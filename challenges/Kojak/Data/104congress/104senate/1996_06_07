I thank the President pro tempore.\n  Mr. President, today, there will be a period for morning business for \n2 hours, and rollcall votes could occur today on executive or \nlegislative items cleared for action. We would like to work out some of \nthe nominees, at least clear some of the nominees on the Executive \nCalendar, including some of the judicial nominees.

There is a statutory 10-hour time limit. \nHopefully, we can resolve that today and work out some agreement. I am \nnot certain how much time it will take. It should not take 10 hours on \na conference report.\n  In any event, we will be in touch with our colleagues later sometime \nthis morning. We are still working on health care. My view is we are \nvery close. I am not certain what the White House view is, but I \nbelieve we have made a lot of progress. There has been a lot of give \nand take. Whether or not that will be complete by next Tuesday is \nproblematical, but we are making progress and, hopefully, there can be \nsome resolution. At least when it is taken up, it may have broad \nsupport.

Mr. President, I rise today to express regret over what \nhappened yesterday. Yesterday was a very significant day in America. We \nhad an opportunity yesterday to pass a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. Of course, it did not work out. We fell short by a couple \nvotes.\n  It reminds me a little bit of last year when we fell short by one \nvote--one vote--one vote away from forcing fiscal discipline into two \nbodies that have expressed and shown and demonstrated no fiscal \ndiscipline over the past 40 years.\n  This is not anything that is new. I can remember, Mr. President, back \nin the middle 1970's when there was an ad by, I think, the National \nTaxpayers Union. They had a nationwide ad. They were trying to express \nto the people of America how serious the debt was, and tried to give us \nan understanding as to what these dollars really mean. Because once you \nstart getting past $1 million or $1 billion or $1 trillion, nobody \nreally has any concept of what it is. Our debt right now, when you say \n$5 trillion, does not mean an awful lot.\n  So back in the middle 1970's I can remember this very effective ad \nthat they had. What they did at that time--the Empire State Building \nwas a tall building--they took $100 bills, and they stacked them up \nuntil they finally reached the height of the Empire State Building. \nThey said, ``That is $400 billion. That is our national debt.'' At that \ntime we looked at it and said, ``You know, we can't go much beyond \nthis. You start talking about the interest that is going to be \nnecessary to pay on the national debt. Can we really afford it?'' \nBecause when you make interest payments, you have to use revenue \ndollars that would otherwise go to defending our Nation or to paying \nfor education and the environment and the other needs, structural needs \nthat this Nation has in such abundance.\n  So at that time, back in the 1970's, I remember so well someone who \nwas in this body for quite a lengthy period of time. His name was Carl \nCurtis. He was a U.S. Senator from Nebraska. He was just a delightful \ngentleman.\n\n[[Page S5956]]\n\n  He came up with an idea. He came out to Oklahoma. I was in the \nOklahoma State Senate at the time. He said, ``You know, we can't seem \nto get across to the people in the U.S. Senate how much the people at \nhome want us to exercise fiscal discipline, how much they want us to \nbalance the budget and quit borrowing more and more from future \ngenerations.''\n  So to demonstrate this--this was his idea, not mine; Carl Curtis--he \nsaid, ``We're going to go out and get three-fourths of the States to \npass resolutions that would preratify an amendment to the \nConstitution.'' As we all know, we have to get two-thirds of the vote \nof the House and the Senate; then it has to be ratified by three-\nfourths of the States. ``So if we can show that there are three-fourths \nof the States who want to have a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, then that will give us the influence that we need to get \nit passed in the U.S. Senate.'' It sounded like a good idea.\n  So he came out to Oklahoma. I remember so well we went around to--I \nremember one time at the Kay County Fair we made a presentation of \nthis. These are just good, earthly people who are paying taxes and \nworking for a living. And they all thought it was a great idea.\n  So I introduced in the State Senate of Oklahoma back in 1974 a \nresolution to preratify the constitutional amendment. I remember that \nAnthony Kerrigan at that time--I think he is retired now, still resides \nin Washington--he wrote in a syndicated column that was all over the \nNation, and the name of it was, ``A Voice in the Wilderness.'' He said, \n``Way out in Oklahoma is a State senator who has successfully passed \nthe first resolution to preratify an amendment to the Constitution to \nbalance the budget.'' That was over 20 years ago. This is not anything \nthat is new.\n\n  In fact, it goes back even further than that. Thomas Jefferson was \nthe one who came back from France and said if he had been here during \nthat constructive process of the Constitution, he would have had \nsomething that would prohibit us from borrowing money, except in times \nof war. This is something that is not anything new.\n  We heard in the discussion, in the debate in the last few days, over \nand over again by those who are fighting a balanced budget--not \nbalanced budget amendment, but balanced budget. It is interesting that \nyou never hear anyone on the stump campaigning for office, ``We want to \nspend more money. We do not want a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. We want to fiscally discipline ourselves. And it is our \njob to do it.'' Yet, when they come here there is so much influence \nhere not to balance the budget, not to have fiscal discipline, they do \nnot do it.\n  We have heard these people over and over again on the floor saying, \n``We do not need a constitutional amendment because we were elected to \ndo that.'' I say we have demonstrated clearly in both bodies of this \nCongress that we are incapable of doing it without something to force \nus to do what we ought to do voluntarily. We have demonstrated that so \nclearly that this is the only vehicle out there that I can think of \nthat would do it.\n  The argument has been made on this floor that the Governors and the \nStates are lowering taxes and are boasting about the fact they are \nlowering taxes, and if we pass a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, we will have to have dramatic, draconian increases in \nState taxes to pay for the services that otherwise they would get from \nthe Federal Government. That just is not true.\n  There is a mentality, I know, in the White House that the only way to \nraise revenue is to raise taxes. I can remember a very articulate \nPresident of the United States who was a Democrat, John Kennedy, who \nsaid back in his administration, ``We have to raise more revenue; to do \nthis, we are going to lower taxes to stimulate the economy.'' A lot of \npeople do not realize, for each 1 percent of economic growth, that \nproduces new revenues of $26 billion. If he can do this, this will \nallow him to raise more revenues. That is exactly what happened in the \nKennedy administration. They reduced taxes and that increased revenue.\n  Along in 1980 when President Reagan was elected, President Reagan \nsaid, ``We have to have more revenues and we have to use those revenues \nto reduce the deficit and reduce the debt and ultimately do something \nabout debt, so we are going to cut taxes, marginal rates,'' and we went \nthrough, in the 1980's, the largest tax cuts in any 10-year-period in \nthe history of America.\n  The results are there. The total revenues that were generated to \noperate Government in 1980 were $517 billion. Then in 1990, the total \nrevenues were $1.30 trillion--they doubled, exactly--between 1980 and \n1990. That was a period of time when we had the most dramatic cuts in \nour marginal rates. As far as the income tax is concerned, the total \nreceipts in 1980 were $244 billion, and in 1990 $466 billion, almost \ndoubling, at a time we reduced our rates.\n\n  You might say, ``Well, wait a minute. We hear on the floor that \nduring the Reagan years we had such dramatic increases in our \ndeficit.'' Yes, we did, but that was not as a result of the fact that \nwe were reducing taxes; that was the increase in revenues, the problem \nthat we were spending more money here in the Senate and in the House. \nSo while revenues went up, our spending went up exceeding that \nincrease, and the deficits continue.\n  Now, in hindsight, I say maybe the President at that time, President \nReagan, should have vetoed a lot of those bills he did not veto. That \nis what the current President is getting by with now in vetoing all the \nthings he ran on when he ran for President of the United States and \nwhat most of the Republicans who took over control of the U.S. Senate \nran on in 1994.\n  Speaking of President Reagan, I remember one of the greatest speeches \nof all time was called ``A Rendezvous With Destiny,'' way back in the \nmiddle 1960's. The speech that Ronald Reagan made, I remember a \nsentence he said. ``There is nothing closer to immortality on the face \nof this Earth than a Government agency once formed.'' That certainly \nhas proven to be true. Once you form an agency to respond to a problem \nthat is there, and the problem goes away, then the agency continues, \nand their political muscle expands. So there are problems that are out \nthere that can be dealt with, but they cannot be dealt with unless we \nforce ourselves to do something to discipline ourselves in this manner.\n  There is one other problem that I think adds to this. A study was \nmade--and I cannot document it, but I do have the document back in my \noffice--over 98 percent of the people who come to visit their Senator \nor their House of Representatives Member are coming because they want \nto increase funding for some program. It might be for a problem. They \nmight be a contractor; it might be a program that they feel in their \nhearts needs to be expanded.\n  What do we hear, if we are here in Washington? We hear from the \npeople who come in and say, ``We want to spend more money.'' That is \none of the reasons I have been an advocate for term limitation for so \nmany years.\n  I made it a practice to commute. I still live back in my State of \nOklahoma and I come up here during the time we work and we vote and we \nhave committee meetings, and I go back so I am there virtually every \nweekend. When you do this, you talk to the people who are back home, \nthat I sometimes get chastised for referring to as ``real people,'' \nimplying there are not real people here. Really, those who come in and \nwant something out of Government generally are people who are here for \nsome particular cause--their cause or for a personal gain.\n  The fact remains that over 98 percent of the people that come in are \nhere for increased funding. That is something I meant to mention when \nthey use the arguments that we will have to have draconian cuts in \nGovernment if we have a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. \nThat is not true.\n  A study made by the Heritage Foundation--and I got it renewed only \nthis week to see, is it true today--if we were to take all Government \nprograms and not cut one Government program, entitlement programs and \nall the rest of them, and increase these programs with growth caps of \n1\\1/2\\ percent a year, we could balance the budget in 7 years and have \nthe tax cuts that the Republicans want, the $500 tax credit per child, \nthe tax decreases in capital gains in order to stimulate the economy. \nWe could make the trust funds well again;\n\n[[Page S5957]]\n\nwe could secure Social Security, Medicare--all of that, without cutting \none program.\n\n  Realistically, that will not happen. We understand that, Mr. \nPresident, because when it gets down to it, there are programs that \nneed to be cut and some that need to be increased by more than 1\\1/2\\ \npercent. If we had a resolution, if it could be structured, I have \nthought we might be smarter just to let every program grow by that \npercentage.\n  When I have townhall meetings--and I have more than most because I am \nback in my State more than most Members are--and you have people coming \nin who are senior citizens, and you tell them, ``What if we were to put \na cap on your Social Security of 1\\1/2\\ percent, if you knew that all \nother Government had to do the same thing?'' They all nod with approval \nand say ``yes.'' Their concern is they would have to take the hit and \nthe veterans would not, or somebody else would not. I think all the \nAmerican people want is to be treated equally. I guess the point I am \ntrying to make here is, you do not have to have draconian cuts to have \na balanced budget.\n  Now, I do not want to use up too much time because there are others \nwho want to speak during this period of time reserved by the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, but I do want to \naddress something. I was quite disturbed yesterday when the very \ndistinguished senior Senator from Kentucky came to the floor. I was \nchastised for some of the comments that I made. One of the statements I \nmade that offended him was that he implied I was saying that people say \none thing at home and say something else in Washington.\n  Let me read exactly what I said so that there can be no \nmisunderstanding. I said this after I had read some quotes of various \nSenators who were strong supporters of a balanced budget amendment in \n1994 and turned around and spoke against it and voted against it this \ntime.\n  What I said was: ``So I think it is something that we need to look \nat, and I'm hoping that those individuals, as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa, Mr. Grassley said, a lot of the Senators who are voting for \nthis because they want to go the party line instead of voting with the \npeople at home, better really stop and think about it before noon \ntomorrow,'' the day before yesterday, ``because the people at home are \nnot going to forget,'' and I know that is true. People at home are not \ngoing to forget because the vast majority of the Democrats and the \nRepublicans in America--approximately 80 percent--want a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution.\n\n  So I did go back and read some quotes from individuals. One was from \nthe Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, who said, ``This \nconstitutional amendment, no matter what one thinks of it, will add the \npressure that we reconcile what we spend with what we raise.'' This was \nMarch 1, 1994. This time he was one of the most articulate Senators \nthat was opposing the balanced budget amendment.\n  Then the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, \nsaid, ``So let us debate, pass, and ratify the balanced budget \namendment by writing a balanced budget amendment into the basic law of \nthe land. We will compel Washington to do its job.'' I agree. That is \nwhat he said on March 1, 1994. This time he was one of the leaders in \nopposition to the balanced budget amendment.\n  Then, of course, the one I have a great deal of respect for, the \ndistinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle from South Dakota, back \nin February 1994, said, ``Too much is at stake for us to settle for \nthis tax. A balanced budget amendment will provide the fiscal \ndiscipline our Nation must have in order to meet the needs of the \npresent generation without bankrupting those of the future.'' That was \nSenator Daschle in 1994. Of course, he led the opposition this time.\n  So I hope that the distinguished Senator from Kentucky will \nunderstand the context in which I was saying this. I do not understand \nhow somebody could be such a strong supporter in 1994 and then oppose \nthe same thing in 1996.\n  I have the two resolutions here. They are worded exactly the same--\nnot approximately the same, but exactly the same. Back in 1994 this was \nSenate Joint Resolution 41. All of these Senators were talking about \nhow great this was and how we had to do it--I was applauding them for \ntheir courage--only to turn around and oppose this in 1996. What \nhappened between 1994 and 1996? Nothing, except the debt has grown to \nover $5 trillion.\n  So when the Senator from Kentucky came in--I had not quoted him, but \nI will now. He said this back on March 1, 1994. He said, ``I support \nthe efforts of my friend and colleague from Illinois''--talking about \nSenator Simon, who is a very courageous guy, and one I complimented \nprobably more than I have ever complimented anyone else on the floor \nyesterday. Senator Ford said, ``I support the efforts of my friend and \ncolleague from Illinois to take on this persistent fiscal dishonesty. I \nhear so much about if 40-some-odd Governors can operate a balanced \nbudget, why can't the Federal Government? I operated under it''--this \nis Senator Ford, who was a Governor of Kentucky--``and it worked. I \nthink implementation of this amendment will work. I think we can make \nit work. I do not understand why it takes a brain surgeon to understand \nhow you operate a budget the way the States do. This is an opportunity \nto pass a balanced budget amendment that will work and will give us a \nfinancially sound future, not only for ourselves but for our children \nand our grandchildren.''\n  I was criticized yesterday because I said those individuals who \nopposed the balanced budget amendment--I am talking about those who \nvoted against the balanced budget amendment--are people who are liberal \nin their philosophy, and there is nothing wrong with that. That is the \n``L'' word, and there is nothing wrong with it. Either you are liberal \nor conservative. It just means how much involvement we want the Federal \nGovernment to have in our lives. If we want more Government \ninvolvement, we have to raise taxes and pay more.\n\n  Fortunately, for the people of America, they can get out of this \nenvironment that we are in right now and not just listen to what we \nsay, but they can look and see how we perform. We are rated in every \narea by different rating organizations. If people are concerned about \nhow we are on social issues, family issues, they can look at the \nChristian Coalition rating and see how we have voted. If they want to \nknow how we are on regulations and business issues, they can look at \nthe National Federation of Independent Business. They have a rating \nsystem, and they will tell you. You do not have to listen to us. They \nwill tell you who is for less Government involvement in our lives.\n  We are the most overregulated nation in the world. That is why we are \nnot globally competitive. Look and see how we are rated. If you want to \nknow who the conservatives are, do not listen to us. I have yet to hear \nanybody go out on a stump and say, ``Vote for me, I want to spend more \nmoney.'' They do not say that. So do not listen to us. Look and see how \nwe are rated.\n  The National Taxpayers Union uses ratings of A, B, C, D, or F. Those \nare the five ratings. Of those individuals--the 33 Democrats who voted \nlast year against the balanced budget amendment--I am sure the same \nthing is true this year, but we have not had enough time to get the \nratings--they were rated either a ``D'' or an ``F'' by the National \nTaxpayers Union. So they are liberals. I do not know why they are \nashamed of being a liberal. I have yet to hear a conservative being \nembarrassed about being a conservative. But many liberals try to say, \n``I am moderate,'' or ``conservative.''\n  Here is the last thing I was personally chastised for. Here is a \nphoto of two little children, which I did not use last night. I used a \nphoto of my newest grandson. These are my two other grandchildren. They \nare the same age and are children of two different sons. This is Maggie \nInhofe, and this is Glade Inhofe. What I was getting across yesterday \nwas that the balanced budget issue, and the deficits in this country, \nis not a fiscal issue; it is a moral issue. These are the faces of \ninnocence, who did not do anything wrong. This is little Jase, who was \nborn January 9. The day he was born, at the moment he took his first \nbreath, he inherited a $19,000 personal debt as his share of the \nnational debt. He did not do anything wrong. These kids were born 3 \nyears ago.\n  So I think we need to look at the whole subject of a balanced budget\n\n[[Page S5958]]\n\namendment as the only way we can discipline ourselves. We demonstrated \nthat very clearly. Let us not think about what it is going to do to the \npeople up here today. It is not going to affect us. It is the next \ngeneration that is going to have to pay for it.\n  I suggest to you, Mr. President, that we did a great disservice \nyesterday to all of Americans, to future generations, when we passed up \nan opportunity to pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. \nWe are going to do it; it is just a matter of time. We may have to do \nit in the next legislature, or when there is another President in the \nWhite House. But we are going to do it, so that these guys right here \nare not going to have to pay for our extravagances. It is a moral \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I understand you will be relieved as \nthe Presiding Officer in a moment. At that time, I will yield you up to \n10 minutes to speak on this question.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: It is my understanding that, under a unanimous \nconsent, I will be controlling an hour from approximately 10 until 11 \no'clock, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator was to control the first hour of \nmorning business.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to control the time from now until 11 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

Mr. President, in the last several days, as we have \ndebated this very historic constitutional amendment, Thomas Jefferson \nhas been quoted over and over because of his early recognition that \nthere needed to be a constitutional provision for balancing the budget.\n  I want to read one other quote that was sent to me by a Georgian, and \nthen I will yield to the Senator from Idaho. This is what Thomas \nJefferson said:\n\n       Men, by their constitutions, are naturally divided into two \n     parties: One, those who fear and distrust the people, and \n     wish to draw all powers from them into the hands of the \n     higher classes; two, those who identify themselves with the \n     people, have confidence in them, cherish and consider them as \n     the most honest and stable.\n\n  This debate was on this point because we were, through our efforts to \npass the balanced budget amendment, endeavoring to put to the people \nthe question in the several States which would have had to ratify. \nThose opposed it, in my judgment, were fearful of turning the question \nover to the people of the country.\n  How unfortunate, as you have just alluded, Mr. President, the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Idaho up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Georgia for \ntaking out this period of morning business to discuss and to continue \nthe important debate that occurred on the floor of the Senate yesterday \nin relation to a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma, who is now presiding, related his \nexperience in the beginning of this movement that started in the mid \n1970's when Senators and Members of the Congress recognized that there \nwas growing in this city an insidious appetite that was spawned by \ninterest groups and citizens--that somehow the way you solved nearly \nall social problems in this country was to put government money at it, \nand that it was justifiable in doing so to deficit spending. We began \nto hear the clock of debt tick at that time--hundreds of thousands of \ndollars, and finally billions of dollars, as the Senator from Oklahoma \nspoke of.\n  When I arrived here in the early 1980's we were still in the hundreds \nof billions of dollars, just breaking into the first trillion. It was \nin that period of time, in 1982, that the former Congressman from New \nYork, Barber Conable, who had picked up the idea that had been started \nhere by Senator Curtis, was retiring. He had heard me speak on the \nfloor of the House. He knew I had done much of what the Senator from \nOklahoma had done--had passed a resolution in my State of Idaho asking \nfor a balanced budget amendment and that the Senate and the Congress of \nthe United States should issue that report so that the States, under \narticle V of the Constitution, could go through the ratifying process.\n  Barber Conable came to me, and he said, ``Congressman Craig, I am \nleaving. Why don't you take this issue and work with it? Make it a \nnational issue. Work with our other colleagues because some day the \nAmerican people will recognize what is going on in Washington, and they \nwill insist that it be stopped.''\n  That was 1982. Myself and Charlie Stenholm, the Democrat Congressman \nfrom Texas, began to do exactly what the Senator from Oklahoma started \nin the mid 1970's in his State legislature. We began a national \nmovement traveling to all of the States of the Nation, to those State \nlegislatures, asking them to petition the Congress of the United \nStates, because without that, without that extraordinary pressure from \nacross the country, we did not believe the Congress would bow to the \nwishes of the people because the pressure from the interest groups, the \npressure from a growing Government, would simply cause them to continue \nto deficit spend.\n\n  That was a $1 trillion debt. That was 1982, and this is 1996. We now \nhave a $5 trillion debt. Senator Curtis was right. Congressman Barber \nConable was right. The National Taxpayers Union was right. Now the \nAmerican people understand better than they have ever understood before \nthat somehow this has to be stopped.\n  Throughout the 1970's and into the 1980's you could always poll the \nAmerican people and say, ``Should Government balance its budget?'' And \nthe answer by 65 to 75 to 80 percent was, ``Yes, they should. We have \nto. We have to do it with our personal businesses and our personal home \naccounts, and the Government ought to do the same.'' But you could \nnever get that high when you asked the question: ``Should there be a \nconstitutional amendment requiring it?'' Because a lot of people did \nnot think we ought to go the extraordinary route of using the organic \nact of our country to force our Government into compliance with the \nwishes of the people; that that was held for unique and special \nexceptions, and that our organic document of the Constitution should be \nrarely changed. We know that in the history of our country--the 208 \nyears of history--that we have only changed that document 27 times.\n  But finally, in a poll just a few weeks ago, when the question was \nasked, ``Should there be a constitutional amendment requiring a \nbalanced budget?'' all of a sudden that had skyrocketed to 83 percent \nof the American people. That is an all-time high. Not that the budget \nshould be balanced--I think that is almost unanimous--but now that we \nshould use the organic document of our country to force this issue. \nBecause what the American public instinctively knows is that the \ngrowth, the phenomenal movement of a budget into deficit and into debt \nthat now scores $5 trillion, and that this year we are going to deal \nwith the 1997 budget with over $300 billion of interest; and that that \ninterest will be more than we will spend on defense, or will be more \nthan we will spend, within a few dollars, of Social Security; that \nsomehow the American people are beginning to say, ``Isn't it true that, \nif you continue to accumulate that debt, somehow one day almost all of \nthe budget would be interest?'' Well, no. I do not think that would \noccur. But significantly the largest segment of the budget would be \ninterest.\n  That is the impact on Government, and that is the impact on \ntaxpayers.\n  What is the impact on personal lives, and on the young people who are \nhere helping us as pages in the U.S. Senate, when they get to be 35 and \n45 years of age? Even this President, who does not agree with a \nbalanced budget amendment, and until 1994 when he began to be a born-\nagain moderate after having been a 1992-94 very liberal President with \nlarge tax increases and large\n\n[[Page S5959]]\n\nspending programs, even his government, his appointees, said these \nyoung people will be paying 75 to 80-plus percent of their gross income \njust to pay for government.\n  So you have to ask them: ``Well, then what would you be able to do to \nown a home, to fund a college education of your child, to have the \nAmerican dream that all of us expect for ourselves and our children? Is \nit possible that debt could eat it all away?'' Yes, it is.\n\n  That is why the debate yesterday was so significant, and that is why \nthe Senator from Oklahoma is absolutely right. The vote yesterday was, \nwithout question, one of the most significant votes that this Senate \nhas taken. I honor Senator Bob Dole for bringing it up again, forcing \nthe political issue and causing the American people to see who is for a \nbalanced budget amendment to our Constitution and who is against it.\n  It is very important that they understand the forces that work in \nWashington and the forces that resist the idea of fiscal responsibility \nwith no real answer to how you deal with a $5 trillion debt and 300 \nbillion dollars' worth of interest on debt and an ongoing deficit. We \nhave offered that solution. We have offered it in the form of an \namendment to cause it to happen on an annualized basis.\n  Last year, we put forth a budget that would bring us to balance. The \nfiscal responsibility that the American people have asked for is here. \nIt is here in the majority party of the U.S. Senate which has brought \nabout those kind of efforts and will continue to until it is the fact \nof the organic law of the land that we operate continually under a \nbudget that is balanced or near balance. That has to be the goal of \nthis Congress and for future Congresses and the responsibility of those \nwho serve in the U.S. Senate. It is for our future; for our children \nand your grandchildren's future, Mr. President, that you showed us \nthose marvelous pictures of this morning. If we fail to do that, we \nwill no longer be a great people. We will no longer be a great people. \nWe will no longer have a system of Government that is the envy of the \nworld because it will be weak and anemic, and unable to provide or \nunable to cause the environment that creates the kind of human \nproductivity that has historically been the mission and the great gift \nof this country. We will steal from all by destroying it with debt. We \nnow have an opportunity to change that, and I hope that in the next \nCongress we bring that about and that we have a President who presides \nin the White House who will not openly fight us and resist us, but who \nwill encourage and embrace the idea of a balanced budget amendment to \nour Constitution.\n\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia for acquiring this time to debate \nand to continue to discuss this critical issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, while I have you both here, I want to \nthank the Senator from Idaho and Senator from Oklahoma, who have been \nhere a bit longer than I in Congress, for the extensive and committed \nand dedicated work each of them have committed, not only to a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution, but to disciplined financial \nmanagement of the affairs of our Nation for all the years in which you \nhave been here. Your States and America owe you a great debt.\n  Mr. President, these numbers get to be beyond what, I think, a lot of \npeople can comprehend in their own home or business, but the fact that \nwe have not had a balanced budget has had a massive impact on every \nfamily in America. I am going to talk about a Georgia family, a typical \nGeorgia family, but it would not be any different in Oklahoma or \nArizona or California. These are all going to be very similar pictures, \nno matter which State you look at.\n  This family earns, in Georgia, about $45,000 a year. They are a \nfamily of four, typically. For the most part, today, both parents work, \nwhich I will come to in a minute. We have been talking about 5 trillion \ndollars' worth of debt and an expanding, exploding Federal Government. \nMargaret Thatcher was in Atlanta not long ago and she said something to \nthe effect: Just remember, when anybody says to you I am going to do \nsomething for you, remember that they have to first take something from \nyou to do it.\n  Her statement could not be more true for this Georgia family. They \nmake $45,000 a year, and the total Federal taxes on their income is \nabout $9,511. The total State and local taxes are $5,234. The estimated \ncost of Federal regulations to the family, in other words, the price \nthey have to pay when they buy a loaf of bread, to pay their share of \nall the regulatory apparatus that we have set up over the last 30 \nyears, is $6,650. That is more than their annual car payment. That \ncould be worth about two annual car payments. And then they have to \npay, because of that $5 trillion debt we are carrying, that pushes \ninterest rates up, so they have to pay $2,011 for their share of the \nhigher interest rates.\n  When it is all said and done, half their income has been consumed by \nGovernment apparatus and Government programs. If Thomas Jefferson were \nhere--he could never have perceived that our Government, the Government \nthat those valiant Americans fought for and put in place, that \nGovernment would consume half the wages of bread winners. He is turning \nin his grave. And he warned us of this over and over and cautioned us, \nwhich is why he recognized that there should have been a statement in \nthe Constitution that would have called for a balanced budget.\n  The fact that we have not had a balanced budget amendment in place, \nwe have not forced Congress to have balanced budgets in place, means \nthat every family in America has to pay for these unchecked and \nburgeoning governments. In fact, they work half the year for these \ngovernments now.\n  Imagine, the Fourth of July is not only Independence Day, it is the \nfirst day you get to keep your own check. Who would have ever thought \nthat, that an American would work from January 1 to Independence Day? \nIndependence Day is going to take on a new meaning. We need to have \nsigns all across the country, ``Today you get to keep your first \ndime.''\n  We have depended throughout our history on that American family to \nget America up in the morning, get it to school, keep a roof over its \nhead, educate it, keep its health and, yes, instill it with the \nspiritual belief in this country so that there would be a continuum of \nleadership.\n  This practice, the failure to have a balanced budget--we have had one \nbalanced budget in the last 36 years. No wonder America is so anxious. \nShe ought to be. This is dangerous. This has made it very difficult for \nthat which we depend upon, the American family, to do what it is \nsupposed to do. They cannot get it done right.\n  Yesterday I referred to an editorialist in the Maryland Constitution, \nMarilyn Geewax. She thinks what is wrong in the American family is that \nthey are greedy, they have too many electric toasters. I can tell her, \nthat is not what is wrong in America. What is wrong in America is there \nis not enough left in their checking account to save or to do the \nthings that we ask them to do.\n  Mr. President, I see we have been joined by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas. In a moment or two, I am going to yield to her. But before \nI do, I wonder if I can put these two quotes up here.\n  There was a quote by Representative Stark, on the House side, that he \nmade Wednesday, that makes it imminently clear why the other side, and \nthe President--we have not talked enough about it. If it were not for \nthe President, we would have passed the balanced budget amendment. It \nrests right at his feet. He did not want that balanced budget amendment \nto pass. He said so. And that is why these six Senators changed their \nvotes; they did it in deference to their President. But read this \nquote:\n\n       To fix the longer-term problem--\n\n  He is talking about the fact that also last week, in addition to \ntalking about a balanced budget amendment, we were told Medicare is \ngoing broke faster than we thought. But he said:\n\n       To fix the longer-term problem, Mr. Stark [of the House \n     Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. He is the ranking \n     member] said, ``Democrats probably would resort to either a \n     Government takeover of the hospital and health-insurance \n     payment system, or raising payroll taxes.''\n\n  If we had a balanced budget amendment, you could a make a big ``X''\n\n[[Page S5960]]\n\nthrough that statement. They cannot afford to have a balanced budget \namendment when they talk about the Government takeover of medicine and \ncreating yet a new entitlement that would be larger than Social \nSecurity in 2 years.\n  Do you want to know why they do not want a balanced budget amendment? \nThat is why. They cannot afford to have the discipline that a balanced \nbudget amendment would have brought about. The family that is going to \nsuffer is this average family, because they are the ones who are going \nto pay for that. They are already paying half their income. What do you \nthink would happen if that situation came up?\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 15 minutes at this time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \ntaking this time to really talk in a little more detail about why we \nneed the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. What happened \nyesterday, and its policy ramifications, really needs to be discussed \nso that the American people see that just because we are trying in this \nCongress to go toward a balanced budget does not mean we do not need a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  In fact, I think when the American people have seen how very hard it \nis to balance the budget or to even have a 1-year budget that moves \ntoward a balanced budget, and when they see how slow the progress has \nbeen and they see, even though we have tried to make the tough \ndecisions--Medicare reform, Medicaid reform, welfare reform--these have \nbeen vetoed by the President and, therefore, we are still at ground \nzero. The American people see this.\n  So, for Heaven's sake, does that not make the argument that we need a \nbalanced budget amendment, because if we can ever get the deficit off \nthe plate, if we can look at the year 2002 toward that point where we \nwill have a balanced budget, don't we need to say no future Congress \nwill ever be able to get out of control again? Don't we need to put in \nwhat Thomas Jefferson worried about, that we should have put in the \nConstitution in the first place, and that is that no future Congress \ncan put debt on generations in the future, that no Congress will be \nable to say we want to spend this money now, but we want our children \nto pay for it.\n  Thomas Jefferson worried about that. It was one of the two things he \nwas concerned with that had not been addressed in the Constitution.\n  The other one is term limits, and I think that probably bears on the \nproblem we are having right now. We have too many people who have been \nin Congress too long who have not been in the real world who have \ncontinued to put off the tough decisions. These are people who talk \nwell. They are people who say, ``Oh, we want a balanced budget; of \ncourse, we want a balanced budget. We'll make the tough decisions \nlater,'' or ``We will let somebody else make the tough decisions.'' \nThat is what Congresses have been doing for 40 years, and it is what \nPresidents have been doing. That is why we are in this mess.\n  So, of course, we need a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. It would not take 2 years for a balanced budget amendment \nto be ratified by the States; that is, if the people are consulted, \nbecause the people know. The people of America are not stupid. They \nknow the difference between a balanced budget and stability and the \nfuture of their children and out-of-control spending, spend-now-pay-\nlater policies that they have seen for so long out of Washington, DC.\n  The opponents of the amendment, as was pointed out by my colleague \nfrom Georgia, really use scare tactics. Let me go through a few of \nthose. This is just a gimmick. Don't you think if this were a gimmick \nthat Congress would have tried it before? I mean, 40 years of gimmicks, \nI think I have seen just about everything. I think they would have \nthought of this if it were a gimmick. They say this will tie the \nGovernment's hands. ``What are you going to do if you have a war, if \nyou need an emergency expenditure?''\n  There is a safety valve. You can pass an unbalanced budget with a \nthree-fifths vote, and I think if we were in a crisis in this country, \nif we were needing to go to war and support our troops, I believe \nthree-fifths of the duly elected representatives of the people of this \ncountry would be able to come to that conclusion. But I do not think \nthree-fifths of the duly elected representatives of our country would \ngo into a deficit situation for just another social program.\n  They say this will bring on another depression. You have heard that \none. Bring on another depression? The money is going to be spent. \nPeople earn money, they send part of it to the Federal Government or \nthey keep it.\n\n  Now, where is the recession here? The recession is not going to be \ncaused because there is going to be less Government spending. If we \nhave less Government spending, that means there is more money in \npeople's pockets. It is their money, it is not ours. I just love these \npeople. I think the Senator from Oklahoma, who is sitting in the chair, \nhas heard the people on the floor say: ``Oh, we can't have that tax \ncut, it would cost the Government $300 billion.''\n  The Government? Whose money is it? It is not the Government's money. \nMoney belongs to the people in this country who go out and work every \nday. It is their money. The Government will not lose $300 billion if we \nhave a tax cut.\n  I would ask the question a little different way: How much will it \ncost the hard-working American taxpayer if we do not cut their taxes by \n$300 billion?\n  We are not talking about lower spending here; we are talking about \nwho makes the decisions. We are talking about whether you decide how \nyou spend your money for your family or whether you send your money to \nthe Government for them to decide what your priorities should be.\n  It is a matter of priorities and who makes the decisions. That is one \nof the reasons why the Republicans said very clearly, when we put our \nbalanced budget forward over 7 years, that we had a $245 billion tax \ncut package, because we knew that if we were going to slow the spending \nin the public sector market, that we wanted to increase the spending in \nthe consumer market.\n  The difference is who makes the decision. That is why we put tax cuts \nin our balanced budget. It is why we have a $500 per child tax credit. \nIt is why we have IRA's for the homemakers of this country so that the \nhomemakers of America will have the same retirement security options \nthat anyone who works outside the home has. It is why we have capital \ngains tax reform, so that our small businesses will be able to make \nthose investments that will create the new jobs and help the economy \ngrow. It is why we have inheritance tax reform. It is why we do away \nwith the marriage penalty, or significantly reform it, because we know \nthat the American family deserves to have more of the money they earn \nto spend for their families.\n  So causing another depression is out of the question. In fact, our \neconomy will boom if we will pass a balanced budget amendment. The \nmarkets went up just because it looked like we had the chance to do it \na year ago. Last year, the market went up because they had the \nimpression that Congress was finally going to ``gut up'' and do the \nright thing. We lost it by one vote.\n  It was a great disappointment, but the market knew. The market knew \nthat by lowering interest rates two points, which is what the balanced \nbudget would do, that we would save money for every person in America \nwho is paying a home mortgage, that we would save money for every \nperson in America who is borrowing to buy a car, that we would save \nmoney for every person in America who is borrowing to go to college. \nThe markets knew the stability that would be created by a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Last, but not least, they have really talked a lot on this floor \nabout raiding Social Security--raiding Social Security--if we balance \nthe budget. I ask the question to anyone in America: Would you trust a \nCongress that cannot balance its budget to keep Social Security intact? \nIf someone does not have the guts to have a balanced budget for our \nGovernment, can they be trusted to keep the integrity of the Social \nSecurity system?\n  Frankly, I think that is why our younger generation does not think \nthey will ever see Social Security, because they see a Congress that \ncannot\n\n[[Page S5961]]\n\neven balance the budget or even pass a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget for the future, and they think, ``Now, if they don't \nhave the ability to do that, I really don't think I'm ever going to see \nSocial Security.''\n  So, Mr. President, I think passing the balanced budget amendment is \nthe most important policy decision that we would make in our lifetimes \nof public service. I think if we do not take that step, we can wait for \nour grandchildren to ask the question, ``You were there back then. Why \ndidn't you do something?''\n  I saw the picture that my colleague from Oklahoma showed of his \ngrandbaby on the floor. I am horrified to think that that baby is \nsomeday going to meet me or talk to the Senator from Oklahoma and say, \n``You know, why didn't you do something back then when you could, so \nthat I could afford to send my children to college, so that I would \nhave a good job in a great economy in the land of opportunity?''\n  Mr. President, if we do not pass a balanced budget amendment that is \nresponsible for the American people, we are not going to be able to \nface our grandchildren, we are not going to be able to answer the \nquestion. So if our colleagues will think about the long-term future of \nthis country, or if the people who are looking at voting for a U.S. \nSenator on the ballot next year will ask that person the question, \n``How do you feel about a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution?'' I mean, you only can say one of two things: ``I'm for \nit,'' or, ``I'm against it.''\n  If the people of this country will rise up and say, this is the most \nimportant issue, then our grandchildren will not have the question, \nbecause it probably would not ever occur to our grandchildren that we \nwould not balance the budget of this country when it is on our watch.\n  So, Mr. President, I think the time has come for the people of \nAmerica to weigh in on this issue. They saw the vote yesterday. They \nsaw that we are within five, six, seven votes in this Congress of \npassing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, which will \nneed to be ratified, so the State legislatures will have a chance to \nweigh in on this as well. I do not worry about the legislatures \nratifying it, if we will have the guts to do what is right in this \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, it is all a part of what we were elected to do. We did \nnot run for the U.S. Senate thinking it was going to be an easy job. We \nknew, especially those of us who have run in the last 2 years, we knew \nthat we were going to have to make tough decisions to turn around 40 \nyears of bad decisions.\n  I have been a small businessperson. I bought a little company that \nwas on the ropes. I had to make tough decisions to turn that company \naround. I did it. But it was not easy. That is the exact issue we are \nfacing here on a much bigger scale, because the people of America are \ndepending on us to make this tough decision for our country. They know \nthat we are not going to agree on every budget cut that it will take. \nThey do not expect that. But they do expect a responsible decision.\n  Mr. President, I will just close by saying, there is only one way to \nprevent the most dreaded question that I can ever imagine. It is not \nfrom one of my constituents calling in or someone that I will see in \nTexas; it is not from a news reporter. It is from my 5-year-old \ngrandchild, in 20 years, who would say, ``Cake, you were there back \nthen. Now I am going to have a child, and I can't afford to send my \nchild to college. Why didn't you do something?'' That is the question I \ndo not ever want to hear.\n  The way we can assure that we will never have that question in our \nfamilies is to pass the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution \nbecause we know how hard it is to do what is right. We know the \nresistance that we have faced. We know that if we can ever get it to \nbalance, that we should never again allow a future Congress to mortgage \nthe future of our children.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Texas and hope that her wish \nof not ever having to answer that question can be fulfilled while she \nis here representing the State of Texas in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for once again bringing together a \ngroup of Members to discuss an issue of significance. He has been doing \nan outstanding job, I think, of trying to make sure the public \nunderstands exactly what it is that is happening here in the Senate of \nthe United States with the crisis and what the prospects are for our \nfuture.\n  Today, I will continue this discussion about the balanced budget. \nThere seems to me to be two fairly clear questions that Americans need \nto ask themselves. First, why do we need a balanced Federal budget? \nSecond, why do we need a balanced budget amendment in order to have a \nbalanced budget?\n  The first question was really one that I think was addressed pretty \neffectively last year. That was the need for bringing the Federal \nbudget into balance.\n  The fact is that, as numerous Members have indicated over the last \ncouple of days, a balanced budget means for most families in this \ncountry the chance to keep more of what they earn and to spend more on \ntheir own priorities rather than spending more money on interest \npayments, on things like new car loans, mortgages for their homes, the \nrepayment of student loans, and so on, as has been very effectively \ndocumented, Mr. President.\n  When our Federal Government is forced to go into the borrowing \nmarkets at large levels and compete with private investment, the price \nof private investment goes up, interest rates go up. When people want \nto buy a new home, and in many cases their first home, they find that \nit is unaffordable today because of interest rates. When people need to \nobtain a new car, they find that it may be not the car they need for \ntheir families because of interest rates. When students start to try to \npay back their student loans, they find it extremely difficult because \nof interest rates.\n  The reason interest rates are high, Mr. President, is because the \nFederal Government is borrowing so much money. The way to end the \nFederal Government's borrowing is to bring the Federal budget into \nbalance. That is what we have been trying to do here. But the goal is \nnot just simply to balance the budget one time in the year 2002, as we \nhave been focused on; it is to keep the Federal budget under control \nand the growth of Federal spending under control well beyond that date.\n  There is a very simple reason why 2002 has to mark the beginning, not \nthe end, of the efforts to balance the budget. As we have learned and \nas I think economists on all sides now would agree, projecting the \ngrowth of Federal spending out beyond the year 2002, projecting the \ngrowth of entitlement programs as they at least currently are \nexpanding, will find the Federal Government by the year 2010, 2012, \n2013, depending on your analysis, but some point about 15 years from \nnow at the point where literally all Federal revenue, all tax \ncollections in total, will only pay for the interest payments that have \nto be made on this huge Federal debt and for the entitlement payments \nthat will be required at the current rate of growth of Federal \nspending.\n\n  That means not $1 for national security, not $1 for education and \ntraining, not $1 for law enforcement to protect the safety of our \ncitizens, not $1 for transportation and infrastructure, not $1 for any \nother priority unless the Federal Government borrows that $1 or prints \nthat $1.\n  We know we are not going to go back to the days of the printing \npress, Mr. President. So that leaves only one option: The further \nborrowing of money at levels far greater than we ever have before. If \nwe do not bring the growth of Federal spending under control and \nbalance the budget today, that is the prospect, that is the future we \nlook forward to. In fact, it would require so much Federal borrowing \nthat I think\n\n[[Page S5962]]\n\nprivate investment in this country would effectively be crowded out \nentirely, bringing us the kind of economic crisis that we have never \nconfronted before as a nation. That is the future.\n  The question is, Why do we need an amendment so we do not bring about \nthat future? I think what has happened over the last few months is a \npretty clear indication exactly why we need a Federal balanced budget \namendment in our Constitution.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, we now have virtually everybody singing, \nit would appear, from the same song sheet. We should have to balance \nthe Federal budget. The President says it, although a year ago he did \nnot. The Members of the Republican party in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives have, not once but twice, passed a balanced budget. \nThis year Democratic Members and Republican Members on the Senate side \ngot together and offered a third version. The fact is, everybody now \nsays they are for it; and everybody in Congress has now found a \nbalanced budget they could live with and vote for. But we still do not \nhave it. The reason we do not have it, Mr. President, is very simple: \nThere is no discipline in the process that requires us to come to final \nagreement.\n\n  So the President, as we saw last winter, could call down leaders of \nCongress and spend hours talking in generic terms about the Federal \nGovernment and how he wanted to balance the budget, but no one was \nunder the pressure that a constitutional amendment would bring in order \nto balance that budget.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield 5 additional minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  For that reason, we have deadlock. For that reason, we did not reach \ncloture. For that reason, there was no finality. On we went, on we go--\npeople all claiming to be for a balanced budget, but not willing to \nmake the ultimate tough decision to get there.\n  As we saw last year, the President would say 7 years, 9 years, 10 \nyears, whatever amount of years seem to satisfy the audience, voters, \nor polls. We did not get the balanced budget. Mr. President, it is \nimperative that we do so. We have to consider exactly where the country \nwill be if we continue to flounder along.\n  As we learned yesterday, just to take one specific program area, \nMedicare, we know where we are going to be if we do not bring about the \nkind of discipline in the fiscal process that the Senator from Georgia \nhas been talking about the last 2 days. Where we will be in the year \n2001; the Medicare trust fund will go bankrupt. We are no longer \ntalking, as has been the case in the past, in general terms about a \nbankruptcy somewhere in the distant future. We are not talking, as even \nwe were last year, about having 7 years to solve the problem. We are \ntalking about bankruptcy of the Medicare trust fund on our doorstep in \n5 years. We are talking for the first time, Mr. President, not about \nthe Medicare trust fund running a surplus, but it is now running a \ndeficit.\n  If that is not enough of a wakeup call, I ask my colleagues, what \nwould it take? Obviously, there are some who believe you can continue \nto put this off. Indeed, the Senator from Georgia today brought us this \ncard which quotes from Wednesday's Washington Times: ``The Democrats \nsaid they are not concerned that Medicare will go broke because \nCongress has always acted at the last minute to avert disaster.'' That \nmay have been the way the Democratic Congress acted in the past. This \nRepublican Congress does not believe in putting off and putting off and \nputting off the solutions to the problems that Americans, particularly \nthat our seniors confront, Mr. President.\n  Not only that, but we understand if we do not solve the problem today \nwith a well-thought-through plan, the only alternative way to fix the \nproblem at the last minute will be the kind of plan that I do not think \nmost Americans are going to want or going to tolerate. In fact, we have \na sense of what that plan will be. Congressman Stark from California, \nwho is the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee of the Ways and Means \nCommittee that oversees the funding of the entitlement programs, the \nperson who would be chairman of that subcommittee if his party were in \ncharge of the House of Representatives, said the Democrats probably \nwould resort to either a Government takeover of the hospital and \nhealth-insurance payment system, or raise payroll taxes.\n  For Americans who are trying to understand the difference between \nwhat we are suggesting on our side, Mr. President, and what the \nopposition is suggesting, I think this quote probably encapsulates \nthings about as vividly as it possibly could. The Republicans had \noffered a plan here over a lengthy period of time to reduce the growth \nof spending in entitlement areas--not cutting, but just reducing the \ngrowth of that spending--through more prudent and efficient operation \nof these programs, by giving seniors, to take the Medicare case as an \nexample, giving seniors the kind of choice the rest of us have as to \nhow we will deal with our health care, but basically preserving intact \na system that gives individuals control over how they take care of \nthemselves in the health care they receive.\n  Now, if we do not address this problem in the fashion Republicans are \noffering, to avert disaster and bankruptcy in Medicare, the alternative \nwill be this: A system the Democrats will design that will include \neither the hiking of payroll taxes or a total Government takeover of \nthe health-care system. I actually predict, Mr. President, that if we \nwait any longer, under the Democratic scheme you will get both of \nthese--not one, both.\n  So that, Mr. President, puts it in pretty clear contrast, what the \noptions are for Americans today. If we balance the budget, if we put a \nconstitutional amendment in place that requires discipline not just for \n1 year but for the future of this country, then we can guarantee our \nchildren the kind of security that we have had, the kind of knowledge \nthat if they work hard, play by the rules and do their jobs, they will \nhave choice over their destiny. If we do not, their destiny is going to \nconsist of higher taxes, Government-run health care, and more \nGovernment intrusion into their lives.\n  As far as I am concerned, Mr. President, when I talk to the people of \nmy State, the answer to this question is pretty simple. People in \nMichigan want to control their own destinies, give their children more \nopportunity, and see the Government run the way their families are run. \nKeeping their own budget balanced is a challenge most American families \nand almost every Michigan family confronts every day. I think we should \nexpect no less here in Washington.\n  For that reason, I am very disappointed the balanced budget amendment \nfailed. I continue to join and will join with the Senator from Georgia \nand others to do our best to make sure sooner or later the balanced \nbudged amendment to the Constitution passes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Michigan for the very \neloquent statement on the purpose of passing a balanced budget \namendment and the consequences, as well, of not having one.\n  There have been many accolades in the last couple of days for the \nSenator from Illinois. The leader on the other side of the aisle \nendeavored to try to convince the President and his side of the merits \nof a balanced budget. In his remarks which he made the other morning on \nthe floor, I want to quote them, I was here, he made a very eloquent \nstatement about why this country needs a balanced budget amendment. He \nsaid, ``I was reading the other day and came across where John Kennedy \nin 1963 complained about the huge amount of money that was paid for \ninterest for which we get nothing.'' That is something to be \nremembered. It does not buy any service. It does not buy a tank or \ndefend anybody. ``He complained about the huge amount of money being \npaid for interest for which we get nothing. Do you know what the gross \ninterest expenditure was in 1963? Nine billion. That is a terrible \nwaste of money.''\n\n  But do you know what the latest Congressional Budget Office figures \nare for this fiscal year, gross interest expenditure? Mr. President, \n$344 billion. From 1963 to 1996, from $9 billion interest payments to \n$344 billion, and going up.\n  The point that Senator Simon of Illinois was making was that if we \nhad a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, we would not be \npaying\n\n[[Page S5963]]\n\n$344 billion in interest payments. Those resources would be available \nto return to the American taxpayer, to this Georgia family that is \nlosing half of its income to government, so that they could do the job \nwe are asking of them.\n  Mr. President, it was a very disappointing vote yesterday. It was \nexceedingly costly to every American family. A balanced budget would \nsave the average American family $2,388 a year in mortgage payments, \n$1,026 in a 4-year car loan, $1,891 over a 10-year student loan.\n  The net effect of having passed a balanced budget amendment, the net \neffect of having balanced budgets would immediately leave $3,000 to \n$4,000 in the checking account of this average Georgia family--$3,000 \nto $4,000. That is the equivalent of a 10- to 20-percent pay raise. \nThat is what we are talking about.\n  You get passed it all, talking about the checking account of a \ntypical family at work, doing what they have to do to get the country \nup in the morning, to get it to school and get it ready. We have \nimpaired, drastically, their ability to do it. Passage of a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution, as Jefferson called for, as \nSenator Simon called for, as Senator Dole called for, is the best \nsingle thing we can do to protect the integrity of these working \nAmericans all across the land, tomorrow and for the year to come.\n  I see the time I was allotted has expired. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, first, I want to commend the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia [Mr. Cover- \ndell], and those who spoke this morning on the subject of a balanced \nbudget amendment and the unfortunate consequences of our failure to \ndeal with the problem of the ever-increasing deficits.\n  We also had a few of those Senators mention, as an aside, the problem \nwith the Medicare trust fund. I wanted to remind Senators that we had a \nhearing yesterday in the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and Secretary Donna Shalala \ncame before the committee to present the President's proposed budget \nfor that Department for the next fiscal year. She serves, along with \nothers in the administration, on this panel of trustees, whose \nresponsibility it is to monitor and help keep Congress and the \nadministration informed about the integrity of the trust fund, and \nsupports the Medicare Program.\n  The trustees, earlier this week, talked about the fact that the worst \ncase scenario for future deficits in that program had been exceeded, \nand that rather than having the program go bankrupt, be hopelessly \ninsolvent by the year 2002, it was going to be bankrupt earlier. By the \nyear 2000, it would be out of balance by over $30 billion, and the \nfollowing year, it would be out of balance and in deficit at the figure \nof $100 billion.\n  The consequences of this report have to wake up everybody to the \nrealization that unless Congress and the administration quit playing \npolitics with this issue, it is going to be insolvent. This program is \ngoing to be in jeopardy, and benefits are going to be in jeopardy as \nwell.\n  I think the time has come for us to say, OK, the Republican Congress \npassed a balanced budget act last year. It included in that suggested \nreforms in the Medicare Program that would have put it in balance, \nwould have kept it solvent, would have made some needed changes in the \nprogram to give older citizens more choices, more protection, so that \ntheir medical expenses and benefits could continue to be paid through \nthis program.\n  The President vetoed the bill. He rejected the balanced budget act. \nSo we started over again. This year, the Budget Committee is wrestling \nwith the problem of reconciling budget resolutions, which contain \nprojected expenditures under this program, as well as all other Federal \nprograms, with an effort to continue to build toward a balanced budget \nplan as soon as possible. Their projection is the year 2002.\n  What I am going to suggest is that, in this politically charged \nenvironment of Presidential politics and campaigns for House and Senate \nseats underway--and we have to admit it--it is unlikely that this \nadministration is going to change its mind and embrace the Republican \nproposals. And so we have to acknowledge that.\n  The President, at the same time, has made a counteroffer, as I \nunderstand it, and has proposed some changes in the Medicare Program, \nwhich would achieve savings of $116 billion over the same period of \ntime. The Republican proposals would have achieved savings of almost \n$170 billion.\n\n  Let us say, OK, Mr. President, have it your way for the short term. \nLet us introduce the President's proposed changes in the Medicare \nProgram. Let us accept his proposals for changes and cuts in the \nMedicare Program and enact them next week, or the week following. If \nthe reconciliation bill from the Budget Committee's resolution is \nvetoed by the President or not supported by the Democrats in that area \nof the budget, let us isolate the Medicare Program changes and enact \nsome changes.\n  I suggest, let us enact the President's proposed changes and cuts in \nthe program and, at the same time, establish a commission--which the \nPresident has recommended, the trustees have recommended in their \nreport, including Secretary Shalala, Secretary Reich, Secretary Rubin, \nand others, who serve on that trustee panel--to recommend long-term \nchanges in the Medicare Program that would ensure its solvency and \nprotect the benefits for the older citizens in our society over the \nlong term.\n  I do not see anything wrong with that. As a matter of fact, I have \nbeen suggesting that that be considered as an alternative. If Congress \nand the President cannot agree on what changes ought to be made, get a \ncommission together, much like the Base Closure Commission, or the \nSocial Security Commission, which was formed in 1983 and chaired by \nAlan Greenspan. It made recommendations to save the Social Security \ntrust fund from bankruptcy, and Congress and the President agreed at \nthat time to accept the recommendation of that commission and implement \nit.\n  That ought to be a part of this legislation--that we establish that \ncommission, agree to implement its recommendations, and have a vote on \nit. If you do not want to implement them, vote no; be against \neverything. But we have to come to terms with the reality of the \nsituation. The longer we wait, the harder the solution is going to be \nand the more sacrifices that are going to have to be made by \neverybody--the taxpayers. If we do not make these changes, do you know \nwhat is going to happen? Pretty soon, you are going to see the taxes on \nthe employers and employees to fund this program being increased--and \nby substantial sums.\n  Now, the older population is getting older and, thank goodness, \nmedical science is wonderful and it is giving us all opportunities for \nlonger lives. But coming with that, too, are added expenses, as you get \nolder, for medical care. Our senior citizens confront the reality every \nday of this terrible fear, and that is that they will not have the \nfunds, they will not have access to the care they need to enjoy the \nlongevity that they now have, compliments of medical science, good \nnutrition, and the advances that we have made for good health in our \nsociety.\n  So I say that it is time to stop the partisan politics. Let us quit \nthrowing rocks at each other across the aisle, blaming each other for \nnot getting anything done. I am prepared to say, as a Member of the \nRepublican leadership in the Senate, OK, Mr. President, let us enact \nyour proposal.\n  I am going to introduce a bill next week, and I hope there will be \nSenators on both sides of the aisle who will say, OK, let us go along \nwith this suggestion as an alternative to what we have\n\n[[Page S5964]]\n\nbeen getting. And what we have been getting is nothing--gridlock, \nconfrontation, yelling at each other, people getting red in the face, \nand nothing getting done.\n  I think the American people are fed up with that kind of politics, \nfed up with that kind of Government. I am fed up with it. It is time to \nchange. We ought to do it now--before it is too late.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let the Chair advise the Senator that he may \nproceed as in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/07/senate-section/article/S5963-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair. I will only take 5 minutes. I wanted \nto do a couple of things. I want to thank the Senator from Georgia for \nbringing some discussion today as a follow-up to this vote on the \nbalanced budget amendment. I am very disappointed that that balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution did not pass. I think there are \nobviously reasons that it should have passed. Obviously, it was very \nclose to passage. The reasons, of course, have to do with \nresponsibility, with morality of Government, with fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Everyone accepts the idea that we should not be continuously spending \nmore than we take in. It has to do with the historic performance of the \nFederal Government for 25 years, or more, since we have balanced the \nbudget last. Everybody gets up, and the first thing they say is, ``Yes, \nI am for balancing the budget''--the same people who have been here for \n25 years and have never balanced the budget. They say, ``We do not need \nan amendment; we will just do it.'' Well, we have not just done it.\n  So I am very disappointed in that. I suspect that we will have some \nmore opportunities to do that.\n  I come from a State where the constitution provides for a balanced \nbudget. Frankly, it works very well. It is a discipline, and the \ngovernment works within that discipline. It is one of the elements of \ngood government--one of the elements that says, ``All right. We want a \nprogram. Here is what it will cost. Are you willing to pay for it?'' If \nyou are not, if we are not, if I am not, then we should not do it. That \nis what this fiscal responsibility is all about.\n  I think the best instance of that, of course, is a property tax where \nwe live. The school district says, ``We need a new science building. \nHere is what it will cost.'' Is it worth it? You vote. Are you willing \nto pay for it, or are not you?\n  I want to talk about a change that needs to take place in the budget \nprocess. Last year we took the whole year and deferred getting the \nbudget finished. Now we are in a year of budgeting, and we are spending \nsuch a large amount of our time on the budget. Congress has more \nresponsibilities than simply the budget. Indeed, the budget is very \nimportant. The budget is sort of an outline of what we are going to do. \nBut the Congress also has, and the Senate also has, many other \nresponsibilities, such as oversight, such as seeing if bills that have \nbeen passed and are up for renewal have, indeed, been effective, \nwhether they need to be changed, whether they need to be renewed. This \nis a big job, and we are supposed to be doing that. But instead, we are \ngoing back and forth spending the whole year practically every year on \nthe budget.\n  I have a bill that has bipartisan support that asks for reform in \nbudgeting and doing a biennial budget. I think there is a great deal of \nmerit in a biennial budget. No. 1, it is better for the Government. It \nis better for the agencies. They at least have 2 years of planning for \nwhat they can do in their expenditures; 2 years in which they can plan \nhow to manage their dollars. It is much better for the Congress. It is \ndone in most legislative bodies--biennial budgeting. It has been \nsupported by both sides of the aisle.\n  The resolution that we introduced this year is supported by Senator \nDomenici, who is head of the Budget Committee, and we think we can make \nthis reform next year. I think, as we spend all of this time on \nbudgeting, we spend the whole year practically on budgeting rather than \nsome of the other things that we ought to be doing in addition to \nbudgeting, it makes it more clear that there needs to be some reform. \nWe need to have a biennial budget.\n  So, Mr. President, obviously, we are not going to get to that this \nyear. There are relatively few working days left. That will not be one \nof the issues. I am not naive to think that. But I do say to you that I \ndo not think there is anything more important in terms of restructuring \nour process than to take a look at biennial budgeting. I intend to \nbring it up again next year. I have been promised support by those who \nare much more knowledgeable than I about budgeting.\n  I recognize that there is always resistance from the appropriators. I \nwas on the Appropriations Committee when I was in the legislature. \nAppropriators have a great deal of influence over all kinds of things \nbecause they control spending, and everybody is interested in how \nspending is done and how it affects their State. So appropriators are \nreluctant, of course, to lose the authority that they have every year \nby going through this process. I am sorry for that, but I think they to \ndo a better job if they do it on a biennial basis.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time. I hope we will continue to talk \na little bit about how we might change some of the processes in this \nCongress; that we talk about results rather than procedure; that, \ninstead of saying we have been doing it for 200 years, maybe so, but we \nought to see what the results have been for having done that for 200 \nyears. There are some things that should not be changed. There are some \nfundamentals that should not be changed. But there are some processes \nthat are not producing the results that we want, and one of them is \nbudgeting. The result is a $5 trillion debt, the interest on which is \nthe largest single line item in the budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nproceed under the 1 hour that has been reserved by the minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/07/senate-section/article/S5964-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5964-S5968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REPUBLICAN GRANDCHILDREN\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened this morning to some of \nthe discussion on the floor of the Senate. I felt I needed to come over \nand speak, at least for historical records, speak to the Republican \ngrandchildren a bit, because the Republican grandchildren have been \nspoken to on the floor of the Senate about a range of issues. They have \nbeen described on the floor of the Senate as victims of legislative \nproblems created this week by a vote on the constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget.\n  All grandchildren are affected by what happens in these Chambers, in \nthe Chambers of the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate. Grandchildren will \nask the tough questions in the years ahead about the country in which \nthey live, the country in which they are growing up. They might ask \nsome questions about what has made this a wonderful place. There are \nsome who simply cannot concede this is a worthy place to live. They \ntalk about how awful America is. America has gone to hell in a \nhandbasket, they say. America has gone to the dogs.\n  It is interesting, we have people talking about building fences to \nkeep people out of America because we have so many people who want to \ncome here. This country is a remarkable place, with enormous \nchallenges, to be sure. We have faced challenges before. We faced a \nCivil War and survived it and came back together. We faced the threat \nof Adolph Hitler. We faced the threat of a depression. We have survived \nall of those threats and all of those challenges. Do we have challenges \nnow? Of course; enormous challenges, substantial challenges. But is \nthis a remarkable, wonderful country that the rest of the world looks \nup to, the rest of the world wants to come to? Of course it is.\n\n[[Page S5965]]\n\n  At the turn of the century, if you were living in America, you \nexpected to live 48 years. That was the lifespan. Now, at the end of \nthe century, you are expected, as an American, to live approximately 78 \nyears. What accounts for that? A number of things. I have spoken \npreviously about some of them, but let me just describe a few again, at \nthe risk of being repetitious. Our grandchildren and the Republican \ngrandchildren will read the history of these, of course.\n  The history is well documented of one thing that makes this a better \ncountry in which to live, one of the reasons we are living longer. \nUpton Sinclair did the research at the turn of the century and wrote a \nbook about it. He did the research in the meatpacking plants in our \ncountry, in Chicago, and discovered in the meatpacking plants they had \nproblems with rats. How did they deal with the problems of rats in \nmeatpacking plants? Well they took loaves of bread and would lace the \nslices of bread with arsenic and poison, and lay them around the \nmeatpacking plants and the rats would eat the bread and the rats would \ndie and the dead rats and meat would all go down the same chute and \ncome out the other end as something called mystery sausage and be sold \nin the supermarkets. Upton Sinclair wrote his book about what he found \nin the meatpacking plants and, guess what, the American people said, we \nwant to be assured we are eating safe products. And guess what, the \nAmerican Congress said we are going to make sure when meat is processed \nin this country it will be inspected. We are going to make sure we are \nnot pushing meat and dead rats down the same chute and pushing it out \nof the plant and selling it to the American people.\n\n  A step forward? Sure. Government intervention? You bet, at the turn \nof the century, saying this country deserves to have a safe supply of \nfood.\n  That is one thing that has made this a little better place. There are \nthousands of others. We constructed, some long while ago in this \ncountry, something called the National Institutes of Health and also \ncreated something called Medicare. The combination of funding in \nMedicare and the funding of research in the National Institutes of \nHealth and the genius of some health care professionals around this \ncountry have created breathtaking technology that saves people's lives.\n  It allows people to live longer. People who get old and have trouble \nwith their knees now get new knees. When they have trouble with their \nhips, they get new hips. When they have trouble seeing, cataract \nsurgery. When their heart blood vessels get plugged up, they get open \nheart surgery. So we live longer and it costs more. But it comes about \nbecause of these breathtaking changes in health care, most of which \ncame as a result of investment by, yes, this Senate, this Congress, the \nAmerican people, saying we want to make life better for people in this \ncountry.\n  I could go through a litany of things that have changed to make \nthings better, but I will not go through the whole list. I want to say, \nas you fast-forward to a point in time at which we face these enormous \nchallenges, but at a time in which Americans are living to an average \nage of about 78 years, a time in which, after 20 years, when we have \ndoubled our use of energy in the last 20 years we have cleaner air and \ncleaner water--why? Why would we have cleaner air and cleaner water \nwhen we have doubled our use of energy in the last 20 years? Because \nthe Congress said to polluters: ``You are not going to be able to \npollute anymore. You're going to pay a penalty if you pollute. We \ndemand on behalf of our kids and grandkids that we have clean air and \nclean water in our country.''\n\n  Is it perfect? No, but would anyone 21 years ago have predicted if we \ndoubled our use of energy we would have cleaner air and cleaner water? \nNo one would have predicted that. It has happened. Why? Because the \nCongress said to those who were polluting America's air and water, \n``You can't do it anymore.''\n  Interference? Regulation? Yes. Are some people angry about it? Yes. \nSome of the largest polluters in our country are angry about it. In \nfact, they have office space over in the House of Representatives.\n  The majority party in the House said to those folks, ``You all come \nin here and help us write new regulations that allow you to pollute. \nLet's retract what we have done on clean air and water regulations. We \nwant to give you more freedom to pollute.''\n  It is called Project Relief by the majority party. Thank God for the \nU.S. Senate that it has not gotten its way through this Congress, \nbecause some of us here value clean air and clean water.\n  I said I wanted to, for historical purposes, speak as well to \nRepublican grandchildren, because we heard this morning about the \nburdens of Republican grandchildren.\n  Some grandchild is going to be asking grandpa some day on that side \nof the aisle: ``Grandpa, I read in the books that the Social Security \nsystem was actually collecting enough money for Social Security; in \nfact, collecting more money than was needed in the late 1990's and the \nearly 2000's, and yet, why isn't there money available for Social \nSecurity now when I reach retirement age?''\n  And that Republican grandpa or grandma, if he or she served in the \nSenate, would probably have to say: ``Well, Grandson, that's because we \ndecided that we would take that money that we promised we would save \nfor Social Security and we would use it over here for something else. \nWe wanted to say we balanced the budget, and we also wanted to build a \nstar wars project and we wanted to provide tax breaks and we wanted to \ngive fairly significant tax cuts, half of which would go to people \nwhose incomes are over $100,000 a year, and we couldn't do all that \nunless we took the Social Security money and used it over here as \noperating budget revenues so we could claim we balanced the budget. So, \nGrandson, in short, those were our priorities.''\n  Maybe they would say, ``Grandad, what happened to the jobs? I went to \nschool, I got my college degree and, Grandad, I don't understand, \nthere's not a good job here.''\n  Maybe the grandad would say: ``Well, you know what happened to us is \nwe felt we needed to help big business when we were in Congress. So \nwhat we decided to do is provide a big, juicy tax break to businesses \nwho would move their jobs from the United States overseas.''\n  And they are going to say: ``Grandad, that doesn't make any sense, \nwhy would you do that? Why would you encourage people to move jobs out \nof the country? You knew I was in your family, you knew I was going to \ngo through the school system, you knew I was going to need a job some \nday. Why would you encourage corporations to move American jobs \noverseas?''\n  ``Well, that's just our philosophy,'' they would say, ``because we \nthink the big, big corporations are what make the world tick. It is our \ntrickle-down/supply-side notion: If you make the big bigger and the \nrich richer, somehow everybody else would be better off. So we gave tax \nbreaks to companies who would move jobs overseas.''\n\n  I have a hunch some of these grandkids who were discussed earlier \nthis morning on the other side of the aisle are going to be enormously \npuzzled.\n  They might look at the Record here--because we were told that the \nmajority party had offered a balanced budget and were upset the \nPresident vetoed it--they might look at the Record and they would say: \n``But, dad, I don't understand. I looked at the Record, and you know \nwhat you all did? What you all did was you took a little program called \nthe Star Schools Program, which was designed to target investments in \nmath and sciences and certain star schools to enhance America's \neducation system, and you slashed that at the same time that you said \nyou needed to increase, by over 100 percent, a star wars program. Why \nwas star wars more important than star schools?''\n  So the father is going to explain to the son or daughter that choice.\n  ``But, grandpa, what about the Head Start Program? Didn't all the \nevidence suggest the Head Start Program really did work where you make \navailable to a 3- or 4-year-old child who comes from a low-income, \ndisadvantaged family the opportunity to go into a Head Start Program? \nDidn't all the evidence show that that investment in that 3- and 4-\nyear-old produced enormous rewards, enormous returns?''\n  ``Yes; yes, they did.''\n  ``Well, then, why did you tell 60,000 children that they were no \nlonger\n\n[[Page S5966]]\n\ngoing to be eligible for Head Start? If that was a good program, why \ndid you tell 60,000 kids that they don't matter, that star wars was \nmore important, or a tax break to a company that was going to move \ntheir jobs overseas was more important?''\n  Or maybe they will read the Record and they will say, ``Well, \ngrandma, I was reading about that budget debate you all had, and the \none thing I don't understand is with all the problems you had with kids \nand youth crime, you cut 600,000 summer jobs for disadvantaged youth. \nWhy would you do that? Why would you believe that summer work for \ndisadvantaged youth somehow was not in this country's interest?''\n  And they are going to have to explain that, I guess.\n  But mostly they are going to have to explain, it seems to me, the \ncontradiction between their assertion that their demand that they \nchange the Constitution now in a way that misuses Social Security funds \nfollowed by an agenda that immediately brings to the floor a program \nthat will cost up to $60 billion more to create a star wars program, \nimmediately bring to the floor a proposal that will cut gas taxes some \n$30-some billion in 7 years, a proposal that will substantially cut \ntaxes somewhere in the $180 to $200 billion range, much of which will \ngo to upper income people, they are going to have to answer as to how \nthat adds up. How does all that add up so that those children can \nunderstand that this was a menu that made sense, and, of course, it is \ngoing to be hard for any child to understand that because this does not \nmake sense.\n  I want to reinforce this, not with my words, but I would like to \nreinforce it by quoting some others.\n  David Gergen, who worked for Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and Bill \nClinton, writes the following, speaking of the Republican majority:\n\n       In their eagerness to satisfy one principle, fiscal \n     responsibility, the Republicans would ask the country to \n     abandon another, equally vital principle--fair play. This is \n     a false, cruel choice we should not make.\n       When Bill Clinton achieved large deficit reductions--\n\n  And they have been reduced substantially--\n\n     we pursued the idea of shared sacrifice. Not this time. \n     Instead, Congress now seems intent on imposing new burdens on \n     the poor, the elderly and vulnerable children, while, \n     incredibly, delivering a windfall for the wealthy.\n       Proposals passed by the House and Senate would rip gaping \n     holes in the Nation's safety net, already low by the \n     standards of advanced nations and once considered sacrosanct.\n\n  This from a fellow who has worked for both Republican and Democratic \nPresidents.\n  Another quote from David Gergen:\n\n       U.S. News reported last week the lowest 20 percent of the \n     population would lose more income under these spending cuts \n     than the rest of the population combined. At the other end, \n     the highest 20 percent would gain more from the tax cuts than \n     everyone else combined.\n       No one disputes the basic contention that the burdens of \n     benefits are lopsided. In a nation divided dangerously into \n     haves and have-nots, this is neither wise nor justified.\n\n  Let me describe what he is saying, because I think it is important. \nConsider this room is the United States and then say, ``All right, the \n20 percent of you with the lowest incomes, you move your chairs over \nhere,'' so we have the 20 percent with the lowest incomes sitting on \nthis side of the room.\n  ``Now we have a deal for you. You're going to have 80 percent of the \nburden of all the spending cuts. You 20 percent with the highest \nincomes, you all move your chairs to this side of the room, and we have \nsomething that is going to make you smile, because you are going to get \n80 percent of our tax cuts.''\n  That is the problem with this agenda.\n  Let me quote extensively from someone who has not worked with both \nDemocrats and Republicans. This is a Republican, Kevin Phillips, a \nRepublican political analyst, who has written extensively on economic \nissues, written a couple wonderful books.\n  He speaks of this agenda:\n\n       Remember, at the same time as the Republicans proposed to \n     reduce Medicare spending by $270 billion over 7 years, they \n     want to cut taxes for corporations, investors, and affluent \n     families by $245 billion over the same period. This is no \n     coincidence.\n\n  Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst.\n  Kevin Phillips:\n\n       Today's Republicans see federal Medicare outlays to old \n     people as a treasure chest of gold for partial redirection in \n     their favorite directions; towards tax cuts for deserving \n     corporations, families, and individuals.\n\n  Again, Kevin Phillips, a Republican analyst:\n\n       Further, [Kevin Phillips says] the revolutionary ideology \n     driving the new Republican Medicare proposal is also simple. \n     Cut middle-class programs as much as possible and give the \n     money back to private-sector businesses, finance and high-\n     income taxpayers.\n\n  Not a Democrat speaking; Kevin Phillips, a Republican analyst.\n  Again, Kevin Phillips:\n\n       If the budget deficit were really a national crisis instead \n     of a pretext for fiscal favoritism and finagling, we'd be \n     talking about shared sacrifice with business, Wall Street and \n     the rich, the people who have the biggest money making the \n     biggest sacrifice. Instead, it's the senior citizens, the \n     poor, the students and ordinary Americans who'll see programs \n     they depend on gutted, while business, finance and the \n     richest one or two percent, far from making sacrifices, \n     actually get new benefits and tax reductions.\n\n  Again Republican political analyst Kevin Phillips:\n\n       If the U.S. budget deficit problem does represent the \n     fiscal equivalent of war--maybe it does--then what we are \n     really looking at is one of the most flagrant examples of war \n     profiteering this century has seen.\n\n  I know these are controversial and very strong, assertive \nstatements--not from a Democrat--from a Republican political analyst \nabout the Republican agenda.\n  Kevin Phillips again:\n\n       Spending on Government programs, from Medicare and \n     education to home heating oil assistance, is to be reduced in \n     ways that principally burden the poor and middle class, while \n     simultaneously taxes are to be cut in ways that predominantly \n     benefit the top one or two percent of the Americans.\n\n  Finally--Kevin Phillips--this is the last quote I will use from him. \nBut as you can see, this Republican analyst has had a very harsh view \nof the Republican agenda.\n\n       In short [he says] aid to dependent grandmothers, children, \n     college students and city dwellers is to be slashed, while \n     aid to dependent corporations, stock brokers and general and \n     assorted James Bond imitators survives or even grows.\n\n  Then William Kristol, who is the contemporary philosopher behind the \nRepublican agenda these days, at least the principal spokesperson on \ntelevision.\n\n       Someone needs to stand up [he says] and defend \n     the establishment: In the last couple weeks, there's been \n     too much pseudopop- \n     ulism, almost too much concern and attention for the, quote, \n     the people--that is, the people's will, their prejudices, \n     their foolish opinions. In a certain sense, we're all paying \n     the price for that now. . . After all, we conservatives are \n     on the side of the lords and barons.\n\n  William Kristol.\n  I would not even bother to come to the floor today except I sat and \nwatched almost 2 hours of the other side saying, ``Gee, our agenda's \nright for America. We have the right menu. We're doing the right thing. \nIt's a bunch of other slothful people around here who can't get their \nacts straight. It's people who have changed their mind, people who \nwon't stand and support a balanced budget.''\n  I have heard almost more of that than we care to hear from people who \nsay they want to change the Constitution but whose every action on the \nfloor of the Senate is that they want to spend more money.\n  I say this to them, those who spoke this morning and others, when you \ncome to the floor of the Senate next week, if it is a defense \nauthorization bill you bring to the floor of the Senate next week--I \nthink it probably will be; we have not yet been informed--if it is, and \nif you are intending to spend, I believe, between $11 and $13 billion--\nI think $11 billion more than the Pentagon asked you the spend--would \nyou also come to the floor of the Senate and tell the American people \nwho you want to tax for the extra $11 billion? Who is going to pay the \nextra $11 billion? Why, do you think generals do not know enough about \nhow many trucks they want to buy?\n  You say, we want to buy more trucks than the generals ask for, buy \nmore ships than the generals ask for, more airplanes than the generals \nneed. Last year you did the same thing. You said the Defense Department \ndid not know enough. We insist on buying more submarines, trucks, \nships, and planes than the Pentagon wants, needs or asks for.\n\n[[Page S5967]]\n\n  I just encourage this: If you say you are for balancing the budget, \nthe place to balance the budget is in individual spending decisions \nhere on the floor of the Senate, not in the Constitution. If in the \nnext piece of legislation that comes to the floor of the Senate, you \nhave decided that the Pentagon needs to spend more money than they have \nasked to spend, tell us who is going to pay for that. How much are you \ngoing to increase the debt to accommodate that?\n  Then when the next bill comes following that, which you say is not \nstar wars, but which in fact is a new $60 billion program--the \nCongressional Budget Office says $30 to $60 billion-- you show me a \nprogram that comes in at the low end, I will show you every program \nthat comes out in the high end. When you bring the next one on the \nfloor to spend $60 billion on a new star wars program, you tell us, \nagain, how much you favor a balanced budget and you tell us who you \nintend to have pay for that. Or do you intend to charge that?\n  I do not have today the charts that show the budgets that were \nsubmitted by President Reagan and President Bush in 12 years. But I \nwill bring that to the floor at some point because the implication of \nthe debate on the floor of the Senate is that somehow it is the \nDemocrats that want to spend money. No one has asked for more deficits, \nno one has requested higher deficits in the history of this country \nthan the combination of Ronald Reagan and George Bush in the budgets \nthey have asked for Congress to pass. No one.\n\n  I am not talking about accidents. I am talking about deliberate \nrequests, asking Congress for budgets that create deficits that have \nbeen the highest in the history of this country. I will bring those to \nthe floor and demonstrate that. So it is not a case where one party is \nall right and one party is all wrong. The only reason I stand to \nrespond to 2 hours of constant finger pointing is that people need to \nunderstand that what the Republicans have complained about this morning \nis they have not been able to get their agenda through the Congress \nbecause this President has vetoed an agenda that their own Republican \ncolleagues and their own Republican authorities have said is a terrible \nagenda. It is, take from the have-nots and give to the haves. Some of \nus are unwilling to go along with that. I know that that forces some of \nyou to complain.\n  So I come to the floor to say it is not the way you suggested. It is \nnot a case where you can point fingers across the aisle and say, \n``They're at fault. They're responsible.'' We have plenty of blame on \nour side of the aisle. Democrats have plenty of blame to spread around \non our side of the aisle.\n  Let me take some credit for being part of a party that says, we want \nto build a Medicare program in this country, and we did it. No thanks \nto some people who are still bragging they voted against it. Medicare \nhas made this a better country and a better life for a lot of people in \nthis country. I am proud to be a part of a party with a legacy that is \na wonderful legacy that has made life better in this country.\n  But we also have some responsibility. We have created too many \nprograms. I do not disagree with that. We have been concerned about \nsolving problems. Sometimes we create a program that we think will \nsolve a problem, and it does not work. We have not, in my judgment, \nbeen aggressive enough in getting rid of those programs.\n  But I do not believe the record will show that those this morning, \nwho spend 2 hours pointing fingers, are going to come to the floor of \nthe Senate in the next couple weeks with a menu of proposals that \nreally balances the budget, especially without misusing the Social \nSecurity trust funds. They are going to come instead to the floor of \nthe Senate with proposals to increase Federal spending, increase \nFederal spending on a star wars program and increase Federal spending \non defense programs. They will make a case where it is necessary. I \nwill not discredit them for doing it. They have every right to do that. \nI will not question their motives. I will not discredit them. We \ndisagree on the agenda. I will not discredit them.\n\n  If you are going to propose new spending programs, you have a \nresponsibility to tell us who will pay for it. The majority leader was \nasked at a press conference in the last week, when they propose this \nso-called star wars program, how much will it cost and who will pay for \nit? The answer was, ``We will leave that to the experts.'' That is the \nkind of answer that has given us the debt that we have and the deficit \nthat we have in this country.\n  I want to make one additional point, and then I know my colleague \nfrom Kentucky wishes to say a few words.\n  We have $21 trillion in debt in this country. I heard one person \ntoday say, ``I started a business and I had to balance my budget.'' I \nbet--and I do not know anything about that person's business--I bet \n$1,000 that person started that business with debt, had debt financing. \nHow many people in here paid cash for their house? How many people \nbought a car with cash?\n  Mr. President, $21 trillion in debt in this country, almost $5 \ntrillion in corporate business debt, $4.3 trillion in household debt, \nincluding home mortgages, a little over $5 trillion in Federal debt. Is \nthe Federal debt too high? You are darn right--far too high. Do we need \nto do something? You bet. This is a very serious problem. But what you \ndo to solve the deficit problem is what we started doing in 1993 and we \ndid not get one vote for it on the other side of the aisle. We cut \nspending in a real way, and we increased taxes.\n  I understand, some people would not increase a tax under any \ncondition, even if their kid did not get education. They say, ``I am \nagainst taxes.'' I am perfectly willing and was willing in 1993 to vote \nfor a piece of legislation that substantially cut the Federal deficit. \nYes, it increased the 4.3-cent gas tax. I did not like that. I would \nhave preferred we not do that. I am glad I voted for it because it \nreduced the deficit substantially.\n  That deficit has been coming down, way down, and I am glad we did \nwhat we did. We did not even get one vote on the other side of the \naisle by those who try to reach 10 feet in height and crow about how \nmuch they want to reduce the deficit. They care so much they want to \nenshrine in the Constitution of the United States a practice taking \ntrust funds from the Social Security trust fund and use them over here \nto balance the budget.\n  Let me finish with this point. I heard this morning, again, that they \nhave passed a balanced budget and sent it to the President. I would \nlike one Member of the majority party to explain this chart to me--just \none, just once. One Member explain it just once.\n  This is the chart that you say is a balanced budget. Mr. President, \n$108 billion in deficits in the year 2002. Either you balanced the \nbudget or you did not. If you did not, why do you call it a balanced \nbudget? If you did, why is $108 billion here?\n  Now, I see our friend from Wyoming has entered the Chamber, and we \nwill probably have a discussion about Social Security, which I am \ndelighted to have because we have not had an opportunity previously to \nhave any substantial time on the floor to address the issue. I hope \nmaybe we will today because I have a fair amount of time and a fair \namount of interest. I say at the start that I do not discredit his \nmotives at all, but we have a deep disagreement about a vote I cast, to \nsay to people you pay higher payroll taxes, you pay higher payroll \ntaxes, and those payroll taxes will be dedicated to paying for Social \nSecurity. The fact is, you will enshrine in the Constitution a \nrequirement they be used in the operating budget.\n\n  I know the Senator from Kentucky wants to say a few words first, and \nI would like to let him speak. I do not have any place to go. I am \nhappy to have a discussion with the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Briefly, but I would like to yield to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. INHOFE. One quick question. Earlier today I quoted you. Did I \ninaccurately quote you in any way?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would not have any idea what you said. I did not hear \nyou.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It was a statement made. Put it this way: Is it not true \nin 1994 you voted for and supported and totally supported the balanced \nbudget amendment that was then before this body? Is that not the same \nexact balanced budget amendment you voted against yesterday?\n\n[[Page S5968]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am pleased the Senator has asked the question. The \ncircumstances are quite interesting about this. I think the Senator \nfrom Kentucky will probably respond to it.\n  In 1993, we had a balanced budget amendment on the floor of the \nSenate. I raised the same question there that I raised 10 years \npreviously, in 1983, in the Ways and Means Committee, about using the \nSocial Security trust fund. If you will go back and read the dialog, \nyou will read that the Senator from Illinois and others with whom we \nhad a substantial discussion about this, said, ``No, no, we do not \nintend after we pass this amendment to use Social Security trust funds \nto show a balanced budget. In fact, we intend to do something \nstatutorily to prevent that.''\n  Two years later, instead of a promise by the promoters of the \nconstitutional amendment that they would not use the Social Security \ntrust fund, there was a guarantee by a vote of the Senate that they \nwould use the Social Security trust fund.\n  So you ask, is it the same vote? No. One was a promise they would not \nuse them, and the second was a guarantee by a vote of the Senate that \nthey would.\n  No, it is not the same vote, not the same circumstances. The \ndifference might seem small to some, but when you come from a town of \n300 people, $700 billion is a mountain of money.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 27 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/07/senate-section/article/S5964-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5968-S5970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT VOTE\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am glad the junior Senator from Oklahoma \nis on the floor. I regret, once again, the junior Senator from Oklahoma \nhas resorted to a personal attack and distortion of my record on the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FORD. Senator, I did not come over here and bother you. I will be \nglad----\n  Mr. INHOFE. You suggested I impugned your integrity.\n  Mr. FORD. You certainly have, and I will explain it.\n  Mr. President, I do not yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky does not yield.\n  Mr. FORD. Just a little while ago, the junior Senator from Oklahoma \nquoted from a floor statement I made on March 1, 1994. He represented, \nby holding up two copies of the legislation--you do not understand that \nor see that in black and white, but you watch it on television--that I \nwas speaking in favor of an identical version of the balanced budget \namendment which was defeated yesterday.\n  Mr. President, I want to give you and the Chamber a page number. I \nsee the staff. They can go back and go through it. It was page S2058 of \nthe March 1, 1994, Congressional Record. I wish the Senator from \nOklahoma would have actually read my full statement. He would have \nfound out that I was not speaking about the underlying constitutional \namendment from which he quoted me, but rather about something called \nthe Reid-Ford-Feinstein amendment.\n  Guess what that amendment did? It created a firewall so that the \nSocial Security trust fund could not be counted to balance the budget. \nThat was my position. It was the Reid-Ford-Feinstein amendment.\n  The junior Senator has misrepresented my record by quoting from that \nstatement in support of an amendment in the form of a substitute and \nacting as if I was speaking about a constitutional amendment which does \nnot protect Social Security.\n  On March 7, 1994----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FORD. I guess it is all right.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask the distinguished and honorable Senator from \nKentucky if he did, in fact, vote for Senate Joint Resolution 41 in \n1994?\n  Mr. FORD. You have my record there. Tell the public.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, you did. It is identically the same. You voted----\n  Mr. FORD. And it is the same question you asked the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. The reason we did, they were excluding Social Security. \nWe had a firm commitment they were excluding Social Security.\n  Now we have a guarantee that you are going to use Social Security.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is an identical resolution.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, if he is going to talk, I want it on his \ntime, not on mine.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me respond. The Senator is under a \nmisimpression, I am sure. He does not understand this. You are asking \nif this is identical, and the answer is, no, it is not identical. I \nbelieve it is not identical. Let me ask you this. As an example, does \nthe latest resolution referred to include the Nunn amendment, and if it \ndoes----\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have the two resolutions right here. They are exactly \nthe same. I ask the Senator to show me or read to me where they are \ndifferent.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I believe the Senator is absolutely wrong, demonstrably \nwrong. As an example, does the Senator recall that Senator Nunn \nrequired an addition to the amendment to be made, during the latest go-\naround, before he would vote for it and that there was an addition made \nby Senator Nunn? Do you recall that?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two \nresolutions that we voted on--Senate Joint Resolution 41, in 1994, and \nHouse Joint Resolution 1, in 1996--be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

The Senator from Kentucky has the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we never got an answer from the junior \nSenator from Oklahoma as to whether Senator Nunn's amendment was in the \nlast one. He says they are identical, and they cannot be identical if \nSenator Nunn's amendment was included. It would not have gotten Senator \nNunn's vote had that not been included.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. FORD. I am not going to yield for anything, Mr. President. I am \nnot going to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Kentucky yield so I \ncan make my point?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from North \nDakota briefly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator may not be putting in the documents that \nrelate to his question. The Senator's question was, were these not \nidentical amendments, the 1994 and 1995. I think the Senator put \nsomething in the Record that does not relate to the information that \nshows you were wrong.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we have printed in the Record the first \nvote on the constitutional amendment, and that, I believe, was in 1994, \nand the actual amendment voted on and the subsequent amendments, and \nthe Record will show that the Senator is incorrect in saying that they \nare identical.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object to the unanimous consent \nrequest. The two resolutions that I asked to be inserted into the \nRecord are Senate Joint Resolution 41, which was in the 103d Congress, \nfirst session, and Senate Joint Resolution 1, which is what we voted on \nyesterday, which are identically the same. I do not want the ones from \n1993, 1989, or any other time. I want these two.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator wishes, we can ask unanimous consent to \nput anything we want to the Record. Does the Senator object to allowing \nus to put something in the Record, or not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, I want the Record to be \nclear that these are the----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky has the floor. I \nwithdraw the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this is what has been going on in this \nSenate Chamber for some time now. You attempt to put in certain things \nto substantiate your position, but you do not tell it all. You put in a \npiece of legislation that was printed, but you never put in the piece \nof legislation as it was amended.\n  When I was brought up, Dad told me that ``the devil was in the fine \nprint.'' So let us get to the fine print. You just cannot continue to \ncondemn people around here because they do not agree with you. I wish \nyou would read Warren Rudman's book on why he left the U.S. Senate. He \nsaid he could sit down with Ted Kennedy, Joe Biden--and he named a list \nof Senators. He would say, ``Let us compromise and work this thing \nout.'' He said, ``I never did question their morality or their \npatriotism. But we could sit down and work things out.'' We no longer \ndo that in the Senate, so Warren Rudman is no longer a major voice in \nthe consideration of legislation in the Senate. So you have driven from \nthis body one of the sharpest, one of the most dedicated individuals, I \nthink, that has served here.\n  Now, I will go back to where I was interrupted. On March 7, 1994, the \ndistinguished majority whip made a similar mistake, quoting me out of \ncontext. I will say one thing for him. He later came to the floor and \napologized. But here we go again, misquoting my record.\n  Mr. President, we have made some tough votes around here, which \nactually were about deficit reduction, not just talk, not just an \nissue. We had a deficit reduction package in 1990. We had one in 1993. \nYes, Senator, I voted for both of them, and you voted against both of \nthem. They were not perfect packages, that is true. If they were \nperfect, we would not be here. Those of us who voted for them took a \nlot of political heat--a lot of political heat. But, guess what? The \ndeficit is coming down for the fourth consecutive year. The deficit is \nbeing reduced. One pledge that was made in 1992 was that the deficit \nwould be reduced by half. It is better than half. There was not a vote \nfrom the Republican side for that package. I note that the junior \nSenator from Oklahoma is as tough as his rhetoric is about balancing \nthe budget. He voted against both deficit reduction packages.\n\n  Let me talk about one other item included in the 1990 deficit \nreduction package. It is section 13301. I am sure the Senator is \nfamiliar with that, because Senator Hollings, if you have been \nlistening to the debate on the floor, described it in such detail \nduring our debate on the balanced budget amendment. It says, you cannot \ncount Social Security trust funds when balancing the budget. You cannot \ndo that. That is the reason you are $108 billion short. You have not \npresented a balanced budget. If you balance the budget, why is it $108 \nbillion short? It is in the Record. CBO is what Speaker Gingrich said \nwe had to go by, and the President agreed. CBO says you are $108 \nbillion short. There is no balancing the budget. You can beat your \nchest all you want to, but there is no balancing the budget.\n  It is more than $100 billion short in the year 2002. All you have to \ndo is read the bill, because you cannot count Social Security under \ncurrent law. But the balanced budget amendment--the senior Senator from \nOklahoma, yesterday, objected to the Senator from Oregon asking \nunanimous consent to offer that amendment for the firewall on Social \nSecurity. The senior Senator from Oklahoma said it is taxes and \nexpenditures, and it ought to be in the budget. Now, look that one up.\n  So here we are offering to protect Social Security with a firewall, \nwhich is now law, and we get an objection from the senior Senator from \nOklahoma, who said, ``It is a tax and expenditure, and it ought to be \nin the budget, so, therefore, I object.'' They would not let us bring \nthat amendment up to even vote on it. They would not even let us bring \nit up to even vote on it. If you want to pass a balanced budget \namendment, put a firewall in, protect Social Security, and get 70-some \nvotes in this Chamber. But, no, you want to use it. We have it in \nhandwriting. The leadership on the Republican side said how many \nhundreds of billions of dollars they will take from Social \nSecurity. Now they are talking about a little gimmick that after 2002 \nwe will take 4 years and pay it back. If you want to balance the \nbudget, let us balance the budget.\n\n  So the Senator from Oregon was refused.\n  You know, in this statement I made from which I was quoted yesterday, \nit starts out: ``Mr. President, I have but a few minutes to speak this \nmorning on behalf of the Reid-Ford-Feinstein balanced budget amendment. \nSo I will concentrate my remarks on the Social Security trust.''\n  That is where you quoted me. That is where, excuse me, where the \nSenator from Oklahoma--I want to be careful of\n\n[[Page S5970]]\n\nmy language here; we are not supposed to use ``you,'' but ``the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma''--that is where you quoted me from. It was a debate on \nthe Ford-Reid-Feinstein balanced budget amendment to put firewall in \nfor Social Security.\n  So it is just be beyond me. I want to say that I hear so much about, \n``If 40-some-odd Governors can operate a balanced budget, why can't the \nFederal Government?'' We do not have a capital account. Most Governors \nhave capital accounts, if you understand how Governors operate. The \nGovernors have an operating account. So it is all different. Governors \ndo not print money like the Federal Government. So they have to balance \nthe budget. But they find ways around it.\n  ``I think the implementation of this amendment will work.'' That is a \nquote from me in that statement. ``I think we can make it work.'' That \nis a quote from me in that statement. It is on page 2058 of March 1, \n1994.\n  ``If we want an issue, fine.'' That is in that statement. ``Stay with \nSenator Simon and Senator Hatch. Stay with them, and then we will have \nan issue when we go home with no balanced budget amendment.''\n  I said that in that part of the statement from which I was quoted \nyesterday. Also, I might say in there I said, ``I am just as worried \nabout my grandchildren as anyone, and I think I have a pretty good idea \nabout grandchildren.''\n  That is in that statement. You did not read that. People did not read \nthat out of my statement. You know, you could just lift these things \nout, hold up your hand, beat your chest, and wave the flag. But when \nyou get down to it, what do you have? An issue and no amendment. Take \nthe money out of Social Security.\n  We have heard a lot about a contract around here in the last 18 \nmonths. There is a contract for the seniors of this country, and that \nis Social Security. And they paint a broad brush with Medicare. \nMedicare has two parts: part A and part B. Part B has a surplus. We \nhave been trying to correct part A now for 2 years. But they will not \nlisten; $124 billion was the first cut from the budget that was given \nto us.\n  So now we hear the objection of the senior Senator from Oklahoma \nyesterday to the distinguished Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden] to offer \na substitute amendment that would put a firewall in to protect Social \nSecurity.\n  There are other different ideas about Social Security and about \nMedicare. But no country in the world, in my judgment, takes care of \nits citizens better. We are a capitalist country. What happens when the \ncapitalists no longer need us? They fire us. And when they fire us, \nsomebody has to try to pick up the pieces. Because we have been a \nstrong democracy, government has picked up the pieces. We have \nretrained personnel. We have helped them with health care. We have \ntried to feed them and clothe them until they could get back on their \nfeet. But that is the story of democracy and government, and government \nhas a part.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that in the times ahead when we start \nquoting Senators that we quote them in context instead of out of \ncontext, and that we remember that there is a section 13301, the off-\nbudget status of Social Security, the exclusion of Social Security from \nall budgets: Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts \nand disbursements of the Federal old age and survivors insurance fund, \nand the federal disability insurance trust fund, shall not be counted--\nshall not be counted--as new budget authority outlays, receipts, or \ndeficits or surplus for the purpose of the budget of the U.S. \nGovernment as submitted by the President, the congressional budget, or \nthe Balanced Budget Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n  That is the law. If you put the amendment on and pass it, then the \nlaw falls, and the amendment to the Constitution includes Social \nSecurity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). Eight and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me just conclude, and I understand the \nSenator from Wyoming is here and I will attempt to stay and listen to \nsome of his discussion as well.\n  Mr. President, let me also complete one portion of this discussion. I \nonly responded to the Senator from Oklahoma with respect to identical \nbills because I believe they are not identical. I do not want the \nSenator to sometime come to the floor and say, ``Well, he opposed the \nNunn amendment.'' But I actually supported the Nunn amendment. I have \nno problem with the Nunn amendment. I believe the Nunn amendment means \nthose were not identical proposals. I do not want you to misunderstand \nthat.\n  On that, the Senator is wrong. I believe these are not identical \nproposals. I did not oppose, nor did the Senator from Kentucky oppose, \nthe Nunn amendment, for that matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/07/senate-section/article/S5968-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5970-S5971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to make an observation about Social \nSecurity. So the Senator from Wyoming might think about this as he \nbegins his presentation. I have heard him a number of times. Sometimes \nhe and I are in agreement and sometimes not. He is always thoughtful, \ninteresting, and bright, and I enjoy his speeches. I have written him \nprivately. I think his leaving the Senate is a loss for the Senate. I \nstill believe that, even though we have substantial disagreements. And \nI have respect for his opinions.\n  But I want him to understand that in 1983 when I served on the House \nWays and Means Committee and became a part of a group of people who \nwrote the Social Security Reform Act, in the archives of the warehouse \nthat holds the markup documents for that markup, the Senator will find \nthat I offered an amendment that very day 13 years ago, an amendment \ndesigned to head off what I feared would happen and what has happened \nunder both Democrats and Republicans since, and that is we would \nincrease a regressive payroll tax and use the regressive money from the \npayroll tax to do things other than save for Social Security.\n  I would like to just make this observation. I do not think there is \none Member of the U.S. Senate--not one--who would vote affirmatively \nfor the proposition as follows: Let us increase the payroll tax \nsubstantially for workers and for businesses and tell them that it will \ncome out of their paycheck in the form of a dedicated tax to be put \ninto a trust fund, but that we will, in fact, treat it as all other \nrevenue with no distinction and that it will become, in fact, part of \nthe ordinary revenue stream of Government with which we will balance \nthe rest of the Federal budget. I do not think there is one man or \nwoman in the Senate who would affirmatively vote for that kind of \nproposition. Yet, that is exactly what we have gotten from the 1983 \nSocial Security Reform Act.\n  I would not have voted for it in a million years had I thought that \nwas going to happen. When it began to happen, the first day of the \nmarkup I offered an amendment--and I have offered a dozen proposals \nsince, in meetings with the Speaker of the House when I was in the \nHouse, and here in the Senate. We have technically changed the law \nthanks to section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act, authored by the \nSenator from South Carolina. But we have never altered the momentum of \nusing the taxes that are taken from the paychecks to become part of the \ngeneral stream of money to fund general fund obligations of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I have had a generous amount of time to speak. The majority party has \nspoken generously this morning as well. Let me, as I sit down, say once \nagain that although we have deep disagreements, I have great respect \nfor Members of the other side of the aisle. But I believe in my heart \nthat what we are doing--to the tune of hundreds and hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of Social Security revenues--is fundamentally \nwrong. No business in America could do what the Government is doing. No \nbusiness in America could say: By the way, I had a good year last year. \nOh, I was short of money, but I took the money from my employees' \npension plan and showed that as part of my income, and it turned out \nall right.\n\n  No business in America could do that because it is against the law. \nYet that is exactly what happens in this budget scheme, proposed not \nonly by the majority party but proposed in the past as well.\n  Mr. President, I will stay here and be anxious to listen. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n[[Page S5971]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I will make this very brief, because \nseveral questions have come up concerning Social Security. I think it \nis a very critical thing. I happen to have been privileged to be \npresiding yesterday when the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, the \nsenior Senator, Senator Simpson, who is the chairman of the Social \nSecurity Subcommittee and, I think we all agree, is the authority in \nthis body on Social Security--he is here and will be responding to \nthese questions in a much more informed and eloquent way than I would \nbe able to respond to them. But I do have to respond to a few things \nthat have been said by both my good friend, the Senator from North \nDakota, and the Senator from Kentucky.\n  First of all, it was implied--I am sure it was not intentional--that \nI was only concerned about Republican grandchildren. Obviously, we are \nall concerned about our own. I opened my remarks yesterday on the floor \nmaking a reference to Senator Simon, who had talked about Nicholas \nSimon, his grandchild. I said I know he is just as emotionally involved \nwith his children and grandchildren as I am, and Democrats are as much \nas Republicans. I hope that is understood.\n  But, when the distinguished Senator from North Dakota used the \nexample of government control, with the rats eating the bread laced \nwith arsenic, certainly if I had been there at the time I would have \nstrongly supported an effort to stop these types of abuses and these \ntypes of unsanitary practices from taking place.\n  But there is a fine line here. You come to a point where, if you see \nthat point, you have too much government control. I think that is one \nof the basic philosophical differences, and it is an honest difference, \nbetween Democrats and Republicans. I suggest to you, if you talk to Tim \nCarter of Skiatook, OK, who was called a couple of days before \nChristmas a few years ago and put out of business by the EPA, what he \nhad done wrong was he moved his business from one area of Skiatook, OK, \na very small city, to another area, and did not inform the EPA of this \nmove.\n  I said, ``They do not know that you moved?'' He said, ``Well, yes, I \ninformed the district office, but they apparently did not inform the \nnational office.'' For that reason they put him out of business and \nthey took his number away from him.\n  Then, when I finally got that corrected, he called me again and he \nsaid, ``Now I have another problem. I have an inventory of 50,000 \nbottles.'' He had some kind of operation, horse spray or something, \nthat they manufactured. Apparently there is a market for it. He said, \n``The EPA says I cannot use those bottles now, because during that \nbrief time I was out of business they gave my number to somebody \nelse.'' This is the type of thing.\n  Or Jim Dunn, who owned a third generation family lumber company in \nTulsa, OK, who called me up and said, ``The EPA put me out of \nbusiness.'' This was a couple years ago. I was in the other body at the \ntime. I said, ``What did you do wrong?'' He said he did not do anything \nwrong. He said, ``I have been selling used crankcase oil to the same \ncontractor for a couple years and they traced some of that to the \nDouble Eagle Superfund Site and they say I am in violation. They are \ngoing to impose $25,000 a day fines on me.'' This is a company that had \nits net increase the year before of something like $50,000. He was out \nof business. The heavy hand of overregulation.\n\n  We corrected that situation. But if he had not called me, he probably \nwould be out of business today. That contractor he sold his oil to 10 \nyears ago was licensed by the Federal Government, by the State of \nOklahoma, by Tulsa County. He did nothing illegal. Yet Government was \nregulating him out of business. This is what I am talking about. Have \nwe gone beyond that point, to where we are the most overregulated \nsociety or country, to the point where we are not globally competitive? \nI say, yes, we are overregulated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/07/senate-section/article/S5971-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5971-S5972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota talked about star wars. He and I have had this discussion. There \nis, I guess, nothing to be gained other than to update it and put it in \nthe context of today's debate, but it always offends me when we talk \nabout star wars. Star wars is a phrase that was coined to make it look \nlike this is something fictitious, something imaginary, when in fact \nthere is a very real threat that is facing the United States of \nAmerica, that of missile attack.\n  We know the Russians have their SS-25. They have the SS-18, which is \na MIRV'd missile with a number of warheads capability, some 10 \nwarheads. We know the Chinese have a missile that can reach us. We know \nthe North Koreans are in the final stages of developing the Taepo Dong \nmissile that originally was going to reach the United States by 2002. \nNow we feel, our intelligence community feels, it will be the year \n1999.\n  We were on schedule from 1983 to protect ourselves against a missile \nattack, so that we would have protection, or a defense system in place, \nby the year 1999. We are not talking about star wars. We are not \ntalking about even space-based launchers. We are talking about \ntechnology that is alive today. We have bought and paid for and have \nalmost $50 billion invested in 22 Aegis ships that are floating now, \npaid for. They have launching capability. They can knock down missiles \ncoming in. But they cannot knock down missiles coming in, ICBM's, that \nwould come in from above the atmosphere. So we are trying merely to \ntake that $50 billion that has already been spent, spend $4 billion \nmore so they can reach above the atmosphere and knock down a missile \nthat might be coming from North Korea.\n  We would have some 30 minutes' time between the time a missile is \nlaunched and our technology tells us when that was launched. I am an \naviator. I flew an airplane around the world a couple of years ago. I \nused the global positioning system, that is satellites, for navigation \nall the way around. We can know what is happening around the world \ntoday. The technology is there.\n  So, if a missile is launched in North Korea, we know it is coming, we \nhave 30 minutes to do something about it, but you cannot hit it because \nit is above the upper tier. All we need to do is spend about 10 percent \nmore of the money that we have spent to be able to give the capability \nto knock it down. That is not star wars. I do not know where they come \nup with this $70 billion or $60 billion. The CBO came out and said it \nwould cost about $31 billion to $60 billion more, over the next 14 \nyears, if we installed and made a reality all of the proposed missile \ndefense systems. We are not suggesting that. No one is.\n  The other day on this floor I said it is like going into a used car \nlot and saying I want to buy all the cars. You do not need to do that. \nYou get the one that works, the one that fits your needs, and that \ntakes care of it. That is the way we are in our missile defense system. \nI hate to use that as an example. I hate to be redundant by coming back \nover and over again, talking about it, but it has to be talked about.\n  When the distinguished Senator from North Dakota said we are talking \nabout a budget next week about spending $11 billion more than the \nPentagon wants--yes, I will be supporting that. Those of us who are \nconservatives over here, we want cuts in programs. We have to defend \nAmerica. I was so proud of the chiefs of the four services testifying \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee, who came in and--this is \nthe first time, I think, in the history of this country this has \nhappened--they defied their own President and said we have to have $20 \nbillion more in order to defend America. This is what they said.\n  They are not the top. There is the Secretary of Defense, appointed by \nthe President; not the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, John\n\n[[Page S5972]]\n\nShalikashvili, who is also appointed. These are the ones in charge of \nthe four services, and it took a lot of courage. We do need it and it \ntook courage.\n  ``Where is the money going to come from for all these,'' the Senator \nsaid. If he had been listening, I outlined a program we have been \ntalking about for several years now. The Heritage Foundation and others \ncame up with it. If we take all our Government programs and not \neliminate one program, but only expand each one by 1.5 percent, we \nwould be able to balance the budget and have the tax cuts that we have \ntalked about that Americans desperately need.\n  That is not realistically what is going to happen, but we could do \nit, and I would live with that in a heartbeat, a 1.5 percent increase \nin the defense budget. We have cut our defense budget 11 consecutive \nyears. We are down now below the level where we were in 1980 when we \ncould not afford spare parts. So that is significant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/07/senate-section/article/S5971-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am going to wind up here. I will only \nmention the last thing that was stated by the Senator from North Dakota \nin response to something the distinguish Senator from Texas, Senator \nHutchison, said this morning.\n  When she started in business, she made it grow, and it was difficult. \nHe said, ``I bet you started with debt.''\n  ``Yes.''\n  The difference is this: The business Senator Hutchison is talking \nabout and the businesses that are started with debt have to pay that \ndebt back. We do not, and that is the difference. Our debt just \naccumulates, and that is why we are looking at $5 trillion. The \ndifference is, they pay it back, and we do not.\n  Getting to the comments made by the distinguished senior Senator from \nKentucky--and I think so much of him; I have held him in very high \nregard--we just disagree philosophically.\n  When he talked about the deficit reduction programs of 1990 and 1993, \nyes, one of those was a Republican President. In 1990, it was George \nBush. I disagreed with him at that time, and I even went on \n``Nightline'' and talked about how we should not have caved in to the \nDemocrat-controlled Congress. As a result of that one cave-in by \nPresident Bush, he lost the election.\n  The next one is 1993. In 1993--he can call it a deficit reduction \nplan--it was the largest single tax increase in the history of public \nfinance in America or anyplace in the world, and that is not a quote \nfrom conservative Republican Jim Inhofe, that is a quote from Senator \nDan Moynihan, who was then chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  So you look at these things in a different light. I would just say to \nthose who are holding on to the past and those who do want to have \nbusiness as usual and want to go back to and continue the social \nrevolution of the middle 1960's, those days are behind us.\n  The last thing I will say, I hope that the Senator from Kentucky did \nnot mean it when he implied that I impugned his integrity. All I was \ndoing was quoting him, and regardless of how we interpret the quotes, I \ndo not think he wanted me to quote his entire statement that was page \nafter page.\n  But I will say this: These are the two resolutions we talked about. \nThe Senator from North Dakota said that does not include the amendment \nby Senator Nunn. I think you are talking about the judicial review \namendment. I suggest to you that, verbatim, that same amendment was \noffered and passed by Senator Danforth in 1994. So we have identical \nresolutions, and regardless of whether the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky was quoted or misquoted, he still supported this back then, as \nthe Senator from North Dakota did, and opposed it yesterday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/07/senate-section/article/S5972-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5972-S5977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the presence of \nSenator Dorgan of North Dakota. He and I have had spirited discussions \nabout Social Security, but we respect each other. I certainly do. I \ntold him that. I told him whenever I had a pain in my bosom with regard \nto his activities, I shared it exactly and expressly with him, which I \nhave always done. It is good that maybe the two of us have a moment to \nat least speak on an issue which surely cannot continue to go in this \nfashion, where two thoughtful people, as the Senator from North Dakota \nand I hope your loyal communicator here, are continually just totally \nin opposition while many who deal with the Social Security Program are \ntelling us what is happening to the program and where the money goes.\n  So, if I may, in a series of questions, and then let us have the \ndebate which we never had, because I will come to the floor and do my \nthing and leave and get on to the seven committees I go to, and the \nSenator from North Dakota comes to the floor and gives his good and \nable presentation and then leaves the floor.\n  Let us just, may I, go back to where you have been. You were on the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee in 1983. In 1983, Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan and company, a bipartisan group --I believe Senator Dole was \npart of that group; I do not recall all of the participants--they came \ntogether knowing that Social Security was going to go broke, totally \nbroke, and that it would go broke within a very short time. So they met \nin good faith, in a bipartisan way, and they put together a package, as \nyou described--and I address the Chair, as my friend addressed \nyesterday--they put together a package which provided for increased \npayroll taxes, it provided for some benefit restructure, it did \nsomething with the ``notch babies.''\n\n  Remember, we had to deal with that one for about 12 years, and it was \nan absolute phony argument. Talk about the froth that goes with Social \nSecurity. We finally, when that vampire came out of the silk casket one \nmore time, drove the stake through it and through the lining, \nhopefully, and that is the end of it. We do not hear any more about it \nfrom the National Committee for the Preservation of Social Security and \nMedicare or the AARP or any other group, because it is a dead issue, \nstaked through the heart.\n  Yet, it created tremendous concern around America in what was \nhappening. Because of the adjustment made in 1983, we found that the \npeople who were born before that certain cutoff date had received much, \nmuch more than they ever should have received, far above the \nreplacement rate of Social Security. We corrected that, and then had 10 \nyears of background clutter and flak and shelling from these various \ngroups. That is over.\n  But what we did do--and we must all use the same facts. We do not \nhave to share the same opinion, but we must use the same facts. If \nanyone will remember, you need only go to the report where we were told \nthat when we did what we had to do in 1982 and 1983 with Social \nSecurity, it would ``save the system and make it solvent until the year \n2063.''\n  If there is anyone within the range of my voice who says that that \nwas not the final package--what we did, our stuff, tough political \nstuff, that when we did that, we would ``save the Social Security \nSystem till the year 2063.'' That is book, page and hymn number. Done. \nOK.\n  What has happened in the next 13 years? It is now 1996, and each and \nevery year that the trustees issue their annual report, we are told \nthat Social Security is going broke faster than we ever would have \ndreamed. And yesterday--just yesterday--we have the 1996 annual report. \nThis is a summary. The actual report is here. It is quite extensive. My \nstaff has been through it. I hope that all of us will enjoy this \nweekend reading. It is just a joy.\n  But I tell you what it does. It tells the truth, and I will tell you \nwho is telling us the truth. The truth-tellers are Donna Shalala, a \nwoman I have the greatest respect for and admiration; the truth-givers \nare Robert Rubin. He and I have not agreed on many things, but I admire \nhim. Robert Reich, my fellow thespian--our line of work takes us away \nfrom this. We intend to ``trod the boards'' starting in Peoria. Robert\n\n[[Page S5973]]\n\nReich, a very splendid man. And then a citizen member of the trustees, \nMarilyn Moon; a citizen trustee, Stephen Kellison; and Shirley Chater, \nCommissioner of Social Security.\n  What are they telling us? They are telling us that Social Security \nwill go broke, flat broke, in the year 2029, I say to my colleagues. So \nin 13 years, we have moved the doomsday date of Social Security forward \nfrom 2063 to 2029. Thirty-four years of this cushion has been eaten up \nin 13 years, and everybody knows that. There is not a soul in this \nChamber who does not know that. There is not a soul downtown who does \nnot know that.\n  Are we saying then, all is well? Of course, it is not well. Next year \nthe trustees may come in and tell us that it will go broke in the year \n2025. It has been happening in increments of 3, 4, 5 years a crack. \nThat is reality.\n  Yesterday, in a spirited little bit of dialogue, I presented a chart, \na most unique chart. Let me do it one more time. This is the Social \nSecurity Act. I did not write this. This is section 201(d) of the act.\n  If we are going to say that somehow we are looting, raiding, and \npillaging, then please tell me, please, where is this taking place? If \nwe mean looting or raiding to put the Social Security surplus into T-\nbills, which are then sold by the Federal Government, and the general \nrevenue goes into the General Treasury, and when the interest on the T-\nbills comes out and is paid on the T-bills to those who own them, if \nthat is looting or raiding, we need a new definition.\n  If we defeat the balanced budget amendment--which is what has \noccurred--is it not true that the Social Security surplus will still be \nput into T-bills? The answer is, it does not matter one whit whether we \npass or defeat a Social Security amendment to exclude it. This will go \non like Old Man River, and no one can stop it unless they wish to \nchange this section.\n  So what does the section say? ``It shall''--shall--``be the duty of \nthe managing trustee to invest such portion of the trust funds as is \nnot, in his judgment, required to meet current withdrawals.''\n  Stop there.\n  There is a surplus in Social Security. Some say it is $29 billion, \nsome say it is $69 billion. Forget what they say. It easily could get \nto $2 trillion by the year 2010. Then, in the year 2012, it starts its \ntremendous swan song. We all know that. The trustees are telling us \nthat.\n  So it matters not whether the reserves get to $1 or $2 trillion. \nThere is nothing that is going to change whether you pass a balanced \nbudget amendment or not with regard to those funds.\n  I will go on quoting. ``Such investments may be made only'' --there \nis no option, no election process--``in interest-bearing obligations of \nthe United States or in obligations guaranteed to as to both principal \nand interest by the United States * * * Each obligation issued for \npurchase by the trust funds under this subsection shall be evidenced by \na paper instrument in the form of a bond, note, or certificate of \nindebtedness issued by the Secretary of the Treasury * * *''\n  I do not think that is too much mumbo-jumbo for all of us to deal \nwith the issue of Social Security. That is what it says. That is what \nwe do with it. That is what FDR and the Congress had in mind for us to \ndo with it.\n  But now one more subsection. The Social Security Act, section 201(f). \nWe must hear this. We must all follow the law. That is our duty. That \nis really maybe the only duty we have here, to follow the law and try \nto craft laws that are understandable to the American people.\n  ``The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, \nany obligations held in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \nTrust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund shall''--\nshall--``be credited to and form a part of the Federal Old-Age and \nSurvivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund, \nrespectively.''\n  And then this, if we can all hear this. We do not have to agree. We \ndo not have to fire up each other.\n\n       Payment from the general fund of the Treasury to either of \n     the trust funds of any such interest or proceeds shall be in \n     the form of paper checks drawn on such general fund to the \n     order of such trust fund.\n\n  That is what it says. And this section has been addressed in the \nreport which came to us yesterday.\n  Let me read from the summary. This is the summary of the Social \nSecurity trustees. Here is a very precise, small paragraph that says \nthis, if I can share this with my friend from North Dakota.\n\n       In all trust funds assets that are not needed to pay \n     current benefits or administrative expenses (the only \n     purposes for which trust funds may be used) are invested in \n     special issue U.S. Government securities guaranteed as to \n     both principal and interest and backed by the full faith and \n     credit of the United States of America.\n\n  That section is not changed one whit whether we include or whether we \nexclude Social Security from a balanced budget amendment.\n  Every penny, every single penny of the trust fund is left in exactly \nthe same condition, whether you pass a balanced budget amendment or \nnot.\n  It is most extraordinarily remarkable to suggest that we can ``save'' \nor ``protect'' Social Security from this by simply separating it from a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Here is the language--I hope this is not a surprise. I want to be \nsure my colleague hears this language. If I could get the attention of \nmy friend from North Dakota. I think it is very important that I share \nthis language. I do not want it to be a surprise.\n  This is language from yesterday's report. I do not know if the \nSenator's staff has read this. My staff went through it during the \nnight. I have to do this kind of work because they have made me the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy. I \ndid not really seek that task, but like all of us who do good work--and \nthe Senator does with his subcommittees and my good friend from \nKentucky does with his--we try then to keep absolutely current. Here is \nthe language from the report of yesterday.\n  It is very important. This, yesterday, became open to the American \npublic. Here is what it says: ``As noted in section 2(b), the portion \nof the OASI trust fund that is not needed to meet day-to-day \nexpenditures is used to purchase investments, generally in special \npublic debt obligations of the United States Government. The cash''--\nthis is a quote from yesterday's 1996 annual report, page 78 and 79--\n``The cash used to make these purchases becomes part of the general \nfund of the Treasury . . .,'' ladies and gentlemen.\n  We all know that. We have known it since Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nwrote it and put it in section 201.\n  ``The cash''--that is cash that is not needed. That means the \nsurplus. That means the excess. That means whatever you want to call \nit. ``The cash used to make''--I am quoting-- ``The cash used to make \nthese purchases becomes part of the general fund of the Treasury and is \nused to meet various Federal outlays.''\n  Does that mean that we have looted it or raided it or pillaged it? I \nthink not, not when we are looking at the specific language of the act \nand the trustees' report.\n\n  I am continuing to quote.\n\n       Interest is paid to the trust fund on these securities. And \n     when the securities mature or are redeemed prior to maturity, \n     general fund . . .\n\n  If I may get the attention of my friend from North Dakota. We never \nget to get this done. I am going to stay, too, because I think it is \nvery important that he and I do not leave the Chamber until the \nAmerican people know a little more than they do now about how we are \nlooting or pillaging or raiding the Social Security system, which is \nnot taking place under any scenario known to man or woman.\n  Quoting again.\n\n       Interest is paid to the trust fund on these securities. And \n     when the securities mature or are redeemed prior to maturity, \n     general fund revenues are used to repay the principal to the \n     trust fund. Thus, the investment operations of the trust fund \n     result in various cash flows between the trust fund and the \n     general fund of the Treasury. And currently the excess of tax \n     income to the OASI trust fund over the fund's expenditures \n     results in a substantial net cash flow from the trust fund to \n     the general fund.\n\n  Finally the quote:\n\n       Sometime after the turn of the century, as shown in the \n     following subsection, this cash flow will reverse.\n\nIt is detailed in horrendous, horrendous factual figures. ``This cash \nflow will reverse as trust fund security''--let me show you how it will \nreverse.\n\n[[Page S5974]]\n\n  This is the annual operating balance of the Social Security trust \nfund in billions of dollars. If that is not a reversal from today's $60 \nbillion surplus. I think it is more today--my colleague may disagree--\nand then it drops like a rocket through the basement. This is the \nannual operating balance of the Social Security in billions of dollars. \nIn the year 2000 it is $1 trillion operating balance. This is the \nfigure. This is from the Social Security Administration, 1995.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we will say that everything my friend has \nsaid is accurate. I do not question his sincerity or his statements. We \nwill take it from that point on.\n  Under statutory provisions, we cannot use Social Security funds as it \nrelates to deficits, budgets--it is off budget. That is 13301. I am \nsure you are familiar with that. Now, in the balanced budget amendment, \nwe are allowing, based on the statement of the senior Senator from \nOklahoma yesterday, that this is a tax and an expenditure and, \ntherefore, it ought to be part of the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  What is the underlying fear, as I listen to the Senator from Wyoming, \nand the underlying fear, I say to my friend, of this Senator is that if \nwe allow the money to be used to reduce the deficit, and when we have \nthe leadership on your side--not necessarily the majority leader but \nother leaders in the budgetary category--tell us how much of the Social \nSecurity trust funds will be used if the amendment to the Constitution \nis passed to balance the budget, then we accelerate your fear here of \nthe reduction of the surplus in the Social Security.\n  If the Social Security continues on its merry way, as you have so \naptly described, going downhill, will we not accelerate that if we use, \nas we were told in handwriting that we are going to use, $147 billion \nfrom the trust fund, at least the last 2 years, would that not make it \ndepleted at a much earlier date?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I always enjoy a spirited discussion.\n  Mr. FORD. This is not spirited.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. It will be before we finish.\n  Mr. FORD. I doubt it.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I enjoy that because he and I, even as deputy assistant \nleaders for 10 years or near that amount--there was not anybody that I \ntreated with more deference, or who dealt with me more fairly, \nhonestly, and directly.\n  Where I am, Mr. President, is this: We are being told in this debate \nthat these funds are being looted or raided. This may not be your \ndebate, but this has been part of a continual debate about the looting \nor raiding or using this. I am saying, based upon the law of the United \nStates, that any surplus in these funds is ``used'' and goes directly \nto the general fund, that there is no trust fund in that to be looted, \nto be raided. It is a series of great stack of IOU's. That is what we \nhave here.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, by ``IOU's'' you are talking about T-bills \nthat are paid to constituents like you and me. We might be down to the \nE bonds or the smaller ones but the T-bills are the IOU's in there, and \nwe have by law sold them or loaned that money to the Federal Government \nin return for T-bills plus interest to be paid at a definite period of \ntime and the trustees are required to have that flow of money.\n\n  Am I correct in that?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. That is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. So you refer to--you say we are looting.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I did not say that.\n  Mr. FORD. No, you quoted others saying ``looting,'' and now the \nSenator from Wyoming is using the words ``IOU's'' for T-bills. It is \njust a matter of how you express yourself.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I believe I have the floor, if you are asking an \ninquiry.\n  Mr. FORD. I am trying to give you my reasoning for the question.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. If you could, I would like that.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand, and you are doing well in the balcony right \nnow. There are more giggles up there than on the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I am trying to do something for my grandchildren.\n  Mr. FORD. I have tried the grandchildren.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. If the Senator would pose the question, I would \nappreciate it.\n  Mr. FORD. Where was I? What I am trying to say is that if the \nconstitutional amendment is passed and then ratified by the States, and \nthen we amend the Constitution on the balanced budget amendment, and \nthat would do away with statutory provisions as it relates to the trust \nfund, and therefore as those who have the responsibility of budgeting \nhere in the Senate, to recommend to us as Senators, say they will use x \nbillions of dollars of the Social Security trust fund to balance the \nbudget. Do we do away with statutory law when we amend the \nConstitution?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I cannot see any format where a \nconstitutional amendment, which would take years to ratify--all we are \ndoing is sending this to the States, if we did do it, and let them \ndecide. I know of nothing in my background that would lead me to \nbelieve that we would have done anything with section 201 of the Social \nSecurity Act, either F or D or any provision therein.\n  Mr. FORD. But you would be able to use the funds held in trust, for \nexample, T-bills, to balance the budget according to the budgetary \nprofessionals on your side.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I will continue to direct my remarks to \nthe Chair. The issue is that you cannot hide something that is $360 \nbillion a year and pretend that you are doing something to ``balance \nthe books.'' That does not mean that we are then going to ``raid'' or \n``loot'' the Social Security System.\n  The constitutional amendment does not in any way injure Social \nSecurity, because the trust fund goes into T-bills or notes or \nobligations regardless. Regardless, the Social Security money still has \nto be raised in the future out of general revenue. That is what the \ntrustees are telling us.\n  Somebody said, what about the interest? I heard that one. Mr. \nPresident, 87 percent of the money that comes in comes from payroll \ntaxes. About 9 percent comes from interest. That is all there is. In \nthe year 2012, you will have to take the notes and go back to the \nGovernment and say, ``There is not enough payroll money coming in this \nmonth. So we are here to cash these in.'' That is when the double hit \ncomes that we described.\n  If you are trying to build a firewall to protect Social Security, \nthis does not affect a Social Security firewall, which seems to be a \nvery important thing to many, does not affect the long-term unfunded \nliability of the Social Security system. It does not alter the \nsituation which requires a Social Security surplus to be put in \nTreasury bills.\n\n  May I just finish the trustees' quote? It is two more sentences. Then \nwe can get on with the action here and see if we can stick with the \ntrustees' report. Do not bother with what I am saying or Senator Dorgan \nor any of us. I am reading from the annual report of the trustees. Let \nme just finish it. ``The cash flow will reverse as the trust fund \nsecurities are redeemed. To meet benefit payments and other \nexpenditures, revenue from the general fund of the Treasury will be \ndrawn upon to provide the necessary cash.''\n  That is pages 78 and 79. The balanced budget amendment in no way \nchanges this. In no way at all does the balanced budget amendment \nfirewall for Social Security change that.\n  This is the way it is. And that is what we ought to be debating. I \nwould be glad to stand here and do that.\n  (Mr. GRAMS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a little \ncolloquy?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Yes, sure.\n  Mr. FORD. I believe the Senator would agree that once a \nconstitutional amendment is passed--and it will not take years to pass \nthe balanced budget amendment--once a balanced budget amendment is \npassed and it amends the Constitution, then it is this body's \nresponsibility to draft the legislation implementing that amendment, is \nthat not correct?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I am sorry. Repeat the last part, please, if you would.\n  Mr. FORD. Well, once an amendment to the Constitution has been \nratified by the States, is it not the responsibility, then, of this \nbody and the House to implement, by law, that amendment?\n\n[[Page S5975]]\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. That is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. Is there anything to prevent a majority from voting to \ninclude Social Security trust funds in the operation of the budget of \nthe United States?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, there is no way to avoid doing anything \nto try to hide Social Security from the budget problems of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I asked a question, and I was chastised for \nnot asking the question. What I want to know is, is there any way to \nprevent a majority vote from using the Social Security trust funds as a \npart of reducing the deficit for balancing the budget?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I have no idea, Mr. President. For 17 years, this \nSenator has talked about the absolute certainty of pretending that \nsomething is off budget when it is $360 billion a year. You would have \nto ask a majority at that time. For me, it is absolutely absurd to \nbelieve that you do not talk about Social Security when you are trying \nto balance the budget of the United States of America, which today is \n$1.506 trillion, and $360 billion of that in there is called Social \nSecurity. If you want to leave it out, fine, but it will not be this \nSenator. I will not be here, but somebody can tap on my box and tell me \nhow it went.\n  Mr. FORD. Knowing the Senator from Wyoming, he will not have to take \nhis money with him. He can write a check where he is going.\n  I am very concerned that we talk about IOU's and they are really the \nbills. We talk about raiding and, no, we are not raiding. You cannot do \nthat. But the Members of this body will implement an amendment to the \nConstitution. As the senior Senator from Oklahoma said yesterday, he \nobjected to voting on the amendment to put up the firewall for Social \nSecurity because it was taxes collected and taxes expended. He wanted \nit in the balanced budget amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and my friend from Wyoming. I am going to leave the \nSenator. I am hungry.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I do not believe that my good friend \nwould check through the Senate ethics and financial records and find \nthat I was listed among the millionaires of the Senate. So I think that \nthat was a rather gratuitous shot.\n  Mr. FORD. How did the Senator take that?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Now, Mr. President, if we can get back to the issue, \nwhich is the law, and stick with this and try to stick in this debate \nwithout going into emotion and who has the bucks and who does not have \nthe bucks, and the rich versus the poor, and all the rest of it, and \nknow that the Social Security Act is right here--(f) and (d). The \ntrustees report is right here, and I am ready to move forward and \ndiscuss those and let us do that.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Indeed, certainly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me clear up two things, and one is minor. The Senator \nis not accurate with respect to the issue of the notch. This is \nprobably not relevant. That was not adjusted in the 1983 legislation. \nThat was in the 1977 legislation, which was implemented in 1979. The \n1983 legislation had nothing to do with the notch. The notch was \ncreated, as the Senator might remember, because of a cost-of-living \nadjustment in Social Security that was opposed in the early 1970's.\n  Subsequently, it was discovered that that cost-of-living adjustor, or \nformula, was inappropriate in 1977. Congress made an adjustment, \neffective 2 years ago. It was not in 1983. That was not such a big \ndeal, but I wanted to make that point for those who are interested in \nthe history of it.\n  Second, the Senator used a chart that is demonstrably false. If the \nSenator would put the chart back up, I am sure he did not do this \ndeliberately.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. No; the dates are not correct. The dates here should be \n2020 here, 2025 here, 2030, 2035, and 2040.\n  Mr. DORGAN. When I saw the chart, I knew one would not want to use a \nchart like that. The impression would be that there is a one green line \nand a lot of red lines. When I saw your dates, I realized they were not \naccurate.\n  Let me give the accurate numbers. Here will be the annual surpluses, \nnot deficits. In the 1996, your chart had a red line, and that was in \nerror. There will be a $71 billion surplus, then a $74 billion surplus, \nthen $80 billion, $87 billion, $91 billion, and, next year, $97 \nbillion.\n  In the year 2002, there will be a $103 billion surplus--that is, \nreceipts into Social Security over expenditures. This surplus will \ncontinue out on into the two-thousand-teens, after which there will be \nred lines.\n  It would be appropriate to have a chart that shows the red lines, but \nyou would not want to show that unless you showed very substantial \nsurpluses. I wanted to make the point that if somebody saw that chart \nand started going, ``We have big troubles,'' that is not accurate.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I said that. I said that the reserves \ncould easily be $2 trillion by 2010. I want the record to be absolutely \ncorrect. Nobody needed to palpitate on that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. There are so many charts showing the deep red canyons, \nand that chart should have showed surpluses.\n  Let us talk, for a moment, about these surpluses, and let us talk \nabout this one. The year 2002 is the 7th year of a budget plan. In the \nyear 2002, the Social Security system will have receipts of $103 \nbillion that are greater than the need for expenditure in that year.\n  I will ask the Senator from Wyoming a couple of questions about that. \nThe first question is, Is this an accident, or is this part of a \ndeliberate strategy to have receipts that far exceed needs or \nexpenditures in that year? Is that a deliberate strategy or an \naccident?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Well, Mr. President, that is a deliberate strategy. The \npurpose was to build the reserves, and it was going to work \nbeautifully, until this year, in the year 1996. Every 7\\1/2\\ seconds \nsomebody turns 50, and 15 years from now, in the year 2012, there will \nbe a dramatic drawdown. We ought to link the two cases together, \nbecause they are so dramatic that it is hard to describe.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I accept that. In many respects, I sat here and listened \nto a debate that, if you won, it was a debate we were not having. I \naccept much of what you say. But that is not the framework of the \ndebate that we have ventured on the floor with.\n  Let me try to understand and describe the debate as between what you \nwere describing earlier and what I am saying. If you are right--and I \nthink you are, because I was part of the team, as you were, that said \nlet us deliberately begin saving money, so that when the baby boomers \nretire, or the war babies, more appropriately, retire after the turn of \nthe century, we will have built up some reserves. That was a \ndeliberate, sober reflective action on the part of the Congress. I \nthink it was an appropriate and courageous won.\n  Now, if in the year 2002, we have said we want $103 billion more to \ncome in in Social Security than we are going to spend, and if in the \nyear 2002 the majority's budget provides a balanced budget in 2002, \nbut, they say, we are $108 billion short in their paper, but say to the \nAmerican people we will balance the budget, is it not the case that \nthey claim that they have balanced the budget because we have not had \nenforced savings of the $103 billion that year, which should have been \nabove what is necessary to balance the budget if you are going to have \nan enforced national savings pool, but, in fact, they have taken that \n$103 billion and said, by the way, we are using it over here so we can \nsay we balanced the budget.\n  Is that not a misuse of the term ``double entry booking,'' to say we \nhave a deliberate reserve and, at the same time, that we are using it \nhere saying we have a balanced budget?\n  That is the major point of contention between us because we will, I \nfear, get to the end of this process and we will never have an enforced \nnational pool of savings above an otherwise balanced budget that is \nused, or usable rather, when we need it when the war babies retire.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, that would be a good argument if we were \nsaying that we were going to ``use it to reduce the deficit.'' But it \nwill have already been used because the minute there are surpluses in \nthe Social Security trust funds, they are invested in T bills or notes \nor whatever, and all the money goes to the general fund. If we can get \nto the point where you and I are, will you please describe to all of us\n\n[[Page S5976]]\n\nwhat you mean when you are describing ``looting and raiding'' of the \ntrust fund?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Exactly. The year 2002 would be a year in which the \nFederal Government would have balanced its budget plus had a $103 \nbillion additional revenue above the balanced budget as an enforced \npool of national savings to be saved for the time we are going to need \nit. That would comport with what the idea was in the early 1980's about \ncreating a national pool of enforced savings. The scheme that we now \nhave, I respectfully say to the Senator from Wyoming, means that we \nwill never have a pool of enforced national savings to meet the Social \nSecurity needs. Instead, we will simply have a regressive payroll tax \nadded to the general revenue stream to be used for whatever other \npurpose it is used for.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, may I ask a question of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota? How does the Senator from North Dakota propose to avoid \nlooting, or raiding? Does that mean it will not be in T bills?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. What does it mean?\n  Mr. DORGAN. You are not winning a debate that we are not having. I am \nnot debating whether or not it is invested in T bills. Of course it is. \nYour basic contention has been because it is invested in T bills it \ndoes not exist. I have asked the question. ``Gee. If you purchase a \nsavings bond for your grandchild for Christmas, are you going to tell \nhim when he opens it that, `By the way, what you see does not exist?' \n'' No. It is an asset. That asset exists in the trust fund.\n  My point is you will not have saved $103 billion in the year 2002 \nthat you promised to save if on the budget side of things you take the \n$103 billion over and say, ``Well, we are $103 billion short of \nbalancing the budget generally speaking but we will count this revenue \nagainst it in order to say to people that we balanced the budget''; \nergo, you have not, in my judgment, created any kind of national pool \nof enforced savings to meet the future needs of Social Security.\n  That is the point.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, how do we achieve this result--by \nsuggesting then that we defeat the balanced budget amendment?\n  Mr. FORD. We do not.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. That is what you have been saying; that we can avoid \nthis result by defeating a balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Excellent question. Let me tell you exactly how you \nachieve the result. The result is achieved specifically by voting for \nthe alternative balanced budget amendment that we attempted to offer \nyesterday that we offered previously, that was voted against by the \nSenator from Wyoming, that is this: It is identical in every respect to \nthe constitutional amendment to balance the budget brought to the floor \nwith one exception; that is, section 7. Section 7 says you will not \ncount as revenues or expenditures the Social Security trust fund and \nSocial Security account, which means that you would balance the budget \nand say, ``All right. Now the budget is in balance plus what we have is \nin 2002, or 2005, whatever the year is, plus we have $103 billion extra \nmoney that came in above the balanced budget. That is the only way you \ndevelop a forced pool of national savings. In the absence of that, what \nyou ought to do is get rid of this payroll tax. If you are not going to \ndo what you said you are going to do, why should workers and business \nnot be paying it?\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Let me ask, Mr. President. And I appreciate your \ncorrecting us and getting the correct dates.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That was a pretty big correction, actually.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. It is not a correction.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We are not saying that the sky is falling.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Not to give too much credit, but simply these dates are \nincorrect, 2020, 2025, 2030--you know those facts. I know those facts.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That chart is a fundamentally improper disclosure of what \nis happening. You would have to show substantial green surpluses on \nthat same chart.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. This is from the Social Security Administration, and it \nis listed in their way as to what is going to happen to this. This is \n2020. There is 2025. This is 2030. There is 2035, and 2040.\n  Mr. DORGAN. There are four categories of green, and you just skipped \n20-some years of good news to get to the bad news. There is bad news. \nWe are not disagreeing about that.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Let me ask a question. You have used a figure of $60 \nbillion in your debate about surplus?\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is $69 billion.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. The accumulated surplus to date is $496 billion to date. \nSo that is rather an incorrect figure. You have used the figure.\n  Mr. DORGAN. What is incorrect?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. The accumulated surplus to date in Social Security is \n$496 billion, and it is going to go way beyond those figures in the \noutyears. It is going to go to $1.1 trillion--not $1.2 billion. It is \ngoing to go to $2 trillion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We are not having a debate; it is a misunderstanding. \nThese are not cumulated numbers. These are yearly numbers. I said for \nthis year, $69 billion. When you are saying that is wrong, I do not \nunderstand.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. The cumulated surplus in Social Security is $496 \nbillion. We need to know that. You have listed an annual figure of $60 \nbillion or $69 billion. The present surplus, cumulated surplus, in \nSocial Security today is $496 billion headed for maybe $2 trillion in \nthe year 2010. Then a precipitous decline in accordance with the charts \nof the Social Security Administration.\n  Mr. DORGAN. There is no disagreement about that. I do not understand \nthe point. The point I was making is that this year we are collecting \nregressive payroll taxes from workers and businesses, because you voted \nfor it and I did, believing that it was done to collect more than we \nneeded this year in order to save it for the future. My only point is, \nif it is used to offset for other revenues that we should have made, or \nother expense cuts we should have made, then it is not saved. If it is \nnot saved, why are we collecting it? Why not say to the people, ``We \nwill not collect it to misuse it; keep in yourself''?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I just hope that perhaps somewhere into \nthe national debate will come pages 78 and 79 of this year's 1996 \nannual report, which is so clear that there is no Social Security trust \nfund. There is nothing in the way of a pool other than the IOU's. These \nare IOU's, and the entire cash, when we sell them, goes to the general \nfund.\n  Is that what the Senator means when he describes ``looting or \nraiding?'' Please tell me, because these are two terms that have been \nused by the Senator from North Dakota day after day after day, that we \nare ``looting and raiding.'' I want to know what the Senator means when \nhe says ``looting or raiding.'' Does ``looting or raiding'' mean that \nwe should not be putting it into T bills? Does ``looting or raiding'' \nmean that we should not see the money go into the general fund, as is \nthe law of the United States? What is, for this Senator ``looting or \nraiding''?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me try it again. I just refuse to let you win a \ndebate we are not having. We are not having a debate.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I am trying to inform the national citizens as to what \nis happening here.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand. Let me try to explain it. I will do it \nagain. I have done it before.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Could you use the term ``looting or raiding'' and define \nwhat that is?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me explain it to you. In the year 2002--the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, I, and others voted to decide that we wanted to collect \nmore money than is necessary in the year 2002 for the funding of the \nSocial Security program--not a little more; a lot more; $103 billion \nmore than is necessary to fund that program. We said we want to do that \nbecause we want to be responsible in order to save it for the future.\n  It is invested in Treasury bonds. The Senator is correct. If he wants \nto have a debate about that, he cannot debate that with me because I do \nnot contest that. It is invested in Treasury bonds. But the $103 \nbillion ought to represent in 2002 $103 billion of revenue above a \nbalanced budget. And it does not, because the Senator from Wyoming and \nhis friends support a budget scheme that says we will show up about \n$108 billion short in the year 2002, and we will use the Social \nSecurity trust funds to make up the difference.\n\n[[Page S5977]]\n\n  If that were in the private sector, they would call it looting. But \nyou could call it whatever you want to call it. Abraham Lincoln said, \n``Calling a horse's tail a leg doesn't make it a leg,'' but you can \ndescribe this however one wants to describe it. I simply maintain that \nif you decided and I decided we should have a pool of enforced national \nsavings to meet the needs of the future, that in 2002 you cannot \naccomplish that if you have used the same money in order to balance the \ngeneral operating budget of the United States. That is the point, a \nvery simple point.\n  I would say to the Senator from Wyoming I understand--I have listened \npatiently--I understand the presentation he made. He and I do not \ndisagree on a lot of this. The Social Security system is now healthy. I \ndisagree, sometimes, when I hear the Senator and others talk about the \n``Social Security system is going broke.'' In a lot of ways I lament \nthat that language is used because it is true that a third of a century \nfrom now it is going to be out of money, but that is a third of a \ncentury from now.\n  It is also true we are going to make some changes. The fact of the \nmatter is, the Senator from Wyoming is a leader: he is a leader on this \nissue. He has proposed substantial changes to secure the financial \nwell-being of the Social Security trust fund. The Congress must make \nchanges. But here is the situation. He and I do not disagree about the \ncircumstances. We have surpluses; they will continue to build into the \ntwo-thousand-teens, after which they will diminish. In the year 2029, \nwe will be out of money. Adjustments will have to be made long before \nthen to solve this in the long term. The Senator is absolutely correct \nabout that.\n  The disagreement we have is in a budgeting scheme that says let us \ntreat the Social Security funds as if they are no different than any \nother funds. I would say, my colleague has made the point, I think, \nthat the Democrats have done that and the Republicans have done it. The \nanswer is, yes, they have. And I have disagreed no matter who does it. \nNow they want to enshrine it in the Constitution. That is the \ndifference.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I want to be sure that the American \npeople know that this is not a partisan issue. So, when we say, ``My \nfriends on this side of the aisle,'' the friends on this side of the \naisle joined with a remarkable number of friends on the other side of \nthe aisle, a total of 64 of us who really think we ought to do \nsomething with the balanced budget amendment and do not feel we are \ngoing to do anything to the Social Security trust fund, because we know \nwe cannot do anything to the Social Security trust fund because it is \nall invested and the money comes out of the general revenue. I guess \nthe debate has to end there. Unless--and I am going to come back to \nthis question. I would like, honestly, an answer.\n  I want to know what--if we are going to use the term ``looting and \nraiding,'' the American people, I think, are being overly excited by \nthat term. There is no need to use a term like ``looting and raiding,'' \nbecause we do not loot or raid. We are putting it where the law \nrequires it to go, and nothing more. So to say that it is looted or \ncut, there was never any suggestion that these dollars would not have \nto be raised by general revenue in the year 2012, or 2005. They come \nfrom payroll taxes and revenue. So we are only arguing about how the \ndeficit is measured, not about the disposition of Social Security trust \nfunds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question on that?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I think there is no reason to portray the balanced \nbudget amendment as a place to talk about Social Security trust funds. \nThey do not fit.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for one brief question?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is it not the case, then, that in the year 2002 the \nmajority party's budget plan is either $108 billion in deficit or it is \nbalanced by using the $103 billion in Social Security funds? Is that \nnot the case?\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, there was another one, so we get away \nfrom the partisan aspect if we can.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is not a partisan question. I am just asking you.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I heard it that way. You know that. But let us look at \nthe Chafee-Breaux proposal.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Same thing. Same thing.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, 46 of us, 24 Democrats and 22 \nRepublicans, voted for that. I thought that was a very responsible \nthing. And whatever you are talking about in the national budget, all \nhas to do with balancing or not balancing the national budget--\neverything in the stack.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But that is not responsive to my question. The Chafee-\nBreaux budget falls short of balancing the budget, if you are going to \nactually save the Social Security trust funds. And so does President \nClinton's budget. They are not in balance, just as the majority party \nbudget is not in balance.\n  So my question is, is there a balance? We are using the Social \nSecurity trust funds improperly, or they are not in balance, they fall \n$108 billion short of being in balance.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Whether we call it balanced or unbalanced in the year \n2002, whether under the Republican plan or President Clinton's plan or \nChafee-Breaux, Social Security moneys will be in exactly the same \nplace. That is what I am saying. It will be in the form of Treasury \nbills or notes backed by the full faith and credit of the United \nStates. So if you want me to say it will be balanced, fine. If you want \nme to say it will be unbalanced, fine. But the issue is, this will go \non like ``Old Man River,'' and all America ought to know that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield to one more point? I think we get \nto the point where we disagree. My point is the budget that you \nsupport, the budget the President has offered, and others, fall short \nof balancing the budget by the equivalent amount of the Social Security \nsurpluses that we deliberately decided we wanted to receive and save. \nThat is the point I made.\n  Look, let us finish because I know the Senator from Massachusetts is \nwaiting, but----\n  Mr. SIMPSON. If we want to use the phrase of ``deliberately saved'' \nand so on, I have no problem with those terms. What I have a lot of \nproblem with is the continual reference to ``looting and raiding,'' \nbecause that is not true.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is another unfortunate setback for \nthe cause of health reform. It appears that the opportunity for \nmeaningful reform has been lost again. Barring a last-minute change of \nheart and mind and strategy, Senator Dole will be leaving the Senate \nnext Tuesday without exercising the leadership needed to make even the \nmodest consensus reform in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill a reality.\n  I regret very much that ``Dr. Dole'' is prescribing a poison pill for \nthis consensus legislation. Medical savings accounts do not belong in \nthis legislation. Several reasonable compromises on that highly \ncontroversial issue have been offered and categorically rejected. The \nfull-blown MSA proposal demanded by Republicans is a death sentence for \nthis legislation. I intend to oppose it as vigorously as possible, and \nif it should even reach President Clinton's desk, I am confident he \nwill give it the veto it deserves.\n  It is clear House Republicans are pursuing a their way or no way \nstrategy, and Senator Dole has chosen to be a part of it. With his \ndeparture from the Senate next week, the chance for any health \ninsurance reform this year is slim.\n  Millions of Americans will suffer unnecessarily because Senator Dole \nhas put gridlock ahead of the needs of the 25 million working families \nwho would benefit from the consensus reform in the original bill, \nbefore it was poisoned by the MSA bill.\n  Senator Dole left the impression yesterday that meaningful \nnegotiations for an acceptable compromise were taking place and that \nthis issue was close to being resolved because Republicans were open to \nchanges in the MSA provisions to accommodate Democratic concerns. It \nnow appears, however, that the intransigence of the House Republicans \nhas prevailed.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill was passed 60 to 0 by the Committee on\n\n[[Page S5978]]\n\nLabor and Human Resources and 100 to 0 by the full Senate. The bill was \nentirely noncontroversial, and it makes no sense to saddle it with this \nlast-minute killer controversy. If the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill were \npassed by Congress today, it would be signed by the President tomorrow.\n  This bill has had two unanimous bipartisan votes in the Senate, first \nin committee and again on the Senate floor. Yet it is going to die \nbecause of the Republicans' decision to force it to swallow this bitter \npoison pill.\n  Under the Republican plan, medical savings accounts could be sold to \nevery employee of every business in America with more than 50 \nworkers, approximately two-thirds of all workers, more than 80 million \nemployees, and within a few years, they will be extended to everyone \nelse. Some compromise.\n\n  A massive untested right wing health idea is being forced on the \ncountry. Any such massive plan is irresponsible and unacceptable.\n  Reasonable compromises are possible, but what House Republicans want \nis capitulation, not compromise.\n  Not everyone agrees that medical savings accounts are a bad idea, but \nsurely we should agree that they ought to be tested first before being \nimposed full-blown on the American people.\n  We all know what is going on. MSA's reward a handful of insurance \ncompanies that have contributed lavishly to Republicans in Congress, \nand they profit handsomely from the worst abuses of the current system.\n  The Golden Rule Insurance Co., with $1.5 million in campaign \ncontributions, is the political engine driving this proposal. The \ncompany does business selling MSA's, and it will profit immensely from \nthe Republican plan. Yet, the company refuses to share the data on its \nplans with impartial analysts at the American Academy of Actuaries and \nother bodies. The company, and its Republican allies, are thumbing \ntheir nose at the public interest and asking the American people to buy \na pig in a poke.\n  Why should the taxpayers be asked to subsidize such a scheme with \nbillions of dollars in lavish tax breaks that will go primarily to the \nwealthy? Medical savings accounts tax the sick for the benefit of the \nhealthy and wealthy. They discourage preventive care by enticing the \nhealthiest Americans to leave their current broad insurance pool. MSA's \nviolate a bedrock principle of health insurance: Broad-based coverage \nto spread the risk of illness among large numbers of citizens in order \nto make insurance premiums affordable for those who need health care.\n  Adoption of MSA's will raise premiums for everyone else and threaten \nthe very existence of conventional health insurance. It will cost the \nTreasury billions of dollars that should be used to expand health \ninsurance coverage or go for deficit reduction.\n  They represent a risky and unnecessary experiment that threatens the \nhealth insurance coverage of every American family. It would be \nreckless to include any such full-blown version of medical savings \naccounts in this bill. The Senate has already rejected this approach, \nand President Clinton will veto any bill that tries to impose this \nuntried and dangerous idea on the country.\n  The Republicans have also refused to appoint conferees to a fairly \nbalanced conference. Despite repeated requests, they refuse to meet \nwith Democrats for serious negotiation. They have ignored four separate \ncompromises that we have offered to allow a fair test of medical \nsavings accounts without endangering the tens of millions of Americans \nwho depend on their current insurance.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill contains a number of key consensus reforms \nthat virtually everyone agrees on. It guarantees that no American will \nbe denied health insurance or be saddled with exclusions for \npreexisting conditions because they change their job or lose their job \nor because their employer changes insurance companies. It provides help \nto small businesses that want to join together to negotiate \nlower insurance premiums of the kind that only large corporations can \nobtain today. Those reforms deserve to pass, and they will pass if \nSenator Dole relents.\n\n  When Senator Dole leaves the Senate next week, he can take his health \ninsurance with him. Every American should have the same right. Many \ntimes in recent weeks, Senator Dole has said he wants this bill to \npass. For months, Senator Dole has criticized President Clinton for \nsaying one thing and doing another. Senator Dole should look in the \nmirror this weekend and see what he has done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/07/senate-section/article/S5977-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BOB DOLE\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the political world was stunned a few \nweeks ago when our colleague, Majority Leader Bob Dole, announced his \nresignation from the U.S. Senate after 36 years of representing his \nnative State of Kansas. In his emotional and moving farewell speech, he \nsaid he wanted to campaign for the Presidency ``with nothing to fall \nback on but the judgment of the people and nowhere to go but the White \nHouse or home.''\n  Senator Dole was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in \n1960. He came to the Senate in 1968, where he served as the Republican \nleader for a record 11 years. He ran for Vice President with President \nGerald Ford in 1976 and ran for the Republican Presidential nomination \nin 1980 and 1988. He has been a fixture of our National Government for \n36 years. Regardless of what we might think of his decision to give up \nhis life's work for an attempt at the White House, we all agree that \nBob Dole has been an outstanding Senator and leader. He is a master \nlegislator.\n  Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute has called \nSenator Dole one of the five most significant Senators of the last half \nof the 20th century. That sentiment has been echoed by the Brookings \nInstitute's Stephen Hess, who labeled him ``somebody who could get \nthings done.'' And in Washington, especially in the unwieldy Senate, \nthis is no small compliment.\n  I have had the pleasure of serving with Bob Dole for nearly 18 years \nand know him to be an excellent legislator with an amazing ability to \nreach solutions to difficult and controversial issues. He is an honest \nand forthright man of integrity. Had he and the President been able to \nnegotiate in good faith last fall and winter during the heated budget \ndebate, I have no doubt they could have reached a solution which would \nhave been good for our country and our future. Unfortunately, the House \nleadership would not agree to such an effort.\n  Despite his legislative prowess, his major strengths lie in the force \nof his personality and his style. His power comes from his knowledge, \nfrom hard work, from his humor and from his strong friendships on both \nsides of the aisle, and from his rare moral authority. He does his own \nwork and does not delegate much.\n  He comes from a humble background, the son of a cream and egg station \noperator in Russell, KS. After serving in the Army during World War II, \nwhere he suffered grave and lasting wounds, he spent 8 years as a \ncounty attorney dealing with people from all stations in life. He dealt \nwith bankers and country club members, but also with garage mechanics \nand feed store clerks. He has exhibited a comprehensive understanding \nof America as a leader for the interests of the average and \ndisadvantaged Americans.\n  As Senator Bob Dole--a true giant in the history of the Senate--\nleaves this body, he holds so dear, to pursue the Nation's highest \noffice, I join my colleagues in saluting him.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/07/senate-section/article/S5978-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5978-S5979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on a recent action \nby the Senate's Committee on Commerce, Science, and Technology. In a \ncompletely bipartisan manner, the reauthorization for the Office of \nPipeline\n\n[[Page S5979]]\n\nSafety (S. 1505) was approved with a substitute amendment offered by \nSenator Pressler. The compromise amendment language was crafted through \nthe leadership of Senators Pressler and Exon. It was also cosponsored \nby Senators Stevens, Hutchison, Inouye, Ford, Burns, and Breaux. It is \nnow ready for consideration by the full Senate.\n  The negotiations involved many, and included various offices within \nthe Department of Transportation. The major trade organizations ranging \nfrom the American Gas Association, the Interstate Natural Gas \nAssociation of America, the American Petroleum Institute, the American \nPublic Gas Association, to the Association of Oil Pipe Lines \nparticipated as well. Valuable Assistance was also received from the \ndedicated staff of the Congressional Research Service. Input was also \nreceived from state and environmental groups like the National \nAssociation of Pipeline Safety Representatives, the Natural Resource \nDefense Council, and the Environmental Defense Fund. The negotiations \nwere both challenging and productive. I want to compliment the staff \nfrom the Department of Transportation for their constructive and \ncollaborative participation.\n  The major stakeholders are all in agreement--the substitute amendment \nis sound public policy. And this week the Commerce Committee also spoke \nwhen it unanimously approved the substitute. Senator Pressler has \nproduced a real consensus which respects the interests and concerns of \nall the stakeholders and furthers the safety of America's interstate \nnatural gas lines.\n  The natural gas industry is important to America and I want to share \nwith my colleagues just a few statistics to explain why the full Senate \nneeds to act on this legislation; First, 160 million Americans live in \ngas heated buildings; second, $10 billion is spent annually by \nAmerica's gas industry for construction that uses enough pipe to almost \ncircle the globe; third, America's natural gas system consists of over \n1.2 million miles of pipe or enough to circle the earth 48 times; and \nfourth, there are over 600,000 Americans working in all aspects of this \nindustry. The numbers speak for themselves--the natural gas industry is \nbig business. It impacts many, and it has a huge presence in America.\n  I want to be clear; this legislation will codify a limited and \ntargeted risk assessment, cost-benefit regulatory approach. It is \nconsistent with both the Administration's principles and the goals of \nCongress. The bill's approach is a practical and responsible \narrangement and is fully supported by the Office of Pipeline Safety. \nThis legislation will also permit demonstration projects where \nflexibility from the one-size-fits-all mentality is permitted in a way \nwhich mandates that safety and environmental concerns must equal or \nexceed existing standards. It opens avenues for creativity, but demands \nstrict accountability. This legislation will fund the Office of \nPipeline Safety into the next century.\n  In response to past criticism, I also want to be clear; this bill \ndoes not alter the basic statutory structure for the Federal \nGovernment's oversight of the interstate industry. The new steps in the \nregulatory process will cause neither undue delay nor excessive costs. \nIn fact, they are designed to provide better tools and management \nindicators for informed rulemaking in the future. This front end \nanalysis will make government oversight more effective and efficient. \nAlso the Secretary of Transportation has specific authority to ensure \nthat the demonstration projects maintain existing safety standards. And \nfinally, the new funding levels reflect the amounts stated by \nadministration officials during the Commerce Committee's hearing.\n  This bill recognizes that new approaches to pipeline safety are \npossible without jeopardizing either the public's safety or the \nenvironment. It allows sound and the most up-to-date science, as well \nas common sense and flexibility when standards are established. More \nimportantly, the process codified in this bill will be accomplished by \nbuilding cooperative consensus through real consultation with all \naffected parties to avoid lengthy wasteful litigation.\n  The bottom line displayed by the modified bill, through the good work \nof Senators Pressler, Exon, Hutchison, and Breaux, is that government \nand industry can produce a genuine natural gas partnership that is good \nfor all Americans. I eagerly look forward to seeing this bipartisan \nconsensus bill considered by the full Senate as soon as possible.\n  Let me conclude by saying safety on America's interstate natural gas \npipelines will be enhanced by this legislation. I also want to \nunderscore that environmental protection along America's pipeline \nright-of-ways will also be enhanced.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/07/senate-section/article/S5978-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to convey certain Public Lands in the State of Alaska \nto the University of Alaska, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                the university of alaska land grant act\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation in \nsupport of higher education in the State of Alaska.\n  Mr. President, the University of Alaska is a land-grant college \nwithout the land. In 1915, Congress reserved for Alaska's land-grant \ninstitution potentially more than 250,000 acres in the Tanana Valley, \nproceeds from the sale and development of which--like other land grant \ninstitutions--would help finance the operation of the school. Under the \nterms of the measure, written by Delegate James Wickersham, the college \nwas to receive surveyed and unclaimed Section 33 in an area of about \n14,000 square miles between Fairbanks, AK in the north and the \nfoothills of the Alaska Range in the south, this was in addition to the \nmain campus of about 2,250 acres 4 miles from Fairbanks.\n  However, this large Tanana Valley land grant never materialized. For \ndecades, almost all of the land in the Tanana Valley (like the rest of \nAlaska) remained unsurveyed and therefore unavailable. As late as the \n1950s, only 0.6 percent of Alaska had been properly surveyed under the \nstandard rectangular system, and a territorial report concluded that at \nthe speed Alaska was being surveyed, it could take as long as 43,510 \nyears to complete the job. Due primarily to this incredibly slow pace \nof Federal land surveys, Alaska's land grant institution received only \na fraction of the land Congress reserved for it in 1915; in addition to \nits 2,250 acre campus, the University of Alaska received less than \n9,000 acres out of a reservation created for it totaling approximately \n268,000 acres.\n  To partially remedy the situation, Congress granted an additional \n100,000 acres to Alaska's land grant college in 1929, but even with \nthis additional grant, the total was less than half of the original \nacreage authorized in 1915.\n  Further efforts to increase the size of Alaska's higher education \nFederal land grant were made from the 1930s through the 1950s. Several \nbills were submitted to Congress that would have reserved up to 10 \nmillion acres for Alaska's land grant college, but strong opposition, \nprimarily from the Department of the Interior, doomed the effort.\n   Traditionally, the size of land grants were most often determined by \na State's population, not by its area. Nevertheless, some of the last \nwestern States were given generous grants despite their sparse \npopulations. For instance, Oklahoma and New Mexico each received about \n1 million acres to support higher education. Alaska received less land \nspecifically dedicated for the support of higher education than all but \none of the contiguous States. Among the 48 States which had received \nFederal land or land scrip to establish land grant colleges, mining \nschools, teachers' colleges, and state universities, only Delaware \nreceived fewer acres than Alaska. Thus, after statehood, Alaska in 1959 \nwas in an anomalous position. While the State had received more land \nand a greater percentage of land from the Federal Government than any \nother western State, it ranked next to the bottom of the list in the \namount of Federal land it had received for higher education.\n  Over the next 15 years, controversies regarding Alaska land matters \ncontinued to boil, as the public domain in Alaska was carved up for the \nfirst time. In 1971, Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act, reserving 44 million acres for Alaska Natives and \nopening the way for the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The \npipeline marked the start of a national conservation battle in the \n1970s over the future of Alaska's lands, which culminated in 1980 with \nthe passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, a \nmeasure which added 104 million acres to the State's conservation \nsystems.\n  Now, with many of the major Alaska land issues of the 1970s and 1980s \nsettled, supporters of the University of Alaska have encouraged State \nand Federal officials to reexamine the question of the university's \nland grant and consider granting the school additional lands in order \nfor it to ``achieve parity'' with higher educational systems in other \nStates.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would achieve this. It would \ngrant the University up to 350,000 acres of Federal land. It would do \nthis on a matching basis with the State of Alaska for up to a total of \n700,000 acres split equally between the state and Federal Government. \nIn other words if Alaska were to grant the University 200,000 acres of \nState land, the Federal Government would grant them to 200,000 acres.\n  I believe this is a fair settlement to this issue. It addresses some \nof the needs of higher education in my State of Alaska and allows the \nState and the Federal government to participate in the fix \nequally.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. JOHNSTON:\n  S. 1852. A bill to bar class action lawsuits against Department of \nEnergy contractors for nonphysical injuries, to bar the award of \npunitive damages against Department of Energy contractors for incidents \noccurring before August 20, 1988, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n           the department of energy class action lawsuit act\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, over the past 6 months, the \nSubcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources has, under the able direction of Senator Thomas, \nconducted an investigation into the management and cost of class action \nlawsuits against the contractors that operated the Department of \nEnergy's nuclear weapon plants.\n\n  Senator Thomas' investigation uncovered a serious abuse of the legal \nsystem that is costing the taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in \nlawyer's fees each year and could result in hundreds of millions of \ndollars in judgments or settlements even though\n\n[[Page S5981]]\n\nthere is no evidence and, in most cases, no claim that anyone was \nphysically harmed by the operation of these plants.\n  The problem results from the peculiar legal circumstances under which \nthese cases are brought. Normally, people suing the government for \ninjury must bring their suits under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which \naffords the taxpayers certain protections. Courts cannot award punitive \ndamages against the Government. Suits must be grounded on specific \nclaims of wrongdoing, not generalized grievances. The Government cannot \nbe subjected to a jury trial or held liable for actions stemming from \ndiscretionary policy decisions made by Congress or Executive Branch \nofficials.\n  None of the protections of the Federal Tort Claims Act applies in \nthese cases because the suits are not brought against the Government \nitself, but against its contractors. Yet, under the Price-Anderson Act, \nthe Government indemnifies the contractors against any liability or \nlegal costs arising out of the operation of the Department of Energy's \nnuclear weapons complex. The contractors defend the suits, without the \nbenefit of the Government's normal protections, but the Government pays \nall the bills.\n  In sum, we have divorced the power to defend these suits, which rests \nwith the contractors, from the obligation to pay, which remains with \nthe Government. The Government is the real party in interest in these \ncases, but it has been stripped of all of the legal protections it has \nin other cases.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to correct this problem. My bill \nis quite simple. It does three things.\n  First, it prevents lawyers maintaining class action lawsuits against \nthe nuclear weapons contractors for nonphysical injuries. Individual \nclaims for nonphysical injuring could still be pursued. Class action \nsuits could still be maintained for physical injuries. But class \nactions could not be maintained for nonphysical injuries.\n  Second, the bill makes the medical monitoring regime established \nunder Superfund the exclusive source of medical monitoring for these \ncases. The pending cases ask the courts to set up medical monitoring \nprograms costing tens of millions of dollars for tens of thousands of \npeople near these plants. The bill would require the courts to make use \nof the existing institution instead of creating multiple and redundant \nnew ones.\n  Third, it bars punitive damages where the government would have to \npay them. The Federal Tort Claims Act does this already for suits \nagainst the government itself. We thought we were doing this under the \nPrice-Anderson Act when we amended it in 1988, but the 1988 amendments \nonly applied to incidents occurring on or after August 20, 1988, and \nthe pending cases are based on occurrences prior to that date. This \namendment extends the 1988 prohibition to apply to incidents occurring \nbefore 1988.\n  These three reforms are the minimum that is needed to address the \ncurrent problem. Indeed, some might say they do not go far enough. \nThese reforms strike a fair balance that will ensure that anyone who is \nin fact injured by the operation of the nation's nuclear weapons \ncomplex will be compensated. At the same time, they close the loophole \nin the current law that has allowed a few lawyers to raid the U.S. \nTreasury on the flimsiest of claims.\n  I urge all Senators to join me in supporting this measure and ask \nunanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1852\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1.

MEDICAL MONITORING.\n\n       Section 170n. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. \n     2210(n)) is further amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(5)(A) Except in the case of an extraordinary nuclear \n     occurrence, medical monitoring provided by the Agency for \n     Toxic substances and Disease Registry under section 104(i) of \n     the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n     Liability Act (42 U.S.C. 9604(i)) shall be the exclusive \n     remedy for any claim for medical monitoring in a public \n     liability action against a person indemnified by the United \n     States under section 170d.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate a distinguished corporate citizen of my home State of \nTexas. As you may know, Northern Telecom [Nortel], a telecommunications \nequipment manufacturer based in Richardson, TX, recently received the \nfirst annual Corporate Citizenship Award from the Committee on Economic \nDevelopment [CED].\n  The CED is an independent, nonpartisan educational research \norganization of 250 top business, leaders, economists, and university \npresidents. CED represents no single industry or special interest \ngroup, nor does it lobby. For more than 50 years, CED's recommendations \nhave played a major, often decisive, role in critical policy areas such \nas American competitiveness, government and business management, energy \nsecurity, education, and job creation. The CED's Corporate Citizenship \nAward was created to salute those companies that have demonstrated both \nan active involvement in the policy dialog and a carefully considered \ncommitment to the communities in which they operate and society at \nlarge.\n  Nortel received the award in recognition of the principles of \ncorporate and civic responsibility that have guided the company \nthroughout its 100-year history. The award cited Nortel's investment in \nresearch and development, the training and education of its workers, \nthe quality of its management, as well as the company's strong and \nongoing commitment to education, the preservation of the arts and \nculture, and community service.\n  With over 5,000 employees, Nortel is a global telecommunications \nleader. It is with much pride, Mr. President, that I urge my colleagues \nto join me today in congratulating the Nortel family on this much-\ndeserved distinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/07/senate-section/article/S5982-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      1997 BUDGET RESOLUTION VOTES\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to thank my colleagues for their support of the Kerry-\nSimpson-Nunn-Brown-Robb long-term entitlements amendment. My colleagues \nand I were a mere 14 votes away from passing legislation to begin the \nprocess of changing our entitlement laws. The support for this type of \nlong-term reform is unprecedented, due in no small measure to our \npersistence on this matter.\n  I am particularly gratified because the reforms we advocated did not \nsimply tinker around the edges of our budgetary dilemmas. Our \nadjustment to the Consumer Price Index would have saved the country \n$126 billion over 7 years; the phasing in of the Medicare eligibility \nage to 70 would eventually, by 2030, in 1 year alone save $41.1 billion \nin 1996 dollars; and our provision would have given more than 120 \nmillion working Americans the chance to start accumulating their own \nwealth through personal investment plans.\n  Mr. President, the fiscal imbalance of entitlements versus \ndiscretionary spending threatens our implicit intergenerational compact \nto leave a prosperous and growing economy to the next generation of \nAmericans. The great demographic shift that will occur over the next 20 \nor 30 years--when the baby boom generation reaches retirement age--will \nlargely shape our Nation's future. Accordingly, these changes must be \nmet with new assumptions, different rules, and a fresh perspective.\n  That is what my colleagues and I offered. With growing support from \nboth sides of the aisle and increased public awareness, perhaps soon we \nwill get the votes we need to pass long-term entitlement reform. So, I \nam encouraged.\n  Accordingly, I would also like to briefly comment on other amendments \noffered to the budget resolution which I chose to vote against.\n  Several amendments were offered to the Republican budget resolution \nto restore funding to education, Medicaid, and the environment. While I \nagreed that the spending cuts to these programs in the budget \nresolution, particularly education, were severe and counterproductive--\nI could not vote for the add back amendments as they were written. In \norder to balance the budget and according to budget rules, amendments \nwhich add money back to programs in the budget resolution must be \noffset by cuts in other areas of Government spending. Each of the add \nback amendments I voted against used unspecified cuts to corporate \nwelfare to pay for them. I realize that this might look like a good \nidea to the average citizen--cuts to corporations to fund education--\nbut it's not always that simple.\n\n  ``Corporate welfare'' can be a very loosely defined and overused \nterm. The reality is that most of us support--and more importantly \nbenefit from--something that someone could call corporate welfare. The \nhome mortgage deduction is a prime example. Some people would say it \nqualifies as corporate welfare for the real estate industry. However, \nif Congress ended the program today, we would hear the furious cry of \nthe people claiming that we had increased their taxes. The self-\nemployed health insurance deduction is another example. So is the \nresearch and development tax credit--and the list goes on. These \nobviously were not the programs my colleagues had in mind. But I felt I \nneeded a better sense of what they did have in mind before I joined \nthem in support of these amendments.\n  Please do not misunderstand, I believe there are many places where \nGovernment can cut back on spending--including unfair tax breaks for \ncorporations. But we cannot use cuts to corporate welfare as a panacea \nto cure all our budget ills. I believe we must examine each program for \nits merits before deciding to eliminate it. Had the add-back amendments \nin the budget resolution been more specific on which items were to be \nused as offsets, my votes may have been cast quite differently.\n  Moreover, as I mentioned earlier, the most responsible way to solve \nour budget problems is not to tinker on the edges, cutting slices from \ncorporate welfare or discretionary spending. We must address the \nunsustainable growth of entitlement spending if we want to bring our \nbudget into long-term balance. The support for our long-term \nentitlement amendment was an important first step to getting us \nthere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/07/senate-section/article/S5982-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5982-S5983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SMALL BUSINESS WEEK\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this week is Small Business Week, \nduring which we honor and express our appreciation for the men and \nwomen who, by dint of hard work and risktaking, help keep the American \neconomy going strong and create jobs for millions of their fellow \ncitizens.\n  The life of a small business owner is not easy: Long hours, uncertain \nfinances, competition, the very real chance of failure. Add to these \nburdens Federal taxes and regulations, and you have a rough road \nindeed. Many small business people will tell you that the Federal tax \nand regulatory burden is an obstacle to growth, and that the Federal \nGovernment's excessive interference poses a threat not only to their \ngrowth, but in some cases to their very survival. It's time the \nGovernment got off the backs of small businesses, and stopped throwing \nobstacles in the way of their success.\n  Because small businesses are so vital to our economy, and because so \nmany American workers benefit from employment in small businesses, \nCongress is working to relieve some of the tax and regulatory burdens \non small business owners so that they may be free to grow, create jobs, \nand contribute even more to the economy.\n\n[[Page S5983]]\n\n  We've done quite a bit, passing--and making law--15 bills that \nincluded measures endorsed by last year's White House Conference on \nSmall Business. Unfortunately, eight bills that contained important \nsmall business relief have been vetoed by President Clinton.\n  Yes, that's right--eight bills that included recommendations from the \nWhite House Conference on Small Business were vetoed by the current \noccupant of the White House, President Clinton. Those eight measures, \nwhich would have been of tremendous help to small business men and \nwomen were: An estate tax reduction, health care reform, pension \nreform, legal reform, a health deduction for the self-employed, an \nexpensing provision, broad-based capital gains reform, and small \nbusiness investment via capital gains reform. Last year, at the \nconference, the President expressed strong support for these measures \nand led us to believe that he wanted to relieve some of the burdens on \nour Nation's entrepreneurs.\n  Well, as we know from past experience, you can't always rely on what \nthe President says he's going to do. I certainly hope this Small \nBusiness Week will jog his memory as to the promises he made last year, \nand that he will work with Congress as we continue in our efforts to \nease the burdens on small businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/07/senate-section/article/S5982-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRATULATING WEST PHILADELPHIA CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I call attention to a very \nspecial honor bestowed upon the West Philadelphia Catholic High School \nof Philadelphia, PA. West Philadelphia Catholic High School is among \n266 secondary schools to be selected as a Blue Ribbon School of \nExcellence. The U.S. Department of Education's Blue Ribbon School of \nExcellence Program nationally recognizes public and private schools \nthat are effective in meeting local, State, and national goals and in \neducating their students.\n  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate West Philadelphia \nCatholic High School on this distinguished achievement. I am also proud \nto say that the West Philadelphia Catholic High School is a two-time \nwinner of this prestigious honor and is the only Archdiocesan school to \nhave received this award. As the U.S. Department of Education notes, \nthese Blue Ribbon Schools are not only centers of educational \nexcellence in their communities, but are often visited by educators \nfrom across the country who study their success.\n  The West Philadelphia Catholic High School is a Blue Ribbon Award \nwinner because of the hard work of its students, the continued support \nof parents and graduates, and the dedication of its faculty and \nadministration. This hard work and dedication to excellence can also be \nseen in the high number of graduating students who pursue higher \neducation.\n  Again Mr. President, the Blue Ribbon Award is an honor to the \nstudents, faculty, and administration of the West Philadelphia Catholic \nHigh School as well as the city of Philadelphia. At this time I would \nlike to extend my best wishes to West Philadelphia Catholic High School \nand congratulate this academic community on a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/07/senate-section/article/S5983-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          BICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF MONTAUK POINT LIGHTHOUSE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on the seventh day of June, 1796, \nthe founding block of sandstone was placed at the base of the Montauk \nPoint Lighthouse on the eastern tip of Long Island. Two hundred years \nof Atlantic breakers have worn away more than half of the land that \nonce separated the great black and white striped tower from the ocean; \nhowever, this steady beacon continues to welcome seafarers from near \nand far and guides them around the point, safely to shore.\n  On April 12, 1792, President George Washington signed into law the \ncongressional authorization for the construction of the Montauk Point \nLighthouse. On March 2, 1793, a sum of $20,000 was appropriated for the \nproject. Unbiased in its service to the vessels of the sea, the \nlighthouse was the first to be constructed in New York State at full \nFederal expense, and it remains a shining beacon of the best of what we \ncan do as a nation.\n  From the top of the lighthouse tower, one can see Long Island, \nConnecticut, Rhode Island and Block Island. This range of sight proved \nbeneficial during World War II, when spotters from the tower would \ncoordinate the 16\" cannons located in the battery at Fort Hero--500 \nmeters to the west. Throughout the war, the lighthouse was operated by \nthe Army Signal Corps and established itself as a crucial part of the \neastern coastal defensive shield.\n  Though its construction was significantly altered only once, the \nlighthouse has changed with the times. Originally it burned whale oil, \nhoused a lightkeeper, and could be seen from but a few miles from its \nsource. Today the lighthouse runs on an automated system, and can be \nseen at a distance of 19 nautical miles. In addition, it forms part of \na satelite-based global positioning system.\n  This year the Montauk Point Lighthouse Museum will welcome its 1 \nmillionth visitor by land. On behalf of those who pass both by land and \nby sea, I would like to thank the Montauk Historical Society and the \nCoast Guard for their dutiful service to the light, and I am delighted \nto celebrate the Bicentennial of the Montauk Lighthouse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/07/senate-section/article/S5983-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 3120\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Before I go to the closing script, I want to comment \nbriefly on what I understand is happening with the health insurance \nreform package. I understand that discussions are continuing. I have \nthe impression that very good progress is being made. I am hopeful, as \nI know the distinguished majority leader is, that agreement can be \nreached and that this legislation can be taken up early next week.\n  Yet I was amused to hear the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy, a few moments ago, complaining loudly, vociferously about how \nnot enough was being done. Actually, what he is complaining about is \nthe way it is being done to come to an agreement. It was amusing to me \nbecause he was complaining about how there were meetings going on and \nthey were not being informed or kept advised, yet he immediately \nstarted talking about exactly what is being discussed. He knows every \ndetail. I know he is involved and staff is involved.\n  Senator Kassebaum, the Senator from Kansas, who coauthored this \nlegislation with the Senator from Massachusetts, is keeping him \ninformed. Really, he protests too much. He says they are not involved, \nyet he knows every detail immediately. When we get close to an \nagreement he does not like, he runs to the floor and says, ``My \ngoodness.'' Then he continues to complain that members of the minority \nare not involved in discussions. Yet every time we have tried to get \nconferees appointed, the Democrats have objected. I tried it yesterday. \nThat way Senator Kennedy, Senator Pell, Senator Moynihan, Senator Biden \nor others would be involved, sitting down in a room discussing the \nsolution. The reason they are not directly, formally involved is \nbecause Senator Kennedy and other Democrats have objected to the \nappointment of conferees.\n  We are never going to bring this to a conclusion if we cannot get \nover the hurdle of at least appointing conferees.\n\n[[Page S5984]]\n\n What they really want is an agreement first. Once we get it all worked \nout, they will have conferees. I think that is a little bit of a \nperversion of how the system usually has worked and how it should work.\n  What Senator Kennedy is complaining about with regard to the \ndistinguished majority leader is that the majority leader may have a \nlittle different view of some of the comments. So the inference is if \nSenator Dole does not agree to what Senator Kennedy wants, then it is \nhopeless. That is not the way it works. A lot of progress has been \nmade. A lot of concessions have been made by the House to the Senate \nand some from the Senate to the House. The big objection is medical \nsavings accounts. There are solutions there. There are compromises that \nare within reach.\n\n  It is a question of choice. Will our people, some day--some day--have \na chance to decide if maybe they want to put their money in medical \nIRA's? Senator Kennedy wants to block that. Even the President has \nindicated along the way over the last year that he would be willing to \ngo with some form of agreement on medical savings accounts. Maybe not \nwhat they are talking about now, but on a pilot basis, some form. This \nis an idea we ought to try. I hope the conferees or the people who are \ntalking about it, since they will not let us appoint conferees, are \ngetting close to an agreement. I believe they are. It is encouraging. I \nlook forward to our having a chance to take that up next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/07/senate-section/article/S5983-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 10, 1996\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

This would enable the Senate to yield \nback some of the statutory time limitation on Tuesday and allow for a \nvote on the conference report during Tuesday's session of the Senate. \nThis is a measured step in the right direction. I am glad that \nconference report has been agreed to and we can take it up early next \nweek. Rollcall votes are possible during Monday's session of the \nSenate, and the Senate may be asked to turn to any legislative items \nthat can be cleared.\n  I am sure in the opening session and opening script on Monday we will \nhave additional information about the schedule during the day of \nTuesday and Wednesday.
