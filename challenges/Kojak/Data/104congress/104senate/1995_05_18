We long for this superlative quality of peace, and \nfor good reason. You have called us to lead this great Nation. To \nenable us to be creative Copernican thinkers about the problems and \nopportunities before us this day, You seek to give us profound inner \npeace.\n  But Lord, we find it difficult to stay our minds on You. We try to \nfocus on You and often our attention wanders; we seek to listen to You \nand the sound waves to our hearts are cluttered with the static of \ndistracting voices; we want to trust You, but years of self-reliance \nmake it difficult to wait patiently for Your answers. Most of the time \nour motto is, ``I have just got to get control of my life!'' Ah, \nthere's the issue, Lord. We were never meant to usurp Your control. Now \nin the quiet of this time of prayer we discover the secret: You alone \ncan keep our minds stayed on You. All we can do is ask for the miracle \nof a day lived in constant awareness of Your abiding presence. May this \nbe a day crammed full of spectacular moments when You keep our minds \nsteady, our hearts calm, and our wills alert to Your will. Lord of \npeace, keep our minds on You.

Mr. President, I have asked for a period of time to be \nreserved this morning to speak about the incidents at Ruby Ridge, ID, \nand Waco, TX. And there are a number of other Senators who have stated \nto me their intention to come to speak.\n  My remarks at the moment will be relatively brief, and I want to \nthank my distinguished colleague from Colorado for yielding to me \nbecause he was on the floor before I arrived. It is a little unusual to \nfind Senators here in advance of the opening of the Senate session. But \nSenator Campbell has time reserved as well.\n  I hope to return later during the period for morning business to \nspeak at greater length and also other Senators will come to speak on \nthe subjects of Ruby Ridge, ID, and Waco, TX, as well. But I have a \ncommitment to appear before the Finance Committee at 9:30 to testify on \nthe flat tax.\n  (Mr. DeWINE assumed the chair.)\n\n\n                             Ruby Ridge, ID\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think it is important that there be a \npositive showing by the Senate of our concerns about what happened at \nRuby Ridge, ID, on August 21, 1992, and the days thereafter, and what \nhappened at Waco, TX, on April 19, 1993, and the days which preceded to \nassure the American people that appropriate congressional oversight \nwill occur and that there will be accountability at the highest levels \nof the U.S. Government.\n  The House of Representatives has scheduled a hearing on the events at \nWaco, TX, and an announcement has been made by the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Judiciary Committee \nwill hold hearings on Waco, TX, and Ruby Ridge, ID, as well.\n  As I said last week on the Senate floor, it is my hope that we will \ndo these hearings sooner rather than later because of my strong view \nthat the American people need reassurance that there will be proper \noversight. I say that I do not know what the answers are to the \nquestions which have been raised, but I do see many important and \nprofound questions. And I do think it is absolutely necessary that a \nfull effort be made with congressional oversight to find answers.\n\n[[Page S6838]]\n\n  Mr. President, with respect to the incidents at Ruby Ridge, ID, back \non August 21, 1992, I have talked to FBI Director Freeh; FBI Deputy \nDirector Potts; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Director John \nMagaw; Jerry Spence, Esq., the attorney who represented Mr. Randy \nWeaver in the criminal proceedings in the Federal court; Randy Dade, \nthe county attorney of Boundary County; and have attempted contact, \ntraded calls with Special Agent Glenn, who is the agent in charge in \nSalt Lake City.\n  My preliminary findings--and these are obviously preliminary--show me \nthat there are very important questions which require congressional \noversight on the appropriate use of force in taking someone into \ncustody and on the initiation of investigations by Federal agencies \nlike the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.\n  In discussing the incidents at Ruby Ridge, ID., and in taking them up \nin a preliminary way with the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, and Firearms, John Magaw, there is a serious question as to \nhow that matter all began.\n  Last Saturday, when I was in Des Moines, IA, I had occasion to talk \nat some length with Mr. Randy Weaver, who was tried and acquitted on \nmurder charges. I had a chance to talk to his daughters Sarah and \nRachel, ages 19 and 13. His 3-year-old daughter Elisha was present as \nwell but was not in a position to shed any light on what occurred.\n  Picking up just one strand in the few moments that I am able to speak \non the issue now, Mr. Weaver recounted how he had been contacted by a \nman who had asked him about acquiring sawed-off shotguns. Mr. Weaver \nadvised that he thought that the individual was an undercover agent for \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. And that was later \nconfirmed by Director Magaw, who told me that it was a confidential \ninformant who had gone to contact Mr. Weaver on the subject of \npurchasing sawed-off shotguns.\n  When that matter was tried, according to the information given to me \nby Mr. Magaw, Mr. Weaver was acquitted, on what Mr. Magaw said were \nborderline entrapment circumstances. When I questioned Mr. Magaw about \nwhat he meant by borderline entrapment--I know when I talk about this \nwith the Presiding Officer, the distinguished Senator from Ohio, Mr. \nDeWine, knowing what entrapment is, it is really not borderline; it is \neither entrapment or not. And if it is a matter of acquittal, there is \nno entrapment.\n  For those who do not know the details of entrapment--and it is a \ncomplex situation--that is when the idea comes from law enforcement and \nit is planted in the mind of the individual who ultimately does the \nconduct, undertakes the action which is the cause of an indictment.\n  I think we need to focus on the specifics as to what happened there \nto give congressional oversight from some of us who have had more \nexperience along that line so that we do not become engaged in the law \nenforcement agency, the Government itself, setting up circumstances \nwhich begin the chain of conduct which results in the indictment and \nlook what happened beyond that in the Weaver matter because the law \nwill not support a conviction if it is entrapment by the law \nenforcement agencies.\n  I am going to have to speak at length to this later, Mr. President. \nBut one other matter that I wanted to touch upon in the Ruby Ridge \nincident was the question of the use of force and the question of \nwhether it was excessive. I do not want to come to any conclusions. \nThere has been considerable comment about whether the rules of \nengagement were changed and whether that was what led to the censure of \nSpecial Agent Larry Potts, who has since become the Deputy Director of \nthe FBI. And in my discussions with Mr. Potts, which were relatively \nlimited because we were scheduled to meet at a later time when he will \nhave an opportunity to have his attorney present, Mr. Potts advised me \nthat there had been no change in the rules of engagement. And that \nraises a very fundamental question as to the conduct and the use of \nforce by Federal law enforcement when Mr. Weaver was taken into custody \nin a very sad situation where a U.S. marshal was killed, where 14-year-\nold Sam Weaver was killed, and where Mrs. Randy Weaver was killed. That \nis a tough subject but certainly deserves and requires our attention.\n  I touch upon those matters only briefly at this point, Mr. President, \nbecause I had said I would be making an inquiry, a preliminary inquiry, \nand I wanted to report on that. We had scheduled the hearings initially \nfor the Terrorism Subcommittee for this morning, and those have been \ndeferred until the full committee will take up the matter at a later \ndate.\n  I had wanted to touch on the Waco incident again to at least refer \npreliminarily to the report by Dr. Allen Stone, of Harvard, who was a \npanelist selected to help in that inquiry, but since it is almost 9:30 \nand I am due in the Finance Committee--and I have already taken the \ntime of my distinguished colleague from Colorado--I am going to \nconclude these very brief remarks with the hope of being able to come \nback a little later in morning business to talk additionally, to report \nfurther on my preliminary inquiry. I thank the Chair and I again thank \nSenator Campbell.\n  Mr. President, before my colleague starts, may I just add, perhaps \nunnecessarily, that I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nColorado [Mr. Campbell] is recognized to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Campbell pertaining to the introduction of S. 817 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DOLE. Was leader time reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, leader time was \nreserved.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6837-6", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6838-S6839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this weekend, an important advertisement \nwill be appearing on our television screens. The ad will feature two \nprominent Americans--Dr. William Bennett and C. Delores Tucker, chair \nof the National Political Congress of Black Women.\n  Dr. Bennett is a Republican. Ms. Tucker is a Democrat. Both agree \nthat the entertainment industry must be held accountable for the \nmindless violence and loveless sex it serves up each day to our \nchildren.\n  Of course, there are many fine people in the entertainment industry \nand there are many fine movies, songs, and television shows. And, \nthankfully, it appears that Hollywood is finally beginning to \nunderstand that family-friendly films can also be box office hits.\n  That is the good news.\n  The bad news is that too much of today's entertainment continues to \noperate in a moral vacuum, without a redeeming hope, and without any \nsuggestion that virtues are important, that morality is, in fact, \npreferable to immorality.\n  We cannot ignore this simple truth: culture does count.\n  Cultural messages can and do bore deep into the hearts and the minds \nof our impressionable young. And when these messages are negative \nones--repeated hour after hour, day after day, month after month--they \ncan rob our children of that most precious gift of all: their \ninnocence.\n  One of the leading cultural influences in America today happens to be \none of our largest corporations, Time-Warner.\n  Now, Time-Warner has produced much entertainment over the years that \nhas enriched the cultural life of our country. But unfortunately, \nthrough its affiliation with companies like Interscope Records, Time-\nWarner is now on the cutting-edge of the misogyny business. As Ms. \nTucker will explain in her television ad, and I quote:\n\n       Time-Warner's music division promotes music that celebrates \n     the rape, torture, and murder of women. The lyrics are \n     vulgar, offensive, and do terrible harm to our children.\n\n  Columnist John Leo puts it another way. He calls Time-Warner's \naffiliation with Interscope the ``cultural equivalent of owning half \nthe world's mustard gas factories.''\n  Last month, I urged all Americans to join with me in refocusing the \nspotlight on the entertainment industry. I said that ``shame is a \npowerful tool and [[Page S6839]] we should use it.'' So, it is \ngratifying to see two concerned Americans, with different backgrounds \nand different political views, joining forces to put some much-deserved \npublic heat on one of the giants of the entertainment industry.\n  Let us also be very clear that Government censorship is not the \nanswer. We have more to fear than to gain from putting Washington in \ncharge of our culture.\n  But just as Time-Warner has the right to produce and sell its harmful \nwares, concerned Americans like Bill Bennett and Dolores Tucker also \nhave the right to call upon the executives of Time-Warner to think less \nabout short-term profit and more about the long-term good of their \ncountry.\n  So, I want to congratulate Dr. Bennett and Ms. Tucker for taking this \ninitiative. I know that Dr. Bennett cites courage as one of the great \nvirtues in his great ``Book of Virtues'' and with this bold advertising \ncampaign, he has proven that courage and good citizenship are alive and \nwell in America today.\n  Mr. President, I will just say, maybe as a suggestion, it would be \nwell for the Time-Warner executives and Bill Bennett and Ms. Tucker to \nsit down and talk about this, try to work it out, try to have a dialog. \nI hope that there will be some meeting of the minds and some agreement \nto start this discussion, to start a dialog because, as I have \nindicated before, it is very important to Americans, particularly \nAmerica's children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6838-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NRA FUNDRAISING RHETORIC\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I was pleased to see the National Rifle \nAssociation apologize for some of the statements in their recent \nfundraising letter. The NRA has done the right thing. They should not \nhave used some of that language in the first place. Alleged abuses of \npower by Federal law enforcement authorities are a fair and legitimate \nsubject of debate--for Congress and for the American people. But it is \nwrong to impugn the motives and actions of the courageous men and women \nwho risk their lives every day in enforcing our laws.\n  Mr. President, words do matter. Statements do matter. Our debate \nshould recognize that fact. I ask that the article from today's \nWashington Post on the NRA apology be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 18, 1995]\n\n     NRA Executive Issues Apology for Letter Attacking U.S. Agents\n\n       A National Rifle Association official apologized yesterday \n     to law enforcement officials and others offended by a recent \n     fund-raising letter describing some federal agents as ``jack-\n     booted thugs.''\n       ``I really feel bad about the fact that the words in that \n     letter have been interpreted to apply to all federal law \n     enforcement officers,'' NRA Executive Vice President Wayne \n     LaPierre said in a telephone interview from Phoenix.\n       ``If anyone thought the intention was to paint all federal \n     law enforcement officials with the same broad brush, I'm \n     sorry, and I apologize,'' LaPierre said.\n       Lapierre's apology comes after a week of steadily mounting \n     criticism of the NRA, which began May 10 when former \n     president George Bush revealed that he had resigned from the \n     group in protest of the letter.\n       Lapierre said the letter was intended to criticize only \n     isolated actions, primarily involving the Bureau of Alcohol, \n     Tobacco and Firearms.\n       But at least one section of the letter offer a more general \n     condemnation of federal law enforcement efforts.\n       The letter, sent to the NRA's 3.5 million members in March \n     over LaPierre's signature, said that ``in Clinton's \n     administration, if you have a badge, you have the \n     government's go-ahead to harass, intimidate, even murder law-\n     abiding citizens.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6839-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MORE SHELLS FALL ON SARAJEVO\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, on Monday more than 1,000 shells fell on \nSarajevo--5 people were killed and 25 wounded. Yesterday Bihac was \nbeing shelled. Today a Sarajevo marketplace was hit by a mortar shell. \nThe response to these attacks on U.N. designated safe havens reflects \nthe United Nation's latest de facto policy: Blame the Bosnian \nGovernment for trying to defend its people, and dispatch NATO planes to \nbuzz overhead. Meanwhile contact group negotiators are desperately \ntrying to sweeten a deal for Serbian President Milosevic.\n  Let us face it, the protection of U.N. safe havens has become a \nfraud. The enforcement of weapons exclusion zones has also become a \nfraud. The United Nations is not fooling anyone even with its blame \nboth sides rhetoric.\n  According to news reports, the United Nations is considering mandate \nreduction for its forces in Bosnia. In my view that has already \nhappened, and without a U.N. Security Council vote.\n  The General Accounting Office recently released a study on U.N. \noperations in Bosnia-Herzegovina prepared at my request. In painstaking \ndetail the report explains how the United Nations is not doing the job \nit was tasked to do in Bosnia.\n  The GAO report confirms what many of us already knew: that the U.N. \noperation in the former Yugoslavia is ineffective, that UNPROFOR is not \ncarrying out its mandates. It also indicates that UNPROFOR has lost its \ncredibility and has impeded NATO's ability to carry out air strikes in \ndefense of U.N. designated safe havens and U.N. forces, facts that are \nvery clear in light of events over the last 2 days in Bosnia.\n  I would remind my colleagues that even though there are no Americans \nparticipating in UNPROFOR, the United States has been subsidizing this \nfailed endeavor for several years now, to the tune of more than $1.1 \nbillion in direct support and $1.4 billion more in indirect support.\n  It is high time that we review our support for this flawed policy. \nThe facts are clear: This operation is a failure, an expensive failure. \nIt seems to me that increasingly UNPROFOR's real reason for being is to \nprevent a change in policy, specifically to prevent the lifting of the \narms embargo on Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I simply urge all of my colleagues to read the GAO's \nreport. I believe that after reading it, one would be hard pressed to \nargue that this operation is worth Bosnia being denied its fundamental \nright to self-defense.\n  I say, along with Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, it is our hope \nthat we will be able to vote on lifting the arms embargo in the Senate \nsome time in June. It seems to me that everything is falling apart and \nwe are getting less and less response from the United Nations. I must \nsay I have no quarrel with the U.N. Protection Forces, the men and \nwomen there. They are certainly exhibiting courage and bravery. But it \nseems to me that the time has come for a total review of our policy. I \nsuggest to the President of the United States that he provide the \nleadership in this review and that we do it as quickly as possible.\n  I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to comment on Senator Dole's \nremarks on the floor of the Senate today with reference to violence in \nthe United States in the mass media of America and its role in terms of \nviolence. I want to commend the Senator for making the point. Those two \nAmerican citizens, one Democrat and one Republican, have no idea what a \nservice they are doing for the people of this country, if they can just \nget the media to understand that they, too, have a responsibility. They \nhave lots of freedom. But where is all the violence coming from? We are \nmaking excuses and talking about it all the time, as if Government is \nto blame and this is to blame. The truth of the matter is people are \njust seeing so much violence, and they are outdoing each other to show \nus a different and new way that is becoming part of some of American \ncitizens' lives. They see it, and they do not have regard for life.\n  Mr. DOLE. The children see it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. Then you have 14-year-olds committing the acts \nthey have seen on television 50 times. Sooner or later--we cannot \nlegislate in that area. It is very difficult. Sooner or later we have \nto come to our senses, and I commend the Senator for his remarks.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6839-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6839-S6843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      FRESHMAN FOCUS ON THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, our freshman focus group continues today \nand will continue on through the next week. [[Page S6840]] \n  I rise today to express my surprise and my disappointment at the \nposition the administration has taken, and, indeed, the other side of \nthe aisle, with regard to the budget, with regard to Medicare, line-\nitem veto, unfunded mandates, the rescission package, and the balanced \nbudget amendment. In fact, on every issue that has come up since the \nbeginning of this Congress, we have had the same approach, we have had \nthe same reaction. And that position is to resist--``obfuscate'' has \nbeen used; that is a new word to me, but I think it means ``don't do \nanything''--and oppose with no alternative; to simply say no with no \nsign of leadership as to what an alternative solution would be to those \nissues.\n  It is surprising, Mr. President, and disappointing to me that the \nPresident 2 years ago made a great issue out of change. He was going to \nbring to this place change, new Democrats, a reinvention of Government, \na more user friendly Government, reduce the size. Great rhetoric. \nExcept when it comes to doing it, when it comes to the tough part--and \nit is tough to change; it is tough to make changes in systems that have \nbeen there; it is tough to make changes in programs that have built up \nabout them a constituency. And so it is tough.\n  Talk is easy, but it is not easy to make the change. It is not easy \nto come to the snubbing post and really have to do it.\n  Instead, it is really easy to revert to the old system, and that is \nmore Government and more spending and more programs. That is the easier \nway to go. It is one that makes it less politically volatile and one \nthat we do.\n  Never mind that the programs have not solved the problems. Never mind \nthat nearly everyone I think in this country believes that Government \nis too big and too intrusive and too expensive, a Government with \nnearly 3.5 million employees, thousands of programs, and literally \nhundreds of agencies and advisory groups.\n  And, of course, even the administration argues for cuts. Secretary \nShalala recently announced a major revision. I think it involves 2,700 \njobs--2,700 out of 62,000. That is hardly a major revision.\n  But now, we do have a chance, Mr. President, to do something \nsignificant. We do have an opportunity for the first time in a very \nlong time to make some significant changes, not only to reduce the \ncost.\n  The budget argument is not just about dollars, although that is \nparticularly important and significant. The real discussion and the \nreal debate and the real opportunity is to take a look at Government \nand to examine now what the role of Government will be, to examine \nwhere we want to be in terms of the Government in the year 2000, when \nwe move into a new millennia, what kind of a new century that we want \nto prepare for our children and our grandchildren if we do not do \nsomething by then. If we do not make changes by then, this Government \nwill be able to afford only the entitlement programs and interest.\n  We will have this year, in a couple of months, a vote to raise the \ndebt limit to $5 trillion. And before the next 2 years is over, before \nthe first Clinton administration is over, we will be having $6 trillion \nin debt. Some say, ``Well, that doesn't matter, particularly. Debt does \nnot matter.''\n  Debt does matter, as a matter of fact. Debt takes money out of the \neconomy; money could be invested for other things. Maybe more to the \npoint, the cost of interest will be soon the largest single line item \nin the budget. This year nearly $260 billion for interest alone. So it \nis significant.\n  It seems to me the measure of good Government is to be able to look \nat programs and see if, in fact, they are doing the job, to measure the \noutput, to measure the results.\n  Unfortunately, I think it is fair to say that Government over the \nyears in a nonpartisan way, when problems are not resolved by a \nprogram, we say, ``Well, this needs more money.'' And that may or may \nnot be the case.\n  The fact is it is more likely that what happens is that you need to \nchange the program, you need to change the application of the funds. \nAnd to suggest that results will be different if you continue to do the \nsame thing is kind of a fantasy. It gives us an opportunity to look at \nduplication. And there is great duplication. There is redundancy.\n  There are 160 programs that have to do with moving from education to \nwork. Now, everybody wants to do that. That is a great idea, and we \nshould do it. It is a significant effort. But we do not need that many \nprograms. They continue to add on.\n  There is a list of them. It is sort of interesting. I think it was in \nthe newspaper 2 days ago.\n Actually literally hundreds of basically advisory committees no one \nhas ever heard of in the world. Quite frankly, if they disappeared, \nnone of us would know the difference. So we need to do some of those \nthings.\n\n  Despite the first opportunity in 40 years, what is the strategy? I am \nafraid the strategy of the opposition is to object, to resist, to \ncriticize, to filibuster. Let me say that filibuster is not the old \nclassic filibuster where you stand on the floor for 72 hours and fall \nover from exhaustion. What filibuster is is hundreds of amendments that \npile up so that we do not go anywhere, so that nothing happens, and \nthat is what is happening around here. And that is too bad. Every issue \nthis entire year has been handled that way. We do have to do something \nabout that.\n  Medicare is an excellent example. I do not think anyone can doubt \nthat you have to do something about Medicare. It is not a brandnew \nidea. We have known it is coming. Medicare was started in the sixties. \nI believe there was one point where 19 million people were involved in \nthe beginning. Now that is doubled. The first year in Medicare, I \nthink, was a $1.2 billion expenditure. This year it is a $165 billion \nexpenditure and going up at a rate of 10 percent a year, one that we \ncannot maintain.\n  The trustees, which include three members of the Cabinet, have just \ngiven a report saying that unless we do something, in 2 or 3 years the \nprogram will be calling on the reserves and in 7 years it will be \nbroke. We cannot let that happen. So we have to make some changes.\n  The proposal that is being made is to reduce the percentage of growth \nfrom 10 percent a year to 7 percent a year. That is still a pretty good \ngrowth. That is the growth of health care in the private sector plus \ninflation.\n  Some say, ``Well, there are more people.'' The fact is it increases \nthe per capita spending which takes into account new participants. It \nincreases the per capita spending from about $4,800 a year to $6,400 a \nyear, and yet this will be attacked as a cut.\n  What is the alternative? The alternative is Medicare goes broke. We \ncan fix it. We can fix it, but we have to change, and we can do that.\n  Mr. President, the opportunities are great. We are now dealing with a \nbudget that continues to grow and, under the administration's plan, the \ndeficit continues as it is as far as one can see. The package grows. \nThe total package over $1.5 trillion a year grows at 5.5 percent a \nyear. We are suggesting that we reduce that growth to about 3.5 percent \na year. Hardly a cut.\n  So we have a great opportunity, and I think the point is that voters \nsaid to us in 1994, and voters have said to us before, we have too much \nGovernment, that Government costs too much, that Government is not user \nfriendly as it should be, we have overregulation. And that is true.\n  I do not say those things particularly as criticisms, but just as a \nrecognition of where we are, but with the happy thought that we can \nchange that, and that, of course, is what is so remarkable about our \ndemocracy, what is so remarkable about our Government.\n  Let me tell you that even though the request for change on the part \nof voters, on the part of citizens, on the part of you and me is not a \nnew idea. It has been done for years. In the 1800's and every \ngeneration there was substantial change in Government. Now it becomes \nmore difficult. Government is larger, there is more bureaucracy, there \nis more lobbying, there are more people who are constituents of \nprograms, and it becomes much more difficult, but not impossible at \nall.\n  As a matter of fact, I can tell you having been home, and going home \nevery other week, I find my people, the people I represent in Wyoming, \nwant some change. They know there is going to be some change, there is \ngoing to be some pain as there always is when you make your budget fit \nin your business [[Page S6841]] or in your family. And that is where we \nare.\n  I think it is an exciting opportunity. We need to take a look at our \nobjectives. Our objectives are to make Government more responsive, to \ntake those areas, such as welfare, where we are committed to helping \npeople who need help and fix the program so that we help them help \nthemselves, and that is the way it ought to be.\n  So we are there. We need to take the bull by the tail and look the \nproblem in the eye. The objective is to have a solution. We can find \nit, taking a look at the role of Government, better ways of doing it, \nless Government in our lives, in responsible financial condition. We \ncan do it, and I think it is a great opportunity. We will be talking \nabout it this week. I think it is a watershed opportunity. We will make \nsome big decisions this week over where we will be when the century \nchanges in 7 years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming. I \nmust say that his remarks are both compelling and accurate and reflect \nthe opportunity which we face in the U.S. Senate and for which the \npeople sent us to the U.S. Senate. A job well done and items well \nstated, because they understand what happened here on May 11, just a \nfew days ago, when Republicans annunciated their view for a brighter \neconomic future, for financial stability, for fiscal integrity for the \nUnited States of America.\n  On that day, Senator Domenici, and other members of the Budget \nCommittee, passed a resolution that would reduce spending over the \ncourse of the next few years by a trillion dollars. It is a budget \nresolution that brings our budget into balance by the year 2002. When \nthis happens, it will be eligible for categorization as one of the \neight wonders of the world. It is one of those things people have said \ncould not be done.\n  But free people have the right to shape the tomorrows in which they \nlive, and if we want to shape a tomorrow in which our children will \nlive in a constructive way, we will have that kind of discipline which \nputs us on a balanced budget path and an enforceable balanced budget \npath by the year 2000 which sets us on a path for fiscal sanity and \neconomic responsibility.\n  The plan that has been annunciated, the plan brought forth by Senator \nDomenici, is a plan for which he and members of the committee should be \ncommended. I personally want to make that special effort to thank them.\n  These plans just do not happen in a vacuum. Someone has to make the \ntough judgments, someone has to be willing to take the tough stand, \nsomeone has to be willing to make the commitment, and Senator Domenici \nhas done so.\n  His resolve, his commitment, his dedication, his courage has not been \nmatched on the other side of the aisle. What has been the Democratic \nresponse to the Republican plan? Well, we have had ad hominem attacks, \nmisleading charges, empty rhetoric. At this momentous time in our \nhistory that requires decision, that requires courage, that requires \ncommitment, the Democratic Party seems committed only to partisanship \nand to politics.\n  So I think it is important that we ask again today where is their \nalternative? Where is their plan for a balanced budget? You and I and \nother Members in this Chamber endured a balanced budget debate, and we \nfell 1 vote short--1 vote short--because many on the Democratic side \nchanged their votes to vote against a balanced budget this year. They \nsaid over and over again, ``All we need is the will and the courage, \nand the determination to balance the budget. We don't need an \namendment.'' Well, now we have Senator Domenici who stands up and \nannounces with will, courage and determination a balanced budget. And \nwhere are those who would support the balanced budget? They are not to \nbe found.\n They were not to be found in the vote for the balanced budget \namendment, and they are not to be found in the discussion of an actual \nbalanced budget--except for criticism, except for partisanship. It is \ntime that we have a united, bipartisan effort to achieve a balanced \nbudget.\n\n  I suggest that critics of our balanced budget plan, brought forward \nby Senator Domenici, ought to heed the counsel of the 16th President of \nthe United States. In Lincoln's words, he put it this way:\n\n       Those have a right to criticize who have a heart to help.\n\n  You have a right to criticize if you have a heart to help. Well, we \nconfront a fiscal crisis as great as any threat that we have confronted \nin this Nation, any threat we have ever faced, and calls for the \nmaintenance of the status quo are insufficient. They are, in fact, \nirresponsible. Those who would criticize the move toward responsibility \nby instituting or institutionalizing the status quo are really saying \nthey want to embrace irresponsibility. Inaction today will ensure \ndecline for America tomorrow.\n  Now, the story of our financial crisis has been told many times on \nthis floor, but it bears repeating. If we do not act dramatically and \nquickly to balance the budget of the United States, we will find \nourselves in a position of bankruptcy. If unreformed Medicare will be \nbankrupt in just 6 years, is this the alarmist position of partisan \npoliticians? No, this is the announced report of the board of trustees \nof the fund which supports Medicare. And three members of that board \nare members of the President's Cabinet.\n  There is a crisis in Medicare funding. We will not have the resources \nin the hospital trust fund in order to make the payments if something \nis not done. Yet, what has been the response of those who have said \nthey want to balance the budget, but all we need is the will, the \ndetermination and the commitment to do it, and we do not need the \nbalanced budget amendment? Well, they are just criticizing Senator \nDomenici and his report that would provide us an opportunity, a \nroadmap, which would carry us to a balanced budget. Medicare will be \nbankrupt in just 6 years. There is a real need for commitment and \naction.\n  Without changes, we face a tremendous load of debt, and not only debt \nbut the interest payments on the debt. In 2 more years, we will be \npaying more interest on the national debt than we spend in the entire \ndefense budget of the United States of America. That seems \nincomprehensible, that just the interest on the national debt will be \nmore than we spend in defending the interests of this country \nworldwide. By the year 2000, the national debt will reach close to $7 \ntrillion. We must act now to balance the budget. We cannot continue to \nmortgage the future of the children of this country because we refuse \nto have the discipline to balance our budget.\n  Sadly, children who are born this year will end up paying just a \nlittle short of $200,000 in interest on the debt over their lifetime--\neach child. The figure, according to the statisticians is $187,150 of \ninterest that each child will have to pay on the national debt. It is \ntime for their individual futures and our national future to be saved. \nWe must act in the coming weeks and months.\n  Now, through shared sacrifice we can ensure that the coming \ngeneration of Americans will share in the abundant riches and \nopportunities of this country if we have the discipline to restrain the \ndebt. What is the proposal of the Republican Party? How would it affect \nAmerica, and how would it change Government therapeutically? How would \nit benefit us so we can do what we ought to do on behalf of the \nchildren of this country? What is our plan?\n  First, freeze congressional salaries, unless the budget is balanced \nby the year 2002.\n  Second, cut foreign aid.\n  Third, eliminate a number of unnecessary and duplicative programs. \nJust yesterday in the Foreign Relations Committee, there was a plan to \nconsolidate the voices of America, the different representations of \nthis country around the globe under the Secretary of State, saving \nalmost $5 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Abolishing nonessential governmental agencies. Democratic attacks \naside, our plan provides sufficient funds to maintain the health and \nintegrity of a whole range of important governmental services.\n  These figures are important because those who would be the speakers \nof fear and the sowers of discontent, and [[Page S6842]] would suggest \nthat our plan will not work, should understand that under the \nRepublican proposal, Medicare will increase by 59 percent over the 7-\nyear life of the plan--a 59-percent increase. Medicaid will rise at \nover 5 percent annually. And Social Security is totally untouched by \nthe program between the present and the year 2002. Spending on the \nSocial Security program is expected to increase by 43 percent, from \n$354 to $483.7 billion.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, the plan we will consider allows spending in \nall of Government to grow by an average of 3 percent annually, \nincreasing by over one-half trillion dollars over the next 7 years the \noverall spending of Government.\n  In this debate over the future of our country, I am reminded of the \nphilosopher's words: ``They sought to heal by incantations a cancer \nwhich requires the surgeon's knife.''\n  You cannot heal by just speaking words those things which require the \nsurgeon's knife. The truth of the matter is that we are in a condition \nin this country where the scalpel of surgery needs to be applied to the \ncancer of national irresponsibility. We need to have the scalpel of the \nsurgeon's knife cut out the unwanted and malignant growth which is \ntaking over and depriving us of the ability to make good decisions \nregarding the future of this country.\n  Mr. President, we are hearing all around us the familiar cries of the \ndiscredited and irresponsible philosophy. But we should not listen to \nthe cries of those who do not have the will, do not have the \ndedication, do not have the commitment, who, while they said we did not \nneed a balanced budget amendment, they now refuse to face up to the \nspecific personal responsibility to operate with fiscal integrity.\n  We were sent here by the American people with a demand and an \nexpectation. They demand that we make the tough decisions, the same \nkind of decisions that are made around every kitchen table in America. \nWhen you sit down to figure out what you can and cannot afford, you set \npriorities to guard the vital interests of the family and you do away \nwith those things that you can get by without. That is what the people \nsent us here to do. They demand that we stop business as usual in the \nU.S. Senate and that we embark upon something new and different for \nGovernment, and that is Government living within its means, Government \nthat understands that there are limits. The people want the hand of \nGovernment out of their pockets. They do not want a Government handout. \nThey expect us to listen and we ought to listen and we will listen.\n  Well, our budget plan goes a long way. It goes all the way to \nbalancing the budget on a controlled, understandable, doable, \nachievable plan by the year 2002. It is a plan that will not only \nbenefit the people today, but it will benefit the children. It will \nprovide for them the opportunity to enjoy the fruits of their labors, \nrather than just to try and retire a debt and pay interest for items \nthat we have consumed. It is an opportunity for Members of this \nCongress, it is an opportunity for Members of the U.S. Senate; but more \nthan an opportunity, it is a charge from the American public, and it is \na responsibility we have to the generations to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague, Senator Grams, from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if I may make an inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator yields the floor to the Presiding Officer, \nrather than to another Senator, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. But I see that my colleague has risen, and I look \nforward to his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor no more than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n                      freshman focus on the budget\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to begin debate on \nthe budget resolution for fiscal year 1996, I rise with my fellow \nfreshmen to offer our perspective on the challenge ahead.\n  Mr. President, the individual Members of this class of freshmen \nSenators--11 strong--do not have much seniority. We do not chair \npowerful committees. But we do have one thing it seems many of our \ncolleagues are missing--something far more valuable. We have the pulse \nof the people, and we always carry it.\n  We took the pulse ourselves, during our Senate campaigns last year. \nAt coffee shops, truck stops, town meetings, we heard from thousands of \naverage Americans. They talked about high taxes and excessive, wasteful \nGovernment spending. They talked about Social Security and Medicare, \nand wondered if it would still be around for them, their children, and \ngrandchildren.\n  We listened, and we promised them that if they sent us to the Senate, \nwe would fight to change things. We are deeply committed to change and \nto keeping our promises.\n  If life in the Senate sometimes reminds me of the barnyard \nconversation between the chicken and the pig, as they argued over which \none was more committed to the breakfast meal: ``I give eggs every \nmorning,'' the chicken said proudly. ``I'm committed.'' ``Giving eggs \nisn't a commitment, it's participation,'' snorted the pig. ``Giving \nham, now that's a commitment.''\n  Sadly, this body too often seems content to deliver eggs when the \npeople are demanding ham.\n  Mr. President, this freshmen class is committed to following through \non the promises we made last November. And for the next week, we'll be \nfocusing our attention on the Federal budget.\n  Year after year, when they ran things on Capitol Hill, the Democrats \noffered up budgets which raised taxes, sent Government spending \nspiraling out of control, and created massive deficits.\n  The voters soundly rejected that mentality in November. They looked \nto the Republicans for an alternative, for a budget that could turn \nback 40 years of spending mentality and the belief that money will fix \neverything, especially if it's your money and Washington can spend it.\n  Debate on our alternative begins today.\n  Whatever form it eventually takes, a budget resolution that is truly \nserious about America's financial future must accomplish three equally \nimportant goals:\n  We promised middle-class American families a budget that cuts taxes, \nand we will deliver.\n  We'll deliver for the Smith family, and the Johnsons and the Joneses, \naverage American families where both parents work, earn $48,270, and \ntake home $31,664, and end up sending $16,606 or more than a third of \ntheir paychecks, directly to the Government.\n  Families with children are now the lowest after-tax income group in \nAmerica, below elderly households, below single persons, below families \nwithout children.\n  As one person put it, those who say we do not need a tax cut, \nprobably do not pay taxes.\n  Mr. President, it has gotten so bad in my home State of Minnesota \nthat it took until last Sunday, 134 days into 1995, for my constituents \nto finally reach Tax Freedom Day, the day when they're no longer \nworking just to pay off taxes, and can finally begin working for \nthemselves. Nearly 20 weeks, over 800 hours on the job just to pay \nUncle Sam.\n  I applaud the distinguished chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nfor his courageous work on the budget resolution, but I part ways with \nhis blueprint when it comes to tax cuts. I say we had better find a way \nto help the Smiths, and the Johnsons, and the Joneses.\n  The chairman states: ``Balance must first be achieved by reducing the \nrate of growth in Federal spending before tax reductions could be \nconsidered.''\n  That is like holding the taxpayers' money hostage, like calling tax \ncuts a dessert that we will share with the American people only after \nthey have cleaned their plates. Anyone who thinks tax relief should be \nsaved for the dessert cart has not taken the pulse of the people \nlately.\n  Middle-class American families are paying the vast majority of taxes \nin this country, and they are fed up. They are working longer hours, \nsometimes even taking on a second job, just to [[Page S6843]] meet \ntheir annual tax obligations while trying to maintain their style of \nliving. They are still pursuing the American dream, but the ever-\nincreasing tax burden keeps pushing it out of reach.\n  The $500 per-child tax credit takes money out of the hands of the \nWashington bureaucrats and leaves it in the hands of the taxpayers.\n  It is truly a tax break for the middle class: nearly $9 out of every \n$10 of tax relief goes to families making $75,000 or less. They are the \nones who need our help the most, and we cannot ask them to wait another \n6 or 7 years.\n  Mr. President, I promised my constituents in Minnesota that tax \nrelief will be my top priority in the Senate, and during the next week, \nI will do just that.\n  The freshman class also promised American families that we would \nbalance the budget. With or without a balanced budget amendment, we \nwill deliver.\n  Now, my good friend, the Budget Committee chairman, and his \ncounterpart in the other Chamber, have crafted documents the naysayers \nsaid could never be achieved.\n  The budget resolution we begin debating today, that brings the budget \ninto balance by the year 2002, is proof that we are serious about \nliving up to our pledge. Having to live within its means will be a new \nexperience for a Congress that has only balanced its budget eight times \nin the past 64 years, and has not spent less than it has taken in since \n1969.\n  Even the Clinton administration, despite all its rhetoric about \nshrinking the deficit, has seemingly washed its hands of the deficit \nproblem.\n  Under the President's own budget plan, the deficit would increase \nfrom $177 billion this year to $276 billion in 2002, and add another \n$1.5 trillion to the national debt. Only Republicans have offered an \nalternative to this fiscal madness. And I hope my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle will find the courage to vote for a balanced \nbudget. We're offering a plan to balance the budget, and we have done \nit without slashing Federal spending, without putting children, \nseniors, and the disadvantaged at risk. Most of our savings are \nachieved by slowing the growth of Government. Will there need to be \nsome sacrifices? Yes, although the Government will have to sacrifice \nmore than the people will. Will belts need to be tightened? Yes. But if \nwe do not tighten the belts today, they are destined to become nooses \naround the necks of the coming generations, who will someday become the \ninnocent victims of our negligence. Mr. President, as Senate freshmen, \nmy colleagues and I heard it over and over during our campaigns: the \nAmerican people are willing to make those sacrifices, if they believe \ntheir Government is serious about making change.\n  This Congress is serious.\n  Finally, we promised that our budget will protect Medicare and Social \nSecurity. For the sake of America's senior citizens, we must protect, \npreserve, and improve Medicare, to make sure it is there for the next \ngeneration as well.\n  The fact is, Medicare is in trouble, in large part due to fraud, \nwaste, abuse, mismanagement and misuse. By 1997, Medicare will pay out \n$1 billion more in benefits than it collects in revenue, and 5 years \nlater, it will go bankrupt.\n  Again, in our budget plan, we are working to preserve, protect, and \nimprove the Medicare System. In fact, Medicare will remain the fastest \ngrowing program in the Federal budget.\n  Over the next 7 years, we will spend $1.7 trillion to keep Medicare a \nhealthy and viable health care provider for this generation of senior \ncitizens.\n  Social Security must receive the same care, although as a self-funded \nentity it will be taken off budget and dealt with separately from other \nprograms.\n  Clearly, the Government must honor its contract with our senior \ncitizens, and the budget that Congress produces this year must ensure \nthat the Social Security Program will survive and be there for older \nAmericans. The best way to achieve that is to bring the Federal budget \ninto balance.\n  A budget that works for America will meet the needs of all our \ncitizens, working men and women and their children, senior citizens, \nand the disadvantaged, while providing middle-class tax relief, \nbalancing the budget by the year 2002, and protecting Social Security \nand Medicare.\n  Mr. President, that is what we promised the people, and our promises \nwere not made lightly. I remember hearing about a commencement speech \ngiven by Winston Churchill toward the end of his life. He sat patiently \nthrough the introduction, rose, and went to the podium. All he said was \n``Never, never, never give up.'' Then he sat back down.\n  Mr. President, this committed class of freshmen Senators has taken \nthe pulse of the people, and we are not planning to give up on the \nambitious agenda they sent us here to carry out.\n  Like the latest chapter in the ``Die Hard'' movie trilogy, we will be \nhere--with a vengeance--to remind our colleagues just what America's \nmessage last November was all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, before addressing the matter that brings \nme to the floor, may I congratulate the Senator from Minnesota for the \nvery forceful and, I hope, prophetic statement. The concerns that he \nhas raised are real. They have been addressed without large consequence \nin this Chamber for some 15 years now, as I can attest. And I for one, \nand I think many others, welcome the energy and conviction, the \ncommitment of the freshman class, as he chooses to describe it, that \ncame to the Senate in January. I look forward to working with him in \nthe years ahead--months ahead--weeks ahead, to be specific.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Moynihan pertaining to the introduction of \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Senator from North \nDakota is recognized to speak for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Thank you very much. It is my intention to speak for a \ncouple of minutes at the beginning and then to yield the remainder of \nthe time to Senator Akaka from Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6839-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6843-S6844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE BUDGET DEBATE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we will begin in a matter of a couple of \nhours the debate on the budget resolution.\n  I do not want anyone to despair about the disagreement that will \nexist on the floors of the Senate and the House on the budget. The \ndisagreement that exists ought not to be a cause for despair, because \nthere is not any disagreement about the destination. We all believe \nthat the budget ought to be balanced. We believe it ought to be \nbalanced by the year 2002, and I am prepared to support that and vote \nfor that.\n  There is a vast disagreement, however, on priorities: How do you get \nfrom here to there? If we agree on the destination, there is certainly \ndisagreement on the routes. How do you achieve a balanced budget? This \nis the time and this is the place to have a vibrant and healthy debate \nabout priorities.\n  Now, I expect there will be some skepticism about statements from \nthose of us on this side of the aisle, so I want to today, as we begin \nthe discussion, quote from a Republican political analyst, author, and \ncommentator, Kevin Phillips. This is not from a Democrat. Here is what \nKevin Phillips says about the budget that is going to be brought to the \nfloor by the Republicans.\n  ``Anybody who thought the greed decade ended several years ago,'' Mr. \nPhillips says, ``hasn't yet had time to study the new balanced budget \nproposals put forward by the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House.'' He said \nit is ``special interest favoritism and income redistribution. Spending \non Government programs, from Medicare and education to home heating oil \nassistance, is to be reduced in ways that principally burden the poor \nand the middle class while simultaneously taxes are to be cut in ways \nthat predominantly benefit the top 1 or 2 percent of Americans.''\n  Again, this is a conservative commentator writing that fiscal \nfavoritism and finagling is what is involved here. If it was not that, \nhe said, ``we'd be talking about shared sacrifice, with business, Wall \nStreet and the rich, the people who have big money, making the biggest \nsacrifice.'' But Kevin Phillips says:\n\n\n[[Page S6844]]\n\n       Instead, it's senior citizens, the poor, students and \n     ordinary Americans who'll see programs they depend on gutted, \n     while business, finance and the richest 1 or 2 percent, far \n     from making sacrifices, actually get new benefits and new tax \n     reductions.\n\n  He says:\n\n       In short, aid to dependent grandmothers, children, college \n     students and city dwellers is to be slashed, while aid to \n     dependent corporations, stockbrokers, generals and assorted \n     James Bond imitators survives and even grows. And if the \n     deficit is substantially reduced under a program like this, \n     there'll be a second stage of further upward income \n     redistribution from upper bracket profits in the stock and \n     bond markets.\n\n  Again, Kevin Phillips, a Republican says:\n\n       If the U.S. budget deficit problem does represent the \n     fiscal equivalent of war--and maybe it does--then what we are \n     really looking at is one of the most flagrant examples of war \n     profiteering this century has seen.\n\n  Mr. President, the debate will be about priorities. We ought to \nbalance the budget, we ought to do it by the year 2002, but there are a \nlot of ways to get to that destination. You do not have to run down the \nroad and stop and pick up a few dollars from those who cannot afford it \nand then make another stop and give to those who have a substantial \namount already. That is the purpose of, I think, the discussion of the \nSenator from Hawaii.\n  We are talking about the Republican party that brings a budget to the \nfloor and gives very big tax cuts for the wealthy and takes it from \nthings that are important--kids who go to school, working families and \nthe elderly. We think that these priorities are not in step or keeping \nwith the best interests of this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nHawaii, Senator Akaka.\n  Mr. AKAKA addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to say good morning to my friend who \nis now presiding, Senator Inhofe, from Oklahoma, and wish him a good \nday.\n  I am here to express some of my concerns about some parts of the \nbudget, and particularly Medicare and Veterans' Administration health \ncare programs.\n  Mr. President, earlier this week the Republican-controlled Budget \nCommittees unveiled their 7-year budget resolutions. The House \nresolution provides a generous tax cut for wealthy Americans. The \nSenate resolution would allow not one, but two tax cut proposals. The \nfirst would be $170 billion in tax cuts once the Congressional Budget \nOffice certifies that the savings from cutting Medicare, education, VA \nhealth care, and the other programs targeted for reductions are, in \nfact, achieved.\n  Further tax cuts would be permitted if the budget is reduced by an \namount that is greater than the reductions already proposed by the \nSenate budget resolution. We can clearly see that Republicans in the \nHouse and Senate have laid the foundation for implementing the tax \nproposals outlined in the Contract With America. To pay for their tax \ncuts they must reduce programs that help working families and the \nelderly.\n  The Senate budget resolution proposes a $256 billion cut in Medicare \nspending over 7 years, but provides no guidelines on how these savings \nwill be achieved. This will be the largest Medicare cut in history, and \nthe impact on beneficiaries and providers will be very painful.\n  If Medicare cuts of this magnitude are approved, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services estimates that senior citizen's out-of-pocket \nexpenses will increase by $900 a year, or a total of $3,500 over the 7 \nyears. Eighty-three percent of Medicare benefits go to beneficiaries \nwith incomes under $25,000.\n  It is obvious who will be hurt by these cuts. Our Nation's low-income \nelderly, who can least afford it, will bear the brunt of the Medicare \ncuts.\n  In addition, cuts to providers will have serious ramifications on \nhealth care costs since they are passed along to other health care \nconsumers. Provider cuts could have a devastating impact on urban \nhospitals which already bear a disproportionate share of the Nation's \ngrowing burden of uncompensated care. Reductions in Medicare payments \nwill also endanger access to care in rural areas. Nearly 10 million \nMedicare beneficiaries--25 percent of the total Medicare population--\nlive in rural areas. There is often only a single hospital in their \ncounty. Significant cuts in Medicare may force rural hospitals to close \nor cause more providers to refuse to treat Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The Senate Budget Committee was given the opportunity to restore the \ncuts in Medicare funding. Two amendments were offered to scrap the tax \ncut for the rich in order to fund Medicare. Unfortunately, they were \nrejected on party-line\n votes. This massive cut in Medicare funding would not be necessary if \nthe majority abandoned their tax cut for the wealthy.\n\n  Under the Republican plan, the wealthy will gain while our elderly \npopulation suffers more pain. Instead of cutting Medicare, we must work \nto ensure that any effort to maintain the solvency of the Medicare \ntrust fund does not put Medicare beneficiaries at risk. And, we must \nprotect the program for future enrollees. This problem can and should \nbe solved in the context of health care reform.\n  I recognize the critical need to ensure long-term stability in the \nMedicare Program and I support efforts to balance our budget. However, \nI am opposed to arbitrarily cutting Medicare to finance a tax break for \nwealthy Americans. I look forward to working with my colleagues on \naddressing these important issues.\n  Just as health care benefits are being cut for our senior citizens \ndependent on Medicare, the freeze proposed on veterans health care \nprograms would be equally devastating for our elderly veterans.\n  At first glance, the majority budget seems to have little impact on \nveterans health care programs. The chairman's mark shields the Veterans \nHealth Administration from cuts, and freezes funding at the 1995 level. \nHowever, if you examine the long-term impact of the proposal, you find \nthat the proposed freeze will have a debilitating effect on health care \nprovided to our Nation's veterans.\n  The budget resolution contains only half of the annual cost-of-living \nadjustments [COLA], so the Veterans' Administration must absorb the \nremainder of the increase from a budget that is already being held \nflat. This will mean that fewer resources will be available to veterans \nseeking access to veteran health care programs.\n  In fiscal year 1996, the majority's proposal will cut $640 million \nfrom the Veterans Health Administration's budget compared to the \nPresident's budget request. The options to cope with this cut include \nthe elimination of 8,200 health care providers and support staff or \nclosing Veterans Administration Medical Centers [VAMC] to achieve a \ntotal reduction of 1,500 patient beds. In terms of direct care \nservices, 57,000 inpatient and 1,300,000 outpatient visits for 142,000 \npatients would be foregone in fiscal year 1996 under the Republican \nproposal.\n  Under their proposal, by the year 2002, 53,000 full-time-equivalent \npositions would be eliminated or 35 Veterans' Administration medical \ncenters would have to be closed. Over a 7-year period, one-fourth of \nthe current medical care positions would have to be eliminated and 35 \nof the 159 Veterans' Administration medical centers currently serving \nveterans across the country would be closed if the Republican proposal \nis implemented.\n  Health care facilities and personnel are not the only areas which \nwill be affected by the majority's proposal. Medical research within \nthe Veterans' Administration would also be frozen at the fiscal year \n1995 appropriation level. This will significantly impact the \nspecialized services the Veterans' Administration provides, including \nspinal cord and prosthetics research. In fiscal year 1996, over 150 \nprojects would have to be terminated to meet the budget constraints \nimposed by the majority.\n  The cumulative impact for Veterans Health Administration services \nover 7 years would decimate the Veterans' Administration health care \nsystem as we know it. By the year 2002, the Veterans Health \nAdministration budget would have lost $20.6 billion over 7 years. Over \n1.5 million inpatient and 34 [[Page S6845]] million outpatient visits \nfor 3.7 million patients would have been denied under the majority's \nbudget blueprint, and we will have turned our backs on the majority of \nthose who so valiantly served this Nation.\n  Mr. President, this has been our findings in reading through the \nbudget proposal that will be presented today to the Senate. The \nmajority's budget proposals for cuts to Medicare and freezing Veterans' \nAdministration health care programs are simply, in my eyes and in my \nheart, unacceptable. You cannot single out health care for one segment \nof the population for cuts without serious consequences. The senior \ncitizens of today, the veterans of today, should not have the rugs \npulled out from under them. So, therefore, I urge my colleagues to \nreject these unwise proposals.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6844-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        IS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

PATRICK W. DRENNON, CEC, USN\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, it has come to my attention that Rear Adm. \nPatrick W. Drennon will be retiring from the Navy after some 33 years \nof honorable and distinguished service.\n  He most recently served as the Director, Facilities and Engineering \nDivision (N44) for the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Logistics), \nWashington, DC. In this capacity he has provided timely support and \naccurate information on Navy facility and engineering plans and \nprograms to the Members of the Senate and our professional and personal \nstaffs.\n  Admiral Drennon was previously the Commander of Western Division, \nNaval Facilities Engineering Command [NAVFACENGCOM], headquartered in \nSan Bruno, CA. This was following duty as Deputy Commander for Planning \nand Assistant Commander for Facilities and Real Estate at NAVFACENGCOM \nHeadquarters in Alexandria, VA, and as Assistant for Civil Engineering \n(OP-04E) to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Logistics), \nWashington, DC.\n  His other duty assignments have included: Assistant Resident Officer \nin Charge of Construction in Key West, FL; Public Works Officer at the \nNaval Facility and the Navy Representative for Construction while on \nthe staff of the Commander, U.S. Forces in the Azores; Operations \nOfficer of Naval Mobile Construction Battalion One on two deployments \nto Vietnam; an instructor at the Civil Engineer Corps Officers School \nat Port Hueneme, CA; and an Exchange Officer with the Mediterranean \nDivision, Corps of Engineers, Livorno, Italy. While working with the \nCorps' Mediterranean Division, he served as the program manager for the \nplanning and design of King Khalid Military City, Saudi Arabia.\n  Admiral Drennon also served in the Seabee Division, NAVFACENGCOM \nHeadquarters; on the staff of the then-Director, Shore Activities \nPlanning and Programming Division (OP-44) for the Chief of Naval \nOperations, Washington, DC; and as the Executive Officer of the Public \nWorks Center and Resident Officer in Charge of Construction in San \nDiego, CA.\n  His awards include the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star with Combat ``V'' \nand a Gold Star, the Meritorious Service Medal with a Gold Star, and \nthe Navy Achievement Medal.\n  Rear Admiral Drennon has become widely acknowledged as a leader and \nvisionary in the Civil Engineer Corps. As a fellow\n Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket, I can say that this is no real surprise as \nRear Admiral Dennon began his distinguished naval career upon his \ncommissioning out of the NROTC Program at the Georgia Institute of \nTechnology.\n\n  Mr. President, over the past several years many communities have \nexperienced great anxiety and turmoil as a result of the Department of \nDefense's base closure process. Rear Admiral Drennon has played a vital \nrole in promoting effective communications and harmonious working \nrelationships in the Navy's base realignment and closure implementation \nprocess. He has assisted local civic leaders throughout the country in \nworking through many challenging situations associated with base \nclosure and realignment actions. Rear Admiral Drennon has been equally \nrecognized and appreciated by all who have come to know him.\n  A man of Rear Admiral Drennon's talent and integrity is rare indeed, \nand while his honorable service will be genuinely missed, it gives me \ngreat pleasure today to recognize him before my colleagues and to wish \nhim, his wife, Cheryl, and his family every success as he brings to a \nclose a long and distinguished career in the U.S. Navy.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6845-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6845-S6846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TEXAS ACTS ON FLAG DESECRATION\n\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, there is broad consensus in this country \nthat the current welfare system serves no one well--not the recipients, \nnot their children, not the American taxpayer. I agree with that \nconsensus. The current welfare system is broken and needs major repair. \nWhy? Because it is failing both the people in need and the working \npeople who are paying for it.\n  The current system has trapped all too many people into a lifetime of \ndependency rather than assisting them on a temporary basis to get back \non their feet and back into the labor force. Any meaningful welfare \nreform must be grounded on the premise that government assistance is a \nway ``up and out''--not a ``way of life.''\n  The current welfare system has failed us all. It traps all too many, \nespecially women, into a lifetime of dependency and poverty. Their \nchildren in all too many instances suffer irreparable harm and are \nlikely to remain poor and disadvantaged for the remainder of their \nlives. If the past is a predictor, too many children of today's welfare \nrecipients will end up on the rolls themselves or in trouble with the \nlaw.\n  We simply must break this cycle. Unless we move welfare recipients \ninto meaningful educational and work situations, we are doomed to \nfailure. The only system that can work to the benefit of all is one \nthat encourages independence, discourages dependency and demands \npersonal responsibility. All of those elements, it seems to me, are \nmissing in the welfare program we have today. Let us make sure that \nthose key elements are the underpinnings of the bill on which we will \ncast our votes. Let us make sure we do it right. And let us make sure \nwe do it with great care and compassion.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that Republicans and Democrats alike can \nwork together to fashion a bipartisan welfare plan that will be both \neffective in moving recipients from welfare to work. Our welfare system \nshould provide temporary help--an opportunity for people to help \nthemselves. If we put aside partisan rhetoric and turn instead to the \nmission of protecting poor kids and helping adults who need a temporary \nhelping hand, I think we will have the best opportunity we have had in \nmany years to forge a reform package which is good for kids, good for \ntheir parents and good for the American taxpayer.\n  Before we begin the debate, I think it is important to dispel some of \nthe myths surrounding welfare. My purpose in detailing the following \nfacts is not to defend the current system, but to ground the debate in \ntruth rather than fiction.\n  First, AFDC caseloads as a percentage of the general population have \nremained fairly static over the past 20 years, fluctuating between 4 \nand 5\\1/2\\ percent. The number of recipients has grown as the \npopulation has increased and, cyclically, when the economy has \ndeclined.\n  Second, benefit levels have substantially declined in inflation \nadjusted dollars over the past two decades. The median State benefit \nfor a family of three, adjusted for inflation, fell by 47 percent \nbetween 1970 and 1994.\n  Third, AFDC does not come close to providing a poverty level income \nto recipients. The median State benefit for a family of three was only \n38 percent of the poverty level in 1994. If food stamps are included, \nthe median State benefit only reaches 70 percent of the poverty level.\n  Fourth, the average size of the welfare family is 2.9 while the \naverage size of the typical American family is 3.2.\n  As legislators, we must craft a welfare reform bill that helps rather \nthan hinders hope and self-sufficiency, especially for poor mothers and \ntheir children. And I know we can achieve our goals if we join together \nin a collaborative effort to accomplish them.\n  Mr. President, since there is no Democratic or Republican welfare \nbill around which the Senate membership of either party has currently \ncoalesced, I thought this would be an appropriate time to offer some \nsuggestions.\n\n\n                        IT MUST PROTECT CHILDREN\n\n  Protecting the vulnerable children of poor welfare mothers must be \nour highest priority, and I do not believe that can be accomplished \nwithout maintaining the entitlement status of benefits for children. \nLet me make it clear, I am not talking about entitlement status for the \nmother, only the child. Despite the best intentions of State \ngovernments, despite their basic goodwill, despite their legislative \nskills, there is no way the Federal Government can guarantee that the \nwelfare child will be protected by each and every State under a with a \nno-strings-attached block grant approach to reform. And protecting poor \nchildren is something I believe the Federal Government must do. It is \nand ought to be a national priority. I am not simply not willing to \ntake the gamble that each and every State government will successfully \nmeet this most fundamental responsibility.\n  I am all for giving State governments as much flexibility as possible \nin designing effective State reform plans that fit local needs. I am \nall for encouraging States to tap every creative resource available in \nforging new approaches to reform. But let us be honest with one \nanother, welfare varies widely from State to State. Benefit levels vary \nwidely. Effectiveness varies widely. Successful job training and \nplacement efforts vary widely. And I am simply not willing to sacrifice \nany child, in any State, to a potentially unsuccessful outcome. These \nkids are our future. We must protect their interests.\n\n\n               IT MUST BE WORK-ORIENTED AND TRANSITIONAL\n\n  After the protection of children, the fundamental focus of the bill \nmust be to move recipients from welfare, to work, to economic self-\nsufficiency as quickly as possible. While the original goal of AFDC in \n1935 was to pay widows to stay at home and raise their children, the \nworld and workforce have changed a great deal over the intervening \ndecades. Increasingly, we expect both parents to work to support their \nchildren. We also expect both parents to share the responsibility of \nrearing their children. No one denies the difficulties involved in this \ndual role for parents. But it is done every day by millions upon \nmillions of struggling [[Page S6847]] families. Is it any wonder, then, \nwhy the general public expects the same from welfare recipients?\n  Today 75 percent of mothers with children between the ages of 6 to 16 \nare in the labor force. The public expects no less from the welfare \nmother. And they are right. So it is critically important that welfare \nbe re-framed, in the minds of both the public and recipients alike, as \na transitional work assistance program. Our goal must be to replace a \nwelfare check with a paycheck. No more something for nothing. No more \nrevolving door. Strict work requirements, and a time limit on benefits. \nYou take responsibility for yourself and the government will provide \nyou with temporary help to ease your entry into the workforce and to \nhelp you stay there.\n  Easier said than done. No doubt about it. But if we can change the \nperception of welfare and build upon the lessons learned over the \nyears, at both the State and Federal levels, we should be able to move \nforward in a constructive way.\n  Most people on the welfare rolls do not want to be there. They want \nto work. They want to be role models for their children. They want \ntheir children to have better opportunities in life than they have had. \nBut, like the workforce in general, many welfare recipients need some \nhelp. They want to work, they want to be successful, but they need help \nin getting from here to there. Many need help in learning how to look \nfor a job. Others need training. Others need assistance to remain in \nthe labor force. But let us face up to the fact that there may not be \nenough jobs or the types of jobs available in the private sector to \naccommodate each and every welfare parent, so community service jobs \nmay have to act as a last resort. And let us admit that reforming the \nsystem may require some investment if we want to get it right.\n\n\n                  WE MUST ELIMINATE WORK DISINCENTIVES\n\n  But how do we move from a program which encourages dependency to one \nthat encourages work? One obvious way is to eliminate the disincentives \nwhich exist in the current system. You liberalize earning disregards, \nyou raise asset limitations, and you make support services, the \nlinchpin upon which success in the workplace hinges, more readily \navailable to poor people who want to work.\n  One decisive lesson we have learned over the past decade is that \nformer recipients return to the welfare rolls after a short time in the \nlabor force due to the inadequacy of transitional support services. We \nhave learned that as soon as the recipient has to begin paying for \nchild care and medical care out of a meager salary which more often \nthan not is significantly below the Federal poverty level, the \nfinancial burden becomes too great and--no surprise--the mother returns \nto the welfare rolls. We must address this problem squarely. Forcing \npoor parents to choose between work and their children's health care or \nchild care is a losing proposition and it is doomed to failure. Who \nloses? The parent, the child and the taxpayer. So meaningful work is \nimportant, but equally important is the continued provision of child \ncare and health care services as these welfare recipients transition to \nthe workplace. These services are a critical bridge to successful work \noutcomes.\n  Is 1 year of transitional assistance for those who have gone to work, \nas required under current law for Medicaid services, sufficient? \nProbably not. Should child care support end as soon as a recipient has \nfound work. Clearly not. Child care consumes at least a quarter of most \nlow-income family budgets. How many low-skilled workers in low-paying \njobs are going to receive a raise in 1 year sufficient to be able to \nfinancially absorb the full cost of child care and medical care? Not \nmany, if any. This is simply not a realistic goal. I therefore believe \nthat the plan we pass should continue these vital family support \nservices at a reduced level over a number of years, phasing them out as \nthe recipient's income rises. This will cost money in the short term, \nbut it will be invaluable in ensuring long-term success. But it is my \nhope that savings to offset this spending can be achieved through other \nreforms in the system.\n\n\n             WE MUST REMOVE TWO-PARENT FAMILY DISINCENTIVES\n\n  One issue on which I believe there is virtual unanimity is that the \nbest environment in which to raise children is in loving, two-parent \nfamilies. Yet welfare assistance is not available for two-parent \nfamilies, regardless of their income, unless one parent is unemployed \nor incapacitated. A system that discourages marriage of low-income \nsingle parents and encourages the breakup of married couples who find \nthemselves in economic need is shameful. It is bad social policy, bad \nwelfare policy, bad family policy, bad children's policy, and it ought \nto be changed. Another thing we ought to change is our policy toward \nabsent fathers who want to share in the support of their children, but \ndo not have the economic means to do so. Why not offer them job \ntraining and placement services as well as the mother?\n\n\n                 IT MUST DEMAND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n  I believe it is the best interest of society to discourage out-of-\nwedlock births. But if individuals continue to choose to have children \noutside of marriage, they must take responsibility for their actions. \nIt is their responsibility to support their child. They must learn that \nactions have consequences and parents have responsibilities. If they \nwant temporary assistance, it is their responsibility to identify the \nfather who must be required to share, at the very least, in the \nfinancial burden of raising the child. If they seek temporary \ngovernment help, they must be willing to go to work to help pay for \nthat assistance.\n  Most welfare proposals contain a requirement for the welfare parent \nto sign a contract with the State agency agreeing to abide by the work \nplan that has been designed for the recipient, with the recipient's \ninput, after careful assessment by a team of case managers of the \nindividual's personal history, work experience and educational and \ntraining needs. Once the contract has been signed, the recipient must \nhonor its terms or suffer sanctions. Actions have consequences. That \nmakes eminent good sense to me. It demands accountability and \nresponsibility.\n\n\n          IT MUST ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE TEEN PREGNANCY CRISIS\n\n  Although last on my list, curbing teen pregnancy is one of my highest \npriorities. And it is one of the most crucial yet vexing components of \nwelfare reform. Teen pregnancy is a crisis by any standard of \nmeasurement. Too many teens are becoming parents and too few are able \nto responsibly care for their children either emotionally or \nfinancially. The result: the child is deprived of a fair start in life \nand the mother will very likely be doomed to a lifetime of poverty.\n  The teen pregnancy crisis is escalating at an alarming rate. The data \nare shattering: Before age 20, 43 percent of teenage girls become \npregnant; 1 million teens become pregnant each year; 70 percent of teen \nmothers are not married today in comparison to 15 percent in 1960; the \nunmarried teen mother rate has doubled in a single generation and \ncontinues to climb; 77 percent of unmarried teen mothers end up on the \nwelfare rolls within 5 years of the birth of their first child, and all \ntoo many remain there for years thereafter; and approximately half of \nAFDC recipients in 1993 had their first child as a teen.\n  What can we reasonably do about this seriously escalating social \ncrisis? There is clear data linking teen births with long-term welfare \ndependency. Data also tell us that teen births go down as educational \nand economic options go up. So one thing we must do is require AFDC \nteen mothers to stay in school and finish their educations or pursue a \nvocational alternative in return for benefits. We can and must insist \nthat these teen mothers immunize their children and participate in \nparenting and pregnancy prevention classes. And we can and should \nrequire that teen mothers on AFDC live with their families or in \nsupervised homes where they can get the support and guidance they need \nto become successful parents and good citizens. Finally, we must all \nbecome engaged in finding solutions to this devastating societal \nproblem.\n  Each of us in one way or another has the bully pulpit. Every entity \nof government, every community, every church, every corporation must \ntrumpet the alarm about teen pregnancy, and we must speak with a single \nvoice: out of wedlock births, especially [[Page S6848]] among teens, \nare wrong; they are a prescription for disastrous outcomes for both the \nmother and the child--both will undoubtedly be seriously disadvantaged \nfor the remainder of their lives. We must preach--and I do mean \npreach--that marriage is the proper social unit in which to have and \nraise a child. We must, each of us, discourage illegitimacy as harmful \nto the parents, the child and society at large. And we must do it now. \nThis is not an issue we can push to the back burner. We are in a \nserious crisis now, and every single indicator points to it getting \nworse each and every year into the foreseeable future.\n  These are some of the threshold issues that I believe must be \naddressed in whatever reform package reaches the Senate floor. When the \ndebate begins, I hope it will not become another missed opportunity. I \nhope we will work on the reform together. I hope we will do it right, \nwith firmness but fairness. And I hope it will produce the desired \nresults. Our efforts will impact all of our lives in one way or \nanother. But it will affect more directly the lives of our children and \ntheir children.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6846-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            WELCOMING HER MAJESTY QUEEN SIRIKIT OF THAILAND\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, this month the United States is \nprivileged to welcome Her Majesty Queen Sirikit of Thailand. She is \nhere as an honored guest. On May 25 Queen Sirikit will be awarded the \ndegree of Doctor of Humane Letters by the Johns Hopkins University. On \nTuesday, May 16, Queen Sirikit became the first woman ever to receive \nthe prestigious Lindbergh Award. In the words of the Charles A. and \nAnne Morrow Lindbergh Foundation, Her Majesty was honored for her \n``educational and humanitarian efforts, her conservation and wildlife \npreservation work, and programs which are maintaining the Thai heritage \nand culture.''\n  The description does not begin to do justice to Queen Sirikit's 45-\nyear effort to care for the people of her country, to improve their \nhealth and living standards, and to preserve their environmental and \ncultural heritage. She has given generously of her time and energy to \ntraditional humanitarian causes. She has served as honorary president \nof the Council of Social Welfare of Thailand, an organization of 150 \npublic and private social work agencies. In her capacity as president \nof the Thai Red Cross, a position she has held since 1956, she \nestablished shelters for refugees from the war in Cambodia. But her \nparticular genius, and I do not use that word lightly, the \naccomplishment for which the queen has been honored by the United \nNations and for which she was awarded the first International \nHumanitarian Award by the Friends of the Capital Children's Museum in \n1992, has been in finding ways to preserve traditional Thai culture and \necology while simultaneously making life easier for impoverished \nfarmers and hill tribes.\n  Her deep concern for the welfare of the Thai people is matched by her \nknowledge of their needs. Her husband, His Majesty King Shumibol \nAdulyadej, has made it his admirable policy to ``visit the people'', \nspending more than half of each year traveling around Thailand, often \nto remote areas accessible only by helicopter or jeep. Accompanying him \non his trips, the queen witnessed at first hand the hardships of rural \nlife, the damage to forests, wildlife and water supplies caused by \nprimitive farming practices and the threat posed by modernization to \ntraditional Thai arts and crafts. It was her inspiration to, in effect, \ncapitalize culture, to train farm families in producing handicrafts \nwhich could be sold to bring in regular income. Since 1978, Queen \nSirikit's SUPPORT Foundation has trained 30,000 such families in crafts \nranging from ceramics to silk-weaving to bamboo basketry.\n  In 1982, the Queen initiated the Forest-Loves-Water project, to \ndemonstrate that SUPPORT handicrafts projects could encourage \nreforestation. At Ban Mae Tam village, the rich teak forests once \nthreatened by illegal logging are being replaced. Villagers able to \nearn a living from cottage industries do not need to rely on tree-\ncutting or slash-and-burn farming for subsistence. Under her gentle \nleadership, through encouragement and practical training, solutions are \nbeing found to pressing environmental problems.\n  Queen Sirikit's likeness is on the Cares Medal awarded by the Food \nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. This is an honor \nreserved for women who by their lives and their work have helped to \nlift the status of women. It is a beautiful medal, reflecting the \nbeauty of spirit of its model, a woman whose motto has always been ``To \ngive without discrimination.'' It is always a pleasure to welcome Her \nMajesty to the United States, and to tell her how much we admire her \nefforts on behalf of the Thai people.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6848-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6848-S6849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        GEORGIA AND LARRY TALSMA\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, this week I have been fortunate to visit \nwith two citizens from Springfield, SD--Georgia and Larry Talsma. \nGeorgia and Larry made their first trip ever to Washington, DC, by car. \nThe Talsmas are the quintessential hard-working South Dakota ranch \nfamily. They and their ancestors have worked the land for five \ngenerations. They know the importance of proper stewardship of the \nland, because without this respect there would be nothing for the next \ngeneration.\n  The Talsmas came to Washington to tell their story of how the Federal \nGovernment is intruding on their land and threatening to take over \ntheir private property. Amazing as this may sound, Mr. President, it is \ntrue.\n  In 1991, Congress passed legislation to designate the 39-mile segment \nof the Missouri River from the headwaters of Lewis and Clark Lake to \nthe Ft. Randall Dam as a recreational river to be administered by the \nNational Park Service. Today, however, the process to achieve this \ndesignation has raised great controversy. In fact, the local citizens \nalong this segment of the Missouri River now question the need for the \ndesignation. I agree with those South Dakotans, including the Talsmas.\n  During the first public meeting on the designation, pamphlets were \nhanded out describing how the Park Service acquires private property. \nMr. President, most, if not all, of the South Dakotans in attendance \nwere not even aware of the river designation, let alone the possibility \nof the Federal Government condemning their land and buying it out from \nunder them.\n  Their concerns and fears were fed by representatives of the National \nPark Service who stated that if they, the Park Service, cannot own this \nland, then they will control it.\n  This morning I asked the Director of the National Park Service to \ncome to my office and listen to the Talsmas. At that meeting I told the \nDirector that I intended to introduce legislation to undo the \ndesignation in South Dakota. This is an effort the Talsmas and other \nSouth Dakotans strongly support.\n  I also asked the Director to listen to the Talsmas and see what steps \ncould be taken by the Park Service to address the needs of South \nDakotans. While Director Kennedy informed the Talsmas that the Park \nService did not want to buy or control their land or claim eminent \ndomain, the Talsmas correctly pointed out that the ``Devil is in the \ndetails.''\n  The Talsmas informed the Director they were being told just the \nopposite at the\n public meetings and that is why they felt they had to come to \nWashington to get their message across. Their primary concern is not \nfor themselves, but for their children and future generations of South \nDakotans who depend on the land for their survival.\n\n  I am pleased to report that due to the efforts of the Talsmas, \nsomething good came out of the meeting. First, the Park Service agreed \nto push back the deadline for a preferred alternative to no earlier \nthan August 1, 1995. Just a few days ago the Talsmas were told they had \nonly 5 days to review and comment on the preferred alternatives. This \nextreme time limit simply is not fair. I told the Director that South \nDakotans needed the time to tell their story and have input into the \ndecisionmaking process. Director Kennedy agreed.\n  Director Kennedy also assured the Talsmas there would be at least a \n60-day comment period on any preferred alternative. If more time is \nneeded, Director Kennedy said he would be willing to provide such time.\n  Director Kennedy also told me his office would provide legislative \nlanguage [[Page S6849]] to me that would assure local control over the \nriver. I look forward to reviewing the language and if appropriate will \npush for its immediate approval by the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I will continue to work with Georgia and Larry Talsma \nand other South Dakota landowners to see that their property and their \nrights are fully protected, and are not overrun by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Federal policy is moving ever closer toward infringement of \nindividual private property rights. One of America's founding \nprinciples is the right of citizens to own private property. These \nrights must be closely guarded.\n  Mr. President, I am proud South Dakota has citizens such as Georgia \nand Larry Talsma. Their determination, and hard work actually moved \nWashington to action. They had to take time off their ranching chores \nand drive all the way to Washington to move a bureaucratic mountain. I \nam please they achieved progress.\n  I am proud of the Talsmas and what they have accomplished. They are \nto be commended. Their battle is not over yet, but Mr. President, their \naction is proof that this is a government of and for the people.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in less than an hour, the Senate will \nbegin a truly historic debate on a budget resolution reported by the \nSenate Budget Committee. It is a budget resolution which, for the first \ntime, perhaps, since the Budget Act was passed a quarter of a century \nago, seriously proposes to put this Nation on the road to a balanced \nFederal budget.\n  Mr. President, lip service has been promised to that goal by many of \nthose who voted against a constitutional amendment to require a \nbalanced budget, as well as by those who voted for that budget. Most of \nthe former group, however, now find something wrong with this proposal, \njust as they have with any preceding attempts to balance the budget. In \ntheory, they are in favor of reaching that goal, but in practice they \nhave never actually seen the way in which it ought to be reached.\n  Perhaps the best evidence of this proposition, Mr. President, is that \nwhile the minority party in this body is almost--I say almost, not \nquite--without exception opposed to the budget resolution that is \nbefore us, that same minority party in the House of Representatives is \nputting up as an alternative essentially the Senate budget resolution \nand praising it as much superior to the one that will actually pass the \nHouse of Representatives. I think they do that with full confidence \nthat the proposal will not pass, that the alternative will not pass in \nthe House, and it is therefore safe for them to praise it and, in some \ncases, to vote in favor of it.\n  This balanced budget here in the Senate, together with the one in the \nHouse, will have tremendous positive impacts on the American people. It \nwill result in a significantly greater increase in family income all \nacross this country because of lower interest rates and greater job \nopportunities. And those positive impacts will vastly overshadow any \ntemporary negative impacts of the loss of various Federal subsidies.\n  Before we begin that formal debate, I want to make a few remarks \nabout the downpayment on a balanced budget, the rescissions bill, which \nis about to go to the President of the United States and which the \nPresident announced yesterday that he intended to veto.\n  This rescissions bill--this cancellation of some of the spending \nproposed by the last Congress--amounts to about 1 percent of the \ncurrent year's budget. Yet, to reduce spending this year by 1 percent \nseems much too drastic a step for this administration to be willing to \ntake. This bill started as a request by the President to spend more \nmoney, some for the Department of Defense, essentially to cover the \ncosts of various, dubious peacekeeping missions around the world which \nwas passed as part of a separate bill, and others to spend money on \nvarious natural disasters which the President improvidently had refused \nto include in the budget passed less than a year ago, in spite of the \nfact that these disasters are always with us, together with a few \nmodest reductions in a handful of programs.\n  The House of Representatives took the bit in its teeth and came up \nwith a cancellation of something more than $17 billion in current \nspending, about 1 percent of the total budget, as I have already said. \nThe President protested that as being too much and in the wrong places. \nThis body, as the Presiding Officer knows, passed a somewhat more \nmodest rescissions bill, still close to $15 billion or so, with a \ndifferent mix of canceled or reduced programs. And about that Senate \nrescissions bill the President said:\n\n       The bill passed 99 to 0 in the Senate and I will sign the \n     Senate bill if the House and Senate will send it to me. That \n     is how we should be doing the business of America.\n\n  In the 4 weeks since then, Mr. President, the House and the Senate \nhave met together in a conference committee to settle the differences \nbetween these two proposals, in the time-honored fashion under our \nrules. What was unprecedented during the course of this attempt to work \nout differences was the almost total absence of people representing the \nWhite House or the administration.\n  Unlike the situation during the Bush administration, the Reagan \nadministration, and previous administrations when I was not here, there \nwas no guidance from the White House at all. No statement that, ``Here \nis our bottom line.'' No attempt to work out differences the way \nprevious administrations did. Silence, except around the margins, until \nthe day after the conference committee finished its work and submitted \nit to the two bodies.\n  Then the President decided that it ended up reducing a handful of \nprograms and job training and education by so great an amount of money \nthat he had to veto it.\n  I totaled up all of the items that I think could come under that veto \nthreat and they amount to less than $1 billion of the $17 billions.\n  Mr. President, I repeat, no statements of this sort, no bottom lines, \nwere sent to the members of the conference committee while it was \nworking out this situation.\n  Yesterday, the President threatened to veto the bill. He also said \nthat he still wanted to save money but too much money was being spent \nin this bill on courthouses and on highway projects. Curiously enough, \nMr. President, all of these projects which the President now describes \nas pork were included in last year's appropriations bill that he signed \nand praised last year.\n  Of course, if his veto stands and no other rescissions bill is \npassed, all will be built. His veto does not cancel a single one of \nthem. Not a single one of them was criticized at the time which they \nwere originally appropriated for and passed last year.\n  One other curiosity, Mr. President, included in the Senate bill which \nthe White House said would be approved, was certain timber language \ndrafted by this Senator for the relief of timber communities not just \nin the Pacific Northwest but all across the country. That proposal \nsimply authorized the administration to do what it said it wanted to \ndo, to carry out the provisions of what is known as option 9, its own \noption in the Pacific Northwest, and to salvage burned and dead and \ndying timber in national forests all across the country, destroyed \neither by insects or by forest fires and rapidly becoming kindling for \nnew forest fires.\n  Nothing in the Senate provisions required the administration to do \nmore than it wished to do, but it did enable them to do what they \nclaimed they wanted to do without the interference of outside lawsuits.\n  Not only was that apparently all right, as a result of the \nPresidential speech that I just read, it was expressly \n[[Page S6850]] approved just barely a week ago in a letter from the \nSecretary of Agriculture, whom as we know, is the supervisor of the \nForest Service, expressly wrote to Senator Hatfield and said that the \nSenate version was much preferable than the House version.\n  Yesterday, the result of the conference committee was described by \nthe President of the United States in these words:\n\n       There is another thing which is in this bill which I really \n     object to which would basically direct us to make timber \n     sales to large companies subsidized by the taxpayers, mostly \n     in the Pacific Northwest, and that will essentially throw out \n     all of our environmental laws and the protections that we \n     have that surround such timber sales. It would also put us \n     back into the courts.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, the language to which the White House now \nobjects, says is subject to a veto, was first, the language they \napproved when it passed the Senate in the first place, which was the \nsubject of an explicit letter from the Secretary of Agriculture--a \nletter of approval, and which was changed only in ways proposed by \nMembers of the President's own party as a result of suggestions from \npeople in the administration themselves.\n  It does not direct timber sales to large companies in any respect \nwhatever. Most of the large companies in the Pacific Northwest are \nineligible to bid on Forest Service timber. It is not subsidized by the \ntaxpayers. The Congressional Budget Office told the Senate it will net \nthe Treasury some $80 million.\n  It is not mostly in the Pacific Northwest but includes every national \nforest around the country. It does not throw out the environmental laws \nat all. It allows the administration to continue to follow every one of \nthem as presumably it has, in connection with its own plans. And it not \nonly does not put them back into the courts, it takes them out.\n  So every single description of this proposal by the President of the \nUnited States is in error. Every single element. This proposal merely \nallows the President to do what he has told the people of the Pacific \nNorthwest and the country he intends to do anyway, and freeze up the \nlawsuits over that subject.\n  I think the summary, Mr. President, is just this: The administration, \nand regrettably many of the Members on the other side of the aisle, \nwhether it is in this rescissions bill or the budget resolution, favor \nthe status quo. And $200 to $300 million deficits as far as the eye can \nsee are fine. They have no other proposal, no other alternative.\n  Cutting 1 percent of this year's budget is really too much, too \ndrastic. Has to be vetoed. Allowing the President to keep his own \npromises to timber communities, too radical a proposal.\n  Everything is just fine with all the laws and all the spending \npolicies right now. That is the message we get. Just fine. We should \nnot make any chains. We will object to everything that is proposed by \nthe new majority party. We will prevent them from keeping their \ncommitments, but we will not offer any alternatives at all.\n  Mr. President, that is not a satisfactory way with which to conduct \nthe Nation's business. It is not what the people of this country want. \nWe have promised them change and a respect for our commitments. And we \nwill continue to struggle, I trust, ultimately successfully, to just \nthat end.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the issue before this body that will begin \nin approximately half an hour is not whether the Republicans are for a \nbalanced budget or the Democrats are for a balanced budget. The \nquestion is how should we arrive at that balanced budget? All of us \nwant to pass a resolution getting our financial house in order. The \nissue is one of priority. How are we going to resolve difficult issues \nbefore the American people in an effort to arrive at this balanced \nbudget?\n  We have heard a great deal of talk these past few months about the \nneed for deficit reduction. Many on the other side of the aisle have \ntalked about a balanced budget, and rightfully so. I say to my friends \non the other side of the aisle, and I say to the American public, where \nwere those same people in the fall of 1993 when the Democrats alone \nwithout a single Republican vote in the House or the Senate passed the \nlargest deficit reduction package in the history of this country? Where \nwere they? There was not a single Republican vote for the largest \ndeficit reduction package in the history of this country. I say that \nwould have been the time to start the debate regarding a balanced \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, the deficit reduction package that was passed in 1993 \nis projected today by the CBO to reduce the deficit by $600 billion. \nThe deficit will be exactly $16 billion less over 5 years because of \nthe deficit reduction plan that was passed in 1993. Because of the \nDemocrat plan, the 1994 deficit as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct is projected to be the lowest among the G-7 countries. This \nyear we are going to again have a declining deficit. For the first time \nin 50 years we will have had 3 years in a row where we have had \ndeclining deficits. Of course, it should be declining more, but the \nfirst time in 50 years. That says a lot.\n  Because of the deficit plan, the unemployment rate is at 5.8 percent, \ndown from 7 percent in 1992. We have had the lowest unemployment and \nthe lowest inflation combined in the last 2 years than it has been in \nthe last 50 years. There are now about 1.5 million fewer people \nunemployed than at the start of this administration, a 15-percent drop.\n  So I think it is important to talk about some of the good things that \nare happening in our economy. Because of that deficit reduction plan, \nover 6.3 million new jobs have been created. Keep in mind these are not \nGovernment jobs because we reduced the Federal work force by hundreds \nof thousands of people. We have the lowest Federal employment since the \nKennedy administration, right now; not in the future but right now. \nSignificantly, the jobs that have been created as a result of the \ndeficit reduction are in the high-wage industries. For example, \nmanagerial, professional jobs make up 58 percent of the new jobs \ncreated since 1994. These jobs are good jobs.\n  What about taxes? According to CBO the deficit reduction package \nresulted in 98-plus percent approaching 99 percent of Americans paying \nthe same or less taxes as a result of that deficit reduction plan. CPI \ninflation over the past 2 years averaged just 2.8 percent. That is the \nlowest of any administration since President Kennedy was President.\n  The existing home sales for 1994 total almost 4 million. This is the \nlargest total since 1978 and the second-largest total ever.\n  Since our deficit reduction plan was passed, consumer confidence is \nup by almost 80 percent. Business investment, investment in producers \nof durable equipment, which is shown to be closely associated with \nproductivity, again has soared to a 18.6 annual growth rate since 1992. \nThis is a postwar high.\n  Mr. President, let us not talk about the doom and gloom. Let us take \na little bit of time to enjoy the goodness that is in the economy. \nSince passage of that deficit reduction plan the World Economic Forum \nhas declared that the United States has the world's most competitive \neconomy. Some may say, ``So what?'' Well, this is the first time in 9 \nyears that we have been selected for that honor.\n  Again, I repeat, let us look at what is good. Why do we have to dwell \non the doom and gloom? The economy is vibrant. It is strong.\n  There may be someone in this 100-Member body that would argue against \na balanced budget. I do not know who it would be. But there could be \nsomeone. I say that we should have a balanced budget. And we are going \nto have that. A debate ensued here a while [[Page S6851]] back where \nsome suggested that the only way we can have a balanced budget is we \namend the Constitution. It does not appear that is the case.\n  We are going to have a balanced budget by the year 2002. That is what \nwas stated in the balanced budget amendment that was defeated here; we \ncan do it without a balanced budget. The reason that some pushed for a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution is they wanted to use \nSocial Security. It would have been a lot easier way to balance the \nbudget had we used the huge surpluses that are going to be accumulated; \nas, for example, this year $80 billion, the year 2002, $111 billion. \nThat would have been the easy way to balance the budget. But I and a \nnumber of others said, ``Why don't we do it the right way, the honest \nbut hard way, and balance the budget without depleting the surplus in \nSocial Security, so that by the year 2002, we would not only have had a \nbalanced budget, but we would still have a strong, vibrant Social \nSecurity system?'' That is the important thing. I think that is what we \nare going to wind up doing here.\n  The proposal that we have by the Budget Committee will certainly \ndefine the difference between the two parties. We need to talk about \npriorities.\n  Very succinctly stated, is it right to decimate Medicare by cutting \nit by $256 billion, or is it more important to not give a tax cut as in \nthe budget that we have in the Senate Budget Committee of $170 billion, \nalmost $400 billion in the House proposal? Let us do away with those \ntax cuts and apply that money to Medicare, to education. And why do we \nhave in the Senate version this enormous tax increase on wage-earning \nfamilies?\n  And I say to my friends in the Senate and those within the sound of \nmy voice, $28,000 a year, why would we want to increase the taxes for \npeople who are making about double minimum wage?\n  In the 1993 reduction package, the reason we gave a tax break to \npeople who are earning less than $28,000 a year was so that there would \nbe an incentive to get off welfare and and go to work. And now we are \nbeing told that is the wrong way to go.\n  If we want to reform welfare, the only way we can do it is through \nincentives to work. And what this thing we call the earned income tax \ncredit does is reward work. That is what welfare reform is. That is why \nwe have it.\n  The priorities that we are talking about, Mr. President, are \nsignificant. We have, in the proposal we have gotten from the Senate \nBudget Committee, cut college Federal aid to students over 7 years by \n$30 billion. Half of all college students, Mr. President, receive some \ntype of financial aid from the Federal Government; 75 percent of all \nstudent aid comes from the Federal Government.\n  Let me say it again. Half of all college students receive financial \naid; 75 percent of all student aid comes from the Federal Government.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. We are talking about $30 billion.\n  I do not have time. I will be happy, when my time is up, to respond \nto questions from the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  This would affect about 4 million students a year. It would reduce \nPell grants, and Pell grants go to the most needy students, it would \nreduce Pell grants for individual students by 40 percent. That is \nwrong. We would cut back moneys for the Head Start Program, special \neducation. That is not the right priority. The right priorities are to \nachieve a balanced budget but let us eliminate tax cuts. That is the \nfirst way to go. It makes it very simple. And I would be very \ninterested in doing away with some of the tax loopholes that are still \nin the Federal Tax Code. We could freeze tax loopholes at their current \nlevels and save $300 billion. If we want to be more specific and \nmaintain some of those, which this Senator would be willing to do, we \nwould maybe only save $250 billion. The point is simply that we would \nsave lots of money by cutting tax loopholes. That is what we need to \ndo.\n  The Republican balanced budget plan is a plan that is harmful to \npeople who want to work. We are talking about equal sacrifice. This is \nnot equal sacrifice, as was said on National Public Radio yesterday by \nnoted Republican commentator Kevin Phillips. He said that the \nRepublican plan in effect damages and hurts the working people but \nrewards significantly the rich. There is no equal sacrifice. The rich \nwould benefit from the plan while all the sacrifice would go to the \nworking middle class.\n  That is not the way we should go. I believe, Mr. President, that we \nmust be careful that we do not ruin Medicare; that we not have tax cuts \nonly for the most affluent of our society; that we have reasonable, \nnoninjurious cuts in Medicare; that we make sure we do not damage the \neducation phase of our system; and most of all that we do not hurt the \nworking people of this country.\n  I would be happy to respond to a question of my friend from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada and would \nlike to ask this. One of the Senator's statements was that the defining \ndifference, the budget that is adopted in the debate that will take \nplace over the proposed budget that we have from the Republican side \nwill be the defining difference between the two parties. And my \nquestion is, Is the Senator taking the budget, the President's budget \nas your budget and then the Domenici Republican budget as the other, as \nbeing the defining two budgets?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend Oklahoma--and the Senator was not in the \nChamber when I started my statement--I said, No. 1, where were the \nRepublicans when we passed the 1993 deficit reduction plan, the largest \ndeficit reduction in the history of the country? And I laid out in some \ndetail what has happened since we reduced the deficit by $600 billion \nduring this period of time.\n  I will also say to my friend, during all the Reagan years and all the \nBush years, we started out with a document from the President, a \nbudget. But as my friend knows, having had experience in the House, as \nI have, the budget we get from the President is always changed. That is \nour function. I heard this statement numerous times when we were in the \nmajority in the House and Senate, that Congress sets the spending. It \nis not the President. It is the Congress. During the years I have been \nhere, every year President Reagan sent us a budget, President Bush sent \nus a budget, and President Clinton sent us a budget, we came up with \nour own working documents. I think that is what we should do this time. \nWhat the President sent us will not be what comes out of this Chamber.\n  I think when it is all said and done, people on this side of the \naisle will have the opportunity to vote to determine whether we should \nhave tax increases for the poor, tax decreases for the wealthy, whether \nwe should dramatically cut Medicare and education. We will have votes \non that, to determine the differences between the two parties.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I agree with the Senator. I have read the Constitution \nand seen what our job is. And, of course, we had a Republican President \nwith a Democrat Congress at the time the Senator is speaking of. Now it \nis just the reverse; we have a Democrat President and Republican \nCongress. Obviously, there will be a difference from the beginning \nbudget. The observation that I would make and would like to ask the \nSenator about is when we talk about the cuts, talk about the deficits--\nand the Senator was talking about the 1993 bill--in 1994, there was a \ntax increase that was recommended by the Democratic Party and by the \nPresident of the United States, Bill Clinton, that was characterized as \nthe largest single tax increase in the history of public finance in \nAmerica or anywhere in the world. I would like to ask the Senator two \nquestions. He has been talking about the reduction that we are \nproposing in our bill in taxes, and I would suggest to the Senator that \nwe are not proposing a reduction in taxes from the Senate even though I \nwould personally like to have us do that. It is the House bill that is \noffering the reductions in their package.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator from Nevada \nthat the time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I would ask that in morning business this colloquy between \nthe [[Page S6852]] Senators from Oklahoma and Nevada be allowed to \ncontinue.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, I would like to not have \nthat extend beyond the next 2 minutes because I want the use the last 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. If I could have 1 minute to respond.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I would say, first of all, that was wrongly characterized \nas the largest tax increase in history. And I would further state that \nthe Senate budget we have received also has a tax cut. It is disguised. \nBut what it does, any savings that come as a result of the balanced \nbudget would be referred to the Finance Committee and the Finance \nCommittee only use that money for tax decreases.\n  So both the Senate version of the budget and the House version of the \nbudget have tax cuts. The House was more apparent in theirs. They have \nabout $385 billion in tax cuts. The Senate proposal is a little more \ncamouflaged but there is still a call for $170 billion in tax cuts \nbecause that is all the Finance Committee could use the money for as \nsavings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield the time I \nhave to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6850-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6852-S6853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BALANCING THE FEDERAL BUDGET\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nNevada for responding to questions. I would like to make an \nobservation.\n  I had the occasion to be sitting in the chair for the past hour \nbefore the current occupant of the chair, and I listened to the \ndiscussion that took place in the Chamber. It occurred to me that maybe \nsome people for the first time realize how truly difficult it is to \nbalance the budget.\n  I had an occasion last night to see on C-SPAN the Democratic whip in \nthe House of Representatives standing up and talking and stating over \nand over and over again that they are requesting reductions in taxes \nfor the very wealthy people and that those reductions in taxes will be \npaid by what has always been referred to as the working people. And I \nhave always found that to be a little offensive. It is kind of implying \nthat other people are not working. I think it is a very clever way to \nstate it because everyone identifies with that.\n  But we are at a defining moment right now. There was truly a \nrevolution that took place on November 8, 1994, and everyone agrees \nwith this. I know there are others who do not like the way it turned \nout, but the conservatives did, in fact, win.\n  And while there is a lot of confusion over this as to how it must be \ndone, the message that came in November 1994 was: ``We demand change. \nWe don't want the status quo.''\n  Now we are seeing the defenders of the status quo on this floor \ntalking about, ``Well, we can't do this. We can't have a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. We can't adopt the budget as \nproposed by the Republicans because it might incur a hardship on some \nof the people in this country.''\n  I would suggest, first of all, that we make it abundantly clear that \nthe budget that is going to be proposed in both the other body and in \nthis body does not have a cut in Medicare. As a matter of fact, it adds \na bit in growth in Medicare. That growth is somewhere around 7.1 \npercent.\n  The President had a report from his trustees on Medicare. There are \nsix of them. He appointed them. We are talking about people like Donna \nShalala and people like the other Cabinet members. They reported to the \nPresident of the United States that if we do not do something about \nMedicare, Medicare will start into a deficit in the fiscal year of 1997 \nand will be broke, bankrupt, in the year 2002.\n  Now, there are a lot of people watching right now who, like me, will \nreach the age of 65 by the year 2002, and they have to understand that \nthis is not a Republican suggestion or study that has developed the \nconclusion that it will go broke by the year 2002. These are the \ntrustees of the Medicare system that were appointed by the President.\n  Now what has the President done since then? Where is the President? \nHe has not even responded to that. And yet, he is adhering to his \nbudget. Only yesterday, he announced he was going to veto the \nrescissions bill, which was a reduction in spending of $16.4 billion, \nthe largest single reduction, I believe, in the history of this \ncountry. He says he is going to veto this reduction, the spending \nreductions.\n  I think it is just inconceivable that someone who ran for office on \nreducing spending, someone who ran on a balanced budget for this \ncountry, would now come up and say, in this fiscal year of 1995, the \nrescissions bill that has been proposed and that was passed by a \nmajority of votes in the House and the Senate will be vetoed by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  I also think it is necessary for us to reaffirm our commitment to \nchildren. I hear over and over again about this program is going to be \ncut, or that program is going to be cut.\n  Yes, some programs are going to be cut and there are going to be some \nhardships if we do successfully balance the budget by the year 2002. \nBut we cannot stand up here on the floor, as the Senator from Nevada \ndid a few moments ago, and talk about the fact that every Senator, \nevery one of the 100 Senators here in the U.S. Senate, wants to have a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002 and not do anything today to bring it \nabout.\n  You know, this is an exciting time. Right now, this week, we are \ngoing to be debating, and next week we probably will have a vote in \nboth bodies on a budget that will eliminate the deficit by the year \n2002.\n  I heard Congressman DeLay talk about the fact that he has been \nwaiting his entire life for this moment to come. And all of those who \nvoted for a major change on November 8, 1994, this is the change. Of \nall the things that that mandate said to Congress from the American \npeople, it said we want less Government intrusion in our lives. It said \nthat we want to do something about keeping America strong in its \ndefense. But, first and foremost, it said, we want to balance the \nbudget.\n  I had an experience the other day when we had our National Prayer \nBreakfast. When I left the House, I was president of the House Prayer \nBreakfast, so I was kind of in charge, I say to the Senator, of the \ninternational visitors.\n  There was a gentleman who came into our National Prayer Breakfast \nfrom Moldavia. He was beaming from ear to ear. He came up to me and he \nsaid, ``Senator, we are so proud. We now have a free economy. We have \nbeen under communism for all these years, now we have democracy. But I \nhave a question to ask you. In America, how much can you keep?\"\n  And I said, ``I'm sorry, I don't think I understand your question.'' \nHe said, ``In America, how much does the Government take from you?\"\n  Then I understood what he was saying, and so I gave him a figure that \nI would hate to have to stand here and try to justify.\n  But he said, very proudly, ``In Moldavia, when we go out and we earn \na dollar, we get to keep 20 cents.''\n  They have some kind of a periodic collection. At the end of every \nmonth, they have to give 80 cents out of every dollar they earn to the \nGovernment. He was so proud they had reached that point.\n  I thought how fortunate we are in this country, until I realized and \nlooked at the picture of my two grandchildren. And the CBO, and others \nin every study, no one has disagreed, said that if we do not do \nsomething to change the trend in this country of deficit spending, that \nanyone who is born today will have to spend 82 percent of his or her \nlifetime income to support the Government. And that is worse off than \nthey are in Moldavia.\n  So I would just caution you, Mr. President, and others who may hear \nthe stories of the bleeding hearts talking about all these Government \nprograms that are going to be cut, to stop and realize, in most cases, \nthat is not true at all. It is not the case of Social Security, it is \nnot the case of Medicare, it is not the case of Medicaid.\n  And if, in fact, we could actually put a growth cap on Government, as \nI think one amendment by Senator Gramm is going to attempt to do, of \n3.2 [[Page S6853]] percent, we end up balancing the budget without \ncutting one Federal program and without reducing one Federal program by \nmerely putting caps on.\n  So I think we have to ask ourselves a question, Mr. President, not \nshould we do this this week or next week, but what happens if we do \nnot. Are we going to have another opportunity in the U.S. Senate or the \nother body to actually come up with a balanced budget? And we have to \nask the question: Where will our children be if we do not vote \nproperly?\n  I know there are well-meaning people on the other side of this. They \nsay we want a balanced budget, they want to do something by the year \n2002. I would like to do it sooner. Most of us would. But talking is \none thing and doing is another thing.\n  It is not going to be easy, but I suggest to you, Mr. President--I \nknow that my time is up and morning business up--I suggest to you, if \nwe do not do it this time, we will probably not be able to do it in our \nlifetimes.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6852-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution 13, which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 13) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for the \n     fiscal years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the concurrent resolution.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have been authorized by the chairman \nto speak, and the time to come off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I feel somewhat privileged to be the first person to speak on this \nhistoric resolution that has just been laid down by the U.S. Senate. It \nis, in fact, a historic moment for this Chamber that we are going to \nfinally come to grips and face and look straight in the eye the future \nof our country and the children of our country and say we are now \nprepared to act on your behalf. We are now prepared to take the tough \nstands and to weather the beatings that we will be getting from the \npress and from the other side to stand up for the future generations of \nAmericans so we can, like my grandfather who came here as an immigrant \nand my father who came here as a immigrant, try to leave the country \nbetter off and with more opportunities than their generation had.\n  We have stopped doing that in America, and this is a chance to start \nover, to start anew, to give us the opportunity right here on this \nSenate floor to move forward, to move this country forward into a new \nmillennium with sound fiscal policy and with opportunity available to \nevery American. That is what this is all about.\n  This is not about the minutiae that you are going to hear on the \nfloor of the Senate about, ``Oh, well, we're going to cut this program \nand as a result of the program''--listen, a Government program, a \nGovernment program which most people know, most Government programs, \nbig administrative costs, do not necessarily target the way they are \nsupposed to, but we are going to cut a Government program and there \nwill be hundreds of them discussed in the next 50 hours.\n  We are going to take a Government program and that program itself \nwill jeopardize our future so greatly that it is more important to \npreserve this little bit more funding for this program than it is to \nbalance the Federal budget and to preserve the long-term future of this \ncountry. That argument in itself just fails; it is ridiculous. There is \nnothing we do in Washington, DC--nothing--no individual program that \nstands above providing future generations the opportunity to succeed in \nAmerica. Nothing.\n  So when you look and you hear all the debate about all the minutiae \nthat you are going to discuss, all the little programs that somebody \nlikes to scare people with that we are going to abolish or cut or \nwhatever, remember the big picture. The big picture is: We balance the \nbudget in 7 years, we provide fiscal sanity for future generations and, \nfrankly, for this generation with several programs, and that is what we \nhave to focus on. That is what the issue is.\n  You are going to hear a lot about, as I was hearing a few minutes \nago, tax cuts for the rich paid for by cutting working middle-class \nprograms, so we are going to take money away from working Americans, \nworking American families for tax cuts for the rich. I do not know \nabout you, but as far as I understand the Tax Code, you get taxed if \nyou work, you get taxed if you make money. So if you are cutting taxes \nfor people who work, I do not know how that is hurting working American \nfamilies, particularly since the biggest item in the tax cut proposal \nthat is being proposed is a tax cut of $500 for families, a credit of \n$500 per family.\n  Now, how is that hurting families? The only families that could \nconceivably hurt are those that do not have children and those who do \nnot make enough money to pay taxes. But to say that you are cutting \nprograms for taxpaying families, yeah, OK, but then we are giving it \nback to them where they can spend the money where they want to spend \nit. They get all of it, not siphoned off from Washington with the \nadministrative costs and the overhead and the direction of what we \nthink is best to spend money, but they get the whole pot.\n  I see the majority leader is here, so I will cease my comments \nbecause I know he is really the proper one to lead this off. But I am \ntelling you, this is going to be a great day in the U.S. Senate. It is \na day that we should be very, very proud, as all Members of the Senate, \nthat we are having this discussion. It is unfortunate that the \nPresident of the United States has chosen not to participate in this \ndiscussion, that he has chosen to sit on the sidelines and throw either \nconfetti or darts from the stands and not participate and get involved \nin solving the No. 1 problem of this Nation by presenting a budget that \nis balanced.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader, Senator Dole, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. I \ncommend him for his forthright statement. This is going to be a very \nimportant debate, in effect, for everybody in America, I believe for \nthe better if we can keep it on that plane. I certainly look forward to \nSenator Domenici's opening statement, and I will follow with my budget \nstatement after Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I assume we will follow the typical \nprocess and procedure that we have in the past. As the majority leader \nof the bill, I will have some opening remarks and I, obviously, will \nquickly yield to the Senator from Nebraska who will have his opening \nremarks. I would like the Senate to know that as we read the budget \nlaw, there is up to 4 hours for discussion of economics and the macro \neffect of the budget and the like. Some Senators on our side would like \nto speak during that period to what they consider to be a historic \nevent, a redefining event for America. So we are going to let as many \nof them as possible do that without in any way violating our comity \nwith the other side. As soon as we can, we will get into a rotation on \namendments.\n  The Senator from New Mexico will try sometime this evening to offer \nthe first amendment. It should come as a shock to no one. It will be \nthe President's budget. The President's press secretary suggested \nyesterday that it would be a much better starting point to start with \nthe President. So we will accommodate and put that budget before the \nSenate and see what they think about it. Then we will go to the \nDemocrat side for their amendment and we will move back and forth.\n  I am permitted by the majority leader pursuant to his instructions to \ntalk about the fact that we are going to be in next week late. If the \nfull 50 hours is going to be used, obviously we are \n[[Page S6854]] going to have to take a couple days and work very long \nhours. The majority leader has indicated we are going to do that. We \nwould like to finish Wednesday, as I understand it. And I am going to \ndo my best to be accommodating. Everybody knows that there is a \nlimitation on how long you can speak on amendments and how much you can \nspeak on amendments to amendments, all of which is by law, not by \nrecall. That is the way the budget law was written. We are going to \nwork closely under that. With that, I will have a couple of procedural \nunanimous-consent requests, Mr. President.\n  First, as I understand it, you have already read the budget \nresolution by title, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the following staff of the \nSenate Budget Committee be permitted to remain on the Senate floor \nduring the consideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution 13.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the presence and use of \nsmall electronic calculators be permitted on the floor of the Senate \nduring the consideration of the 1996 fiscal budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I need \nfor some opening observations, and then I will yield to Senator Exon. \nAnd then I understand the Republican leader wants to speak immediately \nfollowing that. I will be yielding as quickly as I can to him.\n  Mr. President, today, we begin a discussion of great significance. As \nI see it, we are discussing today the future of the United States of \nAmerica. Over the next few days, we will have the debate that so many \nof us have said we want--a debate to balance the budget of the United \nStates. Earlier this year, we had another debate. That debate had to do \nwith a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. At that time, \nmany of my colleagues declared that we did not need a constitutional \namendment, Mr. President. ``We do not need a constitutional \namendment,'' many said, ``to balance the budget.'' All we needed was \nthe courage to do it ourselves.\n  While I wanted a balanced budget amendment because I wanted it there \nfor the long-term future, I voted for it.\n  Today, I am responding to all of the Senators from both sides of the \naisle, which is an overwhelming number who have said the United States \nof America should balance the budget.\n  Many Senators on the other side who did not vote for that balanced \nbudget amendment--and I am not here arguing with them today--many of \nthem stood up on the floor of the Senate and said, ``We do not need the \nbalanced budget amendment. Just let us exercise courage, and we will \nget a balanced budget. We will do it ourselves.''\n  This is a do-it-ourselves balanced budget. We have an opportunity to \ntest that proposition of courage. Do we have the courage to do what is \nnecessary to achieve a balanced budget?\n  Just 55 session days ago, I say to our majority leader who was \npresent at that time, on February 10, this same Chamber overwhelmingly, \n87-10, voted in favor of an amendment directing the Senate Budget \nCommittee to report back to the Senate at the earliest possible date, \nhow do we achieve a balanced budget without increasing or reducing the \ndisbursements under the Social Security fund.\n  In other words, the instructions were--87-10--bring the Senate a \nbalanced budget, and the only thing that shall not be touched is Social \nSecurity.\n  Today, Mr. President, fellow Senators, the Senate Budget Committee \nhas reported back to the U.S. Senate. Senate Concurrent Resolution 13 \nnow before the Senate achieves that mandate and that directive from the \nU.S. Senate, 87-10. That is the number that said, ``Do it.''\n  We will now have an opportunity to openly and fairly debate our \nvision of a brighter fiscal future, a better America for our children \nand our grandchildren, a brighter America where we pay our bills \ninstead of asking our children to pay our bills.\n  Today, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to all of them, this \nwill be a very important debate. It will be heated from time to time. \nHowever, it is an essential debate. America's future, for the young and \nthe old alike, will be shaped right here on the Senate floor during the \nnext 5 to 6 days.\n  Let Senators, throughout this debate, try to remain focused on what \nour ultimate goal is --a country unsaddled with debt on our children.\n  Because the numbers do not lie, our deficit is out of control, and \nour current state of Federal expenditures versus receipts is \nunacceptable.\n  In the 1960's, deficits were averaging $16 billion a year; in the \n1970's, they averaged $38 billion a year; in the 1980's they averaged \n$156 billion a year; and so far, Mr. President, in the 1990's they have \naveraged $259 billion a year.\n  This year we will borrow 11 cents of every Federal dollar spent. Our \nbudget deficit this year stands at $175 billion, and is growing \nrelentlessly at the rate of $335,000 a minute, $20 million an hour, \n$482 million a day.\n  All of this debt is, plain and simple, mortgaging our children's \nfuture. Experts estimate that a child born today will have to pay an \nadditional $100,000 in added taxes to pay just the interest on the debt \nwhich will accumulate during the next 18 years.\n  The burden is not just on future generations. Our gross Federal debt \nis so large--$4.9 trillion--that it is seriously harming our standard \nof living. Every American now owes $18,500. Every single, living, \nbreathing American, from the smallest child to the most senior \nAmerican, owes the staggering amount of $18,500.\n  And by 1999, Mr. President, the President's proposed budget will \nchange that number dramatically. I wish I could say it would come down. \nEach American will owe $23,700 as their share of our profligacy, of our \ninability as adult leaders to say we ought to pay for what we give to \npeople by way of government.\n  The New York Federal Reserve Bank estimates that the deficit spending \nbetween the years 1978 and 1990 reduced the gross domestic product by 5 \npercent. That means that the sum total of all our acts in terms of \ngrowth and wealth is 5 percent less during that decade because of the \ndeficit we have accumulated.\n  The bipartisan Concord Coalition reveals that our debt and the \ndeficit spending have lowered the income of \n[[Page S6855]] American families by $15,000 a year. As we see, it does \nmatter how much we borrow, how much we owe, and how much interest we \nmust pay to those who have lent and loaned and committed money to our \nGovernment to pay our bills.\n  Yet, if this proposed budget is any barometer, the President is doing \nlittle to avert a fiscal train wreck for this country. If we pass his \nproposed budget, the problem will just get worse, because the \nPresident's proposed budget abandons deficit reduction and succumbs to \nthe status quo, adding another $1.12 trillion to our national debt by \nthe year 2000, bringing the growth deficit to $6.7 trillion.\n  President Clinton's budget promises $200 to $300 billion deficits as \nfar as the eye can see, a Medicare system that will go broke in 7 \nyears, and a crushing tax burden on America's young people just \nstarting out in life. That is the promise of the President's budget. \nEven the Washington Post editorial on Tuesday labeled President \nClinton's budget as ``weak and directionless.''\n  The budget reported by the Senate Budget Committee--and I am very \nproud of the 12 members who voted to report this budget resolution last \nThursday evening--that budget may be called many things, but one thing \nopponents cannot accuse it of is lacking direction. The Senate Budget \nCommittee's resolution direction is straightforward. It is toward a \nbalance.\n  Frankly, I must comment that my good friend, former chairman of the \nHouse Budget Committee and currently Chief of Staff of the President, \nsaid we should let policy direct our budget, not our budget direct our \npolicy.\n  I disagree. I disagree. The policy that should direct our spending is \na balanced budget. That, too, is a policy I say to the White House and \nto those who advocate the President's budget. Indeed, a balanced budget \nis a policy, and it is a policy with a future. It is a policy for the \nfuture.\n  The budget reported by the Senate Budget Committee clearly has \ndirection, has a purpose, and has a tremendously effective and much \nneeded public policy of balance for the first time in almost three \ndecades.\n  Now, there is a chart up behind me here that I think ought to be the \nfocus of the early, early hours of our debate. It is very, very simple.\n  It is very, very simple. The President would have us believe that his \nbudget is an attack on deficits, that he has even made enough of an \nattack on deficits that he can cut taxes. The Congressional Budget \nOffice is, according to our President, the really official, honest \ndisseminator of budget facts. This yellow line is the President's \nbudget for the next 5 years according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. You see the bragging occurs here, at somewhere between 150 and \n200--176, that is where it is. But that is the lowest it ever gets. And \nlook at the line and look at it climb.\n  Now in just 5 years it is perilously close to $300 billion. I am \npositive, although we have not done the numbers, that one could now put \nthe line like this, and by 2002 it would probably be up here. But the \nSenate Budget Committee changed the course of economic history for \nAmerica and their budget line is this. It is more than symbolic that it \nis in black, because for the first time, in 2002 the Federal Government \nis in the black.\n  Look at the difference. This is the difference. The President's \nbudget goes on up, getting close to $300 billion when the Senate budget \nis less than $100 billion and then to zero while the President's \nskyrockets and goes on up to three-and-a-quarter, $350 billion. That is \nnot complicated by any ideas about percentage of gross domestic product \nand the like. It is just plain dollar numbers.\n  So the budget resolution before the Senate today has a vision. It has \na vision of solvency of this country, and a American dollar that gets \nout of the doldrums and has a real chance of remaining the currency for \nthe world.\n  I know people do not quite understand, sometimes, what this low, low, \nlow American dollar might mean. I will not even put the numbers down \nbecause the fact frightens me. But if the American dollar would become \nweak enough--what might happen to America if the Saudi Arabians decided \nthey do not want to be paid in American dollars anymore? Has anybody \nthought of that? I say to Senator Dole, if the Saudis said we do not \nwant American dollars, we want to be paid in yen, you would see the \nmost significant, gigantic leap in inflation in the United States, \nexceeding even the 18, 19 and 20 percent inflation of the Carter days. \nBecause oil prices would of necessity go up two or three times just \nbecause of the value of the currency that we would have to buy up and \nthen pay out.\n  So we have before us, not a blueprint as some have said, but an \nenforceable blueprint, for it tells the Congress of the future what \nthey can and cannot do about spending for the next 7 years. It does not \nignore the problem that everyone agrees exists. It recognizes a simple \nnotion, that our Government simply cannot go on spending our children's \nmoney and that by balancing the budget we can ensure a brighter future \nfor our country and our children.\n  The budget resolution before the Senate today wants to change the way \nour Government works, to make it efficient, responsive, and less \nexpensive. Like a family gathered around the kitchen table, the \ncommittee members who voted to report this resolution Thursday past \nhave made difficult choices. But those are choices we needed to make to \nprotect and strengthen the future. We have been thorough and we have \nbeen fair. This budget resolution is designed to return our Nation to \nreality in terms of the spending of the tax dollars of the American \npeople. It is directed at preserving this country as a land of \nopportunity, for this and future generations, because opportunity comes \nwhen a society gives a citizen a real chance to accumulate wealth and \nearn good pay. The more we go in debt, the less the chance for \nopportunity.\n  In short, it is a reflection of our commitment to responsibility, to \ngenerating economic growth, creating family-wage jobs, and protecting \nthe American dream for our citizens, whether they are young or whether \nthey are old. This is not just rhetoric. It is based on many studies \nand I will cite just an a couple.\n  The economic forecasting firm of DRI/McGraw-Hill, that firm estimates \nthat if we balance this budget America's yearly output will increase by \nan extra 2.5 percent over the next 10 years. Minimum, they say, 2.4 \nmillion new jobs. So, in the debate that follows when we talk about \nless Government and what it might do, less debt and what it might do \nfor those who would like to continue to borrow money, we have to also \nput into that calculation that we might get 2.5 million new jobs. Which \nhas to be set up against some of the things that people will say have \nto be restrained, reformed and cut in the budget.\n  Further, a recent GAO study suggests that the average family income \nwill increase by as much as $11,200 over the next 30 years as a result \nof balancing the Federal budget. Interest rates will decline, say they, \nby as much as 1.7 percentage points by the time we are in balance. \nThese are not my estimates. They are not hopes. They are not dreams. \nThey are what the best people in America are estimating the positive \neffect of balance to be. There is a reward for balancing the budget. \nThe reward is a better America, more jobs, more opportunity, lower \ninterest rates, less debt for our children. Add them all up and every \nadult leader in America should be willing to stand up and say that is \nwas we really ought to do.\n  This resolution restores equilibrium, fiscal equilibrium. The \nblueprint, the enforceable blueprint in this resolution will for the \nfirst time in 3 decades result in a balanced Federal budget. I believe \nthis because I truly believe it will be enforceable and it makes the \nvery tough decision to address the fastest growing areas of Federal \nspending and the Federal Government's commitments. It is a budget which \nreflects the unequivocal goals expressed by the American people and a \nmajority of the Members of Congress. It will balance the budget by \n2002. It will not touch Social Security. And it will do so by \nratcheting down the deficit by slowing the growth of Government.\n  Let me emphasize, Government spending will continue to grow over the \nnext 7 years; but rather than having Government growing faster than \nwages and salaries, as has been the case for the last three decades, \nwages and salaries will grow faster than Government spending--something \nvery important \n[[Page S6856]] for the working people of our country and those who will \ncome along in the future to join that work force.\n  This resolution before us envisions Federal Government growth at 3 \npercent a year over the next 7 years. Wages and salaries are estimated \nto grow by 5 percent--marvelous. If we can keep that going, keep that \ngoing for two or three decades our standard of living would be back \nwhere it ought to be. It is as budget which will reverse the tide of 50 \nyears of power flowing from the rest of the country to Washington. We \nwant to provide more freedom and opportunity to people at the local \nlevel so they might have more control over their own destinies, and \ntheir own decisions on programs that affect their lives, their \ncommunities and their children. Key changes are proposed to shrink the \nFederal bureaucracy. We assume the termination of over 100 programs, \ncommissions, boards, including the gradual and orderly phaseout of the \nDepartment of Commerce. And we recommend the elimination of program \nduplications, consolidation of Federal programs to improve efficiency \nand prioritize the limited resources we have.\n  This resolution begins deficit reduction right here in our own \nbackyard. It establishes a freeze on congressional salaries and pay, as \na suggestion to the appropriators, a $200 million cut in the \nlegislative branch this year with more to come. It assumes a 12.5-\npercent reduction in the Senate support staff, and a 15-percent \nreduction in committee staff, 25-percent reduction in the Government \noperations, GAO, and termination of the Office of Technology \nAssessment. We may do more. But Americans should know we want to start \nright here. Since we are asking for less government, we ought to have \nless money to spend on these institutions also.\n  However, the budget recognizes that Government does provide needed \nservices to our citizens, and we have been painstakingly careful to \npreserve a safety net for those in true need. Moreover, we support \nprograms aimed at keeping the American people safe, safe in their \nhomes, in their schools by funding needed crime programs fully.\n  While this budget assumes a series of reforms of our welfare system \nthat saves nearly $80 billion over the next 7 years, let no one say \nthat we have ignored those basic human needs. It provides $192 billion \nfor food stamp programs; AFDC, and child welfare programs, we funded \nover $130 billion; SSI will be funded over $230 billion. The earned-\nincome tax credit, which we will hear a lot about, will continue to \ngrow, and will expend $155 billion.\n  This resolution does not in its current form recommend school lunches \nbe changed. The WIC Program would not decrease. It could go up. Section \n8 housing would continue, and expiring contracts could very well be \nfunded.\n  So the committee reported a resolution that does not cut funding for \nmajor education programs targeted at the disadvantaged, such as Head \nStart, chapter 1, special education, Pell grants, community service \nblock grants. Check it. That is the way we put it down. That is the way \nwe recommend it. It will all be up to the committees. But they will all \nbe bound by a dollar number.\n  On Medicare, first and foremost, we have taken heat for the April 3 \nMedicare trustees report. Here it is. ``Status of Social Security and \nMedicare Programs,'' April 3. This was issued by six people, four of \nwhom are appointed by the President, or work for him, and two private \ncitizens. They state that this fund is in near collapse. The hospital \nfund for seniors in terms of money available to pay the bills will be \nbankrupt in 7 years. It will be unable to pay any bills. We cannot \nallow this to happen. And we have taken steps in this budget to ensure \nthat it does not.\n  Our budget will slow the growth of Medicare generating savings needed \nto put Medicare on a financially sound footing for the next 7 years \nwhile Congress and, hopefully, the President work together to develop a \nlong-term solution to a serious crisis of the solvency gap for Medicare \nover time.\n  Saving Medicare from insolvency is an issue of immediate importance. \nIt will require all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, to work \ntoward a solution. Therefore, our budget calls upon our congressional \nleadership without delay to establish a bipartisan commission to \ndevelop recommendations on how to maintain the solvency of the Medicare \nsystem. This commission will be required to report back to Congress by \nJuly 10 so that these short-term recommendations can be considered by \nour appropriate committees before final passage of the laws changing \nthe direction of our country.\n  So let us also be clear about taxes in this budget. The budget \nresolution does not raise taxes. Later on, Mr. President, as we are \ntold we should not balance the budget this way, that there ought to be \nanother way--although I do not think we will see another way--but we \nwill suggest that maybe there are some who would like to balance the \nbudget by raising taxes. So we will give everybody an estimate of how \nmany billions of dollars in taxes would have to be imposed on the \nAmerican people to balance the budget by raising taxes. In fact, we \nwill tell you for your Coloradans, Mr. President, how many billions \nthey would have to pay in new taxes if we do not want to restrain \ngrowth and cut programs. If we do not want to do that, restrain growth \nin some of entitlements and change the way we spend money, if we do not \nwant to do that, then we will tell you how much taxes the State will \nhave to pay to the Federal Government to come into balance. Because I \ntake those at their word who said they want a balanced budget. They may \nnot want it our way. So we are trying to explore which way.\n  Let me in closing say that it is my sincere hope that, as we move \nthrough this process, we can start working together. I wish that \nRepublicans and Democrats could respond to the wishes of the American \npeople in harmony and in unison and end this crisis of deficit \nspending. I understand full well, however, that this may not be \npossible. In the end, however, we must pass a budget and direct our \npolicies toward balance.\n  Last week the committee began its deliberation on the budget. We \nobserved a great hallmark in American history, the 50th anniversary of \nV-E Day, or Victory in Europe Day. As I told the committee as we began \nthat debate on V-E Day, it was a day we all proudly recall. We recall \nhow Americans rallied together, persevered, and eventually conquered an \nextraordinary threat to the future. But 50 years later our Nation faces \nanother threat. That threat is severe enough that we should declare war \non it and defeat it. One crisis that is less obvious but is just as \nsinister--one of the great leaders from that great struggle 50 years \nago, Winston Churchill, said and I quote:\n\n       The price of greatness is responsibility.\n\n  We in Government shoulder that responsibility, Mr. President. We \nactively seek it by running for public office. I believe the time has \ncome to stop shrinking but to shoulder our responsibility and enact an \nhonest Federal budget and stop squandering our economic future. As we \nbegin this historic debate, I would ask that we all, especially those \nof us who are elected to lead, consider our service to this Nation. Let \nus not lose sight of the big picture, but let us focus on these \npolicies that will carry this country into the next century strong and \nhopeful with an economic future for everyone.\n  How will future generations view our efforts on behalf of America? \nDid we work to protect it, strengthen it, improve it, or did we consume \nits vitality and leave our children with fewer opportunities and a \nlower standard of living than their parents? I know what I want to do. \nI am very hopeful that a compelling majority of the Senate wants to do \nthe same thing.\n  So let us begin the debate. It is one that should be in full in the \nopen to the American people, and we are very grateful that we live in a \nsociety that will permit both sides to be heard. I understand and \nrespect those who may disagree as to particulars in this budget. But I \nam sure that whatever the outcome of this debate Members from both \nsides of the aisle must conclude that our country's future cannot be \nstrong if we fail to control spiraling debt and continue into the next \ncentury with it unchecked. It will not work unless we make some \nfundamental changes today and early next week.\n  So I think the time is now. The opportunity is before us today. Let \nus show the courage and do what is in the best interest of our country. \n[[Page S6857]] \n  I thank the Senate. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] \nis recognized for his opening statement.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, to begin with, I first want to salute once \nagain, as I have in the past, the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for all of the work that went into the production of this \nRepublican budget.\n I commend him, too, for making the type of hard choices that are \nnecessary if we are to balance the unified budget by the year 2002.\n\n  Most of us on this side of the aisle share the goal of a balanced \nbudget. It is an article of faith, I suggest, for this Senator. I have \na long history of fighting for responsible budgets. Our dedication to \nfiscal responsibility, therefore, cuts across party lines. We are \nwilling to work with the Republican majority to shape a budget that \nwill reach balance on a unified basis by 2002. I hope we can come \ntogether to fashion out of the Domenici initiative a true bipartisan \ncompromise. I will outline today, and during the budget debate to \nfollow, some fundamental concerns that I feel must be addressed.\n  Of course, none of this will be easy. To a Senator, we know the \nenormous challenges that lie ahead. All of us must recognize that we \nhave to make some tough choices, and this Senate has demonstrated in \nthe past I am willing to do that. But no person or party has all of the \nanswers. We should seek to build a consensus on balancing the budget. \nBrute force is not the answer.\n  We cannot be dictated to or ignored. Minority rights and views must \nbe recognized and weighed. House Budget Committee Chairman Kasich \nrecently said, and I quote, ``Democrats have no standing to say \nanything about what we are doing in the House and the Senate.'' This \nbrash rhetoric does not serve the process well. Whatever they do in the \nHouse certainly has no place in the Senate.\n  Earlier this year, I held out the hope for a bipartisan budget. \nHowever, we parted ways on key issues, such as tax cuts and the \ndistribution of spending cuts. Soon after, the trench warfare really \nbegan. The Republican majority in the Budget Committee took a combative \ncrouch during our markup. Their budget was carved in stone and we in \nthe minority could not remove one period or comma. Not a single number \ncould be changed, even in the smallest amount. That is not the approach \nto take if we truly desire to work together to produce a unified \nbalanced budget.\n  On numerous occasions, I have offered a hand of friendship and an \ninvitation to reason on the budget. My purpose is not to thwart the \nRepublican budget, but rather to recast some of its priorities to \nbetter reflect our Nation's needs. My purpose is to make \nrecommendations and offer amendments which I believe will make the cuts \nfairer and evenly distributed. My purpose is to put some balance in \nthis budget.\n  During the next 50 hours, we will hear a lot about this budget. This \nbudget, once shrouded in secrecy, has been in full view for a little \nmore than a week. As it was unveiled, the budget was attended by the \nusual fanfare: the grand statements of vision, the quotes from Thomas \nJefferson.\n  That day, we heard a lot of promises, too. As we sat down to mark up \nthe budget, those promises kept cropping up again and again and again. \nAs we started to peel away layer after layer of the budget, many of the \npromises did not jibe with the numbers I saw.\n  The Republicans promised to make dogged choices over and over again, \nbut tax cuts are the tail that wags this budget. The Republicans \npromised to protect the elderly but asked for a king's ransom in \nMedicare cuts to foot the tax cuts. The Republicans promised a brighter \nfuture for our Nation but cast a bleak shadow upon rural America and \nour children.\n  Although there have been protests to the contrary, there is a tax cut \ntucked away in this Republican budget. No one should be fooled by the \nmirrors that are used to hide this fact. It has been thinly disguised \nas a $170 billion contingent fund, but it is a tax cut nevertheless. In \nfact, this could be the mother\n lode of tax cuts for the wealthy. And what the Republicans do not tell \nthe American people is that the $170 billion tax cut could balloon to \n$356 billion over 10 years.\n\n  The budget before us does not dictate what tax cuts are forthcoming, \nbut we know what is being discussed by the other side of the aisle. The \nnews is not comforting. For example, more than half of the tax breaks \nin the House-passed Contract With America tax bill benefit those \nfamilies with incomes of over $100,000. That is the top 12 percent of \nthe income distribution, and even if we disregard Republican plans to \nincrease taxes for those eligible to receive the earned income tax \ncredit, families with incomes below $10,000 would get an average tax \ncut of $20. Compare that, if you will, with families with incomes over \n$200,000 stand to receive a $11,266 tax cut bonanza. That is wrong.\n  True enough, the Senate Budget Committee adopted a nonbinding sense-\nof-the Congress amendment sponsored by Senator Boxer that states that \n90 percent of any tax cut should go to the middle class.\n  But no one should be fooled into believing that the plans of the \nmajority have changed. Senate proponents of tax cuts have publicly \nstated their support of the House-passed tax provisions in the Contract \nWith America. If ever there was a Contract on America, this is it. One \nSenator has vowed that he will offer a tax cut amendment on the Senate \nfloor, and it will not be limited to the middle class.\n  The tax cut centerpiece of the Republican budget is fueled by cuts in \nMedicare. The Medicare reductions in the Republican mark total $256 \nbillion over the next 7 years. That is the largest Medicare cut in \nhistory. This is the single most important part of the Republican plan. \nThis is the key to the entire deal. This is the cornerstone of the \nRepublican budget, and we intend to change it.\n  Yet, it comes without a single specific proposal beyond the formation \nof a commission. On this point, there is no plan. On the largest, most \nsignificant part of the Republican budget, there is not plan--period.\n  Although we have no details, it is clear that at least half the cuts \nwill fall on beneficiaries. The only Medicare cut publicly supported by \nChairman Domenici would increase the part B premium to 31.5 percent of \nprogram costs, adding nearly $500 a year to out-of-pocket payments by \nthe year 2002.\n  By the year 2002, the average beneficiary will pay $900 more a year \nin out-of-pocket health care expenses. These cuts will have a \ndevastating impact on the most vulnerable citizens: our frail, our \nsick, our poor, our seniors.\n  Republicans promised, too, that their budget would protect Social \nSecurity. But the GOP Medicare cuts will require the elderly on fixed \nincomes to use most, if not all, of their Social Security COLA to pay \nfor health care. For the one-in-four who\n rely on Social Security for their entire income, this is an enormous \nhardship.\n\n  Cuts in providers are often passed along to other payers, as we know \nfrom the past and as we know from the debate that we had last year in \nan attempt to revise the whole health care system.\n  I would point out that if only one-third of these cuts were shifted \nto other payers, businesses, and families would be forced to pay a \nhidden tax of $40 to $50 billion between now and 2002.\n  Provider cuts would have a particularly devastating impact on rural \nareas. Nearly one-quarter of all Medicare beneficiaries live in rural \nAmerica where there may be a single hospital serving an entire country \nor more. Significant cuts in Medicare could increase the number of \nhospitals in rural areas that will be forced to close. Since rural \nhospitals are often the largest employer in their communities, pulling \nthe plug on these hospitals will result in job loss and, most important \nand devastating, physicians leaving these communities.\n  Cuts in Medicaid would also cause the elderly to suffer severe and \nneedless pain. Nearly 67 percent of Medicaid spending is for the \nelderly and disabled. The Republicans cut Medicaid by $175 billion over \n7 years, or 30 percent by the seventh year.\n  More than 800,000 elderly and disabled people are likely to lose \ncoverage under this proposal. Between 5 and 7 million children could \ntumble through the safety net. And half of the children \n[[Page S6858]] served by Medicaid come from working families. Medicaid \nis also the only major Federal source of funding for long-term care, \nserving 1.6 million people in nursing homes in 1993, while 1.1 million \npeople receive home health care.\n  While the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid are onerous, I am also \nextremely troubled by the new 20-percent cut in mandatory agriculture \nspending contained in the Republican budget. It is a harvest of shame \nfor rural America.\n  Agriculture has become a scapegoat for our inability to\n   balance the budget. You have heard all the fictions. Agriculture \nprograms drive the deficit. Agriculture gets a free ride. Agriculture \nmakes no contribution to balancing the budget. The truth is in shorter \nsupply.\n\n  The real deficit problem does not lie in agriculture. We should give \ncredit where credit is due A hard look at the projected growth of \nentitlement spending from 1993 to 1999 demonstrates that agriculture \nspending shrinks while most of the other programs show substantial \ngrowth.\n  In fact, after a peak in 1986, agriculture spending has declined \nsubstantially. The Congressional Budget Office projects that total \ncosts for farm price support programs run by the Commodity Credit \nCorporation will decline from the $26 billion high-water mark in 1986 \nto less than $8 billion by the year 2000. This is due primarily to \nprogram reforms, including those enacted as part of the 1993 deficit \nreduction package.\n  Over the next 5 years, agriculture commodity program spending is \nprojected to decline from $10.3 billion in 1996 to $7.8 billion in the \nyear 2000. As a percentage of total Federal outlays, Commodity Credit \nCorporation outlays have declined from a peak 2.4 percent in the late \n1950's to a projected four-tenths of 1 percent by the late 1990's.\n  In spite of this downward trend, this budget contains an additional \n20-percent hit on agriculture. Let me repeat that. In spite of this \ndownward trend, this budget contains an additional 20 percent hit on \nagriculture. The effect of that cut is startling in its magnitude. It \npulls the rug out from under rural America. To reach such a number, the \nAgriculture Committee will need to take draconian action, such as \nincreasing unpaid base acreage from 15 percent to approximately 35 \npercent.\n  If that happens, I suggest that we are going to see a flight of our \nfarmers in the United States of America.\n  Moreover, these cuts will strangle our ability to craft a rational \nfarm bill this year. When added to the deep Medicare cuts that will \nclose rural hospitals, I am deeply concerned that this budget will \nsound the death knell for any semblance of quality existence for rural \nAmerica. To partially address this, I offered an amendment to reduce by \n$8 billion the scheduled $12 billion cut in government agriculture \nprograms during the budget markup. My amendment was defeated on \nstraight-line, never-swerving, solid-Republican volley of noes--no to \nagriculture and no to rural America.\n  The cuts in the Republican budget go deep and far afield to finance \nthe tax cut. Funding for income security programs is cut $118 billion \nover 7 years. Food stamps and other nutrition programs are cut by $30 \nbillion over 7 years. Some 17 percent of households receiving food \nstamps have elderly members.\n  The Republicans also take a chainsaw to the earned income tax credit. \nThe earned income tax credit helps keep working families off of welfare \nand assists middle-class families who have sudden losses of income. If \nthe chairman's mark, however, is enacted into law, the earned income \ntax credit will be cut by $21 billion over 7 years.\n  The Republicans say they will shield the Veterans Administration's \nmedical system from cuts. This is not a shield I would want to stand \nbehind. The Republican budget increases the veterans' contribution for \nGI bill education benefits. It increases the copayment for prescription \ndrugs for higher income individuals. Let us be clear. By funding the \nVA's medical system at the 1995 level for the next 7 years, the \nRepublicans\n are dramatically cutting access to health care services for veterans \nall over this country.\n\n  During markup, Democratic Senators on the committee made numerous \nattempts to soften the blow upon Medicare and other programs critical \nto working American families. We stated that any fiscal bonus that may \naccrue from balancing the budget should not be spent on tax cuts. \nRather, this money could go a long way to alleviate some of the \nhardship that would be imposed by the cuts in the Republican budget, or \nto further reduce the deficit.\n  Democratic Senator after Democratic Senator offered amendments to get \nour priorities straight and put this budget back on track. Let me \nstress--let me stress, Mr. President--that not a single Democratic \namendment would have resulted in an unbalanced budget in 2002.\n  I will go through the entire list of Democratic amendments. But let \nme give my colleagues a flavor of what the Republicans found so hard to \nswallow. We tried to get an agreement to use the tax cut bonus to ease \nthe cuts on Medicare, Medicaid, education, agriculture, and the earned \nincome tax credit. We tried to eliminate the millionaire expatriate tax \nloophole. That is the one that allows those who have benefited most \nfrom our country to avoid millions in taxes by renouncing their \nAmerican citizenship. We would have used those revenues to hire more \nofficers for community policing and to offset the cuts in veterans \nprograms and the earned income tax credit. We stood up for impact aid \neducational\n programs. We tried to prevent children eligible for Medicaid from \nlosing their coverage. Not a one of these amendments passed.\n  It is a sad commentary on our times that during the markup of the \nRepublican budget, we did not have a bipartisan approach toward a \ncommon goal. We recognize that doing so will take painful, but \nnecessary cuts and we are willing to call for the sacrifices that will \nbe necessary. They will hurt and they will be painful.\n  It is not the goal, but the distribution of the cuts in this \nresolution that is so troubling to this Senator and those on this side \nof the aisle. At a time when so many Americans are being asked to \nsacrifice to balance the Federal budget, I cannot and will not condone \na budget that contains a tax cut that is a sop to the wealthiest among \nus.\n  I cannot support a budget that makes misguided cuts in Medicare and \nother programs that improve the lives of millions of American families \nmerely to underwrite this extravagance.\n  I cannot support a budget that would lay waste to rural America and \nits fragile economy.\n  In closing, let me say that it is my hope that during the upcoming \ndebate on the Senate floor, my Republican colleagues will give serious \nand due consideration to the amendments that will be offered to \nalleviate the unfair distribution of those cuts, and to reverse the \ncourse on the tax cut.\n  Then, and only then, will we have a budget that can be supported, not \nonly by Democrats and Republicans, but all of us here working together \non the common problem that has been so well enunciated by the chairman \nof the Budget Committee: the ever-increasing deficit and the ever-\nincreasing national debt.\n  We want the American people to know and understand that we want to \ncooperate and will cooperate in a means to the end, but it must be done \nin a different fashion than has been detailed in the Republican budget.\n  If we can do that, then we will have a budget that is whole. We will \nhave a budget that could lead to an eventual reconciliation bill that I \ncould support and authorize an appropriations bill that would follow, \nthat I could recommend to the President that he sign and not veto.\n  Yes, Mr. President, the Republican majority should realize that they \nmay have the 51 votes to pass their bills, but they do not have, nor \nwill they ever muster, in my opinion, the 67 votes to override a veto. \nI respectfully suggest that this is the time to start on the road to \ncompromise and the road to reason so that we can come out of this \ndebate on a course of bipartisanship on the budget that we are going to \npass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, in the past few years, this Chamber has been \nthe [[Page S6859]] scene of historic debates on major issues of our \ntime. In January 1991, we spoke of war and peace as we gave our \napproval to the use of military force against Saddam Hussein.\n  Last summer, over the course of several weeks, we conducted a \nnationwide seminar on health care as we discussed President Clinton's \nproposal to turn our health care system over to the Federal Government.\n  In my view, both of these debates brought out the best in the Senate \nand both captured the attention of the country. It is my hope today \nthat America is watching and listening very carefully because I believe \nthat no debate is more important to our Nation's future than the one \nthat began today in the Senate and the one that began yesterday in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I believe that no votes we cast will make more of a difference to our \nchildren and our grandchildren than the ones coming and the ones we \nwill make in the next few days.\n  The Senate and our country is fortunate this debate will be led by \nthe Senator from New Mexico. No Senator has spoken with more courage \nand more conviction on budgetary issues than Senator Domenici. All \nSenators can probably find something in the Senate Budget Committee's \nproposal that we would change. For example, I will say right up front I \nbelieve that while we balance the budget, we can also provide America's \nfamilies with tax relief and our business communities with incentives \nto invest and create more jobs.\n  But no Senator can disagree with the historic nature of the Budget \nCommittee's proposal or with the fact that Senator Domenici's \nleadership has truly transformed this debate. To some, it may seem the \ndebate is all about numbers. And some very big, almost unimaginable \nnumbers will be thrown around in the week ahead. We will hear talk of \n$200 billion yearly deficits as far as the eye can see, which is what \nis contained in President Clinton's budget proposal. And we will hear \nthe number $4 trillion again and again and again which is, of course, \nour national debt--$4 trillion. But I believe the most important number \nis the one everyone can understand and the one that Senator Domenici \nmentioned. That number is $18,500. The fact is that every American now \nowes $18,500 as their share of the national debt.\n  How will Americans pay this bill? It will be paid through fewer jobs \nand lower wages. It will be paid through higher interest rates when \nthey take out a loan to buy a car or buy a home, and it will be paid \nthrough higher taxes. In fact, the Joint Economic Committee estimates \nall children born this year will pay $187,000 each--every child born \nthis year will pay $187,000 each--in taxes over their lifetime just to \npay their share of interest on the debt--just to pay their share of \ninterest on the debt. This is the future that faces our children and \ngrandchildren, and it is a future that is within our power to change.\n  In the final analysis, however, this debate is much, much more than a \ndebate about numbers. It is a debate about people, people we know in \nour hometowns and our home States, people we know all across America. \nIt is a debate about what kind of people live in America today, and it \nis a debate about what kind of America we will pass on to the people \nwho live here tomorrow--again, our children and our grandchildren and \ntheir children and their grandchildren.\n  In the coming days, America will hear two very distinct and \ndramatically different viewpoints on these questions. One viewpoint is \nthat of President Clinton and the Clinton administration. Candidate \nClinton pledged to balance the budget within 5 years, and President \nClinton, in his inaugural address, spoke of ``cutting our massive \ndebt.''\n And he also spoke about ``sacrifice.'' In fact, within hours of the \nPresident's inauguration, I said, ``I was pleased to hear the President \nuse the word `sacrifice,' a word that strikes fear in the hearts of \nmany in this Chamber. But President Clinton is absolutely right. If we \nare to put our economic house in order, if we are going to do right by \nour children and grandchildren, then we must deal with our national \ndebt.''\n\n  That is what I said shortly after his inauguration. That was January \n20, 1993. But, unfortunately, the President's actions have not matched \nhis words of that day. The President is making no attempt to balance \nthe budget. As we know, his proposed budget would give us $200 billion \ndeficits, and more, as I said earlier, for as far as the eye could see.\n  The President is making no effort to cut our debt. As we know, under \nhis own proposed budget another trillion dollars will have been added \nto our Nation's debt by 1997, not a balanced budget but another \ntrillion dollars in debt. The President is making no effort to preserve \nand protect Medicare for our children and grandchildren. He washed his \nhands of the report of the Medicare board of trustees, which included \nthree members of his Cabinet. This was not Senator Domenici's, or \nSenator Kyl's, or Senator Grassley's report. This was the board of \ntrustees' and the President's own Cabinet members' report. ``Medicare \nwill be broke within 7 years,'' they said. If that happens, you cannot \npay anybody's doctor or hospital bills. I believe we ought to fix it.\n  Senator Domenici will recall that in 1983 we had the same problem \nwith Social Security. That was 12 years ago. Then Ronald Reagan, the \nRepublican President, Speaker O'Neill, a Democrat, and Howard Baker, \nthe majority leader in the Senate, put together a commission. I was \nhonored to be on that commission along with Senator Moynihan, Senator \nHeinz, and other Members of this body, Members of the House, members in \nthe private sector, and members of organized labor. After weeks and \nweeks, we put together a rescue package for Social Security. That was \nin 1983. It was bipartisan. It passed by big margins. So Social \nSecurity, as far as I know, according to the trustees, will be in good \nshape until 2017. That was a 34-year fix. Not bad. We want to do the \nsame in Medicare. That is what is proposed by the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The President called it a gimmick. Well, Speaker O'Neill did not call \nit a gimmick, Ronald Reagan did not call it a gimmick, and we got the \njob done. We rescued Social Security from bankruptcy in 1983 in a \nbipartisan effort in this body and in the other body and in the White \nHouse, because the trustees said at the time that it was going to be \nbroke in a very short time. They are saying the same thing today about \nMedicare. I do not recall then Ronald Reagan or any Democrat, as far as \nI know, getting up and railing about, ``We are going to destroy Social \nSecurity,'' as the Democrats are doing now about Medicare, saying we \nare going after seniors, because everybody understood what the trustees \nhad told us. If we did not fix it, it was going to go broke. The same \nis true here.\n  If we do not fix Medicare, it is going to go broke. That is all the \nSenator from New Mexico and that is all this budget proposes, to fix \nit. We are not using any Medicare savings for tax cuts for the rich, as \nI hear all my Democratic friends state. Some of them are rich, come to \nthink of it. Now, the President's administration has apparently \nconcluded Americans are nothing more than a series of special interests \nwho focus on only living for today, uncaring of what will happen \ntomorrow. But the Senate Budget Committee resolution has a different \nview of what kind of people Americans are. I have a different view of \nwhat kind of people Americans are. Maybe it is because of what I have \nseen in my lifetime. I have seen Americans risk and lose their lives to \nprotect freedom. I have seen them sacrifice and sacrifice and sacrifice \nto win the cold war. The words of Winston Churchill to the British \npeople during the dark days of World War II can also be used to \ndescribe Americans:\n\n       We have not journeyed all the way across the centuries, \n     across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies \n     because we are made of sugar candy.\n\n  I do not believe the American people have come all this way only to \nallow their country to drown in a sea of red ink. That is what America \nis all about. That is what the American people are all about. Nobody \nwants to give up anything, unless we understand how critical it is. So \nthe Budget Committee resolution offers America a liferaft. We offer the \nAmerican people, regardless of party, regardless of background, \nwherever they are from, whatever State, a liferaft. It sets a course \nfor a balanced budget by the year 2002. It reverses the tide of half a \ncentury of [[Page S6860]] power flowing from our citizens and States to \nWashington, DC. In effect, it dusts over the 10th amendment, which I \ncarry in my pocket. It is only 28 words in length. It says that the \npower which is vested in the Federal Government ought to go to the \nStates and to the people. That is what this budget does. That was a \nradical theory 200 years ago. That is how old the 10th amendment is. It \nis part of the Bill of Rights and is 28 words in length. You ought to \nread it.\n  For the last 50 years, the power has been shifting to Washington, and \nwe think it is time to shift it back. We trust our Governors--Democrats \nand Republicans--in any State of America. We trust our State \nlegislatures. We believe that many times they can make better \ndecisions, because they are closer to the people, than we can here. We \ndo not suggest by that that the Government does not do a lot of good \nthings. The Federal Government does a lot of good things and we \nunderstand that. We are going to preserve that.\n  If the past few days are any indication, the President is going to do \nhis level best in the coming weeks to scare the American people, \nparticularly seniors who only have Medicare or Medicaid and Social \nSecurity. That may be all the income they have and all of the \nprotection they have. The President is going to try to frighten these \npeople. He is going to try to frighten people with children. He will \naccuse us of being heartless. He will say we are out to get Social \nSecurity and Medicare. But it is off the table here. He will say we are \nslashing programs that help seniors, the children, and the poor. The \nliberal media will, of course, report these accusations, and many \nAmericans will be led to believe it. But in the end, I believe there is \na weapon stronger than scare tactics, and that weapon is the truth.\n  One thing about the Senator from New Mexico: You can expect the truth \nfrom Pete Domenici. He will tell it like it is, even when it hurts. The \ntruth is that this budget does not slash Government spending. It simply \nslows its rate of growth. It does not slash Government spending. It \nsimply slows the rate of growth.\n  As Senator Domenici said, rather than having Government growing \nfaster than wages and salaries, which has been the case for the last \nthree decades, wages and salaries will now grow faster than Government \nspending.\n  The truth is that this budget does not touch Social Security. It does \nnot touch Social Security. But that does not mean the President will \nnot say it does not touch Social Security. It does not mean it is not \ngoing to be reported that it does, but it does not touch Social \nSecurity. I assume the Senator from New Mexico would give a reward if \none could find anything that touches Social Security in the budget.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We ought to put a new incentive in. That will be \nsomething we ought to give to people.\n  Mr. DOLE. Right. If you find something about Social Security, there \nmay be a reward for you.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. With reference to Medicare, we even suggest that in any \nreform measure, people at the low end of Social Security are held \nharmless. That is figured into savings. They do not suffer a loss in \ntheir Social Security check. That is even built in, in addition to \nSocial Security being off the table.\n  Mr. DOLE. It is not a benefit or advantage to seniors.\n  The truth is--and this should all be about the truth, not about what \nis reported--that this budget will shrink the Federal bureaucracy, \nbeginning right here in Congress, with a 7-year freeze on congressional \nsalaries and a $200 million cut in the legislative branch budget. This \nreaches out to Americans in need. For example, we will spend $534 \nbillion on Medicaid over the next 5 years, reflecting a 20-percent \nincrease over that period.\n  The truth is that this budget begins the process needed to preserve, \nimprove, and protect Medicare. This budget acknowledges that we must \ntake action to save Medicare by slowing its annual growth rate.\n  But let there be no mistaking about what we are proposing. Let the \nSenate be very clear about it. Over the next 5 years, we will spend \nover $1 trillion on Medicare. That is an increase of $178 billion. Let \nme repeat: We will spend over $1 trillion on Medicare, an increase of \n$178 billion over what we would have spent if we froze Medicare \nexpenditures at today's level.\n  Despite the overheated rhetoric coming out of the White House, we are \nnot talking about cutting Medicare. Later in the debate I think the \nSenator from New Mexico will have a very interesting chart that ought \nto make Senators' eyes pop out. The statement made by President Clinton \nnot long ago.\n  We are not even talking about freezing Medicare. We are simply \nsuggesting we must find ways to slow the rate of growth. Slow the rate \nof growth. It is not about paying for tax cuts, it is about saving \nMedicare. This is a fact and that is the truth.\n  I do not care how many people stand on the floor on the other side, \nand there will be a storm of rhetoric on the other side about cutting \nMedicare for taxes for the rich. Not true. It is not true. We are \ntrying to save Medicare, just as we saved Social Security in 1983. We \nwill do it.\n  If they want to stand on the sidelines, and the President wants to be \na.w.o.l., absent without leadership as he is almost every day, that is \nall right with us. The American people will remember who was carrying \nthe heavy water up here. As my friend, Senator Gramm says, ``Who was \npulling the wagon?'' They are not going to pull any wagons on the other \nside. We will have to pull the wagon. It will be uphill. It will not be \neasy.\n  I might add here that the President's rhetoric about Medicare rings \nespecially hollow given the fact that his own health care plan included \na $180 billion reduction in Medicare and Medicaid spending. We do not \nhear much about that on the other side. We do not hear much about that \nin the White House.\n  In last year's health care bill, it was there--$180 billion in \nMedicare and Medicaid spending reductions. Now, the President said at \nthe time, that is not a reduction. Again, I will leave that up to the \nSenator from New Mexico to explain at a later time.\n  The fact that Mrs. Clinton said in testimony before the Senate \nFinance Committee, ``We feel confident * * *. We can reduce the rate of \nincrease in Medicare without undermining quality for Medicare \nrecipients.'' That was not anybody speaking but Mrs. Clinton, who was \nin charge of the Government-run health care plan advocated by President \nClinton. Fortunately, it failed. In her own testimony before the \nFinance Committee, ``we can reduce the rate of increase in Medicare \nwithout undermining quality for Medicare recipients.''\n  Now, what has happened in a year? Nothing has happened. So if they \nwere right then, and we are right now, I guess we are both right. And \nthe President ought to go back and read his own statements and read \nstatements others in the administration have made.\n  I would take the President's budget rhetoric a little more seriously \nif he would offer the American people an alternative, besides his \nstatus quo proposal that Senator Domenici said even the Washington Post \ncalled ``weak and directionless.'' Believe me, that was in the \nWashington Post, and they do not often criticize Democrats for anything \nin this town. That was in the Washington Post, believe it or not.\n  Mr. President, we can and must do much more than simply maintain the \nstatus quo as the President has proposed. We can and must set the \ncourse to a balanced budget. And we can and must reduce the tax burden \non America's families.\n  Mr. President, I believe that long after we are gone, future \nhistorians will look back at this moment, the rest of this week and \npart of next week, look back at this debate and say, ``Here's where the \ncourse was set. Here's where the dye was cast.''\n  It is up to Congress to determine what their conclusion will be. Will \nthey conclude that here were the people who blew the last chance to \nchange the status quo? Is that what they will write in 30, 40, 50 \nyears? Or here were the people who ensured that the America of the 21st \ncentury would be one of low wages, high taxes, and fewer opportunities? \nIs that what they will write? Will they look back to 1995 and say, \n``Here's where the American dream died, right here, right in this \nChamber. Right in this Chamber, because we did not have the courage to \ndo what the American people want us to do, or have the courage to do \nwhat we know we should do.'' [[Page S6861]] \n  Are they going to say all those things? Are they going to look back \nin 10, 20, 30, 40 years and say, ``Here were the men and women of \ncourage. Here were the people who made tough decisions and ensured that \nAmerica's best days are yet to come. Here were the people who ensured \nnothing less than the survival of the American dream.'' The choice is \nours, and the time is now.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, \nSenator Frist, would like to speak.\n  Senator Dole, I might say I greatly appreciate the remarks, and I \nthink the American people would know what the majority leader said here \ntoday is very, very important, and part of our efforts to get this \nbudget resolution passed. I am very appreciative of this help.\n  The leader commented on the Senator from New Mexico, and he has been \nvery supportive, as clearly indicated. We have a job to do and we want \nto get it done. I am most appreciative.\n  Let me just say a couple of things very, very quickly. The budget \nresolution before the U.S. Senate does not have any tax cuts in it \nuntil the budget of the United States is balanced, and until it is \ncertified to be balanced by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  So, whatever the talk about cutting taxes versus how we balance the \nbudget, the truth of the matter is we balance this budget and we do not \ncut taxes in doing that. We change programs. We alter and reform \nprograms. We get to balance. Then there is a dividend, an economic \ndividend, that in this budget resolution is directed to be used by the \nappropriate committee for tax cuts, and tax cuts only.\n  Then it is interesting, people are talking about tax cuts for the \nrich. Frankly, we passed overwhelmingly--but for one vote, everybody \nelse voted aye--a Boxer-Brown resolution in that committee that said 90 \npercent of any cuts that were forthcoming after we are in balance would \ngo to people with $100,000 or less.\n  We will hear a lot about other things, but the truth does not lie. \nThe budget resolution is there to be looked at, and that is the way it \nis.\n  I yield Senator Frist 15 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have been in this body for a little over \n5 months now. It is very clear to me where the problem lies. As P.J. \nO'Rourke has said, ``Giving power and money to Congress is like giving \nthe car keys and whiskey to teenage boys.''\n  The problem is that this Federal debt, the cost of increased Federal \nspending, year after year, has grown out of control. The debt is \napproximately $4.9 to $5 trillion by the end of 1995, and it will grow \nto $6.8 trillion in the year 2000. If we do nothing, $8 trillion in the \nyear 2010.\n  They are big numbers. In individual terms, what do they mean? They \nare even more frightening. A family of four currently pays $440 per \nmonth just to pay the interest on the national debt. A child born this \nyear will pay over $187,000 in interest alone on the national debt over \nhis or her lifetime. By the year 2000, the debt will reach $6.8 \ntrillion, nearly $100,000 for a family of four.\n  The reason for the problem is this excessive, wasteful spending. In \nWashington, unlike the private sector from whence I came just 6 months \nago, people use this word ``cut,'' and when we reduce spending in the \nFederal Government from 5 percent to about 3 percent, people say this \nis a huge cut. The American people do not look at that as a cut. They \nknow that it is slowing the increase in spending.\n  It is almost as if a person went in and asked the boss for a raise of \n$500 per month, and he said I will only give $450, and then the \nemployee would call that a cut in salary. The American people are too \nsmart for that.\n  Mr. President, while we must listen to the American people in working \nthrough the best way to structure arriving at a balanced budget and \nlooking at this Nation's spending priorities, we must, over the next 5 \ndays, maintain our resolve to put the long-term interest of this \ncountry over the short-term special interests that will likely become \nprominent in this debate.\n  I intend to vote for this budget because it and it alone will achieve \nbalance by the year 2002. And what is the cost of doing nothing? The \nPresident of the United States has put forward a budget which we will \nbe discussing which does nothing, which continues $200 billion deficits \nnext year, the year after that, the year after that, the year after \nthat, adding each of these years up to a huge additional $1 trillion to \nthis debt. These are ballooning deficits. We cannot continue these \nendless mountains of debt again and again. It is not common sense. It \nis not what Tennesseans told me again and again as I traveled to the 95 \ncounties of Tennessee this past year.\n  If you need further proof, look at the outside independent analysts. \nLook at the GAO, the CBO, the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and \nTax Reform. Again and again they state the obvious, that present trends \nare clearly unsustainable. The General Accounting Office in ``The \nDeficit and the Economy,'' in April 1995 says, ``Continuing current \nspending and taxation policies unimpeded over the long term would have \nmajor consequences for economic growth.''\n  And the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform says:\n\n       Absent policy changes, entitlement spending and interest on \n     the national debt will consume almost all Federal revenues in \n     2010. In 2030, Federal revenues will not even cover \n     entitlement spending.\n\n  Yes, in just 15 years, spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Social \nSecurity, on Federal pensions and on interest on the Federal debt, will \nmake no money available for Government, for roads, for education, for \ndefense. Now is the time to balance the budget.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says:\n\n       Current fiscal policies literally cannot remain unchanged \n     indefinitely: At some time, action will have to be taken to \n     bring Government borrowing under control or servicing the \n     Federal debt will require unsustainable tax rates in future \n     years. Prompt action would limit the damage that occurs when \n     Federal debt crowds out capital investment, putting upward \n     pressures on interest rates. It would also limit the size of \n     the needed changes in fiscal policy.\n\n  Let us talk a minute about what all these statistics mean to the \naverage American in this country. Americans are currently paying almost \n2 percent more in interest rates than they would if we had a balanced \nbudget. What does that mean to the typical American? It is as extra \n$1,248 per year on a $75,000 mortgage at an interest rate of 8.75 \npercent. It means an extra $900 per year on a car loan of $15,000 at an \ninterest rate of 9.75 percent. Again, with my background as a \nphysician, coming to the U.S. Senate from the private sector, what \namazes me most is that Medicare will be bankrupt in the year 2002 \nunless we act; bankrupt--part A, hospital expenditures for our senior \ncitizens and individuals with disabilities. We will talk a lot about \nMedicare over the next several days but the bottom line is that in just \n7 years, unless we act, seniors will not have hospital insurance in the \nUnited States.\n  We are going to continue to lose the war on poverty unless we act, \nand this budget does act. The Federal Government currently runs over 75 \ninterrelated and overlapping means-tested welfare programs. Between \n1964 and 1994, welfare cost the taxpayers $5 trillion in 1993 dollars. \nYet the official poverty rate is 15 percent, nearly 4 percent higher \nthan the all-time low experienced in 1973, a low of 11.1 percent.\n  If we do nothing, we will continue to have a Government that is too \nbig, and the American people want a smaller, less intrusive Government. \nOur Government is too intrusive in our daily lives. It is a Government \nthat strangles economic growth and innovation. If we look at spending \non regulatory agencies, Federal regulatory agencies, it totaled $14.4 \nbillion in 1993. Increased spending on the Federal bureaucracy in \nrecent years has allowed the Federal Government to regulate nearly \nevery aspect of our daily lives.\n  There are numerous other examples. The Food and Drug Administration \nhas grown from 4,400 employees in 1970 to over 9,000 employees, yet we \nstill hear again and again that pharmaceutical agents and drugs that \nare finally approved in this country had been approved on the average \nabout 6 years earlier in other countries.\n  The President himself, in speaking to the AARP last week, said, ``I \ncannot support the status quo and neither can you.'' And that is what \nthis balanced budget is all about. Yet that is what he has done, \nsupport the status quo. He has offered no budget to speak of. And I \nlook forward on this floor to hearing [[Page S6862]] the debate on the \nproposed budget, the budget as proposed by the President. He has made \nno effort to balance the budget, yet the American people call every day \nfor a balanced budget. The American people recognize that only by a \nbalanced budget can we restore the American dream.\n  You can see if the Democrats, the other side, cannot see fit to cut \nspending sufficiently, the only answer will be a tax increase.\n  So what is our solution? It is the budget laid before you today, the \nRepublican budget. And Republicans will tell the truth. Yes, there will \nbe some restructuring and there will be adjustments associated with \nthis budget. But they are nowhere near--nowhere near--the distortions \nthat others are spewing forth. Let us examine some of the claims and \nthen tell what the facts are.\n  Bureaucracy. Some say the Government bureaucrats will lose jobs and \nthe economy as a whole will suffer because of reduced Government \nspending. People say we cannot go that fast.\n  The budget proposal today put forward shrinks the Federal \nbureaucracy, eliminates more than 100 Federal departments, agencies and \nprograms. The budget put forward today abolishes unnecessary \nbureaucracy, eradicates, gets rid of, Government waste, terminates \nduplication, and consolidates Federal programs to improve efficiency \nand priorities. And that is what the American people want. They \nrecognize we need to pull back. But they want us to prioritize \nappropriately.\n  Not only will this be good for the Federal budget but it will be good \nfor the recipients of Federal benefits today, who are out there trying \nto do their best to make sense of the maze of regulations before them. \nThere is no doubt this budget will result in greater economic growth.\n  On Medicare, some people say Medicare cuts are going to devastate our \nseniors and our entire health care spending. It is not true. As pointed \nout by the majority leader, we will be spending over $100 billion more \nin Medicare in the year 2002 than we do today.\n  And with regard to the social safety net, Social Security is put on \nthe side. It is outside of this budget. We do nothing to attack Social \nSecurity. But then some people come forward and say we will leave \nchildren homeless and starving in the streets. In truth, our budget \nprovides a safety net for those truly in need. It provides transforming \nnew programs to empower the underserved, the poor, the indigent. This \nbudget moves power and money out of Washington back to people, and that \nis what the American people are calling for. It does it by working \ntoward block grants for Medicaid, block grants for welfare, child care, \nand other social services. The bottom line is that we empower \ncommunities, empower citizens to make decisions over their lives. The \ncruelest thing we can do to the poor, to the underserved, is to \ncontinue to fund certain assistance programs today without serious \nreform. Over half of the AFDC families today remain on welfare for 10 \nyears or more.\n  One in three children today in the United States is born out of \nwedlock. In some low-income neighborhoods it is 8 out of 10 children, \nand those children are three times more likely to end up on welfare.\n  In 1960, nearly two-thirds of households in the lowest income group \nwere headed by people who worked. By 1991 that figure had plummeted \nfrom two-thirds to only about one-third, and only 11 percent of welfare \nhousehold heads were working full time year round.\n  Yes. The collapse of work and family has spawned crime, drug use, \nviolence in schools, and other social ills. The people who suffer the \nmost today are our children.\n  So we all know that the rhetoric we will hear over the next several \ndays will be about hurting children. In truth that is just a \nsmokescreen, a smokescreen to hide the fact that our big Government \nsolutions have failed. I am confident by turning over our welfare \nassistance programs in large part to the States will result in \ninnovation, creation of new ideas which can be adopted similar to those \nof Governor Thompson of Wisconsin, Governor Engler of Michigan, and \nGovernor Weld. No longer will welfare be a way of life with regard to \ndependence on others.\n  In closing, the Republican budget has its benefits. We will hear \nabout those again over the next several hours.\n  Lower interest rates: Lower interest rates which will affect nearly \nevery American, allowing him or her to participate in the purchase of a \nnew home or a new car for less money. Lower interest rates to make it \neasier to start a business, to keep a family farm in business, or for \nexisting businesses to make new investments. And new investments result \nin more workers, and more workers mean more jobs.\n  Yes. We will see greater economic growth, greater economic growth \nthat will result from a greater amount of capital available for \nborrowing. Right now, the Government is using our Nation's capital, \ncapital that businesses and individuals could be using to invest in new \nventures. New ventures mean more jobs with higher incomes.\n  And in closing, a balanced budget by the year 2002 will result in a \nstronger America today, and a stronger America tomorrow means that all \nAmericans will benefit.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before I yield, let me thank Senator \nFrist for his marvelous remarks.\n  Let me suggest that the Senate is very, very well served in the \ndecision that this eminent surgeon made to get into politics. From my \nstandpoint, I kind of wondered why because he does heart transplants \nfor little children, an expert in the field. It made him very renowned. \nBut I am very pleased he made the decision. He adds a lot of \ncredibility, sincerity, and knowledge to our debate on health care. And \nwe look forward to using him in the debate when Medicare comes up with \nsome additional time. I am very appreciative of his remarks.\n  We understand Senator Grassley was going next because there were no \nDemocrats here. If they would let us do that, then we will yield to two \nSenators on that side for two consecutive ones.\n  How much time does Senator Grassley desire?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Twenty-five minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 30 minutes to Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to first commend the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee for his leadership in \nputting this budget together. But in addition to saying those few \nwords, I want to say to the American people that a lot of times an \nindividual wonders whether one person can make a difference. As far as \nthis budget debate is concerned, the person of Senator Domenici and his \nleadership as chairman, and the responsibility that goes with that, \ndemonstrates clearly what we all know in America. If an individual puts \ntheir mind to it, that one person can make a difference.\n  So I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I, without interrupting after this, just say I \nthank Senator Grassley very much. I very much appreciate that.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the chairman for his leadership again.\n  Because their budget represents a vision, it also represents a plan \non how to get there to carry out that vision. This budget is \nconspicuous in that it is the only plan before this body that will have \na real vision, and will have credibility in the process. The hallmark \nof this budget is that it balances present-day needs with long-term \nneeds. That is quite a balancing act. But it does it well because it \ndoes it for children, it does it for senior citizens, it does it for \nthe needy, and it does it for the forgotten taxpayers of America. This \ndoes not forget the taxpayers. It is not just a bottom line in the year \n2002 that we are talking about, because that is balanced. But it also \nis balanced between our long- and our short-term needs of society.\n  I do not think that any Republican who voted for this in committee, \nincluding the chairman himself, however, thinks that or makes a claim \nthat this is a perfect document. There are elements in here that each \none of us dislike. I will mention a couple for myself \n[[Page S6863]] because I am not going to speak on the negative aspects \nof this. But I do think that we ought to make it clear that there might \nbe some things we would rather have differently.\n  For me, representing an agriculture State, I suppose I could say I am \nnot satisfied with the agriculture numbers. However, I had a chance to \naddress this in committee, and I did it with a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment to limit the savings from commodity programs. We farmers know \nagriculture must contribute toward deficit reduction because we know \nthat people in agriculture, including the family farmers, will benefit \ngreatly from the lower interest rates that result when you have a \nbalanced budget.\n  I also do not like Medicare numbers. But the issue there is to take \nimportant steps to keep this bankrupt program solvent, and of course \nviable both in the short term as well as the long term. The point, Mr. \nPresident, is balance, and this budget has balance.\n  It also contains some very important national goals, and I want to \nbegin my remarks by pointing out some of them. It provides a vision. \nThat vision is to preserve opportunity and the American dream for \nfuture generations. We intend with this budget to stop the practice of \nallowing their generation to live high on the hog and have the next \ngeneration pay for it. That, Mr. President, is a moral issue.\n  Next, this budget is balanced. This is a goal shared, as you may \nknow, by more than 80 percent of the American people. Yet, however, \nthere is only one party that has delivered a plan to balance the \nbudget; that is, this side, the Republican side, of the aisle. It is \nvery clear that the Democrats cannot put one together because that \nparty it seems happens to be the party of the status quo. It is the \nparty of business as usual. I have no doubts in my mind that they do \nnot propose a balanced budget because they are the party that was \nroundly rejected by the voters in the November election last. Those \nvoters, those very same voters by an 80 percent majority, want our \nbudget to be balanced and the sooner the better.\n  Next, our budget confronts in a very responsible way the Medicare \ncrisis. The other side of the aisle is running away from the challenge \nof shoring up the Medicare program, running away from the fact that the \nMedicare program is bankrupt. They happen to be doing it on Medicare \njust like they are running away from the challenge of the deficit. \nInstead of being responsible, and instead of offering constructive \nsolutions to ensure the viability of Medicare, not only for this \ngeneration but for future generations, they are engaging in a campaign \nto scare the senior citizens of America and to scare the wits out of \nthem.\n  It is somehow like a campaign staff has taken over the policy staff. \nThis is a completely irresponsible posture on their part.\n  I just stated the broad goals of our budget, Mr. President. But there \nare others that are reflected in this plan. I want to state them but \nmore briefly. It moves money and power out of Washington and back to \nthe States, the citizens, and our communities. It substantially reduces \ncorporate welfare spending. It provides for maximum crime control to \nkeep Americans safe by protecting funding for the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration and the FBI. It provides a safety net for the truly \nneedy with emphasis upon children.\n  It protects Social Security. It protects our national security. It \nprotects the school lunch and school breakfast programs. And it adds $2 \nbillion for supplemental food programs for WIC. It eliminates over 140 \nagencies, programs, and commissions in the downsizing of government, \nincluding the Cabinet-level Department of Commerce. It eliminates \nbureaucracy, waste, duplication, and overhead, and it consolidates many \nGovernment functions, privatizes many others, and improves Government \nefficiency.\n  Now, Mr. President, it does all this while allowing spending to grow \nby 3 percent per year instead of the projected 5 percent. Government \nspending will still grow by 3 percent.\n  Now, there are a lot of people listening who are going to be \nirritated because Government spending is going to grow by 3 percent. I \nrun into this when I meet with Iowans in town meetings because I \noverhear concerns that 3 percent growth is irresponsible when you have \na $4.7 trillion deficit. These responsible constituents are greatly \nconcerned about the future of their children and grandchildren \nbecause--do not forget--the most important thing that we can do for \ntoday's children, the most important thing we can do for today's \nchildren is to not leave them trillions and trillions of dollars of \ndebt to pay off.\n  If you are really concerned about children, we must denounce policies \nthat are based upon a philosophy of materialism today and to heck with \ntomorrow. We cannot go on borrowing money today at the expense of \ntomorrow's needs. We must find a balance, and that is what this budget \ndoes--a balance between today's needs and our responsibilities for \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, that is the good news about this budget. But all of \nthese positive elements seem to get lost in the rhetorical barbs \nlaunched by the other party and in the news coverage of this budget \nreported to the American people. I think I know why. That is because, \nas we have been reading recently, the media have a penchant for \ndelivering the most negative of news. And the other party, quite \nfrankly, knows this and plays to it. And it makes very great TV. But \nhow responsible is it?\n  There is one other important aspect of this budget that has not been \ntalked about much, and it should be. And that is this. There is no pay \nraise in this budget for Members of Congress. There is no pay raise for \nMembers of Congress for the next 7 years until this budget is balanced, \nuntil we have earned a pay raise.\n  There are also changes in the Members' retirement system to bring it \nmore in line with private sector retirement systems. This pay freeze is \nimportant for two reasons. First, it ties Members' pay to our \nperformance in attacking the deficit. It says, ``Don't even think about \na pay raise until you get the budget balanced.''\n  The second reason is even more important, and I wish to commend again \nour distinguished chairman for the implicit leadership in what this pay \nfreeze states. It says, in effect, we are leading by example. We are \nleading the way toward a balanced budget by denying ourselves any more \npay over the next 7 years. And as a result we are not asking Americans \nthen to do what we are not willing to do for ourselves. When people \ncome into my office and ask why we are slowing the growth of their \nbenefits, I can look them in the eye and say we are denying ourselves \nany growth as well. As a result, this Republican budget, in my view, \nearns the moral authority to ask everyone, to ask everyone to pitch in \nand to help balance the Federal budget.\n  So, Mr. President, the Republican balanced budget contains a positive \nvision for present-day America but also for future generations of young \nAmericans. We balance present-day needs with the need to preserve \nfuture opportunity. Meanwhile, there is no alternative vision proposed \nby the other side. All they seem to offer is business as usual.\n  By definition, the absence of a bold vision is the continuation of \nbusiness as usual. If Americans ever wondered which party is a party of \nthe status quo, let there be no doubt now.\n  I wish to describe this symptom, the symptoms of defenders of \nbusiness as usual. They use half their ingenuity to get us into debt \nand the other half they use to avoid pain--paying it off. Their \nphilosophy is live within your income even if you have to borrow to do \nit. They simply refuse to reconcile their gross habits with their net \nincome.\n  What does a budget look like that subscribes to this philosophy? I \nthink, Mr. President, that we have a very good example of this budget. \nIf you look at this budget, you see the President's numbers here. You \nsee a budget that is never balanced into the future--not only not \nbalanced but the deficits go up and up and up.\n  Now, Mr. President, you look at the Senate budget that we are \ndebating right now and you see it gradually going down and by the year \n2002 it is in balance. This zero here represents no more accumulation \nof debt. But if you look at the difference between this budget and this \nbudget, the space in between, you see the accumulation of $1.5 trillion \nof debt. That is on top of the $4.9 trillion debt we have this very \nday. [[Page S6864]] \n  This chart shows it very simply. It shows two directions into the \nfuture. That top line is business as usual, and it spells disaster for \nour children. The bottom line, the Domenici budget, the one that is \nbalanced, that is the only alternative. It presents only vision for the \nfuture. That happens to be our plan, the Republican plan, the plan that \nwas approved last week by the Senate Budget Committee.\n  You see from the chart the President abdicated his leadership this \nyear in the budget process. My Democrat colleagues in this body now \nhave to decide a simple question. Do they follow their leader in \nabdication and risk being the party of abdication or do they offer the \ncountry their vision in the form of an alternative? That is the \nquestion. It is easy to say what you are against, but what are you for? \nThe American people want to know. The American people have a right to \nknow.\n  During deliberations in the committee, I read a number of quotes from \nthe Congressional Record that were uttered by Democrats on the Budget \nCommittee. They spoke those words on the Senate floor during debate on \nthe constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  I am not going to read those quotes today because I do not intend to \nembarrass anybody, but I have those quotes right here if anybody wants \nto know what they are. In sum, they said this during February: ``We \ndon't need a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. We should \ndo it in the Budget Committee.''\n  So, they implied, let us just roll up our sleeves and get to work on \na balanced budget by the year 2002. But when it came to the Democrats \nvoting on a motion by the chairman expressing the desire for a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002, all but one brave soul from the other side of \nthe aisle retreated, sounded retreat and voted against it.\n  Again, Mr. President, that begs a very important question: What is \ntheir plan? What is their vision?\n  This is then an issue of credibility. You cannot talk the talk until \nyou walk the walk. And all we hear is sniping and wailing about what \nthey are against. It is real easy to pick out a program in isolation \nand attack the whole Republican plan for a balanced budget. But until \nyou put it in the context of your own balanced budget alternative, your \nconcerns ring hollow and there is no credibility. If you want to snipe \nabout the Republican budget and if you want to have credibility in \ndoing so, you have to have an alternative balanced budget plan.\n  You might ask: Why do they have to have a balanced budget? Well, it \nis simple. The public is demanding one, and because it is our duty and \nobligation to this country's future and, of course, to the future \ngenerations of Americans. And not the least reason of which is that the \nother side said during the February debate that they wanted a balanced \nbudget. They said that during the debate on the constitutional \namendment.\n  Or, of course, they can choose the President's path, and they can put \nbusiness as usual on automatic pilot.\n  So I say to them: Show us your vision. Show us how you get us there. \nShow us how you get there in 7 years, just like you said on the floor \nin February. If you do not do that, you will be all talk and no action. \nYou will be following your leader in the White House in abdication of \nresponsibility and then you risk becoming the party of abdication.\n  Now, I think I can claim for myself, this Senator from Iowa, that I \nhave worked closely with the other side over the years for more deficit \nreduction than the leadership of their party or even our party maybe \nwanted.\n  Last year was just one of the latest examples. I happened to join my \ngood friend, Senator Exon from Nebraska, the Democratic leader of the \nBudget Committee, in sponsoring the Exon-Grassley amendment. That saved \nthe taxpayers $13 billion. I am the only Republican on the Budget \nCommittee who can claim to have voted for a Democratic budget \nresolution in getting a budget to the floor.\n  I joined the other side those times because they were responsible, \nfair, and tough on the deficit. I did so even when it meant criticizing \nthe President of my own party.\n  My colleagues on this side know full well that I have been willing to \ncriticize past Republican Presidents. And I now make this same charge \nagainst this President for the budget that he submitted this year. It \nhad no credibility regarding deficit reduction. He punted to the \nCongress. He took a vacation on reducing the deficit.\n  What I am saying now is--and I believe I have sufficient credibility \nto say it--if you do not offer a credible balanced budget alternative \nto Chairman Domenici's mark, you Democrats risk becoming the party of \nabdication as far as the public's desire for a balanced budget is \nconcerned.\n  You might even come up with a plan that I could support, as I have \ndone in the past. That is, if it were balanced. I want it balanced in \nthe year 2002 if you want me to vote with you Democrats. But until you \nwalk the walk, the credibility will not be there.\n  Mr. President, these are new times. These are times that require a \nvision. These are times that require a plan to get where you are \nviewing. You have to find a way to balance your present day priorities \nwith long-term needs to preserve the future for coming generations.\n  Mr. President, we--not just the Members of the Senate--we--not just \npeople inside the beltway--we--you, all the people of America, this \ngeneration--cannot live just for today. We have to live for today and \nwe have to live for tomorrow.\n  We on this side of the aisle have presented a vision and we have \npresented a plan to get there. The question now, Mr. President, is: \n``Where's theirs?'' I want to repeat: ``Where's theirs?\"\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and reserve it for the \nRepublicans.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in answer to my good friend and colleague \nfrom the State of Iowa, ``Where's theirs? Where's theirs?''--I assume \nwe are going to be hearing that over and over again--``Where's \ntheirs?'' was enunciated by this Senator in the remarks I made in \nopening this debate.\n  What we are trying to do, I advise my friend and colleague and \noftentimes associate, is to simply say that we are offering a series of \namendments to the Republican budget that has been offered, frankly, in \na spirit of cooperation.\n  We will be doing here essentially the same thing that we did in the \nbudget markup. And that is simply to reach out the hand of friendship \nand understanding and hopefully reach some kind of a bipartisan \ncompromise by not rejecting the budget offered by the chairman of the \nBudget Committee. But, as I said in my opening remarks, I salute the \nhard work that had been done.\n  ``Where's theirs,'' it should be understood very clearly by the \nSenator from Iowa and everyone else, that ``Where's theirs?'' is simply \nthe situation that we are trying to recognize that in some instances \nyou have done a good job. And ``Where's theirs?'' is that in good faith \nwe are trying to get you on that side of the aisle to quit knocking \ndown and rejecting every suggestion that we have made.\n  And I think that anyone who looked at the amendments that we offered \nwould have had to say that at least they were in good faith and \ndebatable. Basically what we did, time after time on a whole series of \namendments, was to say, we believe that there are some good, overall \nparameters offered by Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, in his mark. But we happen to feel that some of the cuts on \nveterans programs, on Medicare, on Medicaid, and others that we have \nannounced and enumerated--and I talked about most of them in my opening \nremarks--simply take money out of the money that is reserved for the \ntax cut that is clearly indicated in the budget in the House of \nRepresentatives and the $170 billion that is in the Domenici mark and \nreserved only for tax cuts.\n  What we are saying is, why can we not reason together? Why can you \nnot give up on the tax cut, that you want to help out and cut down to \nsome extent, a considerable extent, the hit that we think is being \nunfairly taken by Medicare, Medicaid, by farm programs, by taking away \nearned-income tax credit, by the cuts in education and others?\n  We just say, give us a little bit. Maybe we can go along. \n[[Page S6865]] \n  I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the good Senator from Nebraska for \nyielding. I want to, before I begin my formal remarks, identify myself \nwith his statements to the Senator from Iowa. The Senator from Iowa \nmade a very strong speech. ``Where's theirs?'' Well, that is a lovely \nslogan. The fact of the matter is you are going to have a chance to see \nwhat we have in mind, just as you did in the Budget Committee, where I \nproudly serve with my friend from Iowa.\n  The fact of the matter is, we are going to be offering a series of \namendments that take that Republican budget that we think, frankly, is \na retreat from the American dream and try to fix it and try to fix it \nthe way we think the vast majority of Americans would fix it.\n  So my friend from Iowa will have a chance to find out what the \nDemocrats think is important. He is going to find out, and if he acts \ntrue to course, he will vote against everything because those \nRepublicans do not want to touch the $170 billion they have reserved to \ngive tax cuts to the wealthiest. Those over $350,000 will get $20,000 \nback each and every year, while the drastic cuts in programs that my \nfriend from Iowa says, ``We're doing it for the children,'' cause \nnothing but pain for the children.\n  As we offer up our amendments, they will not change the date in which \nthis budget is in balance. It will be kept at 2002. That will not \nchange by one 1 minute or 1 day. But what will change--what will \nchange--are the priorities of this Nation, and that is why I so relish \nthis debate on the budget and why I was so honored to go on the Budget \nCommittee of the U.S. Senate. I served on the House Budget Committee as \nwell, because what could be more important than what we spend \ntaxpayers' money on? What could be more important than that? When you \nread the preamble of the Constitution--and I recommend that you do it \nas often as possible--you will find out that we do have to establish a \nsystem of justice, that we do have to provide for the common defense, \nthat we do have to promote the general welfare and make sure that the \nblessings of this great country are endowed on future generations. That \nis the function of the U.S. Government.\n  Now, we can argue around the edges, but it is our responsibility to \nfulfill that very solemn pledge we take when we raise our right hand \nand we swear to God that we will, in fact, uphold this Constitution \nfrom enemies both foreign and domestic. I take that oath very \nseriously. I think that the budget of the United States of America is \nwhere we lay out for the American people how we hope to do that.\n  Mr. President, I believe this budget resolution, this Republican \nbudget resolution is a cruel retreat from the American dream because \nit, among other things, will take money out of the pockets of working \npeople, college students, senior citizens and place it in the pockets \nof the wealthy. It is Robin Hood in reverse. It is just what we should \nnot be doing.\n  When I listen to some of the debate and I hear my colleague, Senator \nGramm from Texas, and I have heard him say it many times, he says, \n``What I want to do as a Republican is take the money out of the \npockets of the Government and put it in the pockets of the people.'' \nWell, if he believes that, he will not support this Republican budget, \nbecause this Republican budget takes money out of the pockets of the \nseniors, out of the pockets of the students, out of the pockets of \nthose who work so hard and earn $28,000 a year or less, and what does \nit do? It puts it in the pockets of the wealthy. That is wrong. That is \nwrong, and that is what has been hidden in this debate and that is why \nI relish this debate.\n  When I say that this budget is a cruel retreat from the American \ndream, I know what I am talking about because I am a product of the \nAmerican dream. I am a first generation American. My mother never \ngraduated from high school. Both sides of the family escaped from \noppression, and it was America that gave us the dream. If there is \nanything that I am going to do--anything that I am going to do in the \nSenate--it is to make sure future generations of Americans have the \nsame chance that I had as a little girl growing up in a tiny little \napartment.\n  In this great Nation, my father could get an education, the first \nchild in a family of nine to go to college, and he went at night and \nworked hard, and he worked by day. Then later, when he had a couple of \nchildren, he worked hard and he went to law school at night and became \na professional. He did it because of America. They were able to save \nand send their children to college. One is a professor and another is a \nU.S. Senator. That is the American dream, and this budget is a cruel \nretreat from the American dream.\n  What really riles me is that Republican after Republican will get up \nand say, ``We're doing this for our children. This is a gift to our \nchildren.''\n  I will tell you what kind of gift it is. Imagine you are a little kid \nand you get a big box for your birthday and it is wrapped in a \nbeautiful ribbon and you open it up and nothing is in it. There is \nnothing in this budget for children--nothing.\n  Children are attacked in this budget. Education is slashed in this \nbudget, and I am looking forward to working with my colleague from \nIllinois, who you will hear from soon, and with Senator Kennedy, and \nwith Senator Harkin to restore those cuts in education and, yes, I say \nto my friend from Iowa, we will make that amendment revenue neutral. It \nwill not change your balanced budget one bit. But you will have to walk \nthe line and send a message to the children. Do you really care about \ntheir education? Do you care about the fact that in your budget there \nwill be 550,000 fewer children in Head Start; that the average college \nstudent will have to pay nearly $5,000 more for a loan, and if they are \na graduate student, between $3,000 and $6,000 more for a loan.\n  We are going to fix that in the context of your budget. If you want \nto vote against it, that is fine, but do not tell us that we are not \nacting responsibly, because we are going to give you amendment after \namendment. We are going to give you one on Medicare. We are going to \nsoften the hit.\n  In California, we have over 3 million people on Medicare. Let me give \nyou a portrait. The average woman of Medicare age today has an income \nof $8,500 a year. Think about that. In the Republican budget, that \nelderly woman, that grandma or great-grandma will have to pay $900 more \na year out of her pocket for medical care, and the care will be worse \nand her choices will be taken away. So do not tell her that she is \ngetting a gift in this budget. She is getting hit.\n  When I was growing up, my mother and father taught me to respect the \nelderly. That is not respecting the elderly, to take that money out of \nher pocket and put it in the pocket of someone who earns $350,000 a \nyear. Forget it from this Senator. I will fight that as long as I have \nlife in me. That is disrespect. And we talk about V-E Day. I heard the \nchairman of the Budget Committee talk about V-E Day. I want to talk \nabout V-E Day, because I had uncles who went to war, World War II.\n And I have friends who fought in Vietnam and in Korea. What is the \ngift to them in this budget? We cut out veterans benefits, and for \nthose men who fought, we cut their Medicare. Oh, that is a great gift \nfor our elders to celebrate V-E Day. This is a cruel budget, and it \ndoes not have to be. As my friend from Nebraska said, you just take \nthat money that you squirreled away in your little lock box there very \ncleverly--but it is there--and you back off that, and let us talk \nbusiness. Let us ease the burden on our veterans. Let us ease the \nburden on our children. Let us ease the burden on our seniors, and we \ncan do it in a fiscally responsible way.\n\n  I want to talk a little bit about some of the investments that we are \nwalking away from in this budget. And before I do, I want to make one \nmore point about how this budget hurts those making $28,000 a year or \nless--families making $28,000 a year or less, working.\n  Under Ronald Reagan we started the earned income tax credit. He said \nit was the best antipoverty program he had ever seen. What does it do? \nIt says to those hard-working Americans who earn under $28,000 a year, \nwe are going to ease the burden of your payroll taxes and we are going \nto allow you to [[Page S6866]] pay fewer taxes. What does this \nRepublican budget do? It pulls back on that program, and it will mean \n$1,600 more over seven years to those hard-working families--$1,600 \nmore in taxes for those people. I cannot understand it. We are raising \nthe taxes of people who earn under $28,000 a year, who work mightily \nhard for that money, and we are lowering the taxes of those who make \nover $350,000 a year.\n  There must be some symmetry here. I told you before how we are \nhurting those students who have student loans. It is going to cost them \nmuch more over their lifetime. Do you know what it costs to go to a \nprivate college today? It is $15,000 to $20,000 a year. After the \nRepublicans get through with this budget, only the wealthy will be able \nto go. They are getting $20,000 a year back. So if they have a student \nin their family, Uncle Sam just paid the way. But if you are middle \nclass, look out, it is going to cost you almost $5,000 more a year, \nmiddle-class students for undergraduate, and between $3,000 and $6,000 \nmore for graduate school, at a time when we know we must be the best \neducated in order to compete in the world. This Republican budget is an \nembarrassment to the values of America.\n  I want to talk about another shortsighted area. National Institutes \nof Health. These are the scientists that get grants, who do the science \nto find the cures to diseases. You think about the disease in your \nfamily that you have seen, or among your friends, be it heart disease, \nhigh blood pressure, AIDS, cancer, or be it Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, \ncystic fibrosis, you can name them. Everyone has been touched by \nsomething in their lives. The NIH, National Institutes of Health, gives \nout grants to scientists, and we have created Nobel Prize winners and \nthey are finding the cures for disease. I had a meeting with Dr. Varmus \nwho heads NIH in my office yesterday, and this budget is even worse \nthan I thought.\n  Under current funding, for every four grants that are approved--in \nother words, if scientists come forward with a good possibility of \nfinding a cure for a disease, one in four of those applications is \napproved. I wish we could approve and fund all four. We can fund one in \nfour. Under this Republican budget, we will be lucky to fund 1 in 100 \nnew applications--1 in 100. Now, you do not have to be too smart to \nknow that this is shortsighted. We are one plane ride away from \ndisaster. You have read about this ebola virus. We are one plane ride \naway from disaster, and we are unilaterally disarming our scientists in \nthis country.\n  Now, I have to say this. I believe if I went up to one of my \nconstituents who earned $350,000 a year and I said, ``What would you \nrather have, a tax break, or you could take that money and you could \nbring home a cure for cancer?'' I honest-to-God believe they would say, \n``My goodness, Senator, if you could promise me that, certainly I would \ngive that tax break up.''\n  So what are we doing in this budget? We are retreating from the \nAmerican dream, we are walking away from science, we are giving up in \nthe face of international global competition. And what for? My friends \nwill say that it is all worth it. It is all worth it--hurting the \nseniors--although they will say to you, ``We are not cutting Medicare, \nwe are just lessening the increase.''\n  Let me tell you about that myth. When more people turn 65 and older, \nit is going to take more money to cover those people. And, guess what, \nwe are living longer and do we not like to have our grandmas and \ngrandpas around? With better technology, it costs more for the Medicare \nProgram. I do not think we want to deny our grandmas and grandpas the \nbest technology. I know I do not.\n  So they are going to tell you that the Democrats are exaggerating the \npain of this budget. We are not exaggerating the pain of this budget; \nwe are telling you the truth, and we are telling you the only reason \nyou are being asked to take this pain--the children, seniors, veterans, \nthe scientists, education, and the rest--is to give big tax breaks to \nthe wealthiest among us. I say this budget should be defeated. We \nshould argue the facts. We should bring the facts to the American \npeople, and I hope they wake up and participate in this debate and \nengage in this debate and let their leaders know this budget is not a \nblueprint for the future, it is a blueprint for disaster.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding and I \nthank him for his leadership. It is not easy leading a group of \nDemocrats who wander all over the place on these issues. Senator Exon \nhas done an admirable job. I also commend Senator Domenici for moving \ntoward a balanced budget here. I think he has shown courage and the \nkind of leadership that is needed. I heard Senator Grassley say, ``What \ncan one person do?'' I think Senator Domenici has contributed.\n  I am concerned. I wish this were backed up with a balanced budget \namendment for two reasons. One is that the reality from all of the \neconometric studies is that interest rates would really come down if we \nhad this backed up with a balanced budget amendment. The financial \nmarkets do not know whether this is going to stick even if it stopped \nit. And I think there is good reason to believe it may not stick.\n  Our history--and I see the Senator from Washington on the floor, who \nwas here when we voted for Gramm-Rudman--is that we keep legislative \nsolutions for a balanced budget about 2 years, and then they become too \npolitically awkward and we give them up. If we had a constitutional \namendment, we would have, at a minimum, another $170 billion that could \nbe available for education and Medicare and other things.\n  One of the ironies is that the AARP, which understandably is \nconcerned with what is happening in Medicare, was opposed to the \nbalanced budget amendment which could, today, make more money available \nfor Medicare.\n  I am also concerned, and I mentioned this in the Budget Committee, \nthat our atmosphere has become more partisan than it should be. We \nreally ought to be working together on these things.\n  I am not blaming either party. This thing has just kind of grown over \nthe years. I do not think it is helpful to either party or to the \nNation.\n  I voted for Senator Domenici's resolution to have a balanced budget \nby the year 2002. I voted against the final package because I believe \nthe priorities are wrong. I think they are wrong for the reasons I will \nspell out here.\n  First of all, they assume that there will be a tax cut if we have \nsome interest savings. This is not the time we should have a tax cut. I \nface a choice of giving myself a little bit of a bonus--I do not like \npaying taxes any more than the Senator from Michigan or the Senator \nfrom Nebraska or anyplace else--giving myself a little bit of a bonus, \nor giving my three grandchildren a bonus and making life better for \nthem.\n  I do not think Americans have any hesitancy in saying, ``Let's get \nthat deficit down. Let's not give ourselves a tax cut.'' The tax-cut \npremise is wrong. I know Senator Domenici had to fashion a compromise \nhere. Our colleague from Texas is going to offer an amendment to \nspecify more clearly a tax cut. I hope his amendment is resoundingly \ndefeated.\n  Second, I am concerned what is happening to education. My friend, \nSenator Grassley, mentioned this is a choice between their budget and \nthe status quo. Well, in the field of education, status quo would be \nappreciably better than cuts in the field of education.\n  Every study--I do not care whether it is by a conservative think tank \nor a liberal think tank--every study that questions how we build a \nbetter America says we will have to invest more in education. Yet this \nbudget goes in the opposite direction.\n  Title I, which helps poor kids, and has done some real solid things, \nthe reality is that if this is adopted, young people in Chicago, East \nSt. Louis, Detroit, Omaha, Seattle, and other places represented in \nthis body, will see some cuts. Head Start is going to be cut back. The \nstudent loan--part of this bill is that there will be rescissions that \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee has to make. The Presiding \nOfficer sits on that committee. That committee will have to make $14.7 \nbillion worth of savings on student loans. [[Page S6867]] \n  Now, the document talks about cutting back on graduate education. If \nwe totally eliminate assistance for graduate education, we save $2 \nbillion. That in itself, I think, is wrong. But that leaves $12.7 \nbillion that we still have to get. That means, clearly, we will have to \ncharge interest while students are in college. That will make it \ntougher for them when they get out of school, and I also think will \ndiscourage some from going to school.\n  I think it moves the country in the wrong direction. This is the kind \nof issue where, frankly, instead of devising a partisan document, I \nhave enough confidence in the Senator from New Mexico, the Senator from \nWashington, and the Senator from Michigan, that if we could have been \nable to sit down in a bull session and say what really are the national \npriorities and forget whether the Democratic or the Republican Party \ncan benefit from it, I do not think we would have been cutting back on \neducation.\n  I heard Senator Boxer talk about cutting back on NIH, the National \nInstitutes of Health, in the research area. I remember Senator Harkin \nspeaking on this floor, mentioning that we have spent as much in the \nlast 7 years on military research as we have spent on health care \nresearch since the beginning of the century. I have never checked out \nthat figure, but it was a startling figure. It is probably close to \naccurate, if it is not completely accurate.\n  I saw my father die of leukemia. So I have been interested in what \nhas happened in leukemia research. I have seen great progress. My \nfather died in 1969. Today he would have a real chance of living. I see \nthe progress that is being made, and I want to continue that progress \nso that humanity can benefit. I think that is what people want.\n  Just today in the town meeting every Thursday that Senator Carol \nMoseley-Braun and I have for our Illinois constituents, the multiple \nsclerosis Father of the Year was there with three fine young boys and \nhis wife. Just a marvelous family. He is a lawyer by background, \nstruggling just to walk. How I would love to see some kind of a \nbreakthrough that could help him and his family. But it will take \ndollars to do it. When we cut back on dollars for research, we are \npreventing breakthroughs that we need.\n  Now Medicare and Medicaid. I do not suggest that they do not have to \ntake some hit. The growth is clearly excessive. But the kind of hit we \nare talking about is going to hurt a lot of people. While we have \ntalked primarily about Medicare, I am concerned on Medicaid, too. Half \nthe people on Medicaid are children--poor children. I do not think the \nAmerican people want to cut back on health care for poor children. Yet \nthat is what happens.\n  Then I heard Senator Grassley say in the Budget Committee, \naccurately, he said there is only one sacred cow in this--I am not \ntalking about agriculture here, Senator Exon--there is only one sacred \ncow in this budget. That is defense.\n  I do not think there is any question that that is accurate. Yes, we \nhave cut back defense spending some. But relative to what other nations \nhave done, we have not done it much. We are spending more than the next \neight nations combined are spending on defense.\n  We are continuing to spend money on B-2 bombers. What is the purpose \nof a B-2 bomber? To penetrate Soviet radar. There are only two \nproblems. There is not any Soviet Union and there is not any Soviet \nradar. They are useless. We could not use them in Desert Storm. We do \nnot use them in Haiti. We do not use them in the practical problems \nthat we face. We are spending money for yesterday's war. We can cut \nback and do better.\n  There are a number of other things that I think are wrong in this \nbudget, including one small one. I was pleased to have Senator Bond \nfrom your side of the Budget Committee vote with me to restore this. \nThis is the antifraud compliance group that will save $5 for every $1 \nwe put into it. The estimate is if we have this antifraud compliance \ngroup in, the IRS, we will save $9.2 billion over a 5-year-period, I \nbelieve the estimate was. And we are talking about a 7-year budget.\n So it would be significantly more than that.\n\n  I understand when people say we should not have any tax increases, \nthough frankly I think we should be more candid with the American \npublic that, of the 224 industrial nations, we are 224th in the \npercentage of our income that goes for taxation. We have the lowest \ntaxes on gasoline, for example, of any country outside of Saudi Arabia. \nYou go through a whole series of things like that.\n  But for people who say we do not want any tax increases, I \nunderstand. I do not understand why, when so many of us pay taxes and \ncomply with the law, we do not want to go after those who are cheating. \nThat is what that amendment does. Senator Glenn and I will have an \namendment on the floor to deal with that.\n  Finally, I would like to deal with Senator Grassley's question, What \nare we for? First of all, you will see in a series of amendments that \nwe will be proposing what we are for in terms of shifts. Senator Exon \nwill have at least one amendment. Senator Kennedy will have an \namendment. Others will have amendments. But there will also be an \namendment that some of us will offer, a more comprehensive amendment. I \ndo not know how many votes we are going to get. I hope there will be \npeople on the other side of the aisle who will look at this carefully. \nI think the priorities are wrong here.\n  That we should move toward a balanced budget, absolutely. Pete \nDomenici is to be commended for moving us in that direction. But that \nwe should have priorities that hurt the most vulnerable in our society, \nI do not think that makes sense. I do not think that is what the \nAmerican people are for.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time back to Senator Exon.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois and my \ncolleague from California, who spoke before him, for their excellent \npresentations and the direct way that they tell what we are trying to \ndo to be constructive on this side of the aisle. I very much \nappreciated the dedicated work of both of them on the Budget Committee. \nThey have been extremely helpful, very helpful in the markup process. I \nthank them for their excellent remarks to set the record straight about \nthe constructive posture we are trying to take on this side of the \naisle.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from the great State of Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member. As the \nSenate begins its debate on the concurrent budget resolution, I would \nlike to offer a few comments also on the work of the Budget Committee, \nand especially on a subject about which I have had a particular \nconcern, and that is the subject of the tax cut; whether it makes sense \nto have tax cuts at this time part of the budget resolution.\n  The first thing I want to do is praise the Senator from Nebraska, not \nonly for his work on the Budget Committee but for the fact that he was \none of the very first Members of this body to point out--and to join me \nin my efforts to say--we really cannot consistently say we are trying \nto reduce the deficit and have tax cuts. So I appreciate his leadership \non that. He has done that consistently throughout the Budget Committee \nprocess.\n  I also want to commend the whole Budget Committee and its chairman, \nthe Senator from New Mexico, for the work that was done on the \nconcurrent budget resolution. As the debate unfolds on the concurrent \nresolution, there will be a lot of opportunities to criticize the \nparticulars of the document and proposed changes to it. I expect to do \nboth of those things. That is the nature of the legislative body and \nthe consequence of the diverse priorities that are represented here. \nBefore that debate, though, Chairman Domenici should be lauded for his \neffort. I was especially pleased with his ability to keep the budget \ndeliberations in committee clearly focused on the issue of reducing the \ndeficit.\n  We have different approaches to how we get there, but there has to be \na unified, bipartisan commitment that at the end of this budget \nresolution we will have a resolution that calls for a date certain--and \nI think it should be the year 2002 or earlier--for a balanced budget to \nbe achieved.\n  Those who are serious about deficit reduction have to make tough \nchoices about where and how much to cut, and I think we have to make \nthose choices right now. When I ran for the Senate, I \n[[Page S6868]] proposed a specific plan that would have provided for a \nbalanced budget by the year 1998. I still think that would work. But at \nthis point, given the realities, if we can get this done by the year \n2002, I think it would be a very significant achievement.\n  But as chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, \nfaced not only the same tough choices the rest of us had to face, his \nchoices had to achieve a consensus out of the committee so he could get \na majority. I will add that the ability of the Budget Committee to \ncraft a document that at least the majority party argues achieves a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002 does underscore my belief that we do \nnot need, and did not need, a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget.\n  How can this process even be unfolding if we need a balanced budget \namendment? The line was they simply will never get down to business if \nwe do not change the Constitution. But the product of the Senate Budget \nCommittee proves that we did not have to mess around with the \nConstitution, we just had to get together in committee and on the floor \nand do the job now.\n  I think that is very important because people lose sight of the fact \nthat we devoted a month out here to discussing the balanced budget \namendment. I think we did the right thing when we defeated it.\n  But now we have the opportunity to show not only that it was not \nnecessary, but that we did not have to wait for the States to ratify it \nand sort of get started on the project late in this decade, but that we \ncan do it right now. We can do it this very year through the budget \nprocess. I know it is tough. I know some Budget Committee members are \non record supporting significant tax cuts. Obviously every Member of \nthe Senate would love to be able to vote for tax cuts.\n  But the chairman of the Budget Committee rightly decided that the \nfirst priority of the committee is not tax cuts but deficit reduction. \nThe Senator from New Mexico is absolutely right and, given the \npolitical pressures he faced in this regard, I think he deserves credit \nfor his efforts. He tried. He tried very hard. He came up short, but he \nimproved the House version, the version of the other body, which \nprovides for even more enormous tax cuts.\n  So that was progress. I wish I could say, though, that those efforts \nspelled the end of the push for tax cuts. I regret that even the Senate \nbudget resolution itself leaves the door wide open for tax cuts. Do not \nlet anyone tell you the Senate budget resolution does not contemplate \ntax cuts within this 7-year period. It does and they would be very \nlarge; to the tune of, apparently, at least $170 billion.\n  That document creates a special budget surplus allowance dedicated \nsolely for tax cuts. Although I certainly think an excellent job was \ndone in many respects, that special fund is an invitation for trouble \nif we are going to reduce the Federal deficit and eliminate it. The \n$170 billion tax cut fund is a cookie jar. It is a special fund put \naway that could be used for deficit reduction, or to restore the \nMedicare cuts and the student loan cuts and the agriculture cuts that \nare a part of this document.\n  I have to reiterate, we could get more deficit reduction or we could \nstill have a completely balanced budget by the year 2002 and not do \nthose very harsh cuts to the tune of $256 billion to Medicare. We need \nto eliminate this kitty, this cookie jar for the tax cut. Not only is \nit $170 billion but the special fund will almost certainly lure \nproposals to enact even more significant tax cuts. I do not think that \nis the chairman's intent. In fact, I think it is just the opposite. But \nI think that is what will happen. And once the focus of our work is \nshifted from deficit reduction to tax cuts, I think it will be a very \nshort route to another tax-cut bidding war.\n  If we have that war it will undo the progress we made in the 103d \nCongress and the further progress I think the Budget Committee is \ntrying to make with regard to reducing the deficit. In fact, it was \njust that kind of tax-cut bidding war in the 1980's that got us into \nthis terrible mess in the first place.\n  A major tax cut is not only fiscally imprudent; it may undermine the \npublic confidence we have to have to pursue the painful cuts necessary \nto balance the Federal budget. The tax cut may be the crown jewel of \nthe Republican contract, but it is really a lump of coal for the \nchildren and grandchildren of our future who get stuck with the debt \nand paying interest on the debt because we did not have the guts to \neliminate the tax cut today.\n  If the American people believe we are playing it straight with them, \nthat the cuts we enact are fair and honest, then they will support the \nwork product and make the sacrifices needed for a balanced budget \nwillingly. If, however, they believe that this process is nothing more \nthan politics as usual, that we are enacting a fiscally irresponsible \ntax cut for the sake of a political agenda, then they will rightly \nquestion the sincerity and fairness and prudence of the cuts in the \nbudget package, and any hope for progress on this will be dashed.\n  Inclusion of any type of a major tax-cut measure in this year's \nbudget resolution sends us in the wrong direction. Deficit reduction \nhas to be our highest priority, not tax cuts. Enacting tax cuts at a \ntime when we are still fighting the deficit could well hurt those \nfamilies whom the tax cut is supposed to help.\n  It is the middle class who will bear the brunt of the higher interest \nrates that could be triggered by a tax cut, and their children who will \nbear much of the burden of the continually escalating national debt.\n  Mr. President, this should not be, and I do not think this really is \na partisan issue.\n  For my own part, I have opposed the tax cut proposals that Members of \nboth parties have offered.\n  Last November, I opposed the tax cuts included in the Contract With \nAmerica. But I also opposed my own President's tax cut plan on the day \nhe announced it.\n  Since then, some of both parties have advanced tax cut proposals. But \nI am happy to say that Members of both parties have joined me in \nchallenging the wisdom of these proposals. The momentum in this body is \nagainst a tax cut. The momentum was begun by the good work of the \nBudget Committee which at least relegated the tax cuts to this cookie \njar. That was the first step. The whole Senate should finish it off. \nLet us get it off the table, and make this budget about one thing and \none thing only; and, that is, getting rid of the Federal deficit once \nand for all so the people in this country can get rid of that sick \nfeeling in their stomachs that the people out here in Washington are \nnot responsible with their tax dollars, so that kind of bipartisanship \nis encouraging, not only the issue of tax cuts, but also on the issue \nof deficit reduction in general.\n  The growing bipartisan opposition to the tax cut stems from a belief \nthat deficit reduction is the higher priority, that the savings \ngenerated by these very, very tough spending cuts have to be used for \ndeficit reduction and not tax cuts. In that common belief we ought to \nbe able to find the common ground that can be the basis of a truly \nbipartisan budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, as I said, before, I stand ready to participate in \nsuch an effort, and I am sure that many of the people on our side of \nthe aisle share that view.\n  Because the actual work of reducing the deficit requires hard \nchoices, it is so very easy to stray away from that chore.\n  It becomes even more tempting to avoid that responsibility when \nsomething as highly charged and politically appealing as cutting taxes \ncompetes for our attention.\n  For this reason, the chairman of the Budget Committee again should be \ncommended for keeping the primary focus of his work and his committee's \nwork on deficit reduction instead of reckless tax cuts.\n  So, though I have a number of significant differences with the \nchairman's proposal, and especially a tax-cut cookie jar, I did want to \ntake this opportunity to thank him for his work.\n  At the end of the day let me conclude by saying that you cannot have \nit both ways. You cannot say we absolutely must make big cuts in \nMedicare and farm programs, student loan programs, you cannot say that \nyou have to get this done by the year 2002, or we will have a terrible \nfiscal mess, and then turn right around and say we have \n[[Page S6869]] plenty of money for $170 billion or $300 billion of tax \ncuts. You cannot have it both ways. As we say back home, you cannot \nhave your cake and eat it too. Mr. President, I would suggest you \ncannot have your deficit reduction and eat it, too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to yield to Senator Gorton as \nmuch time as he desires. I wonder before he speaks if he would yield me \n1 minute.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear once and for all. The budget \nthat we put before the Senate is a deficit reduction budget. It is a \nzero deficit in the year 2002, no games, no smoke, no mirrors. The \nfirst actions of the U.S. Senate when they implement this will be to \nget to a balanced budget. For anyone talking about tax cuts prior to \nbalancing the budget, just get hold of the budget resolution and read \nit. If there is anywhere in there that you can find that, then \nobviously I will not only come here and apologize but clearly, clearly \nit will be a budget that I did not produce. So somebody put words in \nthat I do not understand, that I did not know were there. That is point \nNo. 1.\n  Point No. 2: The way this budget is structured, you will get to \nbalance. You will have all the laws changed that get you to balance. \nThat is frequently called a reconciliation bill, a big bill that will \nchange the entitlements permanently.\n  You will then ask the Congressional Budget Office. Is it balanced? \nWhen they say yes, and only then is the 170, perhaps 170. It might be a \ndifferent number, depending upon the Congressional Budget Office \nevaluation of our path. There will be an economic bonus.\n  The American people are entitled to an economic bonus, and we say \ngive it to them in tax cuts. But only then, and we also pass the \nresolution that the tax cuts, 90 percent of them, have to be for people \nearning $100,000 and less. All of the rest of the talk about tax cuts, \nI would hope everyone understands you are talking about something that \nis not before the Senate. And I am not suggesting you cannot talk about \nit or you should not. But I hope everybody knows that is not the case \nin this budget. Balancing the budget is the primary responsibility.\n  For anyone who wants to balance the budget, and then turn around and \nsay now that you have it balanced, start spending again, it is \nbalanced, you have it in balance, there is an economic dividend, start \nspending it again--have at it.\n  I just do not believe the American people believe that, for they will \nsay that is just the same old thing. That is spending again. We say \nwhen you get to balance give the American people a break.\n  I now yield to Senator Gorton, and he will manage the floor for a \nwhile.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for one unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. GORTON. Certainly.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that staff \npeople, two fellows, Danielle Rose and Lauren Ewers be granted \nprivileges of the floor during the debate on the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Would the President notify me when I use 15 minutes?\n  Mr. President, I must start by saying that perhaps some of the \ncriticisms of the position of the Democratic Party that have been \nlevied in the last few days, and even here this afternoon, may be a \nlittle bit overstated. It has been our position that the opposition to \nthis budget resolution are totally defenders of the status quo, that \nthey do not wish to make any changes whatsoever, that they do not care \nabout a balanced budget. But several of them have already told us that \nis not true, that everything they propose will continue the balance and \nthe resolution produced by my distinguished friend and colleague from \nNew Mexico. Mr. President, if that is the case, the Domenici budget is \nalready a landmark of progress for this country. And I fervently hope \nthat those statements do turn out to be true, though I may be a skeptic \nuntil I see it proven.\n  Under those circumstances, the accusation of the defenders of the \nstatus quo will be appropriately directed only at the White House and \nat the administration.\n  My friend from Iowa earlier this afternoon pointed out that this \nyellow line describes the budget deficit for the next 5 years under \nfigures provided by our Congressional Budget Office if we are to pass \nthe President's proposed budget. This is what happens under the \nPresident's budget, and the proposal that was presented by Members on \nthe other side when they offered us a huge tax increase 2 years ago to \nlower the budget deficit. Well, in all 5 of those years we will have \nthat huge tax increase in place. But the budget deficit will go up each \nand every year.\n  That, Mr. President, is the status quo. That was what the \nadministration proposed to us. That is what was defended for at least a \ncouple of months by Members on the other side of the aisle while we \nstrove mightily to come up with something that would put this country \non this line, a line ending in a balanced budget in 7 years, exactly as \npromised in the constitutional amendment defeated by only a single \nvote.\n  So perhaps we have made a huge degree of progress. We have the other \nparty repudiating this line and accepting this line.\n  My colleague from New Mexico has invited any Member of the other \nparty during the course of the day to propose the President's budget, \nso that we all may vote on it and determine whether or not there is \nanyone in this body who wants to do this. And I hope and I believe that \nif no one from the other side of the aisle makes such a proposition, we \nwill put it out here for debate and for a vote ourselves because its \nrepudiation will show that great progress has been made in agreeing at \nleast on the desirability of balancing the budget.\n  But, Mr. President, my skepticism remains because at the same time we \nare told that all of the amendments will do nothing but redistribute \nvarious functions but will continue this line, we are told, no, no, we \ndo not have an alternative budget--not here. Now, that political party \nin the House of Represenatives has an alternative budget to what is \nproposed in the House. Do you know what it is, Mr. President? It is \nessentially the Domenici budget. It looks good over on the other side \nof the Capitol but not here. No, they say, what we will do is propose \nindividual amendments, each of which will maintain this balance.\n  Now, what, Mr. President, is the difference between going at it that \nway and making an overall budget proposal which continues us on this \nline? Well, it is very simple. You can use the same money over and over \nand over again. Each time an amendment is defeated that would cut the \ndefense budget in order more generously to fund one of their favorite \nprograms or would go into the reserve fund to fund one of their \nfavorite programs, each time such an amendment is lost, you can do it \nover again. You can use the same money for a different spending \nprogram.\n  Between the first two Senators who spoke on that side, there were \neloquent demands for more money for education, for veterans, for health \ncare, for the National Institutes of Health, less of a slowdown in the \noutrageous growth in the earned income tax credit, and more money for \nagriculture.\n  Now, Mr. President, there is no possibility that they could produce a \nbudget that did all of those things in half the amounts outlined by the \nSenator from California without a huge tax increase. But if they do it \none amendment at a time and lose one amendment at a time, they can use \nthe same money over and over again. And perhaps, Mr. President, my \nskepticism is fed a little bit by the fact that that is exactly what \nthey did in the Budget Committee. I kept notes as a member of that \ncommittee, and 14 amendments from that side proposed increased \nspending; 6 of them proposed actual tax increases over the present \nlevel; 5 used the reserve fund, there for the possibility of tax cuts \nif we do our job right; 2 others \n[[Page S6870]] reduced those proposed tax cuts, and 3 reduced \nexpenditures for defense below the President's proposals which \nthemselves already call for reductions, real reductions in every year \ncovered by his budget.\n  That is what we will get here, Mr. President. The one uniting factor \nover there is a total anathema with respect to the remote possibility \nthat someone's taxes somewhere in the United States might be reduced.\n  Now, as the Senator from New Mexico said, we do not propose a tax cut \ndirectly in this budget. We propose to get to this zero figure on the \ndeficit, and we are told that if we do so, not just in a budget \nresolution but by passing actual binding laws which change spending \npolicy so that we can get to this point, the economy will react. \nInterest rates will be lower. We will find 170 billion more dollars \nbecause of a better economy over the course of the next 5 years.\n  And incidentally, Mr. President, those reductions in interest rates \nwill knock into a cocked hat all the statements about student loans \nmade by the Senator from California. They are based on what interest \nrates are going to be if you adopt the President's budget. That is the \nset of circumstances under which interest rates like that will be \ncharged someone, young people or others.\n  So we say that if we go through this exercise, if we balance the \nbudget, if we improve the economy, if we lower interest rates, perhaps \nthe American people ought to get a dividend.\n  Now, why is it difficult to come to a compromise in cases like this? \nBecause of the way that it is characterized. The Senator from \nCalifornia and others, when they talk about tax cuts, say a tax cut is \ntaking money out of the pockets of the poor and putting it in the hands \nof the rich. That stems from an attitude that all the money in the \nUnited States of America belongs to the Government, and if we are good \nlittle children, maybe it will give us back something that we earned \nourselves.\n  Our position is that the American people, when we have done our job, \nought to be allowed to keep and determine the spending habits of a \nlittle bit more of the money they have earned and have less of it taken \naway from them and handed to someone else, and that is a very, very \nprofound difference.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator from Washington yield for \na question?\n  Mr. GORTON. I certainly will.\n  Mr. GREGG. To the Senator from Washington, is it not my understanding \nthat this budget resolution brought forward by the Republican Senate \nMembers on the Budget Committee, for which no Democrats voted, has in \nit language which says that to the extent there is this tax cut as a \nresult of the bonus that would occur to the American people by getting \nto a balanced budget, the dividend occurs as a result of interest rates \ncoming down, this $170 billion tax cut--and as the Senator points out \nthe actual bonus to the American people would be lower interest rates \non everything, and it would represent billions and billions of dollars \nin savings to the American people. But if that happens, does this \nresolution state that 90 percent of this tax cut, to the extent it is \ninstituted, should go to people with incomes under $100,000? And is \nthat the new definition of wealthy from the other side of the aisle, \npeople with incomes over $100,000?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from New Hampshire is 100 percent correct. It \nis interesting that in its initial form that proposal was made by one \nof the Senators on the other side who already this afternoon in the \nChamber has talked about these huge tax cuts for the wealthy. Yet, it \nwas that Senator who, with our help, earmarked any reduction that we do \nget for middle-class working Americans. We felt that was a good \namendment, and we felt that those middle-class, hard-working Americans \nought to be allowed to keep a little bit more of what they earn and \ndetermine how to spend it themselves.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire's comments lead me to another point. \nWhen we speak about $170 billion in this period in savings in interest \non the national debt, which we then can return to the people in the \nform of lower taxes, but which the other side wants to spend before we \nhave even earned it--they are spending this dividend, and in every one \nof the amendments we get they will be spending this dividend before it \nis ever earned.\n  But that is only the savings on the interest on the national debt, on \nthe Government's debt. There are hundreds of billions of dollars more \nthat will be in the pockets of individuals because they will have paid \nlower interest rates on their mortgages, on their installment credit, \non the money they use to begin new small businesses and the like. That \nis the purpose of the budget which we seek.\n  And I want to return to my first comments. I think we have already \nhad a tremendous triumph. I suspect we are not going to get anyone on \nthe other side coming in and giving us an amendment to pass this \nbudget, and I suspect when they vote on it, they are going to end up \nvoting against that budget. But we have already triumphed. We have \nalready come to an agreement that we ought to be on this road here, the \nroad to a balanced budget.\n  The differences will be that, with all of these huge amounts of \nspending, trillions of dollars in this period of time, we hope that 1 \nor 1.5 percent of it, if we do do our job, might be left in the pockets \nof middle-class working American citizens at the end of this entire \ndebate. We think they can do a better job of spending it than can the \nGovernment of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I need to \nmake my presentation. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to do \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, with this resolution, we begin a new \nphase in the debate over the Federal budget.\n  I am sorry that the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, is not on the floor, because I want \nthe Record to reflect not only my admiration but my respect for that \nleadership that he has provided in the Budget Committee and, in fact, \nthough we may disagree with several parts of the budget resolution that \nwas produced, it was the intention of the Budget Committee chairman to \ndo as efficient a job as he could, and I commend him for it.\n  The debate about whether we should move toward a balanced budget is \nover. There is a consensus that we should do just that. It crosses the \naisle that divides us. We Democrats are committed to a deficit-reduced \nbalanced budget in the interest of the financial stability of our \ncountry. And we have no less credentials to do that than our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle. I hope that, during my comments, we will \nbe able to make a clear distinction about how we get to that point.\n  There are differences about whether we balance the operating budget \nor whether we include Social Security in the budget calculation, which, \nastoundingly, on the Republican side it has been part of a structure to \ninclude the balances from Social Security, the surplus--and I talk to \nsenior citizens across this country--to use their trust funds, \nsacrosanct, committed, reserved for the time they need it. No, we are \ngoing to do some funny accounting to get to the point that we want to.\n  I come from the corporate side of the business world, as do many of \nmy colleagues. I know one thing: If I were to project sales and \nearnings for my company over the next 5 to 7 years and I said, ``We are \ngoing to make lots of money and here is how much we are going to make, \nwe are doing this in revenues and here is how much we are going to \ndo,'' and I failed to tell the public that I am going to include the \nemployees' pension fund that my company does not own--it is the \nemployees'--in the figures--and I said this in the Budget Committee--\nyou would be led out with a raincoat over your head and hands tied \nbehind your back, escorted by U.S. marshals.\n  So, first of all, we get to a balanced budget using some smoke, some \nmirrors, and some significant gimmicks. We try to remove the Social \nSecurity balance and say, let us fight for a balanced budget without \nthat. Oh, no, [[Page S6871]] that could not happen. So there are some \ndifferences.\n  Americans, however, want to reduce wasteful spending in both parties, \nDemocrat and Republican, have got the message.\n  So, as we work on this resolution, the budget issue has changed. Now \nthe issue is not whether we reduce spending and move toward a balanced \nbudget. The issue is: How do we do it? Whose benefits will be cut? Who \nwill win? Who will lose? Because this is somewhat of a seesaw. As long \nas we stay within the parameters of balance, when one side goes down, \nthe other side goes up. And, most fundamentally--and I put this board \nup--the question is: Whose side are we on? Whose side is the Government \non?\n  This is the issue that, unfortunately, continues to divide our two \nparties. We Democrats believe that Government must stand on the side of \nordinary, middle-class families, on the side of senior citizens who \nworked to build this country, who presented us with perhaps the best \nhalf century or four decades that this country has ever seen, not by \njust their participation in World War II, Korea, the other wars that \nhave come by, but at the same time building this country's fundamental \nstructure.\n  The other part is children. Two sides: One is to take care of the \nfuture, invest with and in our children, but at the same time not \nforgetting our obligations to the senior citizens; and on the side of \nthose who really must struggle to survive.\n  But the new majority has a very different philosophy, and a different \nconstituency. The Contract With America, as it is commonly called, is a \ncontract with the most powerful, wealthy members of our society. It \nwould provide huge benefits to millionaires and special interests, and \nit would force the ordinary American to foot the bill.\n  Perhaps nothing illustrates the differences between our two parties \nmore than the Republican proposal for massive Medicare reductions to \npay for tax cuts for the rich. I think it is outrageous. And I intend \nto fight it as hard as I can, just as I did during the Budget \nCommittee's deliberations.\n  Mr. President, the average Medicare beneficiary has a rather modest \nincome and, conversely, at that stage in life, typically, they have \nvery high medical expenses. Seventy-five percent of those folks have \nincomes under $25,000--75 percent, incomes under $25,000. Not much to \nlive on, especially if you live in higher cost areas. Thirty-five \npercent have incomes under $10,000.\n  These folks cannot afford massive cost increases. And they should not \nbe forced to give up their own doctor or to sacrifice the quality of \ntheir care.\n  Over the past 2 weeks, Republican leaders have tried desperately to \njustify huge Medicare cuts by pointing to projected shortfalls in the \nHI trust fund. But the argument is bogus. If we need to shore up the \ntrust fund, that does not mean that we need to take a whack at Medicare \nrecipients.\n  There are other places in the budget to find savings. It is only a \nquestion of priorities.\n  These are my priorities.\n   Before we burden more of our struggling seniors, we ought to go \nafter special interest tax breaks, we ought to eliminate funding for \nthe space station, we ought to terminate unnecessary weapons systems, \nwe ought to abolish special subsidies for the timber industry, the oil \nindustry and the gas industry and the ranching interests, and we ought \nto eliminate an array of other wasteful or low-priority spending.\n\n  Of course, Mr. President, there can be debate about the specifics, \nbut there should be no disagreement about this priority, this \nprinciple. I enunciate, we should not be cutting Medicare just to fund \ntax cuts for the rich.\n  In the Budget Committee, I offered an amendment to shift funds from \ntax cuts for the wealthy to restore funding for Medicare and Medicaid. \nMy amendment was defeated when every Republican opposed it, without \nexception. We just heard from our distinguished colleague from \nWashington who said that there was not a Democrat that joined the \nRepublican majority when the Budget Committee denied amendments and \npassed this budget resolution. But I ask, if the same speech that is \nmade on the floor of this Senate would be made in a town meeting back \nhome in whatever the town and whatever the State, and look in the faces \nof the senior citizens and say, ``Listen, we're going to make it easy \nfor you by adding more expense to your already burdened budgets in \nhopes that if we give a tax cut to the rich, if we give a guy earning \n$350,000 a year a $20,000 tax reduction that he is going to invest it \nin some way that will stimulate our economy.'' We just have to hope he \ndoes not put it in some dormant tax-exempt bonds, or something like \nthat, because that is not going to help.\n  To justify their opposition to some of these things, the Republicans, \nonce again, said, ``Oh, no, not us, that's not what we want to do.''\n  So I pointed out that the Republican leadership in both the House and \nthe Senate did support such cuts and did support the House bill that \nessentially was in the works. This was no secret. The House had passed \nthe bill giving a $20,000 tax break to those earning $350,000 in a \nyear.\n  I went a step further. I said, ``OK, if you're really not going to \ncut Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the rich, let's put it in writing \nand make it enforceable.'' So I offered an amendment that would have \nmade it out of order to consider any bill that cut Medicare or Medicaid \nto pay for tax cuts for the rich.\n  Under the amendment, I suggested it would have taken a supermajority, \n60 votes, to take up that kind of a proposal. Simple enough to say that \nif you wanted to offer tax cuts and decided to cut Medicare or \nMedicaid, that it would take this supermajority 60 votes to do so. What \ndo you think? Every Republican on the committee voted against that, \ntoo. Why? I do not know. Obviously, they think tax cuts for the rich \nare more important than other priorities, the thing we were discussing \non the floor here.\n  Mr. President, it should be obvious to everyone that the Republican \nParty really does plan to cut Medicare, to cut Medicaid to pay for tax \ncuts for the rich. But they go out of their way to obscure what is \nreally going on. So we have developed a nomenclature for the reserve \nthat CBO is likely to put up once this budget is believed to be \nbalanced. It is called an economic dividend. It is called a fiscal \ndividend. They do not say that it is for tax cuts. Just a wink of the \neye. Everybody knows it.\n  We have heard some of our colleagues from the Republican side who \nhave declared their intention to run for President demand that tax cuts \nbe included. One suggested that a filibuster would be in order on the \nfloor of the Senate to make sure that tax cuts are in place. Our \ndistinguished majority leader did say in a speech that he made that tax \ncuts are in order in terms of a budget resolution. So we ought to call \nit like it is. Make no mistake, the fiscal dividend is really \ndisguised, but down deep it is simply a tax cut for the rich.\n  There should be little confusion about this. We know that CBO will \nscore the indirect benefits to the Government of reconciliation. We \nknow that these benefits can only be used under this resolution for a \ntax cut, and we know that the House already has passed a bill giving a \n$20,000 tax break for wealthy individuals in a year.\n  This is what it looks like. The Republican budget. The winners: The \nrich--$20,000 tax break, corporate subsidies protected and tax \nloopholes saved. The fix is in. There is a tax cut for the rich in this \nresolution. It is a huge tax cut financed by drastic reductions in \nMedicare, or increases in Medicare costs and Medicaid subsidies. Do not \nlet anybody fool us.\n  Mr. President, I go back now to the larger question posed by this \nbudget resolution. This debate, like few others, is about to force each \nof us to make a very fundamental decision, a decision about what we \nstand for, a decision about whose side we are on.\n  I want to take a look for a minute at who wins and who loses under \nthe Republican proposed budget. The winners: The rich--$20,000 tax \nbreak, corporate subsidies are protected, tax loopholes are saved. The \nwinners are clear: Rich, corporate interests and their lobbyists.\n  Meanwhile, let us see who loses under this resolution. First, there \nare the Medicare cuts. It will cost an average couple over the 7 years \nproposed to get us to a balanced budget $6,400, and in the last year of \nthe 7-year cycle, we are looking at an $1,800 cost for that couple. \nThese, by the way, are people who [[Page S6872]] already pay a \nsubstantial out-of-pocket sum for health care. It is estimated that it \nruns about 21 percent. So if the average beneficiary is getting $16,000 \na year, it costs them $3,000 more for medical care, for health care.\n  On top of that, there are education cuts proposed. On top of that, \nthere are tax increases scheduled for hard-working American families. \nThat is a substantial one, too. By eliminating the earned income tax \ncredit, the Republicans not only will increase taxes on working \nAmericans, but they will reduce needed incentives for people to move \nfrom welfare to work. It does not make sense. It really makes one \nwonder, Mr. President, how can the Republicans cut taxes for the rich, \non one hand, and with the other hand turn around and increase taxes for \nworking Americans, people making $28,000 or less?\n  That may be the Republicans' perspective of fairness, but it is not \nmine. It is just plain wrong.\n  But one thing is becoming quite clear, and that is the sharp \ndifference between the two parties' perspectives. The Republican Party \nis willing to lay down for high-income special interests, while we \nstand up for the working people in this country.\n  So, yes, Mr. President, we are going to do a lot of fighting about \nthis budget resolution.\n In most of these fights, we Democrats are going to be joined together \nin the fight, because while we disagree with each other about a lot of \nthings, there is one thing that unites us; that is, our commitment to \nserving ordinary people, middle-class families who work hard, who \nstruggle to keep their homes together, who struggle to keep opportunity \navailable for their children, who struggle to take care of the elderly \nand the disabled--the people without lobbyists, the people without the \nbig bank accounts and without the connections.\n\n  Most of us came to the Democratic Party because we believe that \nGovernment should stand with these people. I point out, Mr. President, \nimmodestly perhaps, that I came out of the business sector and helped \ncreate an industry as well as a company. I am one of the people who was \nfortunate to be perhaps in some of the higher income brackets. But I \nbelieve that my security as a citizen, that my family's security, my \ndaughters', my son's, my grandchildren's, that my security depends on \nthe stability of our country, not on how much more money I give or \nleave my children. It depends on whether or not we have a society that \nbelieves we are all together and does not feel like the largest part is \nleft out of the loop. So I would rather invest in our people, invest in \nthe children who are going to lead this country tomorrow, provide the \nskilled work force that we need to have in order to complete; that is \nwhy I came to the U.S. Senate.\n  Perhaps our party has lost its way in recent years, and we can admit \nthat up front. We were reminded about that very sharply last November. \nBut now the chips are down. We know where the public stands. We know \nwhat people are concerned about. We know they are worried. The battle \nis now beginning in earnest. And there is no question--I said it \nearlier--about whose side we are on. That is what this debate is really \nabout. I wish it were not so. But when you get right down to it, this \nbudget is designed to decide who is going to be on the side of the \nworking people and who is going to take care of those who already have \na lot. It is a direct assault on ordinary Americans and a sop to the \nmost wealthy and powerful interests in our Nation.\n  That is not what I stand for, it is not what the Democratic Party \nstands for, and it is not what America needs now.\n  In conclusion, we Democrats may not have the votes to win in this \nbattle. We probably do not. But we are going to try and we are going to \ninsist that the votes that take place here will reflect how each one of \nour friends on the other side, as well as on our side, feels about \nwhose side they are on, and whether it is the veterans, or the \ndisabled, or the women concerned about breast cancer, about research \nfor Alzheimer's, or AIDS, we are going to be deciding now whether or \nnot those funds that are freed up as a result of the schedule to \nbalance the budget go to tax cuts for the rich, or whether we continue \nto serve the interests of the ordinary people. At least since the \ndebate will be conducted here, the American people will have a chance \nto see us discuss it, to look at the Record after the votes are cast, \nto be able to say to their Senators and their Congress people when they \ngo back home, ``What did you vote for?'' ``Why did you do it?'' and \n``Whose side were you on?\"\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I think we have been moving along quite well \nin total cooperation. I believe Senator Abraham would be next under the \nusual ruling. I have several Senators on this side who have been \nwaiting and are not asking for any other consideration other than some \ntime.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we would now go to Senator Abraham, and \nfollowing him, we would go to Senator Rockefeller, who wants 12 \nminutes, followed by Senator Kennedy, who wants 15 minutes. Is that \nagreeable so that we could have everybody know the flow?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, we would agree to that if we can then \nhave Senator Hatfield, who would like 15 minutes, and Senator Gramm who \nwould like 10 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. That would be satisfactory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate failed by one vote to support a \nconstitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. At the time, \nopponents told the Senate that balancing the budget did not require \namending the Constitution. All we needed, we were told, was to make the \ntough choices and cast the hard votes.\n  Mr. President, the hard choices are here. The budget resolution \nbefore us makes those choices and balances the budget by the year \n2002--without raising taxes and without gutting national security. It \naccomplishes this task by slowing the growth of Federal spending from 5 \npercent per year to a more reasonable 3 percent per year. In dollars, \nthat means Federal spending, under this budget, will increase from $1.6 \ntrillion next year to $1.9 trillion in the year 2002.\n  Let me repeat that. Federal spending will increase from $1.6 trillion \nto $1.9 trillion over 7 years.\n  Only in Washington would a $300 billion increase in spending be \ncalled a cut. Clearly, while the budget presents us with tough choices, \nallowing spending to increase 19 percent is not an impossible or even \nunreasonable goal. Nevertheless, some do not agree with this objective. \nAs Labor Secretary Robert Reich said on Meet the Press earlier this \nyear, balancing the budget is not a priority of the Clinton \nadministration. The subsequent budget proposal only serves to reinforce \nthat admission. According to CBO, deficits will rise under Clinton's \nbudget from $177 billion to $276 billion in the year 2000. Under the \nClinton budget the national debt will grow by $1.2 trillion over the \nnext 5 years.\n  Mr. President, what does this neglect mean to future generations? \nConsider the consequences of adopting President Clinton's budget for \nfiscal year 1996. Under that budget, by the year 1999, the total debt \nwill hit $6.4 trillion, or $27,700 of debt for every man, woman, and \nchild in America.\n  In the year 2000, interest payments on the debt will be $305 \nbillion--more than we spend on defense, more than we spend on all other \ndiscretionary programs combined, and more than we will spend on \nMedicare.\n  In the year 2010, entitlements plus interest will consume all Federal \ntax revenues, which means we must either slash spending, print more \nmoney, borrow more money, or enact draconian tax increases. In my \njudgment, they are all bad options.\n  In the year 2030, spending for entitlements will consume the entire \nFederal budget. That means nothing will be left for defense or any \nother discretionary program, including those targeted at children and \nthe poor, and it means we would not even be able to finance the \ninterest payments on the debt.\n  On the other hand, balancing the budget is not just an exercise in \ngood government. Eliminating the deficit will pay big dividends to \nAmericans in the form of lower taxes, lower interest rates, higher \neconomic growth, and the bottom line, a higher standard of living. Here \nare some of the projections: [[Page S6873]] \n  Most economists agree that balancing the budget will result in \nsignificantly lower interest rates, thereby saving the average \nhomeowner up to $500 per month on their mortgage payments.\n  According to the CBO, these lower interest rates will result in a so-\ncalled fiscal dividend to the Treasury of around $170 billion between \nnow and 2002. I believe that this dividend should be returned to the \nAmerican people in the form of tax cuts. I will support efforts on the \nfloor to do so.\n  Finally, according to the GAO, if we balance the budget by 2002, the \naverage American will enjoy a real growth in their incomes of 36 \npercent by the year 2020.\n  Given the costs of doing nothing and the benefits of taking action, I \nbelieve it is obvious that balancing the budget is in everyone's \ninterest. That leaves the question of how we get there. The budget \nbefore us shows the way.\n  At the beginning of the budget process, I set out five priorities \nthat I hoped would be embraced by the Senate budget resolution:\n  First, privatize; second, eliminate waste and duplication; third, \nreturn the operation of various Government functions to the States with \nblock grants; fourth, eliminate outdated programs; finally, fifth, \nreduce Government bureaucratic overhead. I am pleased to say this \nresolution includes all five.\n  First, it assumes we will privatize those areas of Government that \nare better left to the private sector, including the naval petroleum \nreserve, the Uranium Enrichment Corporation, and the Alaska Power \nMarketing Administration.\n  The naval petroleum reserve is a good example of why we need to \nprivatize. The reserve was created to ensure that we had sufficient \nsupplies of oil in the event of a crisis. As President Clinton recently \nacknowledged, however, that is no longer the case. As the President \nstated, the reserve's function of producing and selling this oil is a \ncommercial, not a governmental, activity.\n  Mr. President, there are many other naval petroleum reserves out \nthere. This budget identifies them and moves them out of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Second, the budget consolidates Federal departments and agencies that \nare duplicative and wasteful. The GAO reports that the Department of \nCommerce alone shares its mission with at least 71 other Federal \ndepartments, agencies, and offices. In other functions, the Federal \nGovernment operates 163 separate job training programs and has at least \n10 agencies devoted to promoting international trade.\n  Obviously, there are savings to be made by ending this wasteful \nduplication and focusing these efforts. This budget takes advantage of \nthose savings.\n  Third, we need to return government to the States. We need to revive \nthe 10th amendment which says ``the powers not delegated to the United \nStates by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States are \nreserved to the States respectively, or to the people.''\n  In my own State of Michigan, Governor Engler is out in front on \nimportant issues like welfare, Medicaid, and education reform. I know \nGovernors from other States are equally as innovative.\n  This budget takes advantage of the tremendous talents outside the \nbeltway by utilizing block grants, to replace the hundreds of Federal \nwelfare, housing, and education programs.\n  These block grants will provide Governors with the resources and the \nfreedom they need to carry out these reforms. Returning these programs \nto the States is both an exercise in good government and a means of \nreducing costs and increasing efficiency.\n  Fourth, this budget eliminates outdated programs. Programs like the \nInterstate Commerce Commission, the honey program, even the Department \nof Commerce are targeted. All told, 59 programs, 25 statutory boards \nand commissions, and 63 agencies are soon to be terminated under this \nbudget.\n  Let me just cite some more of the program terminations assumed in \nthis budget: The Small Business Administration tree planting program; \nthe Swine Health Advisory Committee; the Board of Tea Experts; the \nTechnical Panel on Magnetic Fusion; the Dance Advisory Panel; the honey \nprogram; the Fastener Advisory Committee.\n  Mr. President, some of these programs might be useful, but we simply \ncannot afford them, given our exploding national debt.\n  Finally, we have reduced overhead. The President stated that over \n100,000 Federal jobs have been eliminated toward the goal of trimming \nthe Federal bureaucracy by 250,000 positions. A vast majority of the \npersonnel reductions come out of the Department of Defense. Other areas \nof the Federal bureaucracy have barely been touched. This budget \naddresses this imbalance by reducing Federal overhead accounts by 15 \npercent, eliminating hundreds of political patronage jobs, and \nexpanding the ability of Federal departments to work with less \nexpensive private contractors.\n  Having focused on what this budget does, it is just as important to \nfocus on what it does not. First, this budget does not abandon \nMedicare. In their 1995 annual report, the Medicare trustees announced \nthat the Medicare trust fund will be insolvent 7 years from now. The \ntrustees conclude that the ``HI program is severely out of financial \nbalance and that the trustees believe that the Congress must take \ntimely action to establish long-term financial stability for the \nprogram.''\n  This budget embraces the call of the trustees to action by addressing \nboth the short- and the long-term insolvency of the Medicare program. \nFirst, it allows Medicare to continue to grow at a 7-percent rate per \nyear. This reform enables Medicare to pass the trustees' short-term \nsolvency test while still growing at twice the rate of inflation.\n  Second, the resolution includes a call for a special commission to \naddress the long-term stability questions facing Medicare and to advise \nCongress on how to keep Medicare's promise for future generations.\n  Another group this amendment does not abandon is the American \ntaxpayers. As I previously mentioned, balancing the budget by 2002 \nwill, according to the CBO, provide $170 billion ``fiscal dividend\" \nfrom lower interest costs.\n  Senator Domenici has stated that this dividend will be used to pay \nfor tax cuts. I believe that we should enact tax relief for the middle-\nclass working families of this country and tax incentives for savings \nand investment. We can and should balance the budget and provide \nAmerican families with real tax relief.\n  Mr. President, if we look at Federal outlays of the span of this \nbudget, the Federal Government will spend in excess of $12 billion \nbetween now and 2002. A significant portion of that amount constitutes \na redistribution of dollars from those who work and pay the taxes, to \nthose who are elderly, sick, homeless, and have low incomes. Federal \nprograms targeted at the poor and the needy are the result of a truly \ncompassionate society, and we should continue to support them.\n  I resent the implication that is often made here on the floor, and \nmade occasionally during our committee hearings, that somehow we are \nnot a compassionate Nation. This budget will spend $12 trillion largely \nfor the purpose of helping people who are less fortunate in our \nsociety. That is 2\\1/2\\ times the average GDP of America. I think that \nis an important investment, and hardly one to be described as lacking \nin compassion.\n  Now, based on that, it is my opinion that if, after we go through \nthis process of bringing the budget into balance, and if, after we go \nthrough the process of spending $12 trillion over 7 years on so many \nimportant programs, that any fiscal surplus created by this budget \nshould go to those who have made the surplus and our compassionate \nprograms possible--the hard-working taxpayers.\n  Moreover, the surplus or dividend only constitutes 1\\1/2\\ percent of \nthe $12 trillion we will spend over the next 7 years. To me, it only \nseems fair to allow those who pay the taxes to keep this tiny surplus \nor dividend so that they can invest it in their families and in our \nNation's economic future.\n  Finally, this budget also avoids the ever-present temptation to gut \ndefense. Real defense spending has declined by [[Page S6874]] 37 \npercent since 1985, and while I believe there are many money-saving \nreforms possible within the DOD, I believe the savings should stay \nwithin defense to provide for our substantial security. No other \nresponsibility of Government is as important.\n  This budget recognizes the importance of our national security by \nmaintaining the current level of spending and establishing protections \nagainst using defense cuts for other spending proposals.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I should point out that without the \nassistance of the minority, Republicans have stepped forward and \nproposed the changes necessary to cap out-of-control Federal spending. \nIn successfully reporting this budget resolution, the Senate Budget \nCommittee has taken a historic step toward reducing the deficit and \nbalancing the budget.\n  Before the Senate today is a resolution that makes the tough choices, \nslows Federal spending and brings the Federal budget into balance by \nthe year 2002.\n  Many people doubted it could be done, and it is a credit to Senator \nDomenici that he set this goal and stuck with it. If we are successful \nin moving this budget through the entire budget process, I believe \nthere is no better present we can give the future generations than a \ndebt-free Government.\n  The benefits of balancing the budget far outweigh temporary effects \ncaused by reducing the growth of Federal spending. This is truly a \nlong-term approach to fiscal sanity, and I thank Chairman Domenici for \ngiving me the opportunity to make my first budget a balanced one.\n  Mr. President, we will hear much talk during this debate and the \nhours remaining over the winners and the losers and so on when we \ndebate this budget resolution. But it is my strong belief, and as I \nhave traveled through my State during both the campaign last year and \nin the days since the content of our revolution has become a matter of \npublic debate, I find that people from one end of my State to the other \nbelieve strongly that what we have to do here in the Senate is finally \nstep up to the plate and accept responsibility and handle this budget \ndeficit now.\n  They understand that if we continue to wait, if we continue to say \nthat every program must continue to grow at the speed and the pace that \nhas America $4.5 trillion into debt, we are not just saddling our \nchildren with even more debt and indebtedness, we are setting the \ncountry on a course that absolutely will lead to a crisis we cannot \nreverse in just a few years--15 years to be specific, according to the \nEntitlements Commission.\n  For that, only, I look forward to working, certainly, with Senator \nDomenici and with anyone else who is committed to the notion that we \nshould bring the spending giant in Washington under control. I believe \nit is the most important thing I can do for my small children, for the \nchildren of Michigan and the children of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from West Virginia is recognized for 10 minutes. Is that the \namount for which the Senator from West Virginia asked?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, under the order I believe it was 12 \nminutes. I was trying hoping to slip it up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 12 minutes, and \nif he is in control of the floor he can yield himself additional time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I cannot help but note for the \nPresiding Officer in the chair, in the last week even, the \nbipartisanship which has reigned on this floor. The Presiding Officer, \nthe distinguished Senator from Washington, and this Senator and other \nSenators from both sides of the aisle worked together to craft a \nproduct liability tort reform bill which was slim, disciplined, and \neffective. People said it could not be done. It was done.\n  Last night the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, this \nSenator, Senator Chafee from Rhode Island, Senator Dole, and Senator \nPackwood--there was quite a flap about a very important but not \nnecessarily attention-grabbing subject called Medicare Select; whether \nit was to be expanded from the present 14 States to 50, for how long, \nand who would decide and all of this. And this Senator objected to its \nbeing taken further, so there was a climate of momentary controversy. \nBut then both sides came together and worked out a bipartisan \ncompromise which was passed. And that was very heartening. It was \nimportant; heartening.\n  Now we are at a very different stage and it is saddening to me, but \nit is terribly real because I do think it has come to where we define \nwhat these two different parties that sit in this Chamber stand for.\n  Mr. President, I will be offering tomorrow, an amendment on Medicare \nand long-term care to the Republican-sponsored Senate budget \nresolution. The amendment will take $100 billion in funds reserved for \ntax cuts for the wealthy and put that money back into vital health care \nprograms.\n  The Senate Republicans have proposed the single largest Medicare cut \nin the history of the program, $256 billion over 7 years. The House \nRepublicans have proposed an even larger cut, $288 billion over 7 \nyears. House Republicans need to cut Medicare more because they have an \neven larger tax break for the wealthy that they have to pay for. The \nHouse tax cut totals $345 billion. Money reserved for the Senate tax \nbreak totals $170 billion.\n  These Medicare cuts would not be necessary--would not be necessary--\nif Republicans did not need to pay for their tax cuts. The Contract \nWith America tax cut would provide a $20,000 tax break to the \nwealthiest 1 percent of the population.\n   The amendment I will offer tomorrow, along with my colleague from \nNew Jersey, who will join me in that, and the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, will take $100 billion out of the $170 \nbillion the Republicans have reserved for tax cuts for upper-income \nAmericans and shift it to Medicare and Medicaid--very simple. It is a \nsimple amendment. What is it about? It is about setting priorities. It \nsays we are not going to balance the budget by whacking health benefits \nthat seniors depend upon. It says we are not going to increase what \nseniors have to pay out of their own pockets ad nauseam for health care \nso we can put more money into the pockets of the rich. It is simple--\nclear. The difference between the two parties.\n  The Republicans have argued--will argue that the $170 billion they \nhave reserved for tax cuts is their special dividend, their own pot of \ngold. I find that a particularly offensive statement. It is not their \nmoney to spend. It is the money of the taxpayers. They want to spend \ntaxpayer money on more breaks for the rich.\n  Democrats, through this amendment and other Democratic amendments \nthat will be offered later on in the process, say let us keep our \npriorities straight. We have already committed those dollars to the \nMedicare Program.\n  Instead of worrying about the effects of such tremendous Medicare \ncuts on seniors, I was significantly struck by what Bill Kristol, who \nspeaks for the Republican Party, had to say earlier this week. And what \nhe basically said was that since--not what he ``basically said,'' what \nhe said--that since the elderly tend to vote for Democrats, it just was \nnot a constituency that the Republicans needed to worry about.\n  Again, straightforward and simple. And, again, the difference between \nthe two parties. Frankly, I find that statement cynical and dangerous \nbut not surprising from the same person who advised the Republicans \nlast year to oppose, sight unseen, any health care proposal that came \nfrom this side of the aisle.\n  We have heard a lot of talk over the past few months from the \nRepublicans about the solvency of the Medicare trust fund. Republicans \nare desperately, in this Senator's judgment, trying to disguise their \nhuge Medicare cuts as a way to save the Medicare Program from \nbankruptcy. We have heard a lot about that. They plan to cut $256 \nbillion, by hiking Medicare premiums and beneficiary cost sharing and \ncutting reimbursement rates to hospitals and doctors.\n  It is a very interesting phenomenon. I just got off two radio talk \nshows this morning where people were phoning in questions to me. I had \nfive hospital administrators from two States call me. I only represent \none State. They were all [[Page S6875]] scared to death about what was \nbeing proposed here because they said the only way to do that would be \nto shut down services. In some cases they talked about increasing \nprices, which of course would exclude some, laying off people and the \nrest. All of them talked about closing the emergency room.\n  The Republicans say they are going to improve trust fund solvency. \nYet there is nothing in this Senate budget resolution that would \nguarantee even one more additional year of solvency.\n  Over the past 2 weeks we have heard health experts, health \neconomists, physicians, and hospital representatives testify before the \nFinance Committee about the consequences of putting the Medicare \nProgram in a budget straitjacket.\n  Dr. June O'Neill, the new Republican-appointed head of the \nCongressional Budget Office--why do I say that? Traditionally it has \nbeen a bipartisan appointment. This year it was not a bipartisan \nappointment, it was a Republican appointment. I resent that. I think it \nis dangerous for the country, not because she is a Republican but \nbecause it is not bipartisan. Anyway, Dr. June O'Neill, the new \nRepublican-appointed head of the Congressional Budget Office said that \nquality will suffer. That is what Bob Reischauer also said before her: \nQuality will suffer.\n  She said seniors will have to pay more to maintain the current \nquality of their health care.\n  Dr. Reischauer disputed Republican promises headlined in the New York \nTimes a few weeks ago that, cuts in Medicare ``will be huge but \npainless.'' He testified that cutting Medicare in the short run is not \npainless and improvements in quality will be slowed down.\n  The president of the American Hospital Association testified that \n``Americans believe deeply that Medicare is Social Security. That \nsentiment cuts across all age, income, geographic and gender \nboundaries.'' He is right. Medicare is part of the Social Security law.\n       Those proposed spending reductions may in fact be \n     reductions in the rate of growth and not cuts in the \n     spending, but let us be very clear. To people who rely on \n     Medicare for their care and for people who provide their \n     care, the spending proposals being considered are very likely \n     to translate into cuts, cuts in services, cuts in personnel, \n     cuts in quality. To the people to whom we provide care, these \n     slowdowns in the rate of spending translates into real cuts.\n\n  Over the past year, during debate on the balanced budget amendment, \nand now on the Senate budget resolution, I have tried to get my \ncolleagues to focus on the consequences of budget cuts. I really do \nbelieve in that. I think budget cuts simply are not done for numerical \nreasons. They are done for the condition of the country as a whole, and \nwithin that condition of the country of the whole are many factors to \nconsider, and some of those are the effects on people. I come from the \nState of West Virginia, and I cannot do anything--nor will I ever do \nanything--without considering the effects on the people that I \nrepresent.\n  To think about the people that will be directly and immediately \naffected by these budget actions, we need to move beyond the strictly \nmathematical. But for those people who like math, I have a simple \naddition problem for them.\n  Millie Wolfe lives in Preston County, WV. She is 83 years old, and \nshe lives alone. She still drives a car. She lives on her monthly \nSocial Security check of $593 a month. She spends $175 a month on rent, \n$93 on her medigap policy, $8.30 cents on her heart medicine. That \nleaves her with a little over $300 a month to pay her phone bill, her \nheating bill, her electric bill, gas and maintenance for her car, to \nbuy groceries, and any and all other living expenses.\n  She is worried she may no longer be able to drive herself to the \ngrocery store and to the doctor's office and might soon need help with \ntransportation. And at 83 she has a right to begin to worry about that. \nBut she is very, very worried and very upset about having to pay $700 \nto $900 more per year in Medicare costs as she would under the proposal \nthat lies before us. She is already, Mr. President, paying $1,200 a \nyear out of pocket for her medigap coverage and her heart medicine, not \ncounting the $46 that is automatically deducted each month from her \nSocial Security check for her Medicare part B premium.\n  People who live on fixed incomes like Millie Wolfe will have to \nsubtract what they can spend on other essential living expenses in \norder to pay for the increased costs of health care that will be \nrequired under this budget resolution.\n  Millie Wolfe lives alone, but she is not alone in West Virginia. She \nis not alone in this country. There are 9 million seniors who live \nalone in this country. A lot of seniors in West Virginia live on fixed \nincomes. Rarely does one run into a senior in West Virginia, as the \nSenator from Massachusetts would know, with an income that might be \nmore than $10,000, $12,000, $13,000 or $14,000 a year.\n  Asking those folks to pay more than they already are paying for \nhealth care in order to save the Medicare trust fund is, frankly, \noffensive to me. Why? Because it directly hurts them. When you say \neverybody should pay more, I take you back to Millie.\n  Mr. President, over half of the seniors in West Virginia live in \nrural areas. That makes them even more vulnerable to the severe \nconsequences of the Republican budget that is before us. Rural seniors \nwill not only have to pay more under the budget resolution, but they \nmay wind up losing their access to health care altogether. Medicare \ncuts of this magnitude will severely threaten the solvency of many \nrural hospitals, as I have indicated, forcing many of them to close \ntheir emergency rooms, if they have them, cut back on other services, \nand, yes, as has happened before in West Virginia, some will shut their \ndoors.\n  We will hear protests by the Republicans that if we do not act right \naway, there will not be a Medicare Program. Mr. President, I can \nguarantee you that if they implement their budget plan, there really \nwill not be a Medicare program. Benefits will disappear, quality will \ndeteriorate, and access will be hard to obtain, or will become \nnonexistent for people in my State, who I will fight for.\n  One word about Medicaid and I am finished. They are going to cut $160 \nbillion to $190 billion out of Medicaid. You see, people do not care as \nmuch about Medicaid because they say that is for the poor, and, \ntherefore, it does not get the attention. Well, it gets the attention \nfrom this Senator. The likely impact of the budget resolution cuts on \nMedicaid, will mean that 5 to 7 million kids will lose health coverage, \n800,000 to 1 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries will lose \ncoverage, and tens of millions will lose benefits. For example, all \npreventive and diagnostic screening services for children, home health \ncare, and hospice services would be eliminated as well as dental care \nif the $190 billion were cut.\n  There is a difference between the two parties. There was not last \nnight. There was not within the past week as we worked out our \ndifferences. On this one, our differences are going to be very hard to \nwork out because there are fundamental priorities and principles at \nstake here.\n  I do not intend to be shy in defense of the people I represent from \nthe State of West Virginia. They work hard. They have had few breaks, \nand they need help where help is justified.\n  I, along, I suspect, with many colleagues from this side of the \naisle, and I expect none from the other side of the aisle, are going to \ndo everything we can to help them. I regard this as a moral issue.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask before the Senator starts his \ncomments if I could make one observation. It will take me 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withhold, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  I note that about 4 years ago, for insurance policies for Americans \nworking for various companies the premiums were going up 14 percent a \nyear. Then they went to 11. And, lo and behold, today they are down to \nsomething like 3.5 percent. I would just ask, for all the people whose \npremiums have gone down because there is competition and modernized \ndelivery system, I wonder [[Page S6876]] if they are all out in the \nstreets without health care. I wonder if the hospitals which treat them \nare closing up because there is no money to treat them. I think quite \nto the contrary. They are getting the same kind of services they got \nbefore. It is just costing people less for the same kind of services.\n  I do not know that is impossible for seniors in America. I hope it is \npossible. For otherwise we cannot afford the insurance, and we cannot \nafford to cover them in the future. I just lay that on the record.\n  We will have a lot more to say about Medicare. We choose now to let \neverybody speak, and we are delighted there are so many on our side. \nThere are more. We have three listed. If there are more Senators, start \ngiving us your names.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my response to my friend from New Mexico \nis the premiums are going down, but what he is not saying is what is \nhappening in terms of the copayments and the deductibles, because the \ncopayments and the deductibles are going up, and the Senator has not \ncommented about the coverage, about whether there has been a reduction \nin coverage.\n  These are the kinds of issues that we ought to be talking about, not \njust these massive figures, about how many billions of dollars more we \nare going to spend on people. That is the question, that premiums can \ngo down if your copayments and deductibles go up, if you are reducing \nthe kinds of coverage and the range of services.\n  So if we are going into full debate about what is going to happen in \nterms of real health care costs, we would welcome that debate and how \nwe are going to get a handle on it. I would agree with my good friends \nfrom West Virginia and Minnesota, and others that the only way we are \never going to get a handle on health care costs is within the totality \nof the health care system rather than just a quarter of the health care \nsystem.\n  I wish to commend the Senator from West Virginia and also the Senator \nfrom New Jersey on an excellent presentation on the importance of \ntrying to preserve the Medicare system in our country. It is a part of \nSocial Security, make no mistake about it.\n  We will have more chances to talk about it. The direct payments under \npart B of Medicare are right under the Social Security system. When you \nsee a reduction in terms of the Consumer Price Index, reduced as in the \nformula of the budget, you are going to see further reductions in terms \nof the recipients of Social Security. We will come to that at another \ntime.\n  I commend the Senator from West Virginia, talking about Medicaid \naffecting children. Eighteen million children in this country are \ncovered under Medicaid. Medicaid is primarily for seniors, long-term \ncare, and people with disabilities, but there are also 18 million \nchildren covered under Medicaid. And as the Senator points out, 5 to 7 \nmillion of those will lose under the proposal of the budget resolution. \nThe fact is, of the 18 million, half are children of working families. \nWe have heard all about trying to have a system that is going to be \nfair and equitable. But here you are, saying to the sons and daughters, \nthe children, we are going to be cutting back on that program--there is \nno protection for them in this program.\n  The Senator was quite correct in stating the terms of what is \nhappening. Never mind the millions of other children, the 14 or 15 \nmillion other children who do not have health insurance. And the \nincrease, as a Carnegie report has shown, in the last 15 months of an \nadditional million poor children not covered by health insurance. Those \nnumbers are going up. They are increasing dramatically.\n  I wish to ask my friend, just taking a few minutes here this \nafternoon, because there are many others waiting, as we are talking \nabout the whole issue of Medicare, to review with me exactly where we \nare as an institution and where are our senior citizens. I have a chart \nhere. We hear the question of fairness. I am talking now about the \nhealth care for Members of Congress versus the health care for senior \ncitizens.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has pointed out that over the next 7 \nyears, Medicare couples will pay out $6,400 more, and then that will go \nup at $900 a year.\n  Let us look at where we are as a base as Members of Congress, as the \nSenator pointed out. The average senior citizen is making $17,700. The \naverage Member of Congress, $133,000. The monthly Medicare part B \npremium per individual: here it is $46.10; Member of Congress: $44.05. \nSo senior citizens are paying more under Medicare on the part B. The \ndeductibles: Members of Congress, $350. That includes the doctors and \nhospitalization, $350. Theirs is $816--more than double. These are the \npeople who are making $17,000 a year. Their deductible is more than \ndouble ours. Hospital care: Member of Congress, unlimited. Theirs, the \nsenior citizens, is limited. Prescription drugs: We are covered, small \ndeductible, about $50. They are not covered. The program does not even \napply to prescription drugs. Any Member of Congress who goes into any \nsenior citizen home and asks: How many of you are paying $50 a month or \nmore for prescription drugs? Sixty percent of the hands will go in the \nair. You ask them how many of you are paying $25 a month for \nprescription drugs. They all laugh. They are amazed. They wonder why \nyou do not know that 85 or 90 percent of them are paying more than $25 \nfor prescription drugs.\n  We are covered, Members of Congress are covered. But they are not \ncovered.\n  On the dental care, effectively, we are covered; they are not \ncovered.\n  On the preventive services, screenings for cervical and prostate \ncancer, some benefits are covered.\n  And look, out-of-pocket limits: $3,700 for Members of Congress, none \nfor senior citizens.\n  Does the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Minnesota \nremember all those wonderful speeches we heard at the start of this \nCongress: We are going to have equity, fairness; the laws that apply to \nthe country are going to apply to Members of Congress. We all lined up \nand we all said yes. That was something that was initiated by the \nDemocrats in the previous Congress, blocked by the Republicans in the \nother Congress. We all supported it. We heard speeches about that.\n  What we did not hear from our Republican colleagues, all our newer \nMembers that came to the Senate, ``We are getting a good benefit \npackage for health care and we want to make that available to the \nAmerican people.'' We have not heard that.\n  We ought to be debating that issue, but, no, we are talking about \nmaking what our senior citizens pay more equitable, make them more \nequitable with the Members of Congress. We are undermining and making \ntheir benefits cost more, $6,400 for a couple--more. And $900 a year \nannually after that--more.\n  What is the answer that we will hear for that? Well, Senators, we \nwill hear it in the course of debate, I expect. Do you know what we are \ndoing? We are capping the Members of Congress now, to go up at the \nConsumer Price Index rate. I remember when we were talking about a cap \nlast year. That was price fixing. That was the heavy hand of Government \nfixing prices and costs.\n  The Senators from West Virginia, Minnesota, and Washington remember: \nWe will never tolerate that; we will not go along with that.\n  Nonetheless, that is going to be the answer. And they are fixing it \nto benefit us, to protect us. We are basically putting billions and \nbillions of dollars, in additional out-of-pocket expenses on our \nelderly. For what? For the tax cut. For the tax cut.\n  It was going to be difficult enough to try to bring about some \nchanges in the Medicare system, to try to encourage preventive health \ncare, to try to provide prescription services for our senior citizens, \nto try to provide home care, to try to provide community care for our \nseniors, and to try to strengthen the quality of health care. We \nproposed some changes and adjustments in the Medicare system last year. \nAnd after the seniors had a chance to review it, they basically \nsupported it with its expanded choices.\n  Not under this program. Not under this program. And the Members of \nCongress ought to be ashamed of themselves, to come out here and say we \nare [[Page S6877]] saving the Medicare program by all of these cuts and \nat the same time providing and utilizing those savings, or $170 billion \nof those, in order to provide tax cuts for other individuals. At the \nsame time they are not even addressing the kind of inequity and \nunfairness that exists. All of these statements are being made here by \nMembers of Congress who have their benefit package all set; we have \nours. And we are back in a regrettable situation where we are going to \nadminister to people who are not in this body, the senior citizens of \nthis country. That is basically wrong and unfair and unjust.\n  Mr. President, I would like to be notified when I have 3 minutes left \nof my 15, if I could, please.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. One of the things, I would say to my good friend \nfrom the State of Massachusetts, we heard this constantly during the \nhealth care debate was, ``You can lose your right to pick out your own \ndoctor.'' But now what is it that the budget resolution and the whole \ncourse of events is doing for senior citizens in Medicare? We are \ntalking about managed care, more and more managed care for Medicare.\n  And so all of the sudden my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare saying, this terrible fee-for-service system which we have for \nMedicare, and it is only for Medicare, only they have a fee-for-service \nsystem, so we have to move to managed care. And what happens then, of \ncourse, is they do not have the chance to choose their own doctor. But \nif they want to choose their own doctor, then let them pay more.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is exactly correct. They will say we are \nenhancing choices but effectively, given the financial burden, there \nwill be none and seniors will be forced into managed care. The cost for \nthe fee for service will be so expensive it will be out of reach. It \nwill not even be there as a possible choice.\n  And yet, I am sure, in the course of the debate, we are going to \nhear, ``Oh, well, we are providing these range of services.'' It is \ngoing to be very important for the American people to listen and listen \ncarefully about this.\n  So, Mr. President, it is important, as we are going to hear all of \nthese speeches about how we are really doing our senior citizens a \nfavor, people ought to be asking--I hope our senior citizens are going \nto ask--``Well, just do for us what you have done for yourself. Don't \ndo us any other favors.'' That is a pretty good question.\n  It always troubles me, when we try to do that, that our colleagues \nvote it down and then take advantage of their existing coverage. And \nthis coverage, which is for Members of Congress, and available to 10 \nmillion of our Federal employees, but is not available to the senior \ncitizens, our Medicare recipients. And they are the ones that are going \nto get shortchanged.\n  Mr. President, just this final thought. As we are addressing this \nbudget, I think it is appropriate for American people to understand \nthat working families are paying for the GOP tax cuts for the wealthy. \nWhat we are going to see, as I mentioned, under this budget, is some \n$6,400 more that they are going to pay over the period of the next 7 \nyears. That is, effectively, as has been pointed out, a tax. The \nworking families, will pay some $1,400. That is the increase with \nelimination of the earned income tax credit. Out there, for men and \nwomen who are playing by the rules every day, going to work, trying to \nprovide for their families, they will get an increase in their tax. \nThat is included in this budget. They get a tax.\n  And then there are the students of America. Those are the sons and \ndaughters of working families that are going to our schools and \ncolleges. They are the hope of our future. The way that program has \nbeen reported out of the Budget Committee will mean anywhere from a 28- \nto 45-percent increase in the amount of the interest that they pay. \nThat is the equivalent of about $3,000 for those who are going to \ncollege. It will be more if they go to graduate school. They are going \nbe paying.\n  And that does not even get into the costs of the reductions in Head \nStart, the title I programs, or the cutback in the help and the \nassistance to local schools in the area of technology, as we are going \nto an information age. It does not even include those kinds of programs \nwhich are going to be further attacked.\n  Mr. President, the first amendment that will be offered is an \namendment by Senator Lautenberg from New Jersey and Senator Rockefeller \ndealing with Medicare that just cries out for support.\n  We hope that the American people will pay attention to this debate \nand to this discussion, and let us know how they feel. I believe we are \non their side. We need to hear from them and I hope they will let us \nknow what their good judgment is on this issue.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-four seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend from Minnesota. I yield \nhim whatever time I have left.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, might I inquire--I am not trying to get \nthe floor--are we rotating, I ask my friend from New Mexico?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are rotating, but not one on one. Your side has had \na number of speakers in succession and the unanimous consent was--Mr. \nPresident, maybe you can say it--I think it was Senators Hatfield and \nBond on our side and then back to you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous informal order, the next \nperson who would be recognized who is now on the floor is the Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do we have only two Republicans, or three in a row?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no order for how many.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I inquire, do you have any other names listed on \nthat unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are no other names listed at this point.\n  Does the Senator from New Mexico yield to the Senator from Missouri?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time would the Senator desire?\n  Mr. BOND. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. President, I am happy to yield to Senator Hatfield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as I understand it, our informal \nagreement was actually that Senator Hatfield would proceed if he were \non the floor and then Senator Bond and then back to the Democrats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico yield to the \nSenator from Oregon?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator Hatfield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee for yielding for a few moments of presentation.\n  I would like to begin today by reiterating some of the remarks that I \nmade during the debate on the balanced budget amendment. I think the \nAmerican people elected the Republican Congress with the expectation \nthat we would show leadership and a willingness to make difficult \ndecisions. In my view, the public shares the point of view that \nGovernment has grown bloated, ponderous, and too expensive. The \nprograms of the New Deal and the Great Society put safety nets in place \nfor those who are in the greatest need, but those nets now strangle the \nFederal Government by tying up precious funding in a knot of \nregulations and poor management.\n  I believe that a balanced budget can come only through leadership and \ncompromise. This compromise must come from each one of us. More \nimportantly, it must come from those we represent. In the end, there is \nno easy answer. If there is a political will to create a balanced \nbudget, we will create one, and if there is will to avoid one, we will \navoid it.\n  Senator Domenici, the chairman, and the Senate Budget Committee \nmembers have proven that this Congress is willing to make difficult \ndecisions and that there is a political will to balance our Federal \nbudget. It was an enormous task to construct this budget resolution and \nI congratulate the Senator from New Mexico and the committee for its \nwork, and the work of the extraordinarily competent staff that they \nhave assisting them.\n  Like others, I think that the budget resolution cuts in the wrong \nplaces, targeting programs which are an investment in our future, such \nas medical research and educational assistance \n[[Page S6878]] to our college students. When we look at the data \nrelated to the National Institutes of Health, particularly, we have \nconvincing evidence that every Federal dollar invested in biomedical \nresearch yields $13 in cost savings and productivity to society. Few \nother Federal programs can claim a similar track record.\n  Mr. President, at the same time that we see substantial cuts in \ninvestment programs, we continue to see other portions of the budget \ncontinue to grow at alarming rates. In comparing spending in 1995 with \nthe proposed spending in 2002, we see that nondefense discretionary \nspending will decrease almost 11 percent, defense spending will remain \nflat--and I will believe that when it happens--and entitlement spending \nwill grow 45 percent. These numbers show that Congress must continue to \nreview the entitlement programs of this country to ensure the long-term \nsolvency of the Federal Government.\n  Let me spend just a moment on the issue of our national investments. \nThis budget presents us with a tragedy in the making regarding our \nability to provide a high quality of life to all Americans. The Senate \nbudget resolution represents the worst of three terrible options for \nthe future of the National Institutes of Health.\n  Option No. 1--the President's budget request calls for reduction in \nthe NIH funding by 10 percent, beginning in the year 2000. I call this \ndeath by water torture.\n  Option No. 2-- the House budget resolution calls for an immediate 5 \npercent reduction from 1995 levels for the NIH for the next year and \nthen level funding for the next 5 years. This is death by the hangman's \nnoose.\n  Finally, option No. 3--the Senate budget resolution calls for a 10 \npercent reduction in 1995 levels for NIH for the next 7 years, a total \nreduction of nearly $8 billion, $1 billion in 1996 to begin with.\n  In addition, the Senate resolution protects certain agencies from \nbudget cuts. In other words, they have seen to it to exempt within NIH \ncertain programs, the Centers for Disease Control, the Indian Health \nService, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, \nand all AIDS-related programs.\n  These exemptions mean the actual cuts to all other NIH programs will \nbe around 16 to 20 percent, not 10 percent. This is death by the firing \nsquad, and it means the end of our growing medical research enterprise \nas we know it.\n  Let me give you a couple of examples. We are now halfway through on \nthe decade of the brain. Mr. President, we have in the first 5 years of \nthat commitment spent a proportion of that time necessary to bring \ntogether over 130 great and tested scientists in this common, \nintegrated, and united effort. It did not happen overnight. And as a \nconsequence, if you start taking a 15- to 16- or 20-percent reduction \nin that kind of neurological and brain-related disease, you are not \nonly reducing the funding levels, you are destroying the \ninfrastructure. Let me analyze that.\n  The Presiding Officer at this moment is my colleague from the State \nof Washington. We both have a very major timber economy in our States. \nYou take a small sawmill, or any sawmill, and if there is an interim of \nno supply of timber resource, that sawmill closes. You lose the chief \nsawer, you lose the greenchain people, you lose all these technological \npeople necessary to make a sawmill function, and then you get a supply \na month later. It will take an inordinate amount of time to reconfigure \nthat team of technology that is required to operate a sawmill.\n  Now look at what it means in terms of high technology, the high \nspecialization of a brain strategy to conquer the diseases of the \nbrain. You lose that team, you lose that kind of an infrastructure and \nyou do not rebuild it 6 months later or the next budget period.\n  Bear in mind, I believe that every dollar we have appropriated for \nAIDS is fundamentally required, but we cannot afford to get into this \nbusiness of playing one disease against another disease and which one \nhas the greatest political clout gets the most money. And that is what \nwe are embarked upon.\n  Why exempt AIDS? What about cancer? What about heart disease? What \nabout Alzheimer's? What about all the other diseases that we are \nconcerned about in our overall strategy of war on disease? It is a \ndangerous precedent to make that exemption and start playing these \nadvocate groups one against the other.\n  I think as we move to balance the budget, we should not randomly cut \nprograms in our midst. We must cut judiciously, but at the same time \nsafeguard our long-term investment programs. Through the promise of \nmedical research we will find the treatments and cures we need to \neradicate disease and disability.\n  Let me take another example. I think it is very interesting that \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has been \nexempt. These are the services coming out of the mental health programs \nand commitments. Mr. President, at the same time that we are going to \ncontinue these services at presently $2.1 billion, we are cutting $630 \nmillion of fiscal year 1995 out of mental research. Now how can you \nsustain a service program delivering the best quality of mental health \nservices if you have cut off the research part of it or you have \ncrippled it or you have brought it to such a place where they lose \ntheir personnel, and so forth?\n  I think we know that only through the promise of medical research \nwill we find the treatments and cures to eradicate disease and \ndisability and reduce our health care costs. Medical research is a \ncentral mechanism for controlling the costs of health care in this \ncountry. That is, a cure and better treatment. After all, a cure is the \nultimate in cost control.\n  We found that fluoridation saves the country approximately $4.5 \nbillion each year in preventing dental cavities; psychoactive drugs \nwhich actively reduce hospitalization for mental illness saves us $7 \nbillion a year and allows patients to return to productive lives; a $20 \nmillion investment in influenza B vaccine resulted in a savings of over \n$400 million a year by preventing cases of childhood meningitis.\n  In other words, Mr. President, all of these things concern me so much \nthat I intend to offer an amendment during the course of debate on the \nbudget resolution to restore the cuts, at least in major part, for the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  I expect to be joined by a bipartisan group of colleagues, all of \nwhom believe that severe cuts in this area are shortsighted at best. We \nare not alone in this task. Public opinion polls have shown massive \npublic support for making health research the No. 1 Federal science \npriority.\n  At the same time, I think it is interesting that we have frozen at \ncurrent levels the research in the energy budget, and that has a major \nfocus on nuclear matters of research.\n  Mr. President, this gets us down to a priorities problem again, and a \nvalue problem. I believe it is more important to protect people from \ndisease by finding the solutions and the preventive actions to take \nrather than to protect our bombs. That may not be the value system that \nothers hold but, in my view, I would hate to go home and explain to my \nconstituents how we are going to cripple the research for spinal \nmeningitis or for Parkinson's disease or for many of the other diseases \nthat everybody, agewise, will face one way or the other and say, ``Oh, \nbut we have sustained our commitment to the research requirements to \nprotect our bombs.''\n  I want to make sure that I add this point: That any type of \nrestoration of $1 to this budget resolution has to be offset, and we \nare working on a bipartisan level now, working with the chairman of the \nauthorization committee, the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Labor-\nHHS of the Appropriations Committee, we are working with our Democratic \ncolleagues to try to come up with the offsets to deal with the \nrestoration that we seek for the NIH budget.\n  I wanted to also say, I know of no person in this body who has a \ngreater commitment to medical and health problems that we face in this \ncountry than Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee. I \nimagine that he has probably lost more sleep than any of us at this \npoint in crafting this budget resolution. So lest anybody attempt to \nmake a personal matter out of this disagreement, I want to certainly \ndisabuse them of that. We want to work with Senator Domenici's staff, \n[[Page S6879]] we want to work with the Budget Committee in proposing \nthis amendment, but I have to say, we are determined--we are \ndetermined--to save the future of this Nation's medical research and \nits infrastructure that is required to find the solutions to these \ndiseases.\n  As we continue with this debate, it is important that we remember \nthat long-term fiscal responsibility should not only depend upon cuts \nin spending. It demands a radical transformation in the way we do \nbusiness as a government. I know as an appropriator I will focus on how \nthe American people can get more out of fewer federal dollars. That is \nthe goal of the private sector of our society, and it should be the \nsame of the Federal Government as well. I hope that the authorizers \nwill also look to the innovators at the State and local level to see \nhow they are making limited resources go further. I think each one of \nus can look to the local governments and advocates to glean ideas of \nhow to make success government's goal, as opposed to an obsession with \npaperwork and feeding the bureaucracy. I hope this Congress takes the \nfact of fewer Federal dollars and turns it into an impetus to allow the \ninnovators to rise to the top as shining examples of Government at its \nfinest.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to ask my colleagues from \nthe other side of the aisle to join in this effort in eliminating the \nbudget deficit. We have all come to the floor time after time to \ndiscuss the impact that continuing budget deficits have on the economy \nand the allocation of Federal revenue. In 1995, 15 percent of all \nFederal revenue will go to paying the interest on the debt, and that \namount will continue to grow if this problem is not addressed. I think \nmany Americans will be surprised that even if we balance the budget in \nthe year 2002, the Federal Government will still spend $279 billion in \nthat year to pay interest on the debt. Imagine what that amount will be \nif we do not make those tough decisions now.\n  As a Member of the Senate that believes that the Federal Government \ncan still play a vital role in addressing societies' needs, I can think \nof a number of ways to allocate that $279 billion in the year 2002, \nrather than simply paying interest on the national debt. Our Federal \nbudget deficit is a national problem which deserves bipartisan \nattention. Bipartisan negotiation, leadership and compromise have been \nthe cornerstones upon which we have built all effective decisions on \ntough issues since the formation of our government. I hope the Congress \ndoes not miss this opportunity to address the real issue of balancing \nthe budget, and that is the issue which is before us in this Budget \nResolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator asked if he might propound a \nunanimous-consent request. I will be pleased to listen to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from New Mexico, \nmight I first congratulate, if you will, sing praise of my colleague \nfrom Oregon. First of all, I very much appreciate his remarks and want \nto be a part of this effort.\n  I know last night my colleague from Oregon was given recognition that \nhe richly deserves from the Parkinson's community for his work in \nintroducing the Morris Udall legislation, and as the son of two parents \nwho had Parkinson's disease, I would like to thank my colleague from \nOregon for his work and also for, I think, a very eloquent statement. \nWe want to make sure one group of people struggling with a disease is \nnot pitted against another group.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after my colleague from \nMissouri is finished with his remarks, that I then be able to speak for \n15 minutes, followed by my colleague from South Carolina, Senator \nHollings, for 15 minutes as well, and then I understand we will rotate \nback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much is the Senator going to use?\n  Mr. BOND. I will need 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So that will be 20 minutes, to be followed by 15 and \n15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico who has \npresided over a very difficult, but a very, very important effort in \nthe Senate Budget Committee. I think the tremendous effort he made \ndeserves a great deal of praise and thanks not only by us, but by \nfuture generations and a lot of people who may not really understand \nthe full impact of what Senator Domenici has led us to achieve for the \nhealth of our economy and for future generations.\n  In the next few days, we are going to have the historic opportunity \nto move through Congress a budget plan which will actually get this \nGovernment's books to balance. How many times have we talked about it? \nEverybody decided that it was the ``holy grail,'' that we could never \nget there. Well, through Senator Domenici's leadership, we have come up \nwith a plan. Nobody said it would be easy. With his leadership and the \nwillingness of Members to stand up and vote for action instead of just \ntalking a good game, this Senate can take that first step.\n  Make no mistake, the step is a big one. For the first time in 25 \nyears, the Congress has an opportunity to pass a budget which will get \nus into a surplus rather than keep adding to our debt. The budget is \ntough. It sets priorities and recognizes that Government cannot do it \nall. It makes a statement that the time has come for leaders of today \nto start paying attention to the economic devastation that is being \ncreated for tomorrow's generations because we cannot live within our \nmeans. We have heard many speeches about the need to cut spending, \nreduce the deficit, and get our Nation's books into balance. Everyone \nwho looks at our nearly $5 trillion debt recognizes the need to do \nsomething so that we do not keep piling on that debt for our children \nand grandchildren.\n  Over the next few days, the American people will have a rare \nopportunity to see exactly what the political leadership's visions for \nour country's future are. I have a chart, and you have seen it before \nin different colors, with the same message. The vision of this Domenici \nbudget shown here in blue is that by taking us from $176 billion on a \nglidepath to 2002, we can reach a surplus by 2002. It is a bold plan. \nIt scrutinizes every program in the Federal budget from agriculture to \nwelfare, and already the dollar has strengthened because we did \nsomething.\n  The Washington Times reported last Friday that on Thursday, May 11, \nthe dollar jumped in its biggest 1-day advance in 4 years. That was the \nsame day that the House and Senate Budget Committees approved our plans \nfor reducing the deficit to zero by 2002. It is no coincidence that the \ndollar strengthened the same day we made an effort to restore fiscal \nsanity to the Federal books.\n  Earlier this year, by contrast, when the Senate failed, by one vote, \nto pass the balanced budget amendment, we showed that some were willing \nto sacrifice U.S. global competitiveness for short-term political gain. \nThe message was heard loud and clear in the global markets, and the \ndollar fell to record lows against the Japanese yen and the German \nmark.\n  Why is that important? Well, Mr. President, it is important because \nthe international monetary markets can tell a country when it is sick. \nThey told Mexico it was sick because the peso started declining and \nnothing was done. Mexico got in big trouble. The international markets \nwere taking a look at our fiscal policy, our inability to control our \nspending and saying that the United States is sick. And when we failed \nto pass the balanced budget amendment, they recorded their votes in the \nway that is most effective. They placed their convictions with money \nbehind their views. They said we are in danger of going downhill.\n  The dollar devaluation does not just impact big banks and big \nindustry. It has an affect on each and every American. The dollar's low \nvalue means that U.S. assets are less valuable, imports are more \nexpensive, and that the threat of foreign competition and lost jobs is \ngreater than ever.\n  Passage of this budget resolution, which would get us to balance by \n2002, [[Page S6880]] is critical to the health of the dollar and to the \nAmerican economy. Bold changes are in store. We have proposed \ndramatically to restructure several Cabinet agencies and the programs \nunder their jurisdiction. We propose the elimination of programs, new \nand old, which will outlive their purpose or are too expensive for the \nsupposed good they do.\n  We have heard very passionate speeches, sincere speeches, on this \nfloor, about how we need to be spending more in all of these areas. \nThat is precisely how we got into this fix. We did not get into this \nfix spending too much money because we were spending it on things that \nwere low priorities. We wanted to spend more on everything. That is \nwhat has led us to the fix that we are in today.\n  What we are seeing, in essence, in this budget is that we cannot \nspend more on everything. We have to make some choices and we have to \nslow the growth. We have told agencies they have to buy smarter, travel \nmore cheaply, and squeeze out the last nickel in their operating \nbudgets.\n  Let me deal with one particular charge, or one particular allegation, \nthat I am afraid was based on misinformation. One of my colleagues, \nearlier today, was told by NIH that if funding was cut by 16 percent, \nthe researchers would not get any new grants. There was talk of the \nsuccess rate. Currently, the success rate for health research is one in \nfour. That means one out of four new applications for research gets \ngranted. The NIH apparently told my colleague that under this plan only \n1 out of 100 new grant applications would get NIH funds. Our staff \nlooked into it and we found out that that was totally unsupportable.\n  First, NIH got the numbers wrong. The budget resolution assumes a 10 \npercent cut in NIH; NIH assumed a 16 percent cut. They came up with \nsome figures that were not the figures we used and took totally \ndifferent assumptions. So, No. 1, their overall figure was wrong.\n  No. 2, NIH decided, in that classic of all Washington moves, to \n``close the Washington Monument.'' They were going to hit the thing \nwith all of the cuts that are most important, and that is the research \ndollars. The ``Washington Monument syndrome'' is when any agency's \nbudget is cut, they shut down the most visible thing that they do. They \nsaid, ``That cheap Congress would not give us the money to keep it \noperating.'' So NIH said that 70 percent of the cut would come from \nresearch grants. If I were a researcher out looking for grants, I would \nask the folks at NIH: How come you do not want to cut money out of the \noverhead, the bureaucracy, the buildings, the Washington, DC, efforts? \nI think that is a pretty good question. In any event, they gave us that \nassumption.\n  Finally, NIH assumed they would take all the money from new grants. \nNIH gets 34,000 requests for new grants each year, and they assume they \nwould cut all the money designated for new grants. In fact, this \nresolution would cut NIH funding by $1.1 billion. The Senate Budget \nCommittee staff asked the NIH if they distributed that 10 percent cut \nequally among the bureaucrats, Washington researchers, new grants and \nexisting grants, what would they get? First of all, NIH had two \nresponses. They said they would do it differently. That is cause for us \nto worry. They said, ``If the cuts were distributed equally, one in six \nresearchers would get new grant money''--in other words, one out of six \ninstead of the current one out of four. Not one out of 100. This, I \nthink, is important to set the record straight. This budget plan is not \ngoing to gut NIH.\n  In addition, this budget is going to say that we are going to save \nMedicare. Medicare is broke; it must be fixed. The public trustees are \nright. The people who were appointed as public representatives and the \nPresident's Cabinet members said that Medicare, part A, is on the verge \nof collapse. It will go into the red in 1997 and start spending more \nmoney than it takes in and, by 2002, the trust fund will be broke.\n  If the trust fund is broke, then under the terms of the law, no more \nmoney can be paid.\n In other words, the system shuts down. I do not think it is \nresponsible to walk away from that.\n\n  The President has decided to sit back and make a political game out \nof Medicare. Worse, he is talking out of both sides of his mouth and \nsaying, ``You cannot claim to protect Medicare when it is cut.'' But he \nhas no plan for saving it.\n  The fact that Medicare part A is on the death spiral was revealed by \nthe President's own Cabinet members. The President knew back in \nFebruary when he said there would not be one penny cut out of Medicare, \nthat Medicare was on the path to first insolvency and then bankruptcy. \nHe set up a status quo budget with no changes, no plans for saving \nMedicare.\n  We stepped to the plate to fix the crisis, and he says that we are \ntrying to kill Medicare.\n  Second, the President conveniently forgets that he proposed similar \ncuts in Medicare himself. When the President, in 1993, needed to \nfinance his Government-controlled, top-down health care plan, he \nproposed spending reductions in Medicare and Medicaid to pay for them.\n  He said Medicare and Medicaid are going up three times the rate of \ninflation, and all we propose to do is let it go up two times the rate \nof inflation, and he said that is not a cut. When he said specifically \nthat is not a cut, how come it gets to be a cut now when we propose to \nsave Medicare by doing about what he proposed to do in 1993?\n  Mrs. Clinton, the First Lady, has said that she is confident we can \nreduce the rate of increase in Medicare spending without undermining \nthe quality of Medicare recipients. We know we can get savings. That is \nwhat she said. Perhaps the best evidence of the political game that is \nbeing played here comes from the architect of the Clinton health care \nplan, Mr. Magaziner, who said, ``Slowing the rate of growth actually \nbenefits beneficiaries considerably because it slows the rate of growth \nof the premiums they have to pay.''\n  It seems to me that those great arguments of a couple years ago \ncannot be ignored when they come out and try to attack our efforts to \nsave Medicare now.\n  Under the Senate budget resolution, Medicare will still be the \nfastest growing part of the Federal budget. Solvency would be \nguaranteed for 10 years. Medicare spending will continue to grow at \nmore than twice the rate of inflation well into the next century. That \nis just the first step.\n  Let me move now, Mr. President, to one other example of the kinds of \nreforms that this budget tackles. That is, reforming the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. I happen to be the chairman of the \nsubcommittee that handles the HUD appropriations. We are responsible \nfor trying to stop the train wreck.\n  This year, we began holding hearings to get at the funding crisis at \nHUD. This is a crisis that not only threatens the programs which \nmillions of people depend on for the very roof over their head, but \nthreatens to squeeze out needed dollars for other important programs.\n  We have found in our hearings and in our investigations that HUD is a \ndysfunctional agency that requires a complete reevaluation of its \nmission and a major reform of its program and program operations.\n  The Department has grown from an agency responsible for about 50 \nprograms in 1980 to well over 200 programs now. It has neither the \ncapacity nor the political will to administer all these programs.\n  Frankly, we have got to make some serious changes. It is this crisis \nthat led me to advocate and propose a dramatic restructuring of HUD, \nwhich is to be incorporated in this budget plan. That is why I argued \nso strongly for the passage of the rescission package which begins the \nmajor surgery HUD so desperately needs.\n  In particular, the budget anticipates the creation of block grants \nfor public housing. It assumes that the actual projected costs of \nsection 8 contract renewals, that some of this assistance should be \ngiven in block grants to the States. The States would get broad \nlatitude to redesign their programs so that they could use State \nhousing finance agencies to manage their program to contract out the \nresponsibilities and to get that program under control.\n  Unfortunately, when the President indicated he would veto the \ndisaster relief supplemental bill with the rescissions in it, he not \nonly took the money away from the California earthquake \n[[Page S6881]] and the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing, it also \ntook over $6 billion in cuts for future year spending from HUD.\n  Let me make this point again. The bill that we passed out of the \nconference committee the President said he would veto provides vitally \nneeded funding for disaster relief. The House and the Senate also \npassed and we passed by an overwhelming majority in this body, a \nmeasure to cut spending in HUD so that we will face not quite as \nserious a problem next year.\n  We still have a funding problem for HUD that is unbelievable. The \nPresident's budget asks for $20 billion in budget authority and $14 \nbillion in outlay increases for HUD over the next 5 years. Even those \nfirst are suspect. We have to have the rescission bill to cut off the \nauthority now or we will add more commitments to HUD that they will \nhave even greater trouble funding in the future.\n  Now, to me, that effort for fiscal responsibility is one of the first \nand most important steps we can take. The President has come out with \nsome kind of gobbledygook, saying that this bill that we pass contains \npork.\n  Does he want more cuts or does he want less cuts? Items that he \nobjected to in the rescissions bill were items that had been passed by \nCongress and signed by the President in past years. Now he objects \nbecause we have not cut the right things? What does he want Congress to \ncut?\n  We stepped up to the plate and gave him some cuts that were carefully \nworked out in this body and in conference with the House. He wants to \nveto that rescission bill.\n  Two things happen if that veto goes through and it is upheld: No. 1, \nwe do not have the money for the emergencies; No. 2, the money that is \nnot rescinded, the budget authority that is not rescinded, will go into \neffect. We will be on an even steeper incline in our rate of spending, \nand it will be more difficult.\n  The President told us back in 1993 he wanted to see us end the \ndeficit. What happened? Did he forget what he said in 1993? He raised \ntaxes to start what he said was the process. He said the second step is \ncutting spending. Where has he gone?\n  Frankly, after the President raised taxes and cut defense, he has \ndecided that that was enough. So what if the deficit goes up every year \non his budget reaching $276 billion by the year 2000. So what if \nanother $1.2 trillion are added to the debt?\n  Well, I think there are some serious consequences. No. 1, it will \nhurt our economy right now. It is going to be a real problem for those \nwho are making a living in our economy today. We are going to see the \npotential of inflation coming back much more strongly. That is what \nhappens when the value of our dollar falls. We are going to see our \ncosts of goods go up. Most of all, we are going to see debt added to \nthe credit cards of our children and our grandchildren.\n  Can we afford to say that we are for our children, we are concerned \nabout children, when we want to walk away from fiscal responsibility \nand add another $1.2 trillion to the $5 trillion we have already put on \ntheir backs? Mr. President, I do not think so.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot of fancy speeches and we will hear \na lot of fancy speeches, but when it comes right down to it, this is \nwhat we say back in Missouri: ``Show me'' time.\n  Are we for cutting spending? Do we want to balance the budget? Or do \nwe want to leave that spending machine going full throttle? I think we \nwill get a fairly clear indication, because when the votes start, we \nwill find out who really is serious about the financial stability of \nour economy today and the total economic security of our future \ngenerations.\n  Do we have the political will? Are we willing to stand up to face the \nmusic and to vote for a tough budget? I believe we will. I will urge my \ncolleagues to support the effort to get the budget deficit to zero and \nmove it into surplus in the year 2002, because it is essential for our \neconomy now. It is essential for the well-being of future generations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Senator will yield for 1 minute to the \nSenator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and fellow Senators, I do not want anyone \nto think that we already have ruled out a vote for tonight. Senators \nasked, are we going to vote tonight?\n  Frankly, we have to use 10 hours of this budget resolution up \ntonight. We started at 12 clock and we are working to see if we cannot \naccomplish that, but clearly we would like to enter into an arrangement \nwhere we would vote tomorrow, at least on a Domenici amendment and on a \nDemocrat amendment. But I have no agreement, nor does the majority \nleader, that we are not to move one of those up to tonight unless we \ncan arrange somehow to get 10 hours out of today's work. Because we \nstill have 30, and that would be 30 for the days of Monday, Tuesday, \nand Wednesday, and our leader has said we are going to be finished on \nWednesday, which will mean very long hours next week.\n  I want to compliment Senator Bond, not only for his remarks today, \nwhich I think were right on point, but actually you cannot get a budget \nresolution out on the floor without a lot of Senators helping you and a \nlot of Senators voting for it.\n  The Senator has been a staunch supporter and formidable proponent of \nthe balanced budget. I want to thank him here in front of all the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, when I come to the floor sometimes I \njust like to respond to what my colleagues have said. Sometimes that \nends up being debate. And then sometimes we come back to it later on.\n  My colleague from Missouri is a friend. I think I enjoy working on \nthe Small Business Committee about as much as I enjoy working on any \ncommittee. But when my colleague said the attitude in Missouri is, \n``Show me,'' and he talked about children, I would remind him and I \nwould remind my good friend from New Mexico that we have not had a lot \nof discussion about children yet. I am going to have several amendments \non the floor eventually. But in talking about the health care cuts, \nthere has been more of a focus on Medicare and less of a focus on \nMedicaid.\n  My understanding--and maybe these numbers are a little bit off--but \nmy understanding is that with the proposed Medicaid cuts, we would be \ncapping the per capita growth rate for expenditures under that program \nat about 1.4 percent. That is compared to a growth rate of about 7 \npercent projected for private expenditures? Am I wrong about these \nfigures?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not know what the 1.7 is. I do not know what that \nis.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The per capita growth rate for Medicaid expenditures--\nafter the proposed cuts--would be about 1.4 percent.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. For Medicaid? I would not know that. I have not figured \nit that way.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. OK. I ask my colleague, at some point in time during \nthe debate it would be helpful to get those numbers.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Fine.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The reason I mention that is that there are, I think, \ntoday in our country about 11 million children who have no health care \ncoverage whatsoever, I say to both of my colleagues. And, every year \nsince 1987, employment-based health insurance coverage has been \ndropping.\n  Do you know what has filled the gap? Medicaid. That is what has \nfilled the gap. I think in Minnesota--I say to my other colleague who \nis presiding--there are about 200,000 children or thereabouts who are \ncovered by Medicaid. I have to say, as long as we are talking about \nchildren, when I see these kinds of dramatic, I think draconian, \nreductions in reimbursement I have to wonder what the effect will be on \nthose children. That is my first point.\n  My second point, and we can come back to it in debate, but I think it \nis a point well worth making because these statistics all mean \nsomething. My colleagues know this. I am not intending to be self-\nrighteous. I am just saying we need to understand the faces behind the \nstatistics.\n  The second point about Medicaid is that I have heard some discussion \n[[Page S6882]] about the power of the senior citizen lobby. The \nmajority of Medicaid expenditures in Minnesota, and I am sure other \nStates as well, go toward nursing homes, covering nursing home expenses \nfor elderly people who by definition are in nursing homes because they \nare frail. Many of them are struggling with diseases and illness. They \nare hardly powerful. I would say to my colleagues, I do not quite know \nwhat we intend to do with the dramatic, draconian cuts in \nreimbursement, Medicaid-wise.\n  I met with a good number of people from southeast Minnesota last \nSaturday and there was one man who runs a hospital nursing home in one \nof our smaller towns in southeast Minnesota. He almost had tears in his \neyes. Maybe this is melodramatic. His question was, ``What is going to \nhappen to these people? Will the State pick up the costs? What is going \nto happen to them?'' That is just a question that I raise.\n  As long as my colleague from Missouri was talking about children, let \nme make another point, and I would like to commend Senator Moynihan \nfrom New York for his powerful voice dealing with the issues of race, \npoverty, gender, and children in America. As I understand it, in this \nbudget proposal we are talking about something like $20 billion in \nreduction for food stamps. I would not want any of my colleagues to \nbelieve, if they do believe so, that by going after fraud--and there \nare some, I am sure, abuses that take place--that is how you get a $20 \nbillion reduction.\n  I ask my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, not to be \nahistorical and to understand that we had a lot of exposes, a lot of \nstudies on these issues. There was a Field Foundation study. There was \na CBS ``Hunger USA'' documentary. And what did those studies point out? \nWhat did we see on television? What we saw was that in the United \nStates of America there were children who were suffering from scurvy \nand rickets, distended bellies, malnutrition, and hunger. As a matter \nof fact, the expansion of the Food Stamp Program, which is one of the \nreally true safety net programs, led to a dramatic reduction in that \nmalnutrition and hunger among children in America. Are we now going to \nturn the clock back? I would like to know where the evidence is that \nsays that we can have those kinds of cuts in a major food assistance \nprogram without having a serious effect on children, the poorest of the \npoor in America.\n  So many of my colleagues keep talking about, ``for the sake of \nchildren in the future.'' How about the children now? Every 30 seconds \na child is born into poverty in America. One out of every four \nchildren--poor; one out of every two children of color--poor. What \nabout those children now?\n  I just mentioned two programs with dramatic reductions, draconian \nreductions. I know we will have time for debate. I have not seen \nanybody stand up yet. I know that we will have this debate and it \nshould be substantive debate. We respect one another. Tell me how we \nare going to do that without harmful consequences to those citizens; in \nthis particular case I am talking about children.\n  We ought not to be doing deficit reduction based upon the path of \nleast political resistance, that is to say targeting those with the \nleast amount of political clout.\n  Second, and maybe last point, because I only have 15 minutes today. \nWhen I heard my colleague from Missouri--and I am sorry he is not here \nnow for purposes of debate--talk about some of the comments that the \nFirst Lady made and Ira Magaziner made about how we could reduce \nMedicare costs, that is true. But that was in the context of overall \nhealth care reform and cost containment systemwide.\n  I say to my colleagues, there are not only consequences to the words \nthat we utter, the words that we speak, there are also consequences to \nthe proposals that we lay out here on the floor of the Senate.\n  I can explain very briefly why in fact the Medicare Program, which is \na benefits program passed in 1965, which has made the United States of \nAmerica a better country, and not just for the senior citizens but for \nall of their children and their grandchildren, has had increasing \ncosts. I can explain why.\n  We have to invest a significant amount of resources into financing \nMedicare because a larger and larger percentage of our population are \nover 65, and a larger and larger percentage of the over-65 population \nare in their eighties. With that comes more illness and higher health \ncare costs. That's why it is important to look at per capita numbers \nwhen we are talking about cuts. We finance it as a nation because it \nsays a lot about who we are.\n  That is what Senator Humphrey from Minnesota meant when he said the \ntest of our country and our society and our Government is how we treat \npeople in the dawn of their lives, the children; the twilight of their \nlives, the elderly; and those in the shadow of their lives, disabled \npeople struggling with illness, and of course the poor people. I do not \nthink this budget meets that standard laid out by the late, great \nSenator from Minnesota, Hubert Humphrey.\n  Mr. President, I heard some reference to comments of the President \nand others about health care reform. But the first thing I would say to \nmy colleagues is this will not work. If you single out one sector, one \ngroup of people, you can talk to any of your providers and they will \ntell you out front and up front that they will shift the cost. They \nhave to. It is a shell game.\n  We should have learned this in the debate on health care last time. \nAnd by the way, I say to my colleague who is now presiding, that in \nKings County, NY, Medicare pays $646 per month per enrollee to an HMO, \nwhereas in Hennepin County, MN, HMO's get $362 per month per enrollee.\n  What will happen is, if our reimbursement is already rock bottom low, \nespecially for those States that have done a good job of keeping the \ncosts down, then the providers have no other choice but to shift the \ncost. They then shift the cost to the employers and the private \ninsurance companies that then raise the costs, and then it gets shifted \nback to the employees, and more people are forced to drop their \ncoverage because it's unaffordable.\n  Mr. President, it will not work if we just shift costs. Talk to \npeople in rural America, not just senior citizens. Talk to the care \nproviders, talk to the nurses, talk to the doctors, talk to the public \nhealth people. It will not work.\n  Mr. President, the essential problem with some of these proposals is, \nA, they do not meet the standard of fairness; B, I do not believe that \nthey are fair just in terms of where the most vulnerable citizens fit \nin or do not fit in to this equation, and on the Medicare front and the \nMedicaid front, as public policy, they do not work. Welcome to health \ncare reform.\n  Tomorrow, when we have our amendment out on Medicare, we will have an \nopportunity to really debate this at great length.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as a former teacher, I really do believe it \nis extremely shortsighted to make a lot of these cuts. As a matter of \nfact, I think what I might do in the course of the debate is bring out \nthe Kasich budget which was passed by the House of Representatives so \nwe could have a vote on that on the floor of the Senate since I think \nit does an even more draconian job when it comes to cutting higher \neducation. But I would just argue today that it is myopic, it is \nshortsighted not to invest in young people and not to invest in their \neducation.\n  I could boil it down to the following kind of analysis in less than 2 \nminutes, I hope. If you want to have real welfare reform: A good \neducation, a good job, and decent health care. If you want to reduce \npoverty: A good education, a good job, and decent health care. If you \nwant to reduce violence: A good education, a good job, and decent \nhealth care. If you want to have a stable middle class: A good \neducation, a good job, and decent health care. If you want to compete \nin the international economic arena: A good education, a good job, and \ndecent health care. And if you want to have a representative democracy \nwith men and women who can think on their own two feet and understand \nthe world, the country, and the community that they live in, what they \ncan do to make it a better world and a better country and a better \ncommunity, keep your focus on a good education, a good job, and decent \nhealth care.\n  This budget moves us precisely in the opposite direction. It is \nprofoundly mistaken for our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Senator will yield for 30 seconds. \n[[Page S6883]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much. Could I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing Senator Hollings, Senator Bennett be in order for 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I certainly agree to that. I ask after Senator Bennett, \ncould we have Senator Murray recognized for 15 minutes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could we have Senator Santorum immediately following \nSenator Murray? That would give us five.\n  Mr. President, I so request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Bennett, 15 minutes; Senator Murray \nfor 15 minutes; and Senator Santorum for 15 minutes, following the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. President, in the brief moment that I have, I would like to voice \na note of sobriety with respect to this debate, and to agree for \nstarters about the bigness of Government.\n  I have played this budget game for 35 years. As Governor 35 years \nago, I balanced the budget in the State of South Carolina, and earned a \ntriple-A credit rating. Some 27 years ago, in 1968, I worked with \nGeorge Mahon, then chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and we \nbalanced the budget.\n  Mr. President, when we hear the hue and cry to get rid of big \nGovernment, we ought to focus on what it is about government that is \nreally big. In 1968 when President Lyndon Johnson balanced the budget, \nhe faced gross interest costs on the national debt of $14.6 billion. \nThat is after almost 200 years of history. Through 36 Presidents, \nRepublican and Democrat, the Revolutionary War of 1812, the Civil War, \nthe Spanish-American War, Mexican, all the wars, World Wars I and II, \nand Korea, a good part of the war in Vietnam, the mandatory spending of \ninterest costs was only $14.6 billion.\n  If my colleagues listen to nothing else, let them listen to this \nfact. According to the Congressional Budget Office in February of this \nyear, the mandatory spending of gross interest costs is estimated at \n$340 billion.\n  Oh, boy, has the size of Government increased. How did it grow? Let \nme go right to the heart of the matter and quote none other than the \nchairman of President Reagan's Office of Management and Budget, David \nStockman. I quote:\n\n       The root problem goes back to the July 1981 frenzy of \n     excessive and imprudent tax cutting that shattered the \n     Nation's fiscal stability. A noisy faction of Republicans \n     have willfully denied the giant mistake of fiscal governance, \n     and their culpability in it ever since. Instead, they have \n     incessantly poisoned the political debate with a mindless \n     stream of antitax venom while pretending that economic growth \n     and spending cuts alone could contain the deficit.\n\n  Mr. President, we are watching history repeat itself as Republicans \ntoday make the same mistake of insisting that the deficit can be \nconquered through spending cuts alone.\n  Lord knows, I have tried. I have worked in a bipartisan way for a \nbalanced budget. As chairman of the Budget Committee 15 years ago, I \nworked closely with Henry Bellmon, then the ranking Republican.\n  In 1980, contrary to what some of the weekly magazines would have you \nbelieve, Senator Bellmon and I presented a balanced budget. In 1985, \nSenator Gramm, Senator Rudman, and Senator Hollings presented a \nbalanced budget, planned over 5 years rather than 7 years. We were \nsupposed to have balanced the budget by 1990, but then Congress pushed \nback the goalposts and eventually repealed the fixed deficit targets.\n  I worked with Republican Senators Boschwitz and Danforth on a value-\nadded tax, 5 years ago. In the Budget Committee, some eight members \nvoted for a value-added tax. Why? Because we needed it. But \nunfortunately today, the charade continues.\n  The truth of the matter is that cutting taxes as they say by some \n$350 billion over 10 years, actually increases the interest costs or \ntaxes on the gross debt. It has been said that there are two things in \nlife that you cannot avoid, death and taxes. Actually, there are three \nthings, death, taxes, and interest taxes on the national debt.\n  So when they talk in a blasphemous fashion about cutting taxes, it \ncomes time for the sober truth. They can try to get away with this \ncharade, but the fact is that they are increasing taxes.\n  Now, there are two-ways, Mr. President, to approach this problem. One \nis a balanced plan of freezing spending, cutting spending, closing tax \nloopholes, and increasing revenues.\n  But the other way, of course, is the Vietnam approach--destroy the \nGovernment in order to save it. It gives you the image, it gives you \nthe headline, it gives you what they are talking about, a balanced \nbudget.\n  But I ask the Members to turn to page 7 of the Senate budget \nresolution. There it plainly says that in the year 2002 we will have a \ndeficit of $113.5 billion. That is just the real deficit. If we turn to \npage 9 where the annual increases in the public debt are listed, in \nfiscal year 2002 the debt increases $177.7 billion. The distinguished \noccupant of the chair on the other side is a very successful \nbusinessman. He knows. Look at page 9. Fiscal year 2002, the debt \nincreases $177.7 billion.\n  So, yes, President Clinton has a budget where the deficits go up as \nfar as the eye can see. The Republican budget now that we have before \nus, unfortunately, has deficits of $177.7 billion as far as the eye can \nsee. That is the truth. Those are the facts.\n  We hear a lot of talk about reducing the deficit, but if we want to \nfathom the true depths of their sincerity, we ought to turn to page 74 \nof the resolution.\n  I am reminded of the story about the days when we had the literacy \ntest. Poor black men would come to the polls to vote and would be given \nthe Chinese newspaper. They would be told, ``Boy, read that.'' The \nblack man would take the paper, look at it one way then turn the paper \naround and around. When he would finally be asked what it said, the man \nwould reply, ``It says ain't no black gonna vote in South Carolina \ntoday.''\n  Now, I read this one on page 74, five little words: ``For legislation \nthat reduces revenues.'' Do you know what that means? It means we are \ngoing to allow for a $350 billion tax cut, just like they are doing \nover on the House side.\n  You have to know the tricks of the trade. The real problem is that \nthose tax cuts are going to be written in stone. The spending cuts will \nnever occur. Part of them will occur. But the bottom line will be we \nwill be up, up and away with deficits and increased spending for \ninterest costs.\n  We need to cut out this total fraud that you can do it with spending \ncuts alone. We have to get serious. You could eliminate all of the \nnondefense discretionary programs--all $275 billion of them--and we \nwould still be in the red because of the $340 billion that we have to \nspend on interest costs. It is Alice in Wonderland: To stay where you \nare, you have to run as fast as you can. To get ahead, you have to run \neven faster.\n  The ox is in the ditch. We have to get to work seriously here and cut \nout the monkeyshines with Social Security, as they did during debate on \nthe constitutional amendment, and as they do now. The provision that \nJohn Heinz and I put in the law, section 13301 of the Budget \nEnforcement Act, says: `` Thou shalt not use Social Security trust \nfunds for the deficit.'' We asked them to obey it in the Budget \nCommittee and, to my shock, 12 Republican Senators voted against that \nlaw in the Budget Committee.\n  Now, if I had Hollings Enterprises as a business and I went to file \nmy annual statement to the Securities and Exchange section, and I was \nusing my pension fund to mask the size of my deficit, I would be in \njail. They would haul me off to the hoosegow.\n  We need to stop, look, and listen and get away from this \ngamesmanship. Republicans talk now as if they are the only ones \ninterested in the deficit. Perhaps they have forgotten that President \nClinton came to town and cut it $500 billion through a balanced \napproach of spending cuts and tax increases. He followed that up with \nan effort to reform Medicare and Medicaid that fell upon deaf ears as \nRepublicans claimed that there was no health care crisis. Now, all of a \nsudden they are sounding the alarm and citing the need for decisive \naction to save the HI trust fund from bankruptcy. How ironic that \n[[Page S6884]] the Contract With America calls for taking $25 billion \nout of the Medicare trust fund.\n   Mr. President, they are playing games with you. They talk as if they \nare so interested in this year's report from the Medicare trustees \nshowing that the fund would be in the red by 2002, but last year the \nvery same report showed that Medicare would be bankrupt by 2001.\n   And now they say, ``We never knew this. We have to go to work.'' \nLast year, they said there was not any trouble with health care; \nMedicare was fine.\n  Can you imagine, $256 billion out of Medicare? We cut $56 billion the \nyear before last. The President offered another $125 billion last year \nwhich you called fantasy. And now you come along with $256 billion and \nsay you need a commission to find it? That is what I call passing the \nbuck. That is punting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Bennett, under a previous order, is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am interested in the various references \nthat are made from time to time on this floor about business practices; \ncomments such as, ``Why, if we did this in a business the way we are \ndoing it in Government, we would go to jail. We can't do that on a \nfiling for the SEC.''\n  Mr. President, as you may know, I have run a business, run several. I \nhave filled out forms for the SEC. I have signed 10 Q's, I have signed \n10 K's. I understand the requirements of honest accounting. And I \nassure the Chair and this Senate that what I am about to say is honest \naccounting. I am not trying to mislead anybody as to what we are facing \nas a Nation. I am not trying to make rhetorical points on fine shavings \nof definitions within committee language. I am trying to be as direct \nand straightforward as I know how.\n  I will start out with a chart that we have seen before and we will no \ndoubt see again but which we need to keep in front of us throughout \nthis whole debate.\n  The information, Mr. President, on this chart comes from the \nEntitlements Commission which shows that if we listen to all of the \nrhetoric that says, ``Why, you can't do this. This will hurt this \ngroup. You can't do that. It will hurt this group,'' which ends up \nbeing ``You can't do anything,'' the present trends are simply not \nsustainable.\n  I remind the Chair and the Chamber, once again, that if we do \nnothing, we let things go as they are going, within 10 years, by the \nyear 2006, we will be in a circumstance where the cash outlays and the \ncash revenues of the Government comes to the condition that everything \nwe spend as a Government will have to be borrowed.\n  That which we do not have control over in the budget, which is in the \nred bar--entitlement spending and interest--we have no control over \nthat. We are contractually obligated to that. The entitlements, by law, \nhave to go out. The interest, by law, has to be paid. That means \neverything else--which includes the Defense Department, includes \nbuilding highways, includes everything else the Government does--will \nhave to be borrowed. This is the reality with which we live. It is \nreal.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Entitlements Commission on \nthe floor. I thank him for his work and his courage.\n  This is the situation in which we find ourselves. Let us not kid \nourselves by saying, ``Oh, this particular phrase of the budget \ndocument does not apply here and we will look at this.'' This is cash \noutlays.\n  I have managed a business. I will tell you the most important way to \nmanage a business is on cash flow. You may have a balance sheet that \nsays you have a whole lot of money, but if that money is all tied in \ninventory and receivables and you do not have the cash with which to \npay your bills, you are in trouble. And you can go to the SEC all you \nwant and say, ``Oh, this is the way I keep my books.'' You pay taxes, \nyou pay wages, in cash. And this is the cash picture of what happens if \nwe do not do anything.\n  Now, we are told, ``Oh, we can't hurt this group. We can't hurt that \ngroup. Look at these terrible cuts.''\n  I give you the second chart prepared by the Budget Committee on the \nterrible cuts that we are talking about in this budget.\n  What are the terrible cuts we are going to inflict on Medicare? Well, \nactually, you know, Medicare is going to go up by $105 billion.\n  I am a businessman. In my vocabulary a $105 billion increase is not a \ncut. I had to come to Washington to learn the definition of ``cut.'' It \nmeans you spend more this year than you spent last year, but you just \nspend less than somebody else promised you would in some previous year. \nThat is the Washington definition of ``cut.''\n  All this reference to business; I am a businessman. This, to me, is \nan increase. Put it on a per capita basis right now, Mr. President, and \nwe are spending per Medicare recipient per year just under $5,000. That \nis today's figure, 4,900 and-some-odd dollars.\n  Under the budget proposed by the Budget Committee, by the time we get \nto 2002, that number will be $6,450. So we are going to punish the \nMedicare population by raising their per capita expenditures from \n$4,900 to $6,400. That is how we are going to punish them. To me, that \nis not a cut.\n  Now, we talk about trends. ``Oh, but the Medicare population is \ngrowing. The Medicare population is so big we have to spend more than \nthat. That will not work.''\n  As I say, that is a per capita number, Mr. President, from $4,900 to \n$6,400 per capita.\n  But what is the overall number?\n  Here is the chart I used in a previous statement I made on this \nsubject. Medical expenditures, where the distinguished minority leader \nhad said, ``You know, our problem is that public funds are growing at \nthe same rate as private funds,'' and I said, ``No, that is not true.''\n  I got the information from the Congressional Reference Service of the \nLibrary of Congress. Here are the trends. The dark figures are the \npercentage of increase in public expenditures for medical activity. \nThis is combined Medicare and Medicaid. The light figures are for the \nprivate rate of increase.\n  Here we are, the worst year, 1990, public expenditures in health care \nwent up 13.2 percent that year. The private rate of increase was 10.6. \nStill unsustainable. In the private sector, they went to work on that, \nbrought it down, cut it in half the next year, in 1991. Public \nexpenditures came down from 13.2 to 12.6.\n  The following year, they could not hold it down on the private side. \nIt came up to 9.9, then 7.2, and then last year, 1994, brought it down \nto 5.3. The public expenditures came down from 12.6 to 10.8 to 8.5, and \nlast year, 7.8.\n  That is the level, Mr. President, at which this budget calls for it \nto stay--a 7-percent annual rate of increase in Medicare is what this \nbudget is talking about.\n We have done it in 1994. Can we not do it for the next 5, 7 years?\n\n  I will say, this combines both Medicare and Medicaid and, therefore, \nthat overall figure is misleading and it is not proper for me--I said I \nam going to be honest in my accounting--it is not proper for me to say \nthat applies directly to Medicare because Medicare at the moment is \ncloser to 10 percent and Medicaid is the lower figure, and that is why \nthe average is there.\n  But that is the target we have to have, that is the target we do have \nin this budget and that is the target I believe we can meet.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin says, you cannot do it to our older \npopulation, you cannot balance this by attacking one segment of the \npopulation, you cannot single out one sector. And then he talks about \neducation, you cannot single out education. And pretty soon, if you \nfollow that logic, you end up with no sector at all that can be cut.\n  I go back to the other chart. I referenced this before strictly on \nthe Medicare side pointing out that we are talking about a $105 billion \nincrease in Medicare. We are also talking about $146 billion increase \nin Social Security, a $36 billion increase in Medicaid, a $51 billion \nincrease in other mandatory programs. The only thing that gets cut is \ndomestic discretionary spending. Defense remains the same in this \nbudget. Interest has to go up because the debt is coming up. \n[[Page S6885]] \n  But what is the total? Nearly $1.9 trillion. I am reminded of the \ncartoon that appeared in the paper where the Republican was writing on \nthe board the budget for 2002, $1.9 trillion, and the other person \nsaid: ``Is that all?\"\n  Mr. President, I have been involved personally in the challenge of \ndownsizing a company. I grant immediately this challenge is vastly \ngreater, but the principles are the same. Time and again, I would say, \n``We have to take something out of the overhead of this company.''\n  People would come in to me and say, ``I agree, we have to take \nsomething out of the overhead, but don't cut my department'' for this \nreason or that reason and how vital it was.\n  Finally, I had to get their attention, and I said: All right, I won't \ncut your department, I won't cut anybody's department. I'll let \neverybody walk out of here feeling comfortable, happy and wonderful \nright up to the point where you file for unemployment, because the \ncompany is going broke.\n  Oh. Well, now, you explained it to me. Maybe I can find something in \nmy department to cut.\n  That was the company equivalent, Mr. President, of this chart. This \nis the chart I began with, this is the chart I come back to. This is \nthe situation we are facing. Do we have the courage to recognize this \nis the situation we are facing and do what has to be done?\n  Mr. President, we celebrated this year a number of anniversaries \nrelating to the Second World War. I am one who is old enough to \nremember the Second World War. I did not fight in it. I was just a \nlittle kid. My brother went over in the Second World War. He was in \nOkinawa when President Truman decided to drop the bomb.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you. The President of the United States came to \nthe American people and said, ``This is the situation we are facing. If \nwe do not do something about it, we are in serious trouble,'' and he \ndemanded sacrifices from the American people. He was up front with \nthem. He made no bones about the difficulties that we face.\n  How disrupting was that experience in the lives of Americans? \nHundreds of thousands of them lost their lives. Millions had their \nlives disrupted. They did it because they recognized that there was a \npurpose for doing it and that their Government was being honest with \nthem.\n  For far too long in this Chamber, our Government has not been honest \nwith our people and, therefore, of course, they do not want to \nsacrifice, of course, they do not want to have their lives disrupted. I \ndo not want to have my life disrupted. I want everything to go on as \ngood as it has been going, but the time has come to recognize that we \nare facing a long-term crisis as severe as any we have faced, and we \nhave to be as honest as we have ever been.\n  So I say, all right, you do not want to do this by restraining the \ngrowth of Medicare, even though the rate of growth of Medicare is not \nsustainable either in this circumstance or, frankly, by comparison to \nwhat is going on in health care in the private sector with this \ncircumstance. All right, you do not want to do it with that one? What \ndo you want to do it with?\n  This budget says we do it with everybody. This budget says we do not \nsingle out a single sector to balance the budget on the backs of any \nparticular group. We say to everybody, the time has come to recognize \nthe crisis with which we are dealing and deal with it evenhandedly.\n  I would say to those who are complaining about this budget, then give \nus your alternative that is equally evenhanded that deals with all \npolitical groups with the same courage with which this deals with \npolitical groups and let us get forward. But do not tell us we cannot \nadopt this budget because it disturbs this or that or the other sector \nin terms of their status quo because that kind of circumstance, Mr. \nPresident, is simply not being honest with the American people, and the \ntime for honesty is here.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was here and listened to all of the remarks. I want \nto congratulate Senator Bennett. I believe he made an eloquent \nstatement. I am sorry that he did not have more time tonight to talk \nabout the realities of what we can afford as a people versus the \nwishful thinking and exaggerated promises that we have been used to \nmaking to the public of America, to our people.\n  I compliment him for it and thank him for his excellence, both in \nunderstanding and hard work and knowledge of matters such as this.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous unanimous consent order, \nSenator Murray is recognized to speak for 15 minutes, followed by \nSenator Santorum, of Pennsylvania, for 15 minutes.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, when I first came here, the Federal \nbudget deficit stood at nearly $300 billion, and for 3 years in a row, \nwe worked with common sense and clear purpose to reduce that deficit. I \nwas not here when this deficit was run up, but I was not elected to \nbring home the bacon, and I know that politics as usual will not sell \nanymore. We must reduce the deficit. But I say to my friends, there is \na right way to cut spending, to streamline Government and to reduce the \ndeficit. I think the correct path was the one we started down in 1993.\n  On the other hand, there are radical approaches which might be \neffective at slashing spending and cutting programs, but we have to ask \nthe question, at what cost?\n  The American people deserve a sound budget. They deserve proposals \nthat meet their urgent needs and reflect their spending priorities. \nThey deserve investments in our future. They deserve security for \nthemselves and for their families, and I firmly believe that taxpayers \ndeserve to get something back from the system that they are paying \ninto.\n  I look carefully and critically at this Nation's budget to make sure \nthat it adequately deals with investments in our basic American quality \nof life. Our children must be prepared for tomorrow. The health of our \ncitizens must be secure and our neighborhoods and towns must be safe.\n  That is how I begin this process every year, Mr. President. I start \nfrom the premise that as Americans we have special rights and \nresponsibilities, and this body must acknowledge them both. I believe \nin personal responsibility. I believe we must take charge of our own \nlives and live up to the obligations that citizenship in this country \nbrings with it. But some Americans, some members of our society cannot \nmake it on their own. There is a great deal of insecurity and a bitter \nloss of self-confidence out there. I saw it in the faces of my friends \nand neighbors when I was home in the State of Washington. I would hear \nit around my kitchen table every night: The middle class, average \nAmericans feel that they are not in control of their own destiny. \nMachinists at the Boeing Co. tell me they feel their jobs are not \nsecure in these days of corporate downsizing, and they feel there is \nnothing they can do about it.\n  Parents tell me they are worried about their kids' safety and \nviolence in the streets, and they feel powerless. My own two teenagers \nand their friends, the so-called generation X, our future leaders, talk \nwith me about poor job prospects, about never receiving Social \nSecurity, not being able to afford to go to college, and the sad and \nunyielding spread of AIDS. They feel they cannot make the future \nbrighter.\n  Today, information flows through our society at such a rapid pace, \ntechnological innovations seem to be outpacing daily life. Average \nAmericans feel overtaken by it. Bankers and economists warn me that in \nour interdependent world the dollar falls to record lows and derivative \ninvestments threaten our financial security and soundness. They feel \nthe economic solution is beyond their control. Doctors and nurses and \nadministrators in hospitals and community-based clinics tell me that \nentitlement programs do need reform. But so does the entire health care \nsystem.\n  If the severe Medicare and Medicaid cuts are kept in this budget, \nthey will not be able to deal with the growing caseload of those who \nneed help and have no means to pay for their own medical care. \n[[Page S6886]] \n  Mr. President, imagine the hopelessness of a young family with a \nnewborn baby diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. First, one parent has to \nquit their job to care for that child and their income drops \ndramatically; insurance runs out, and the young family is forced to \nspend down in order to get health care--Medicaid--for their child. That \nis the family I speak for in this budget process. That is the family I \nthink of when I remember the simple truth our parents taught us: \n``There, but for the grace of God, go I.''\n  That family could easily be mine or yours, Mr. President. I am \nraising two kids at home. I have elderly parents who are not always in \nthe best of health. Like so many Americans, I am squeezed between my \nkids and my own parents. That is why I share with many Americans the \ngrave concern about the Medicare cuts. How will the program be \nreformed? Many people have come to me recently and have told me they \nare afraid that these cuts will result in higher out-of-pocket payments \nfor seniors who are already struggling. They believe cuts will result \nin limiting choices for seniors.\n  My parents have had the same doctor for years in Washington State; \nthey do not want to lose their doctor because of a budget plan imposed \non them from Washington, DC. From the rural eastern part of my State, I \nhear the rumbling of concern. Many Medicare beneficiaries live in these \ncommunities which often share a single hospital.\n  These cuts to the Medicare program have the potential to cause some \nof the hospitals to close--or to shift--a great amount of their costs \nto local taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, this brings me to a major concern. By simply cutting \nfunds to Medicare, we are passing on the cost of care for our seniors--\nour parents--to the hospitals around the country, and those hospitals \nwill pass on the costs to working families across this Nation.\n  I refuse to stand here on the floor of the U.S. Senate and talk about \nthe budget as if it is just a bunch of numbers. There is a senior \ncitizen and a child and an American family behind every number in this \nbudget. I am afraid that in this time of great uncertainty, in this \ntime of anxiety, we will be telling average American families, ``You \nare on your own.''\n  We in the Senate have a choice. We can build self-confidence, we can \ninspire hope, and we can restore trust in our Government and its \nability to work for average Americans. And we can do this at the same \ntime we reduce the deficit, if we do it with common sense. That is the \nright way.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Or, Madam President, we can feed into the Social \nDarwinist thinking of survival of the fittest. Serving the special \ninterests who are up here writing legislation. Giving Goliath an \nadvantage. And that is the wrong way.\n  I am hopeful that we will be able to work on a budget over the coming \ndays, which keeps us on the right path.\n  I look across the aisle to Members of your party, and I see true \nchampions of certain causes, and I have been pleased to support many of \nthem in their efforts.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from \nNew Mexico, has always been a forceful advocate for funding mental \nhealth programs, and he has always looked out for Federal workers.\n  Madam President, I am proud to serve on his committee with Senators \nwho have provided real leadership and hope to the American people on \nmany issues.\n  I know that my friend from Maine, who is presiding over the Senate at \nthis moment, has been stalwart on women's health issues. Senator \nGrassley from Iowa has spent years defending the family farmer. My \nfriend from Missouri, Senator Bond, has displayed real leadership by \nkeeping programs like HOPWA from the rescissions axe. These are my \nRepublican colleagues on the Budget Committee, and I am proud to serve \nwith them. I have supported all of these efforts in the past, and I \nwill continue to do so in this Congress.\n  So I hope that some of our colleagues on your side of the aisle, \nMadam President, will look with favor on programs that are important to \nme, especially the education of our children, both in their early years \nand in gaining access to college and vocational programs.\n  For my State, there are other important budget issues before us: The \ncleanup of Hanford Nuclear Reservation and the funding of the Eximbank; \nimpact aid for educating the children of our men and women in uniform; \nhelp for fishers and timber workers who have been dislocated, and all \nprograms that ease anxiety and restore hope.\n  Madam President, I know firsthand how much hope is needed out there. \nI know firsthand how much harm this budget will do to average \nAmericans.\n  I am one of the millions of ordinary Americans who is worried about \nher elderly parents. I am one of the millions of average people who \nwants her children to be able to go to college. I am one of the people \nout there driving to work every day and just trying to juggle the \npressures of everyday life for myself and my family.\n  But, Madam President, this budget adds to the pressure. It does so \nmuch harm to working people--I find it incredible that it cuts the \nearned income tax credit so severely. I find it incredible that this \nbudget raises the taxes on our working families. Let average Americans \nmake no mistake about it--Republicans are increasing taxes on working \nfamilies.\n  In Washington State alone, this budget means an average tax increase \nof $1,400 over 7 years on nearly 180,000 working families.\n  I am a product of the Western United States. I was born in Washington \nState. I grew up there. I am one of seven children who learned from our \nparents that we should always pull ourselves up by our own bootstraps. \nBut this budget steals our shoelaces.\n  So I plan to offer amendments on the floor, Madam President, that \nmove this budget in restoring some common sense.\n  I will offer one amendment on impact aid, and I will offer another \none to protect children from drastic cuts in Medicaid.\n  And, Madam President, let me make this clear, these are not frivolous \namendments. They have been drafted carefully and I hope that they do \npass. It is not my intention to embarrass anybody. My amendments are \nsincere attempts to improve this budget, and they reflect my highest \npriorities, for I believe we have the chance today to outline clearly \nour priorities for this Nation.\n  Each of us was sent to the Senate to serve the country and to \narticulate the specific concerns of our friends and neighbors at home.\n  So let me conclude here with just a few words of caution. No one \ndoubts the need to put our fiscal house in order. But what I fear the \nmost is that it will be done with an eye only toward today, without \nconsidering the consequences for tomorrow.\n  Deficit reduction is not an economic policy in and of itself. And \nunder today's cut, cut, cut mantra, I cannot allow us to forget the \nword ``compassion.''\n  I worry that slash and burn politics will override common sense and \nfairness, especially for our children.\n  We are looking here today at the Wizard of Oz budget: No heart, no \nbrain, no courage, and no home. And there is too much at stake.\n  At a fast and furious pace these days, polls tell us what Americans \nbelieve about an issue before they have even had time to really make up \ntheir minds about it.\n  I caution my friends--before you impose draconian Medicare and \nMedicaid cuts on the most vulnerable members of our society--do not be \ntoo hasty to legislate based on the shifting sands of current political \npopularity.\n  Let us keep things in perspective, Madam President, and let us \nremember the little guy.\n  Let us talk about priorities and plans, not just cuts and contracts. \nLet us use this budget process to restore hope, to ease anxiety, and to \nmake the future brighter for average Americans. I look forward to this \ndebate.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I would like to take a moment on my time \nto congratulate my friend and colleague from the State of Washington. \nHere is a teacher, a mother, someone that is really dedicated to the \ncause that we are trying to espouse on this side of the aisle. I thank \nher for her excellent remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6853-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6887-S6906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S6887]]\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that prior to the \nclose of business today, Senator Domenici be recognized to offer a \nsubstitute amendment, the text of which is President Clinton's budget; \nthat no other amendments be in order during the pendency of the \nDomenici amendment; that a vote occur on the amendment at 10:45 a.m. on \nFriday, May 19, 1995, without any intervening action or debate; and \nthat the time between 10:15 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. be under the control of \nSenator Exon, and 10:30 a.m. and 10:45 a.m. under the control of \nSenator Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, and I will \nnot object, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may state the inquiry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the substitute offered by Senator Domenici is agreed \nto, is the resolution as amended by the substitute further amendable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only with the amendments that are \nmathematically consistent.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So that the numbers may be changed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. DOLE. I add further, if the substitute is adopted, I will be out \nof work.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Was that a parliamentary inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I further ask that following the \ndisposition of the Domenici amendment, Senators Lautenberg and \nRockefeller be recognized to offer an amendment relative to restoring \nthe Medicare funds; that no amendments be in order to the amendment; \nthat no amendments be in order to the language proposed to be stricken; \nand that a vote occur on the amendment at 3:15 p.m. Monday, May 22, \nwithout any intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, do I \nunderstand that neither of these consents waive any Senator's right to \nmake a point of order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not correct. They would indeed waive \nthe right to make a point of order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On either?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On either.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not know whether there would be a point of order, \nbut I usually make this proposal before every amendment, and I just \nforgot this evening. Nobody is waiving the right to the point of order. \nIt is not that urgent, let it go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his cooperation.\n  Let me just explain to my colleagues, then, the Senator will lay down \nthe amendment tonight, and it is my understanding at the end of the day \nthere will be 40 hours left in today's session.\n  Then hopefully tomorrow we will be in long enough to take 10 more \nhours, and after tomorrow there will be 30 hours left. So we start \nMonday with 30 hours. We would like to complete action on this bill on \nWednesday so we can take up the President's request on the \nantiterrorism bill and pass that before the recess.\n  So there will be one vote tomorrow. And first vote on Monday will be \nat 3:15. There may be votes after that vote on Monday.\n  So I urge my colleagues to not leave on the assumption that there \nwill only be one vote on Monday. There could be several votes on \nMonday. I assume after the disposition of the Lautenberg-Rockefeller \namendment, there will be an amendment offered on this side. I assume we \nare going to rotate back and forth.\n  So there could be several amendments, because again we will be in \nsession at least 10 hours on Monday, maybe longer.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I share the understanding of the \ndistinguished majority leader with regard to the schedule for the next \ncouple of days. Even though there is only one rollcall vote tomorrow, \nwe have a very important debate that will begin immediately after that \nvote. It will be on the issue of Medicare. And I urge my colleagues to \nuse this time to the fullest benefit. That time will be lost, if we do \nnot use it tomorrow. It is very important that all of our colleagues \nappreciate the time that we have available to us tomorrow and Monday to \ndebate this important issue.\n  So I encourage our participation, and certainly hope that you will \ntake full advantage of the hours that are available to us following the \ndisposition of the first vote at 10:45 in the morning.\n  We will have another vote on Monday. It will be on the Medicare \namendment, and between now and then I would hope that all of our \ncolleagues will fully avail themselves of the opportunity that we now \nhave to debate this amendment to the fullest extent possible.\n  So I think this is a good agreement that gets us off to a good start. \nI would certainly hope that between Friday morning and Monday afternoon \nwe have no quorum calls, and that we use every moment available to us \nto participate in the debate on the Medicare amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nconclusion of the remarks by the Senator from Pennsylvania that the \nSenator from Kentucky, Senator Ford, be recognized on this side for 20 \nminutes, and then we will continue the usual process of going back and \nforth.\n  I do not know who is scheduled. Senator Lott will be scheduled after \nthat for 15 minutes. Following the conclusion of the remarks by the \nSenator from Kentucky, Senator Lott will be recognized for 15 minutes. \nFollowing that, Senator Bumpers on this side will be recognized for 20 \nminutes. And then, if there is a speaker on that side, they will be \nnext following Senator Bumpers on this side, and Senator Kerrey will be \nrecognized after that for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the distinguished minority leader might \njust engage in a little discussion with me about amendments.\n  We already are asking Senators on our side to submit amendments to me \nas floor manager to just see where we are. I know for many it seems \nearly. But, frankly, time is going to be really moving. I think it \nwould be helpful to all of us the sooner we knew. I am not asking for \ndetails. But the sooner we know, more or less, where we are, we will \nfinish at a point certain, at a time certain. Everybody knows that. If \nthere are amendments that we have debated, they will get a vote, if \nthey want one. But there will be no discussion. The sooner we know \nmaybe the sooner we might accommodate in some realistic way the \nSenators who desire to have a little time to speak.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator will yield, the Senator is correct. I \nthink it would be very helpful for all Senators to share with us their \nintentions with regard to amendments as soon as possible. We already \nhave a list we are compiling. We would be happy to share it with you. I \nthink it is our intention following the amendment relating to Medicare \nto offer an amendment relating to education, and following that an \namendment relating to the EIPC. There will be an amendment relating to \nMedicare, and EIPC, and education.\n  So the order for our side will be that, and we will be able to give \nyou more information as we go through the list.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I had the opportunity, Madam President, to be on the \nfloor for just a few minutes when the resolution was laid down, and \nspoke about what a historic time this was for our country, and that a \nmajority of Senators from the House and from the Senate--the House \nhaving passed their budget resolution earlier today--had the courage to \ncome forward and present a budget resolution that brought our Federal \nbudget into balance.\n  That is not an easy thing to do. If it was an easy thing to do, it \nwould have [[Page S6888]] been done at least 25 times over the last 25 \nyears, but it has not been done once.\n  I give a lot of credit to the Senator from New Mexico for his \ntremendous work on crafting the legislation; the Congressman from Ohio, \nJohn Kasich, for the work he has done on the House side; and to all of \nthe Republicans who are standing shoulder to shoulder to push this \neffort forward for the future of this country.\n  This is a historic time. This is a great opportunity for America as a \ncountry to face the realities of the future, to stop the endless \npolitical games of promising what we cannot deliver on, and letting \nother generations of Americans pay for our political expediency.\n  I am excited. I am excited to be here during this time. I think this \nwill be one of the great debates in history. I think this will be one \nof the great defining moments of our time.\n  It is just unfortunate, it is truly unfortunate, that at one of these \ndefining moments where the country can really face the future, it is \ngoing to be done without the Chief Executive Officer of this country. \nHe has decided that he is going to take absence without leadership, \nAWOL on this issue. He has decided that he does not want to participate \nin the process. He has decided in debates with himself that he is not \nrelevant to this process, and that he is going to sit on the sidelines \nand throw whatever he can at those who are trying to move this country \nforward to balance the budget.\n  It is a great disappointment to me and I know to many Americans that \nthe Chief Executive Officer, the President, has decided to take this \ncourse.\n  What I have decided to do is to remind everyone here of the \nPresident's action or inaction on this effort. Starting today, the \nfirst day in which the budget resolution was laid down here on the \nSenate floor, I am going to bring this chart to the floor every day \nbetween now and October 1 of this year, when the next fiscal year \nstarts, and going to tell the American public how many days it has been \nsince the Republicans laid down a balanced budget resolution to get \nthis country to balance, and how many days it has been since Bill \nClinton has decided to leave town when it came to this issue.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, in the last election for President \nhad the rallying cry of ``Where's George?'' Well the question today is \n``Where's Bill?'' I guess on day one, the answer is, as the Senator \nfrom Kansas the majority leader has said, he is AWOL. Absent without \nleadership.\n  Today is day one. I suspect, although I hope it is not the case, that \nover the next 135 days between now and the end of September, that I \nwill be putting up day after day, numbers on this chart to show that \nthe President truly is not serious about leading this country, about \nmoving forward in a direction that will preserve this country's not \njust financial future but future as a society.\n  I am actually fairly sad to have to come here and do this. I think it \nis in a time of great courage that we are seeing in the Congress, a \nvery sad state of affairs that we have a President who has decided not \nto participate.\n  By the way, this is the same President who in 1993 he and his budget \ndirectors and many on the other side of the aisle, were clamoring about \nhow the Republicans were not putting up their plan.\n  Where was their plan in 1993 to reduce the deficit? We are not \ntalking about just reducing the deficit here. We are talking about \ngetting to a balanced budget. Something which the President's plan does \nnot do.\n  I want to quote the President in February of 1993. The President's \ndemand to the Republicans in Congress, ``Not hot air, show me where.''\n  Well, Mr. President, ``Not hot air, show me where.'' If the President \nwants to lead, lead. That means the President has to propose, just for \nsome instruction. The President has to propose something in order to \nlead somewhere.\n  The situation is the President being absent from this debate is not \nunusual when it comes to the budget this year. We have a President who \nhas refused to put forward a balanced budget resolution, has refused to \nput forward anything that is going to reduce the rate of growth in the \ndeficit. In fact, according to the numbers of the President, modest \nnumbers he wants us to use, his deficit goes up over the next 7 years \nup to $267 billion by the year 2002, according to the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office of which the President said we should use \nin determining his numbers.\n  And his first chance this year, his first chance this year to put a \ndownpayment on the deficit, is a $16 billion rescissions bill, which \nyesterday in the Washington Post he said that he was going to veto; a \n$16 billion rescissions bill.\n  There is a President who simply wants to preserve the status quo, and \nall you will hear over the next 5 days are people who created this \nGovernment here in the Congress and who want to defend every program, \nand if we touch a hair on one of them, the sky will fall, the Earth \nwill erupt, and life will never be the same again here.\n  Well, let me just suggest that, if we do not touch some of these \nprograms, literally thousands and thousands of programs, if we do not \nstart consolidating, eliminating, reducing the rate of growth of some \nof these programs, truly the sky will fall and the Earth will open up \nbecause we simply will not have a future for our children. We will \nleave nothing for them.\n  So I would suggest that when you hear the gnashing of teeth that you \nwill hear, you will hear about how hopeless things are in America--the \nprevious speaker was talking about, the Senator from Washington, \ntalking about how hopeless people are if not for some Government \nprogram that is going to help them through their hopelessness, or how \nfearful people are, if it was not for the Government to take care of \nthem.\n  I would just suggest that our job here in Washington is to provide \nopportunity and hope for people, to give them the chance to succeed.\n  I will tell you the best way that I believe you can give people a \nchance to succeed is by letting them keep the fruits of their labors, \nbut not taking all of it from them, and when I hear this debate, it \nabsolutely blows my mind. I do not know what budget they are working \non. I hear all of this debate all day long, and from the White House \nhow we are cutting Medicare, cutting all of these programs to pay for \n``tax breaks for the rich.'' I know a lot of you heard this. A lot of \nyou have heard this.\n  Let me tell you what the budget resolution says. This budget \nresolution--I do not know what budget resolution they are talking \nabout. It is not this budget resolution. It is not this budget \nresolution. In this budget resolution is a provision that 90 percent of \nall tax cuts must go to people under $100,000; 90 percent.\n  I do not know. We may be redefining wealthy in America; and, that is, \nthat people under $100,000 are wealthy. People who make under $100,000 \nare wealthy. Those are wealthy. But when you have 90 percent of any tax \ncut provision in this budget as it appears on the floor of the Senate \ntoday, going to under $100,000, I do not know how you make that \nstatement. I do not know how you make the statement the Senator from \nSouth Carolina made a few minutes ago that they are going to cut taxes \nnow, and the spending cuts will not come until later. I do not know \nwhat budget he is looking at.\n  This budget, almost all of the cuts in taxes that occur come the last \n3 or 4 years after we have shown that we can get on a glidepath, after \nwe do cut spending first. Why does that come about? Why do we get this \n$170 billion? It is a very important point. Why is it that the \nCongressional Budget Office gives us a bonus of $170 billion? Let me \nexplain why. It is very simple.\n  Because they believe, as I am sure every economist in this country \nwould believe, and you can see it by what is happening already to the \ndollar and how the dollar is rebounding since we have introduced this \nresolution, how interest rates are coming down since we have gotten \nserious about balancing the budget here in this Chamber--the \nCongressional Budget Office believes accurately that, if we have in \nplace a mechanism to balance the budget over the next 7 years, interest \nrates will come down; therefore, the cost to refinance the debt will \ncome down, inflation will come down, and the economy will grow faster.\n  Those are all assumptions the Congressional Budget Office made in \ncalculating this bonus of $170 billion of [[Page S6889]] which we were \ngoing to take that bonus and return it to the people who work very hard \nto pay those taxes.\n  Think about this. Getting to a balanced budget will create more \ngrowth. That means more jobs. That means for opportunity, lower \ninterest rates, which means lower payments on mortgages, more \naffordable housing, and other programs, lower debt costs which means \nlower deficits. This is what we are focused on, growth, low inflation, \nlow interest rates. But that is a pretty good plan. That is how we get \nthe deficit even further reduced.\n  What we are saying is that once we have established the plan to get \nus to zero, if we do get that bonus, if we do get that savings, then we \nare going to give you the dividend. You, the taxpayer of America, boy, \nI will tell you. By the way, 90 percent of that will go to people under \n$100,000.\n  I do not know, folks. I do not know what budget they are reading over \nthere. But if that is cutting Medicare to pay for tax breaks for the \nrich, tell the Congressional Budget Office because that is getting it \nright, balancing the budget, causing positive effects on the economy \nand letting people who work their tails off in this country keep some \nof the money they worked hard for.\n  You would think that the only people who care in this town are people \nwho want to take your money and give it to somebody else to help them; \nthat those of us who believe caring sometimes can mean letting you keep \nsome of the money you worked hard for. No. That is not caring. That is \ntax breaks for these bad people who work; or these people who succeed.\n  I happen to think that rewarding people for doing what we all, \neveryone in this Chamber, want people to do in this country--work --is \na good thing. It is a good thing.\n  So when you hear about these nasty things that we are going to do \nabout, you know, helping the wealthy, substitute every time you hear \n``wealthy'', substitute ``taxpayer.'' If you are a taxpayer, you are \nthe one they are after. They do not want to give you any relief up \nthere. No, no, no. Those of you who pay taxes, you are bad. We have to \nmake sure that you give us the money that you worked hard for so we can \nspend it, where we, of course, know best. That is just absurd. It is \neven an absurd statement here in Washington DC.\n  This is a good budget plan. This is a fair budget plan. I will talk \nover the next few days about how we are doing. I went to town meeting \nafter town meeting after town meeting in the last 4 or 5 years. I was \nin Congress before being in the Senate this year. And every place I \nwent, the comment I got was whether you want to get to a balanced \nbudget but do not single out anybody, do not single out any group, \nspread it around. You know. Make it fair. We are willing to take our \nshare. We understand we have a problem. We are willing to pitch in. \nThis is America. When we have a crisis in this country we are willing \nto step up to the plate. We are not going to run and hide. ``Oh, no \ndon't hurt us. Don't touch us.''\n  That is what the other side would have you believe. We have a bunch \nof people who are not willing to sacrifice or put forward their piece \nto solve the problem. Of course, they are. Of course, you will. Do not \nlet these people appeal to your weaker side. Appeal to the better \nangels of your nature. Appeal to the side that says America is a great \ncountry, if we all pull together and we stand shoulder to shoulder to \nsolve problems.\n  That is what this budget does. It bridges us all in, everybody. It \nsays let us all pull together. And we are not talking about radical \nstuff here folks. We are not talking about enormous pain here.\n  We are not talking about enormous pain here. We are talking about \nGovernment growth at 3\\1/2\\ percent a year, increasing at 3\\1/2\\ \npercent a year. Under this budget resolution, spending goes up 3\\1/2\\ \npercent a year. Some pain. Three and a half percent a year, that is \njust draconian; it is horrible. Again, the sky is going to fall if the \nGovernment only goes up 3\\1/2\\ percent a year.\n  This is the right medicine. It is absolutely crucial medicine. It is \nabsolutely crucial that we pass this resolution and that we move \nforward to put this country back to where my grandfather, who came to \nthis country back in the 1920's, before the Depression--he lived in a \ncompany town, in the hills of Appalachia, in Pennsylvania. He was a \ncoal miner. And he came here not because he did not have a good job. He \nhad a great job in Italy. That is where he came from. He had a great \njob. But he left there because he wanted freedom. He wanted to be able \nto collect the fruits of his labor, and most importantly he wanted to \nleave his sons and daughter better off than he was.\n  That has been the dream of every American who came on our shores. \nThey came here because they wanted to leave the next generation better \noff and with more opportunities than they had.\n  We are sitting here and standing here as Members of the Senate, and \nwe are looking at a future that will do just the opposite if we do \nnothing. If we fail, the next generation will not have what we have, \nwill not have the opportunity to succeed. As I look around and see \npeople in the gallery with their children, I know their one hope is \nthat those children will be better off than them; that they love them \nso much.\n  Well, folks, love them enough to do the right thing. Love them enough \nto set this country straight and balance this budget so they can have a \nbetter future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. I think we are swapping back and forth. I have 20 minutes \nand then the Senator has 15 minutes. I think that is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, by a unanimous-\nconsent agreement, the Senator from Kentucky is recognized for 20 \nminutes, and then the Senator from Mississippi for 15 minutes.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, while the Senator from Pennsylvania is \nstill in the Chamber, I would like to make a couple remarks.\n  I have been in this Senate for 21 years now. In all of the hot \ndebates, in all of the effort that is made here, I have never heard or \nseen the office of the President of the United States degraded like it \nhas been here today. Never in 21 years have I heard Gerald Ford called \nJerry, Jimmy Carter called Jimmy, Ronald Reagan called Ron, George Bush \ncalled George, and I have never heard a First Lady called by her first \nname. I think it is time we have some respect for the office if we do \nnot have respect for the individual who holds it.\n  Now, when the Senator says ``Bill'' here, we have never done that. \nThe Senator can smile if he wants to, but there is some decorum by \npeople who have been here for a long time. This is an institution that \nhas respect for the office if not for the individual. I would hope that \nthe Members on the other side would be a little careful about the \nremarks they make and how they put forward their effort in this debate.\n  So I just call attention to the Senate that I hope from now on it \nwould be ``the President.'' I have never heard the majority leader in \nthe Chamber refer to his party's President by his first name. I never \nheard him refer to the Democratic Party's President by his first name. \nIt has always been ``the President.'' So I would hope that we would \nrefrain from using the First Lady's first name in the Chamber and that \nwe be very careful about that.\n  Madam President, I hope that I say this constructively because I do \nrespect the office of the President, even though another party from my \nchoosing would be the occupant. I felt it important that I say that.\n  Madam President, what a difference 6 months has made. And I go back \nto November 6, 1994. ``President Clinton and Vice President Gore are \nresorting to scare tactics, falsely accusing the Republicans of secret \nplans to cut Medicare benefits.''\n  That was from the majority leader of the U.S. Senate, quoted in the \nWashington Post of November 6.\n\n       The outrage, as far as I am concerned, is the Democrat's \n     big lie campaign that the Contract With America would require \n     huge Medicare cuts. It would not.\n\n  Haley Barbour, Republican National Committee Chair, CNN's Late \nEdition, November 6, 1994.\n  The GOP budget speaks for itself. The GOP Senate budget plan includes \n[[Page S6890]] $256 million in Medicare cuts. We go back to what the \nchairman of the Republican Party said, and he has been in the meetings \nhere. He has attended the meetings when this budget was developed and \nthe statements were planned. He said it is a big lie campaign. Six \nmonths later, it was the truth.\n  The GOP House budget plan includes $286 billion in Medicare cuts, and \nthe House budget includes and the Senate budget provides funds for GOP \ntax cuts that would give $20,000 a year to the wealthiest Americans.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania say that this \nwill reduce interest rates; that things are going to get better.\n  Well, in 1993, we struggled, and if I recall, after we passed that \nbudget bill without a Republican vote, 50-50, in the Senate, and the \nVice President broke the tie, the Fed had to increase interest rates \nsix or seven times in order to cool off the economy because we reduced \nthe deficit by $600 billion. We reduced or eliminated 300 programs. And \nhow many Republican votes did we get? None. Zilch. Zip. None. And we \ndid pretty well.\n  When you say that we have not done the right thing, I think you have \nto go back and look at the 1993 votes. And if you also want to say \nsomething about 6 months later, there was a Congressman in the House \nthat said it very well. ``If we had come out with this budget in our \ncontract, they wouldn't have voted us in.'' You would not have been \nelected. At least, he was honest. He was honest in making his \nstatement.\n  Madam President, last year, the Census Bureau reported the widest \nrich-poor gap since the Bureau began keeping track in 1947. Business \nWeek magazine suggested that ``If this trend persists, it could tarnish \nAmerica's image as the land of opportunity.'' In fact, it was a \nRepublican strategist who said, ``This stratifying starts to make us \ninto a different country. It goes to the American notion of fairness.''\n  And that is exactly why, when Democrats hammered out an economic plan \nlast Congress, we made sure it not only dramatically cut the deficit, \nbut also helped create an environment for strong growth, proven by the \ninterest rates that we were called on to pay and increased by the Fed. \nWe provided resources so all Americans--and I underscore ``all''--could \nobtain the skills necessary to compete in a global economy. We \naccomplished those goals amidst the first investment-led recovery with \nlow inflation in 30 years.\n  Today, Senate Republicans have put forth a budget that also looks to \neliminate the deficit. But the similarities, Madam President, stop \nthere. While Democrats sought to put in place an economic plan to \nfurther empower the hard-working families of this country and their \nchildren, the Republican plan appears to be driven almost entirely by \nthe desire to cut taxes for America's most well off.\n  Middle-class Americans understand that balancing the budget requires \nthe Henry Clay tactic--compromise, mutual sacrifice, negotiated hurt, \nas Henry Clay would have said. But while they are being forced to \naccept the biggest rate hike in Medicare history, those Americans \nmaking $300,000 or more are walking off with a $20,000 a year tax cut, \nlow-income Americans are being forced to pay more taxes.\n  While low-income Americans are being forced to pay more taxes when \nthe earned-income tax credit is slashed, those millionaire Benedict \nArnolds spit on the flag, renounce their citizenship in the United \nStates--we tried to prevent it and we could not because the votes on \nthe other side would not let us--so they can get out of paying U.S. \ntaxes. As we say down in western Kentucky, ``Something about that ain't \nright.''\n  And while middle-class Americans are being forced to pay thousands \nmore to send their children to college, loophole after loophole remains \nintact for America's richest.\n  There is not a single Senator here who supports the status quo--not a \nsingle Senator. But on this side of the aisle, we do not want to see \nAmerica's image as the land of opportunity tarnished. We want a budget \nthat is balanced, not one that sends middle-class Americans home \nemptyhanded so that the richest Americans can pocket a $20,000 a year \ngoody.\n  While the 1 percent of Americans are trying to figure out how to \nspend their extra 20,000 bucks, middle-class Americans are trying to \nfigure out how to care for their elderly, sick parents when Medicare is \nslashed by over $250 billion. While the 1 percent of Americans are \ntrying to figure out how to spend their extra 20,000 bucks, middle-\nclass Americans will be trying to figure out if their dreams to send \ntheir children to college are impossible to obtain. And while the 1 \npercent of Americans are trying to figure out how to spend their extra \n20,000 bucks, those hard-working families struggling to become middle \nclass will try to figure out how to do so now that the earned-income \ntax credit that they enjoy is slashed and their taxes are raised.\n  Medicare: What are the cuts really for?\n  Madam President, there are 585,000 Medicare beneficiaries in my State \nof Kentucky. I hope many of them will follow this debate, follow it \nclosely, so we can consider the Republican proposal to cut Medicare by \n$256 billion over the next 7 years. I hope many of them will try to \nfigure out what those cuts are really for. Why are they in this budget? \nWhy $256 billion?\n  There are $170 billion in proposed tax cuts in this Republican \nbudget, although they have tried to hide them in something called a tax \nreduction reserve fund. If these tax cuts are anything like we have \nseen from the House of Representatives, we know that they will \nprimarily benefit well-off Americans with high incomes.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle deny that Medicare cuts \nare being used to offset these tax cuts for upper income Americans. \nThey have suggested that the Medicare trust fund is going broke and \nthat we have a crisis. They have also suggested they do not know what \nspecific steps should be taken to make the trust fund solvent, and that \nwe should set up a commission--a commission--to recommend changes in \nthe Medicare program to make it solvent.\n  I hope Republicans are prepared to answer the questions the 585,000 \nMedicare beneficiaries in my State have for them.\n  First, if we cut Medicare by $256 billion, how much longer will the \ntrust fund be healthy? Answer that. We have yet to hear the answer. If \nwe are truly reacting to a crisis, then what will $256 billion in cuts \ndo to affect the crisis? If the proponents of these $256 billion in \ncuts do not know the answer, this would appear to be further evidence \nMedicare cuts are being made to offset tax cuts for upper income \nAmericans.\n  Second, and more puzzling, if Republicans are cutting Medicare to \navoid a crisis in the trust fund, and if Republicans do not know yet \nwhat specific steps to take until a commission tells us, then how do \nthey already know the specific amount to cut? If we need a commission \nto tell us how to make the trust fund solvent, do we not need to add up \nthe changes they recommend before we know the total amount of cuts?\n  How can we know that $256 billion in cuts are needed to make Medicare \nprograms solvent? It sounds suspicious to me and a lot of Americans. \nEither Republicans already know what Medicare changes they will make \nand they will not tell us, or $256 billion is simply the number they \nneeded to offset the tax cuts.\n  I hope the 585,000 Medicare beneficiaries in my State will hear \nanswers to some of these questions. Madam President, we have a Medicare \ncrisis today and we had an even greater Medicare crisis in 1993 and \n1994. The Medicare beneficiaries in my State want to know where the \nRepublicans were then.\n  In 1993, the Medicare part A trust fund was projected to go broke in \n1999, only 6 years out. Let us not forget how tough some of those \ndecisions in the 1993 deficit reduction package were. More than $1 out \nof every $5 in deficit reduction in 1993 went to shore up Medicare. We \ncut $56 billion in spending for Medicare over 5 years in the 1993 \ndeficit reduction package. These cuts included $23.3 billion in \npayments to hospitals, $15.7 billion in payments to doctors, $9.1 \nbillion in payments involving both hospitals and doctors. These were \ntough cuts, and we did not get a vote from the other side of the aisle \nto make those cuts.\n  We also lifted the cap on wages subject to the payroll tax which \nfunds [[Page S6891]] Medicare part A, and increased the amount of \nSocial Security benefits subject to taxes on those making over $44,000 \na year. A tough choice, but we dedicated every penny of increase of \nrevenues to Medicare. They went to Medicare. These were painful \nchanges, hard votes. We made them; they did not.\n  Consider together they shored up the Medicare Program by more than \n$100 billion over 5 years, and how many Republican votes did we get to \nhelp shore up Medicare? Not one. Zilch. Zero.\n  In 1993, when Medicare was projected to run out of money by 1999, how \nmany Republicans said, ``There's a Medicare crisis?'' Not one. Zilch. \nZero.\n  In 1994, when health care reform was being considered and Medicare \nwas projected to run out of money by 2001, how many Republicans said \nthere was a crisis in Medicare? None.\n  In fact, last year, many went out of their way to stress that there \nwas no crisis--no crisis--in health care. More than $1 out of every $6 \nspent in this country in health care comes from Medicare. In fact, over \n40 percent of health care expenditures nationwide comes from the public \nsector, and this is primarily Medicare and Medicaid.\n  When the Medicare trustees' report came out earlier this year, it \nactually extended by 1 year the projections of when the Medicare trust \nfund would run out of money.\n  Yet, my Republican colleagues, none of whom recognized the Medicare \ncrisis in 1993 and many of whom denied the existence of any health care \ncrisis last year, seized upon the trustees' report to justify now a \ncrisis, a crisis worthy of $256 billion in Medicare cuts.\n  I have 585,000 Medicare beneficiaries in my State. They should look \nbehind these numbers. There are a lot of unanswered questions. How do \nwe know from reading the trustees' report that $256 billion in cuts are \nneeded?\n  Let us take a look at what the report says. Part A pays for inpatient \nhospital care, skilled nursing facility care, home health care, and \nhospice care. Most Americans 65 or older are automatically entitled to \npart A protection. There are over 36 million beneficiaries nationwide, \nand Medicare part A is financed by the Federal hospital insurance trust \nfund. According to the trustees' report, at the end of 1995, the part A \ntrust fund will have an all-time record balance of $134 billion, which \nwill grow slightly in 1996. However, the balance will decline, \nthereafter, to the point where the fund becomes dangerously close to \nbeing insolvent by the year 2002.\n  The trustees also reported on Medicare part B. Part B of Medicare is \nvoluntary. It pays for doctors' services, other medical and health \nservices, like laboratory and outpatient services, and some home health \ncare services not covered by part A. Part B is financed by the \nsupplemental medical insurance trust fund.\n  According to the trustees' report, this part B trust fund will have a \nbalance of $26 billion in the year 2002, even larger than the balance \ntoday and an all-time record. So if there is a trust fund crisis, it is \nin part A.\n  Yet, we do not know where the $256 billion in Medicare cuts in the \nRepublican budget will come from. Do our Republican colleagues view a \ncrisis in part B, as well? How will the $256 billion in cuts be \nallocated among part A and part B?\n  Madam President, I do not know what we need a commission for, but if \nwe are to have one, this raises even more questions:\n  What will the instructions to the commission be? Could the Medicare \ncrisis commission recommend tax increases, raising the current payroll \ntax used to fund part A? If so, are our Republican colleagues saying \nthey will support those tax increases? What if the commission \nrecommends less than $256 billion in Medicare cuts? Will Congress be \nrequired to cut $256 billion from Medicare anyway to offset the tax \ncuts for the very rich and the Benedict Arnolds in the Republican plan? \nMadam President, how do our Republican colleagues know that $256 \nbillion in Medicare cuts are needed?\n  They are very precise in this budget. They are very precise. Our \nRepublican colleagues tell us Medicare is in a crisis. They tell us it \nneeds to grow by 7.1 percent per year--not 7 percent, not 8 percent, \nbut 7.1 percent per year.\n  They tell us we need to cut Medicare exactly $12 billion next year, \nthen $22 billion, then $27 billion, then $36 billion, then $44 billion, \nthen $53 billion and, finally, $62 billion in the year 2002.\n  These are very precise levels of Medicare cuts year by year, yet we \nneed a commission to tell us what to do about Medicare.\n  Let me talk a minute, if I have any time left, about education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has just expired.\n  Mr. FORD. I was pretty close to it then, was I not, Madam President? \nI will have another day and another time, and I want to talk about \neducation and the cuts in that. I hope I will be able to have maybe 10 \nminutes then just to talk about what the Senator from Pennsylvania was \ntalking about, our children. We want our children to be educated, and \nif they are not educated, they will never make the middle class.\n  So I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair for her patience.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi. Under the \nprevious order, the Senator is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I am very pleased to rise in support of \nthe concurrent resolution on the budget for 1996, and I would like to \nbegin by congratulating the distinguished chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, of New Mexico, for all the hard work he \nhas done and all of his staff work that has been involved in putting \nthis package together.\n  It is large, it is complex, and it is a very complete document. Also, \nI want to commend the Budget Committee members because there were a lot \nof meetings, a lot of discussion, a lot of give and take. But in the \nend, we came together, worked together, and produced a budget \nresolution that, in my opinion, is a very critical document.\n  It will take the Federal Government to a balanced budget by the year \n2002. Frankly, I had my doubts that we would ever bring a budget \nresolution to the floor of the Senate that would do what we said we \nwould do, and that would be to get us to a balanced budget. But this \ndocument does it.\n  Is it perfect? Probably not. There never will be such a thing. \nObviously, I would like to add some additional tax relief for the \nAmerican people into this budget resolution. But this budget resolution \ndoes take us to a balanced budget in the next 7 years.\n  Let me respond just a little bit to some of the comments we have \nheard in the last few moments.\n  First, I think we should emphasize that it does not matter which \nparty presents a balanced-budget plan, as long as it is done. The \nAmerican people want us to get on with the job of controlling deficit \nspending and, some day, some day maybe even deal with the debt of this \ncountry. They want us to think about the future of our children and the \nfuture of our country. They understand that we cannot continue to have \nthis profligate spending forever, without somebody paying the price, \nand they know that somebody is going to be our children.\n  Now, we have tried it other ways. I have been in Congress for 22 \nyears. I have seen Republican Presidents, Democrat Presidents, Democrat \nCongresses, lots of those, and a Republican Congress, finally. Well, \nboth parties have failed in allowing these deficits to go up year after \nyear after year. But it is time for us to bring that to a stop.\n  (Mr. FRIST assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LOTT. The American people do not want the status quo. They want \nus to get the budget under control. I will say this: This budget \nresolution shows the fundamental differences between the two parties. \nOh, yes, we had a budget resolution in 1993 that not a single \nRepublican voted for that the Democrats passed. Do you know what that \nbudget resolution was? It was little more than monstrous tax increases.\n  This is a budget resolution that gets us to a balanced budget by \ncutting spending and by controlling the growth of programs throughout \nthe Government. Surely, that is the preferred way to do it. The \nAmerican people do not want us to raise taxes on them anymore. They \nwant us to control the growth of Government, control spending--and, by \nthe way, even let them keep a little bit of their hard earned tax \nmoney--their money. In Washington, when the people are allowed to keep \ntheir money, it is called a tax expenditure. The Government is giving \nit [[Page S6892]] away. Well, to the people that is their money that is \nbeing taken away by the Government.\n  One of the things that happened in that 1993 budget that I still have \nnot gotten over--and the distinguished Senator from Kentucky mentioned \nit a while ago--was that it had a provision that raised taxes on Social \nSecurity recipients, and not just the wealthy. At one point, I think it \nwas all the way down to $19,000. We forced it back up to a little \nhigher level. It raised the Social Security earnings threshold on \npeople who are not wealthy, middle-income retirees, and moved the money \nover into other programs. The explanation was that this would help fund \nthe inadequacies of Medicare.\n  Well, my colleagues, we all know that Social Security and Medicare \nare not the same. They are two different programs. When you raise the \ntaxes on Social Security, it ought to go for Social Security if it is \ntaxes are to be raised--and they should not be raised at all. At least \nthe money should not be moved over and put into other programs.\n  The point was made in the past few minutes here about this terrible \nrich-poor gap. Well, why has something not been done about it? The \nparty of the Senator who was speaking has been in control of the Senate \nfor all but 6 of the last 40 years. Their party has been in control of \nthe Congress. Obviously, their programs have not worked. They have \nfailed. The rich-poor gap is there, it is bad, and we need to do \nsomething about it. But what we have been doing has not worked. It has \nfailed. It is time for change. That is what this budget resolution will \nhelp move us toward.\n  One final thing. Gripe, gripe, gripe. Not this, not that, not mine, \nnot yours, nobody's, do not cut this or that. I have heard everything \nabout this budget resolution. You cannot cut this, you cannot touch \nthat. We do not like your budget. I have been through that Kabuki dance \nbefore. We have been guilty on occasion where we have said, ``We are \nnot going to offer our budget resolution; we will just attack yours and \noffer amendments.'' And we were made fun of by the other side. \nSometimes, though--and last year we did it--we were challenged and \nasked, ``Where is yours?'' Even while in the minority we said, ``Here \nis what we will do.'' And it was a tough, good budget.\n  Here is what I have to say now to those that are whining about what \nis or is not in this: Where is yours? Put it up. Let us see what your \napproach is. Well, we know. It is just to raise taxes. Well, we tried \nthat and it does not work. It just makes the gap between rich and poor \nworse.\n  Now, Mr. President, what I really wanted to address today--except I \ngot so fired up from what I heard from the previous speakers that I got \na little off my plan--was why we need to do this resolution, hopefully \nin a bipartisan way. Why are we making these tough choices? I think it \nis because we really need to do it. We need to do it for our country, \nfor our economy, and we do need to do it for our children. We have \nserious problems hanging out there that we cannot ignore.\n  Now, we have come up with a plan here to balance the budget, without \ntouching Social Security or raising taxes. We limit growth in spending \nand cut needless Government waste.\n  We limit growth in spending. I keep emphasizing that. We have found a \ntough, but fair, course that takes us toward zero deficit. When I go \nhome, people say, ``When are you guys going to get that deficit under \ncontrol,'' or ``When are you going to do anything about the debt?'' \nWell, this does it.\n  If you look at this chart that I have here, spending versus revenues, \n1974 through the year 2004, as a percent of gross domestic product, you \ncan see that we have had a chronic problem of what we spend exceeding \nwhat we take in. This cannot continue. Yet, it will unless we do \nsomething. The gap between what we are taking in and what we are \nspending is going to continue to grow. Every businessman, every \nindividual, rich, poor, middle class, you cannot live like this--not \neven the Federal Government. This is the problem and this is what we \nare trying to address.\n  We must balance our books. It is that simple. This should be at the \ntop of our agenda, along with returning resources and power back to the \nStates, communities and families, ending useless programs, and fixing \nthose important programs that need fixing.\n  Now, I know you are going to hear, ``You could have cut some of these \nprograms out in the past.'' Yes, maybe we could have or should have, \nbut we did not. Now we have another chance. This is a time we should \ncome together and make the difference. The problem is overspending that \nsaps our country's strength and harms our families. If we do not stop \nspending, the problem will get worse. This budget resolution is the way \nto fix the problem. It will stop the Nation's slide into insolvency and \npreserve the American dream for us and our children.\n  We are in the last generation--and maybe this is the last Congress \nfor a while--that can really make the changes we need to make. It has \nbeen a generation since this country has had a balanced budget. In the \n1960's, deficits averaged about $6 billion a year. In 1969, I think \nalmost by accident, we had a balanced budget. In the 1970's, deficits \naveraged $38 billion a year. Now, in the 1990's, deficits are averaging \n$259 billion a year. Again, we have gone from zero balance to hundreds \nof billions of dollars in the red within a generation.\n  Why do we have this problem of deficits? What is the Government \nspending all this money on? It is not defense. We are going to have a \ntremendous debate on that. ``Cut defense more; that is the solution.'' \nNo, defense has been cut. Defense spending has been halved--cut in \nhalf--over the last 30 years and has been going down every year for the \nlast 10 years. Domestic discretionary spending has declined, too. It is \nnot foreign aid. A lot of people think we can cut some of the foreign \naid and solve the problem. There is not enough there. We do need to cut \nback on it even more, but it is a minuscule part of the budget.\n  The culprit--the culprit--is the Great Society programs--overblown, \ncostly programs and bureaucracies that too long have been resistant to \nhelpful change. These are well-meaning programs. They were at the time, \nand many of them still are. They are just not well-run. Many have \noutlived their usefulness and are bloated, inefficient, and they do not \nserve the people as well as they could or should and, without change, \nthey will destroy our future. It is uncontrolled bureaucracy. I am \ntalking about spending frivolously. These programs, combined with \ninterest rates on the national debt, are a major part of our budget. \nThis part is getting bigger, while everything else is shrinking.\n  In 1963, entitlements and interest were just 24 percent of the \nbudget. Now they comprise over 56 percent of the budget.\n  If we do not slow the rate of growth of these programs and interest \npayments, Great Society spending and interest on the debt will take up \n69 percent of the budget by the year 2003. And it gets worse.\n  Around the year 2011, all Government revenues will be taken up by \njust five things: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Federal \nretirement benefits, and interest on the debt. All the revenue would go \nfor just those programs.\n  That means no money for anything else. Our borders would be \nunprotected, our children untaught, our roads unrepaired, there would \nbe no school lunches, food stamps, or farm programs. We have to get \nthis under control. Even these five programs I mentioned will be in \ntrouble if we continue to run deficits.\n  Clearly, we are heading down the wrong road. So we face the \npossibility if we do not change of only having enough money to pay \ninterest on a huge national debt. We will not have enough money for \nmuch of anything else.\n  This might seem far-fetched. It might seem like we are using scare \ntactics, and I know we will hear a lot of scare tactics in the next few \ndays. We do not need to make up stories to frighten parents and working \npeople. The facts are scary enough.\n  We want to get the facts out to show the American people that we must \nchange. The people said they wanted it last year. The President of the \nUnited States ran on that, and was elected in 1992--change. Now, we \nhave a chance to really get it.\n  This budget resolution begins the change. If we look at this next \nchart, Federal budget deficits, President Clinton's budget versus \nRepublican budget, [[Page S6893]] we see that the budget resolution I \nam discussing will get to a balanced budget in 7 years, while the \nPresident's budget runs up deficits in the range of $200 billion as far \nas the eye can see.\n  Here is President Clinton's budget proposal for the year. It goes out \nto the year 2001. And here is the budget we are talking about here on a \nsteady decline down to a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  Now, the administration paints too rosy a picture. As we see in the \nnext chart, Federal budget deficits, Clinton budget versus Republican \nbudget, the purple line shows the Clinton budget actual, and then here \nis what he is claiming, and here is what the budget we are talking \nabout here does.\n  The Congressional Budget Office revealed that the Clinton budget will \nactually lead to annual deficits of almost $300 billion. This, of \ncourse will lead to bankruptcy, and I mean soon.\n  Now, that is gloom and doom talk, I admit. But deficits do have an \neffect on our lives today, too, not just in the future. Some people \nwill say, what do they really mean? These billions and billions of \ndollars seem unreal. Deficits seem like something in Washington that \nthose guys talk about and worry about.\n  Here is what it does: The Nation's debt hurts personal living \nstandards now. Each American's share of our $4.9 trillion debt is \n$18,500. That is what it means for each one of the American people. \nAccording to the President's budget, this debt will rise by 1999 to \n$6.4 trillion or $23,700 a person. That is what every American will owe \nif we go with the President's budgets.\n  Deficits have lowered family incomes. A Concord Coalition study \nrevealed that if the United States did not have deficits or a large \nnational debt, average family income would be $50,000 instead of \n$35,000. Let me say that again. If we did not have these big debts, the \naverage American family would be making $50,000 instead of $35,000.\n  That is what it means to individuals. I am trying to bring this down \nto numbers that we deal with on an everyday basis, not the big $1 \ntrillion debts. Because we have not controlled spending, each family in \nthis country has lost $15,000 smokes.\n  Deficits raise interest rates, too, making buying a home or a car \nmore expensive for all Americans. If we balance the budget, the \nprestigious Wharton School of Economics says interest rates would drop \n4 percent. The average homeowner would save $500 per month on their \nmortgage payments. So we are talking about savings on interest.\n  Deficits cost Americans jobs. Maybe this is the cruelest part of all. \nWe have lost 3 million jobs due to deficit spending over the last 10 \nyears. Not putting that on either party, it is just a fact.\n  Most importantly, deficits put a penalty on our children. Our \nchildren are another reason and the main reason for reducing this \ndeficits. The National Taxpayers Union found that a child born today \nwill have to pay over $100,000 in extra taxes.\n  Mr. President, if my time is expiring could I ask for an additional 5 \nminutes of time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Lott.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is $100,000 in extra taxes over the course of his or \nher life, just to pay the interest on the debt.\n  Also, every new $200 billion in deficit spending, and President \nClinton has that or more every year, in the budget a child has to pay \nan additional $5,000 in taxes to pay the interest costs. Children would \nhave to pay 90- to 100-percent tax rates to pay this kind of deficit \nspending.\n  We cannot do it. It is not right for our children to face these \ndeficits for what we have not done. So, now it is time for us to really \ndo something. What we are talking about is slowing the rate of Federal \ngrowth. This is how it really works. We do this, by the way, by 2002, \nwithout touching Social Security. We ratchet down the deficit by $30 \nbillion a year by slowing spending to 3 percent overall from 5 percent.\n  Spending will actually grow 3 percent a year. We just slow it down 2 \npercentage points. Spending will actually increase $1.9 trillion in the \nyear 2002. I have had people ask me why do we not do it sooner? Why are \nwe waiting so long? Why do we allow all the spending to go up? The \npoint is spending will continue to go up even though we are controlling \nthe rate of growth.\n  In this budget, we shrink bureaucracy, over 100 departments, \nprograms, and agencies are prudently eliminated. We consolidate, \nterminate, and improve efficiency, and we do protect our senior \ncitizens by preserving the Social Security COLA and saving Medicare.\n  I would like to allow senior citizens between 65 and 75, who would \nlike to continue to work if they make under $30,000 a year, without \nhaving the earnings test kick in and take part of the money away from \nthem.\n  This budget returns America to fiscal reality and will bring back \nprosperity and embolden, I think, the American people.\n  Let me digress by saying I think that the most egregious fear tactic \nI have heard employed so far on this was the suggestion that \nRepublicans want to do damage to Medicare. Actually, the reverse is \ntrue. We want to preserve and improve and protect it. I have heard \nspeeches on the floor that sound like speeches of a captain on a \nsinking ship, begging the passengers stay on just a little while \nlonger, saying nothing is going wrong, knowing all the time Medicare \nhas problems we have to deal with. There is a lot of hot rhetoric in \nthis particular area.\n  Medicare will be bankrupt in 7 years if we do not do something about \nit. The President's own Medicare board of trustees have said this. And \non that board are Cabinet Secretaries Reich, Rubin, and Shalala. The \nPresident's own people say that Medicare cannot sustain its spending \ngrowth of over 10 percent a year. It is growing at 10 percent a year or \nmore.\n  The care that senior citizens count on will not be there in 7 years \nunless we do something. Workers will have higher taxes, providers will \nbe reimbursed less, seniors have to pay higher premiums and they get \nfewer benefits.\n  This will happen if we listen to the other side and do nothing. Do \nnothing. We want to preserve Medicare. What we will do is to call for \nreforms, and we would slow the growth to 7-percent a year. Still, more \nthan twice the rate of inflation.\n  So instead of growing at 10 percent a year, through honest reforms \nthat would make the program better, I think, and give some more options \nto our senior citizens, they would still have a 7-percent growth. And \nwe can save Medicare by doing that.\n  We have identified the problem. Deficit spending and debt. We know \nwhat will happen if we do not change--bigger debts, less prosperity, \nand national bankruptcy. We have identified a solution. Slowing the \nspending growth starting with this budget resolution.\n  It does not matter which party does it as long as we do. We should \nfix it without so much finger pointing. We should balance our budget. \nWe have a chance to do it. Many people then will be the beneficiaries \nif we will get away from the status quo.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to conclude by saying that I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to look seriously at this budget \nresolution. Let us come together and support it. We have a unique \nopportunity, one that I have not seen in 20 years or more. If we let \nthis opportunity go by, we will not have another one probably for 10 or \n20 years, and the damage will be devastating. This is about our future. \nIt is about our children. I worry about my own mother, 82 years old. \nShe depends on Social Security and Medicare. I care about her. But I \nworry more about my 27-year-old son and my 24-year-old daughter. Will \nthese programs be there when they need them? If we do not pass this \nbudget resolution, if we do not know what to do, what needs to be done \ntoday, then the answer is no. These programs will not be there.\n  We have this golden opportunity, and we should seize it.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first I want to pay tribute to my good \nfriend from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, who has indeed made a monumental effort to bring a balanced \nbudget to the floor of the Senate. I consider Pete Domenici a good \nfriend. We seldom vote together, but we banter back and forth in a \nfriendly way. And what he did in bringing this budget to the floor was \nnot easy. [[Page S6894]] \n  If you ask the American people, ``Do you understand this budgeting \nprocess?''--the answer would be no. It is a very arcane procedure. \nPeople in the U.S. Senate do not understand it, let alone the 260 \nmillion people in America. But if you would also ask the people of \nAmerica, ``What do you want more than anything else?''--they would say, \n``We would like to hear a lot less partisan bickering between Democrats \nand Republicans. We would like to see those two parties hold hands for \na change and provide a final budget.'' That is a nonnegotiable demand \nby the people of this country, and it is a legitimate demand.\n  But we have two parties. The reason we have two parties is because we \ndo not agree.\n  I consider this budget to be a virtual assault on the most \nvulnerable, exposed people in America. It is an assault on education. \nIt is an assault on working people. And above all, it is an assault on \nthe elderly people who depend on Medicare, and who are terrified. When \nthey hear us continue to talk about it, they wonder: Do they have a \nfuture? Is their health care going to be provided for, or is it not?\n  Before I go any further, Mr. President, I want to also say something \nto my friend, the junior Senator from Pennsylvania. I have never, in \nthe 20 years I have been in the Senate, heard a Member of the U.S. \nSenate say, ``Where is Bill?'' ``Where is George?'' ``Where is Ron?'' I \nconsider that to be the exemplification of the growing incivility of \nthe people in this country towards each other, the lack of respect that \npeople have for each other. Nobody could have disagreed with Ronald \nReagan more than I did, and I stood right here in this spot. But you \nnever heard me say, ``Where is Ron?'' The President of the United \nStates deserves the respect of everybody. The office and the man who \nholds it deserve our respect. And, above all, he deserves not to be \ncalled in a denigrating way by his first name on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  He has been a good friend of mine for 20 years, and I might \noccasionally say ``Bill Clinton.''\n  But it would benefit all of us to show more respect for the \nPresidency of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I might also say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, who \nwas saying, ``Where is Bill?''--Where was the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwhen he was a Member of the House of Representatives in 1993, when \nPresident Clinton was cajoling, begging, pleading with both Houses of \nCongress to cut the deficit by $500 billion which, incidentally, turned \nout to be a $600 billion cut? Where was the Senator from Pennsylvania? \nWhere was every single Republican in the House of Representatives and \nevery single Republican in the United States Senate? Well, to coin a \nphrase, AWOL. You could not find them with a search warrant.\n  They said, ``You are raising taxes.'' Everybody jumped under their \ndesk on that side. And the Vice President had to come and cast the \ndeciding vote. Every single one of the 44 Republican Senators voted no.\n  Do you think I enjoyed voting for a tax increase? I did not even \nenjoy voting for the budget cuts. But had it not been for the courage \nof President Clinton and the Democrats in this body and the House of \nRepresentatives, we would be here not debating a $1 trillion cut \nbetween now and the year 2002; we would be debating a $2 trillion cut.\n  Where were they?\n  Here we have this draconian budget which, as I say, is an assault on \nthe most vulnerable people in America: Our youngsters who want to be \neducated, lower-class working people, and the elderly. Even Medicaid. \nOf the roughly 25 million people in this country who are eligible for \nMedicaid, 10 million to 12 million of them are blind, disabled, and \nelderly.\n  Oh, yes, and the Republicans are lining up the votes to cut those \nprograms. Why? To preserve the Contract With America, in the House, \nwhich would cut taxes by $371 billion by the year 2002, and in the \nSenate bill, $170 billion very carefully set aside for a tax cut for \nthe wealthiest, not for the people we are assaulting, but for the \nwealthiest in America, those who do not need our help.\n  We are always hearing what the American people want. Here is a poll \nby USA Today taken December 20, 1994: ``If Congress is able to cut \nspending, where should it go?'' Seventy percent say deficit reduction, \n3 times more people than say they want a tax cut. It just shows you the \nAmerican people are not selfish. They want a balanced budget. They \nwould like a tax cut, of course. But given an option between the two \nthey will take a balanced budget every time.\n  I heard the same arguments in 1981 that I have heard here all day \ntoday. In 1981, they said we will balance the budget by cutting \nspending, cutting taxes, and raising defense spending. And I said about \nan hour before we voted on that, ``You pass this and you will create \ndeficits big enough to choke a mule.'' And I was wrong. They were big \nenough to choke an elephant.\n  Senator Bradley of New Jersey, Senator Hollings of South Carolina, \nand yours truly were 3 of only 11 Senators who voted for the spending \ncuts and against the tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, we would be sitting here tonight enjoying not only a \nsurplus but drawing interest on it if 51 people in the Senate had voted \nthat way. The herd instinct was flowing through this body like I have \nnever seen it before. And so what happened? We voted to double defense \nspending. We voted to cut all other spending. We voted a massive tax \ncut, most of which again went to the wealthiest people in America. And \nhere is what happened, the deficit exploded.\n  At the time we debated the 1981 resolution, the deficit was $65 \nbillion. And the Republicans said that if we would just adopt their \nresolution, in 1983, no later than 1984 or 1985, we will balance the \nbudget.\n  That was the promise. That was $3.5 trillion of indebtedness ago. The \ndeficit went completely out of sight. And so today we have a $4.6 \ntrillion debt because that siren song was irresistible.\n  The Democrats have been criticized, and with some legitimacy, for not \noffering an alternative. We could offer an alternative. It would not \npass. It would be defeated. But we have four important amendments. I \nwill make an offer to that side of the aisle. You adopt our four \namendments, which will still give us a balanced budget by 2002, and I \nwill vote for your budget resolution. I will vote for that resolution. \nPut that $170 billion that is very carefully set aside for a tax cut, \nand put it back in Medicare, Medicaid, student loans, and the earned \nincome tax credit, and I will vote for it. And I will worry about \nreforming everything else later on. Now, if that is not a fair \nproposition, I do not know what is.\n  I heard a Congressman the other day say we are going to give welfare \nrecipients a chance to become productive citizens by cutting them off. \nYou tell me how you make productive citizens out of the 20 percent of \nthe people in this country who are on welfare and who are \ndysfunctional, unemployable. You think you have a lot of homeless \npeople in Washington, DC, right now? Wait until you pass this budget. \nWait until you pass welfare reform as it is being proposed here. It is \na death sentence for a lot of people.\n  These Medicare cuts, what do they do? They fall on the people who are \ntotally dependent on Medicare. They fall on the rural hospitals in my \nState, which are totally dependent on being at least adequately \nreimbursed. And they fall, Mr. President, on the doctors who are also \ngoing to have to assume a good piece of the hit.\n  We all know Medicare reform is necessary. Everybody knows Medicare is \ngoing to have to face up to reform. But to cut Medicare to make room \nfor tax cuts is absolutely heartless. Look at the capital gains tax \ncuts that have been passed in the House; 76 percent of the cuts go to \npeople who make over $100,000 a year. Is that what we believe as a \npeople in this country, that 76 percent of a tax cut should go to \npeople who make over $100,000 a year?\n  Look at this chart. Here is the average tax cut per household by \nincome category. If you make between zero and $30,000 a year in a \nfamily of four, you get a whopping $124 a year. That is a pizza every \nthird Friday night. If you make over $200,000 a year, you get a tidy \nlittle sum of $11,266. Who here believes that is what America is all \nabout?\n  Somebody once said that a progressive tax was something Karl Marx \ndreamed of. Unhappily, they did not [[Page S6895]] know about Teddy \nRoosevelt. He was the person who gave us a progressive tax system. You \nwant me to vote for a bill that provides that kind of relief to people \nwho make over $100,000 a year and $124 a year to people who make \n$30,000 a year and in the process take away the earned income tax \ncredit from them?\n  I am not going to embarrass anybody by reading quotes, but the last \ntwo Republican Presidents and the majority leader of the Senate today \nhave all said the earned income tax credit is the best program ever \ninvented to keep people off welfare.\n  Do you want to save the Government $21 billion? Raise the minimum \nwage to $5.15 and you can cut a lot of that investment tax credit out. \nBut this is a tax increase on people who are making $28,000 a year or \nless, while we give a cushy $11,266 a year to people who make $100,000 \na year or more. It is heartless.\n  Education will take the biggest cut in its history. I would not be \nstanding here, Mr. President, if I had not put in 3 years in World War \nII and gone to school on the GI bill. My father could not have afforded \nto send my brother to Harvard Law School, a classmate of the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island, who is standing in the Chamber \ntonight. He could not have sent me to a prestigious law school where \nthe tuition would have been totally out of the question. So I am a \nchampion of student loans and Pell grants.\n  The managers of the bill say, well, this does not cut student loans; \nthis does not cut Pell grants. What does it say? You will cut a certain \namount of money in these functional areas. And when you analyze that \nrequirement, student loans and Pell grants are the only places you can \nfind that amount of money within a particular functional area. CBO has \nsaid if you borrow the maximum of $17,000 for undergraduate studies on \nstudent loans, your fees and interest rates will probably cost you an \nadditional $5,000. Mr. President, kids who have borrowed money to go to \nschool are so saddled with debt they cannot breathe. Now we are going \nto sock another $5,000 on them.\n  What else does this bill not do? This bill says you may not touch \ndefense. There is $255 billion next year that is off limits. It does \nnot make any difference how much of it is squandered. Every person in \nthe Senate read the lengthy article last week saying that for the past \n15 years the Defense Department has spent billions and billions without \nknowing where it went and cannot until this day be traced--overpaid \ncontractors without knowing what they were paying for. One of the \nsaddest things I ever read in my life. We are not talking about $700 \ncoffee pots and toilet seats. We are talking about checks written that \nshould never have been written, people being overpaid, nobody knows \nwhat for.\n  So what will this budget do? It will cut school lunches. It is going \nto cut AFDC payments for the poorest of the poor, eliminate the \ninvestment tax credit which is an effective tax increase on the lowest \nincome people in America, and there is a firewall around defense. You \ncannot take a penny. No matter how lousy a weapons system may be, you \ncannot kill it and put that money into student loans. You cannot put it \nin school lunches. Of course, if you want to put it in some other \nweapons system, that is just Jakey.\n  A House Member last week was quoted as saying he was not going to \nvote for any more foreign aid. You want to hear applause? Just say you \nare opposed to foreign aid and you will have people applauding. Most \npeople just think if we eliminated foreign aid and welfare, we could \nbalance the budget. Foreign aid is less than 1 percent of the budget. \nBut the House Member said we give this money to Third World countries \nand they buy weapons and starve their own people. What are we doing, \nfocusing attention on foreign aid when it is less than 1 percent of the \nbudget?\n  What else did we not touch in this budget? Why, the space station. \nThe biggest single boondoggle in the history of the world. We have \nspent over $11 billion on the space station as of this moment, headed \nfor $100 billion--yes, $100 billion--while we cut student loans, \nstudent lunches, AFDC, investment income, raise the taxes for people \nwho make $30,000 or less by reducing the earned income credit, and we \nleave the space station fully intact. The senior Senator from Texas was \nquoted in the paper the other day as saying, ``Yes, I am going to go \nfor a tax cut. I am going to offer an amendment to cut taxes in the \nChamber.''\n  We have not even begun to cut as much as we need to.\n  The other day I said to the junior Senator from Texas that I am not \ngoing to offer an amendment to kill the Space Station on this bill. But \ndo not get too comfortable, because I am going to offer it later.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield an additional 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator could keep it to a \ncouple of minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I say to the Senator, he has not waited nearly as long \nto take the floor as I did.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. You go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. So the space station, which costs $160,000 per job, is \nsafe and secure. It is only the most vulnerable, the elderly, the \nblind, the disabled, and the children, they are the only ones who bear \nthe brunt of this.\n  What else was not touched? Why, mining laws. In 1988, I started \ntrying to revise the mining laws of this country to keep the U.S. \nGovernment from selling billions of dollars worth of gold for $2.50 an \nacre and here it is 1995 and they are still selling America's land for \n$2.50 an acre that has billions of dollars worth of gold and platinum \nunder it. And what do the taxpayers of America get out it? Zip. Not a \npenny.\n  Whoever is tuned into C-SPAN in America tonight would not believe \nthat. It is a fact.\n  The Secretary of the Interior as recently as 6 months ago was forced \nby the courts to deed $11 billion worth of gold to the Barrick Mining \nCo. for the princely sum of $9,000. It is not mentioned in this budget. \nYou talk about corporate welfare.\n  I can remember 3 years ago when the mining companies would say, ``We \nmight be able to afford a 2 or 3 percent net royalty,'' even though to \nprivate land owners that they mine on they pay 18 percent. They might \nfind it in their heart to voluntarily pay 2 to 3 percent on Federal \nlands. That was when gold was $333 an ounce. That was when platinum was \n$354 an ounce.\n  And in this day, 1995, gold is $384, $51 an ounce more than it was \nthen. Platinum is $427, almost $75 an ounce more than it was when they \nsaid they would pay 2 to 3 percent.\n  Today, guess what the argument is? They will still go broke if you \nimpose a royalty on them.\n  Mr. President, that is the worst, egregious form of corporate welfare \nI have ever seen in my life. And yet I never get more than six \nRepublicans to vote with me to stop the most outrageous practice going \non in America.\n  The people who are assaulted by this budget cannot afford $1,500 for \na ticket to Washington, DC fundraisers. Do you know who they depend on \nbecause they cannot afford the 1,500 bucks? They depend on me. They \ndepend on you. They expect you to be concerned about them. They expect \nyou to see that they are treated fairly.\n  Why do we not drop this $170 billion nonsense called the tax cut for \nthe middle class which goes to the wealthiest people of America and \nkeep faith with the people who sent us here to do their business?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, a Republican Senator \nwas to be recognized next.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask for 1 minute.\n  I just wanted to take a minute's time to compliment the excellent \nremarks, right on the point, by two of my best friends in the U.S. \nSenate with whom I have had the opportunity to serve with as a former \nGovernor of Arkansas and a former Governor of the State of Kentucky. \nGovernors, who have been through these difficult decisions of balancing \nbudgets, should be listened to more than they are sometimes.\n  I just want to say to my friend from Arkansas and my friend from \nKentucky, well done, well stated, and I hope that the American people \nare listening. [[Page S6896]] \n  I thank you, Senator, and I thank you, Senator Ford, who will be back \non the floor in a very short period of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes of my time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming for yielding me 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the challenge facing the Senate over the next few days \nis whether we will be able to muster the courage--there has been a lot \nof talk about courage out here tonight--but the question is whether we \nwill have the courage to pass a budget resolution that, for the first \ntime in three decades, 30 years, will bring the Federal budget into \nbalance. It is a monumental debate involving the single most important \nstep we can take this year to markedly improve this Nation's future.\n  We cannot continue on the path we are currently on, which is spending \nmore money than we take in and sending the bill to our children.\n  Think of it. Of every dollar the Federal Government spends, 13 cents \nis borrowed. That is what is going on right now in this Nation of ours. \nOur current deficit, what we are budgeted for this year, is $200 \nbillion more--$200 billion more--spending than we are going to take in. \nAnd this debt, this deficit, unless we take dramatic steps, will not \nstay at $200 billion a year. It will grow to $400 billion a year 10 \nyears from now.\n  Because of the horrendous $5 trillion debt our Nation has, 15 percent \nof our budget is solely devoted to paying the interest on the debt. \nFifteen percent of all the expenditures, taxes, that are raised in this \nNation go to pay the interest on the debt. Not a penny of that for \nprincipal, all of this for interest.\n  Interest currently constitutes the third largest expenditure in our \nbudget. First is Social Security, second is defense, and third is \ninterest on the debt. And that last item, interest on the debt, is \ngoing up steeply.\n  The resolution before us represents a fundamental shift in the manner \nin which the Federal Government is going to run its finances. Seven \nyears from now, as a result of this budget, if it is adopted, we will \nend the practice of pushing the cost of today's Federal spending onto \nthe backs of our children and our grandchildren. They are the ones that \nare going to have to pick up the tab.\n  I commend the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, for \nwhat he has done and for his excellent work. This budget does what he \nsaid he was going to do. It balances the budget by the year 2002, in 7 \nyears. There is nothing dramatic about steep declines. We have 7 years \nin order to bring this thing into balance. Senator Domenici has done \nthis without resorting to any tricks or gimmicks. The Senate and the \nwhole country owe Senator Domenici a deep debt of gratitude.\n  And I want to congratulate him for standing firm against any tax \ncuts.\n  There has been a lot of talk, the Senator from Arkansas was talking \nabout the cuts, tax cuts that we are providing.\n  In this resolution, there are no tax cuts. This budget provides a \nmechanism which allows us to consider tax cuts only after we have \nenacted a viable and enforceable balanced budget.\n  I personally believe we are in too deep a hole to even think about \nembarking on any sizable tax cuts. If we do realize an economic benefit \nthat comes from balancing this budget--in other words, there is going \nto be lower interest rates in the future; if, and most economists \nagree, this budget is adopted, that will occur--then we ought to use \nthat to pay back our debt. Why use it for a tax cut, in my judgment, of \nany sizable nature? Instead, use it to reduce the debt.\n  Mr. President, I support the resolution that is on the floor that the \nBudget Committee has brought to us. Do I agree with every aspect of it? \nNo, I do not. No one does, but it is very, very good in its totality. I \nobviously have grave concerns about the level of the Medicaid cuts that \nmight have to occur if we adopt the rules, the duties that are imposed \nupon the Finance Committee. I am concerned about the cuts in Amtrak, \nfor example.\n  But for those on the other side of the aisle who criticize what we \nare doing, come up with a better proposal. Do not just criticize what \nwe are suggesting. Do something better.\n  When we debated and voted on the constitutional amendment on the \nbalanced budget, they all said: ``We do not need it; the true test of \ndeficit reduction is our resolve. All we need to do is balance the \nbudget if we have the courage.''\n  Well, this side is showing the courage to do it, Mr. President. Here \nwe are. We are taking these steps that are long overdue, and I am just \nhappy to be part of this effort. I hope when all is said and done that \nthis budget, or something very close to it, will be adopted by this \nSenate.\n  I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Wyoming for letting me \nproceed.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island. \nAt the end of this very first day of debate on the budget resolution, I \ncome to the floor to offer a few observations. I do not think any one \nof us on either side of the aisle exaggerate when we say that we have \nthe deepest respect for Senator Pete Domenici. I have heard my good \nfriends on the other side say just that. We have a great mutual respect \nfor him.\n  I go on to say that the budget resolution crafted by my respected \nfriend could well turn out, in my mind, to be one of the most historic \nand important and statesmanlike measures voted on during my 16-year \ntenure here in the U.S. Senate.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee is one remarkable legislator. We \nhere have long known him for his expertise, his integrity, and his \ndedication to lessening the burden on posterity--our children and \ngrandchildren. So it is a pleasure to see so many here and out in the \nland giving a long overdue to this man and his work, and he is one of \nthe most hard-working men I have ever met in my time in this place.\n  So the measure he presents to us would bring the annual deficit of \nthe United States down to zero by the year 2002. People say, why 2002? \nI answer, because we may never, ever have another chance to do this.\n  In the future, we could see a war, God spare us, or a recession, and \nthen the retirement of the baby boom generation. That is where the hit \ncomes, the identifiable hit. If we cannot balance the books during this \nfleeting window of opportunity, I feel very deeply that it will never \nbe done again. We would simply be consigning our children--``kids'' is \nthe phrase used here all day, those kids everybody is always talking \nabout on the other side and our side all day long, the kids--the kids \nwill receive nothing. We will not have to worry about cuts. There will \nnot be anything. We will be consigning those kids to mounting deficits, \ncrushing interest rates, and payments of fiscatory tax rates, payroll \ntaxes. You talk about balancing something on the backs of someone, \ntheir backs will break from the tax load that comes if we cannot get \nthis done.\n  Earlier this year, we voted on a balanced budget amendment, a very \nexciting debate, vigorous, spirited. Over and over in this Chamber, I \nheard the opponents of that amendment say, some in high-pitched \nendeavor, that we did not need an amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States; all we need is some political courage, some guts to do \nthe job. Oh, magnificent speeches, they ring in my head.\n  And guess what? Now it is time to do the job, and now we shall see \nwho has the political courage. Oh, indeed, we shall. I cannot wait for \nthe debate.\n  I am very proud that the majority party in this body is coming \nforward and proposing a solution to this growing crisis. If you want a \ngood definition of business as usual in Washington, DC, I would say it \nwas the practice of assuming that the public will punish us if we did \nwhat was right and then pulling our punches accordingly.\n  The strategy on the other side seems to be to assume that business as \nusual will still prevail, to sit on the sidelines, chuckle, do high-\nfives, and criticize and whoop it up and hope, and, more \n[[Page S6897]] importantly, pray that our earnest effort to solve this \nproblem will be punished by a furious and angry electorate.\n  That is a depressing and cynical view of the American citizenry, I \nbelieve, and I, for one, do not ascribe to it. We Republicans are, \nindeed, making a historic gamble. We are betting that if we do what is \nright, unheard of in itself in this city, if we, indeed, move toward a \nbalanced budget, that the shrieking, and wailing and howling of the \nvarious special interests will be drowned out by the chorus of praise--\nyes, praise--from the vast majority of at least thoughtful Americans \nwho are sick and tired of seeing the burdens of debt pile higher and \nhigher and higher on them and on their children.\n  And who did it? We did it; we in Congress did it. Do not blame it on \nRonald Reagan. Do not blame it on George Bush. Do not blame it on Jimmy \nCarter. Do not blame it on Bill Clinton. Blame it on us. We have \nperformed superbly for the last 50 years. We have acted like pack \nhorses in dragging the money back to our districts and preening our \nfeathers to tell our constituents: ``What did you want? We heard you \nand we went and got it for you, even though now it is 5 trillion bucks \nworth of debt.''\n  Columnist George Will, a very bright and articulate man, made a \nrather telling observation, I think it was Sunday before last, on a \nnational television performance. He noted there seems to be a key in \nthe word processors in the Democratic offices on the Hill that \nautomatically types: ``We will not balance the budget on the backs \nof,'' and then you just leave the blank. ``We will not balance the \nbudget on the backs of,'' and then you fill in the blank: Senior \ncitizens, the children, veterans, farmers, teachers, welfare \nrecipients, ``Masterpiece Theater.'' You name it, if it is affected by \nserious deficit reduction, and every form of spending must be, then the \nDemocratic Party will oppose it. Guess what, folks; that is exactly why \nwe have $5 trillion in debt.\n  I am one who is going to balance the budget to get the debt off the \nbacks of the children and the grandchildren. Curious adventure. I think \nthat is what we should do when we are talking about what is on or off \nthe backs. The debt will crush them. Washington must really be the last \nplace in the world where it is realized if you want to get out of debt, \nyou simply can keep spending more and more and more. Washington is also \nthe only town in the world where you cut spending and it gets bigger.\n  I come from Wyoming. We must simply use a different language out \nthere. We call it English. In that language, a reduction means \nsomething gets smaller, not bigger. So anyone who is watching this \ndebate needs to remember that when we are attacked for savage cuts, we \nare indeed talking about increases in spending only. Only increases, \nhowever, that are not as big and as demanding of your hard-earned money \nas those or some of those in the other party would like.\n  Earlier today, I saw a chart brought out by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, my old friend, Senator Ted Kennedy. He and I do a little \nfacing off every day. We do not get paid for that. It is purely a \nnonprofit activity.\n We do not agree on all things, but I enjoy him very much. He brought \nout a chart--a powerful chart--that said ``working families pay for tax \ncuts for the wealthy''--a sinister preparation. Very interesting, and \nespecially so, since there are no tax cuts in this budget resolution \nsubmitted by our colleague. There is not a tax cut in a car load, \nnowhere. The President, however, still wants $63 billion in tax cuts, \nand we do not hear too much about that.\n\n  So all that we have done is said that if we succeed in balancing the \nbudget, and if this produces a dividend perhaps in the form of \ndeclining interest rates, then that money should go to the taxpayers \nand not for us to spend.\n  Now, I have personally come out very strongly to say ``no tax cuts'' \nuntil the budget is balanced. But I find it extremely odd that \nDemocratic detractors believe that tax cuts are irresponsible even if \nthe budget remains balanced. That is the most curious view of budgetary \nresponsibility that I know. But it is historically so with some of \nthem. But here are the facts about the budget before us. With this \nbudget, we achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002. In which \ncategory in this budget does spending grow the fastest? In Medicare. In \nthe budget Senator Domenici is presenting to this Senate, the largest \ngrowing item of spending in this budget is Medicare; 7.1 percent per \nyear, going from $178 to $283 billion. No other program in the entire \nbudget is dealt with more generously than Medicare.\n  It is astonishing that even this huge rate of growth is greeted as \n``not enough'' by the detractors. This is a measure of how serious and \ndebilitating the addiction to spending has become. Under this budget, \nwe are the toughest on the appropriated spending matters. Shrinking it \nnot just relative to inflation, but shrinking it outright--$548 billion \nin 1995 and $518 billion by 2002. This is the kind of budget discipline \nthat America seems to have been crying for.\n  On the other hand, huge increases could still occur and will still \noccur in Social Security--$334 billion in Social Security going to $480 \nbillion; and in Medicare, $178 to $283 billion. And in Medicaid, from \n$89 to $125 billion, and all other mandatory spending which includes \nFederal retirement, welfare, agricultural subsidies, and all the rest \ngrows, continually grows from $146 to $197 billion. And remember, we \nall took Social Security off the table. I did not. The Senator who is \nstanding across in the Chamber did not either. The two of us have \npresented to the American public seven bills to bring solvency to the \nSocial Security system, and we will present that and we will have \nhearings on that, and we will proceed with that. It is very difficult \nto do what we really have to do, and it would be so much simpler. Yet, \nwe did it out of political terrorism, that we not touch the item of the \nbudget which is $383 billion a year revenue. I am going to leave the \ndetails of that. I do not know what my colleague from Nebraska is going \nto say. But I can tell you this: Senator Bob Kerrey is a very \ncourageous person, and he has faced up to these problems before by \nbeing chairman of the Entitlements Commission, the bipartisan \nEntitlements Commission. That is why it is a great privilege and an \nhonor for me to join him in a bipartisan approach to bring some \neventual sanity to a system which goes into terminal decline in the \nyear 2013 and then goes bankrupt in the year 2031, and that is the \nSocial Security system. I do not want my remarks on that tied with this \nbudget resolution or any part of it. Sever that. But I, as a Member of \nthe Senate, will be proceeding to do something about that system.\n  So we cannot do better than to repeat this over and over and over \nagain. The rapid detractors succeed in portraying these as cuts. If the \nAmerican public really swallows that, maybe the detractors are right. \nMaybe then the public deserves exactly what it gets--permanent deficits \nand poverty for our descendants, all out of political terrorism, or, as \nmy old friend Gary Hart used to say, ``mow-mow politics.''\n  I join Senator Domenici and the distinguished majority leader, Bob \nDole, in thinking better of the American public. I believe that though \nthe special interests will cry out, the keening wail will sound like \nwolves in the Yellowstone with a full Moon--the keening wail of the \nspecial interests. But I think the vast majority of Americans want this \njob done and now--or at least for us to start. They want everyone who \nis benefiting from Federal largess to take a hit. It will not be easy, \nand there will undoubtedly be sacrifices that will be called for from \nevery sector of society. I also believe they have grown tired of \nWashington telling them that no sacrifices are necessary. We do not \nhave to touch senior citizens or the children or anyone else to get \nthis job done. When you take that approach, spending never slows. \nAlways up.\n  (Mrs. HUTCHISON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SIMPSON. It is incredible to me that our President and some on \nthe other side of the aisle have chosen to ignore all responsibility in \nthis challenge. AWOL--absent without leadership.\n  I certainly do not intend to include some others on the other side of \nthe aisle. As I have mentioned, Senator Kerrey has faced these problems \nalone and in an election year before. That takes real guts. But it \nastounds me, and I am sure my colleague, that given \n[[Page S6898]] everything we know with absolute certainty through the \nwork of this commission and from the trustees of Social Security \ntelling us about these things and the future of Federal spending, that \nthe President would submit a budget that makes not even the slightest \nattempt to approach or deal with the problem, or to accept one word of \nthe recommendations of the commission that he appointed, and then drop \nall reference to generational struggles that are coming in this country \nin the years very soon ahead.\n  Earlier this week, the President announced plans to veto a \nrescissions package of $16 billion. That is less than 1 percent of the \nbudget, and it was too much for the President to end. How in the world \nare we going to make the tough decisions on entitlements and other \nsensitive spending if we cannot even cut 1 percent of the budget?\n  That rescissions package contained various unauthorized \nappropriations, various GSA construction projects--true pork--and we \nall played that one. Certainly, there must have been spending in there \nthe President favored, but I find it impossible to believe that this \nspending is so important that he would delete even the headway we would \nmake on 1 percent of the budget.\n  It is a terribly strange way to take a stand, to defend every last \nbit, even that last 1 percent of pork-ridden discretionary spending. \nAnd we were all in that one. But that is not my idea of leadership.\n  There are many examples of what have been presented and what will \nhappen. Let me tell you one exaggerated one, and I am going to wind up. \nOthers are here, too. I was thinking how someone maybe in this \nadministration might have conducted themselves in a cabinet meeting or \nsomething at various previous periods in our history--\n perhaps if in office at the time of the secession of the Southern \nStates in 1861, can almost hear advisors turning to the President and \nsaying, ``Now, Americans might get upset if we ask for sacrifices, so \nbetter let the Congress institute a military draft and then we will \ncriticize them for it because that would be better politically.'' That \nis obviously a little exaggerated example, to be sure, but I think some \nappropriateness there.\n\n  This is a historic tune for this President to be the President who \nled the Nation out of debt and on the path of responsibility and \nsolvency, again. He has a Congress also, even eager to do the job, but \nthe best he can do is to hope that there will be a political cost, a \ndeep political cost associated with the effort.\n  Let me say to the detractors, there is still the opportunity to \ncontribute to this effort and to be part of the solution instead of \npart of the problem. I have heard criticism from some Democrats that \nthis budget does not really balance the budget by 2002 because it only \nbalances the unified budget, the one that includes Social Security.\n  Very well, then. Democrats wish to offer an alternative budget, \nbalances the budget without counting Social Security, I would consider \ngiving my support to that. While we have yet to see such a budget \npresented, criticism from the other side is about several million cubic \nfeet of hot air.\n  We Republicans took a lot of guff last session because we did not \nvote for the President's budget. Of course, events since then have \nvindicated Republicans because the President's own budget forecast $200 \nbillion deficits as far as the eye can see. Clearly, that budget did \nnot do the job, just as we said it would not.\n  At least at the time we proposed our own alternative budget to do the \nsame job, that alternative reflected our differences with the \nPresident. We would have done it via spending cuts instead of tax \nincreases but we did present an alternative.\n  Those of the other faith appear to have forgotten that. They have no \nalternative to offer that does the job as thoroughly as our own budget. \nThe President's budget does not even try. It just allows deficits to \nclimb and the debt to pile up ad infinitum.\n  I do not believe that that is good politics for the minority party. \nBut do not take that advice from me. Undoubtedly, there will be \npolitical opposition to the measures we have to take to balance the \nbudget, but once we do, I think Americans will see, once we do it they \nwill see that the benefits will be coming to them. Declining interest \nrates, they will see the benefits of restored confidence in the market, \nin the investment in our economy, in the dollar itself. They will come \nto congratulate Members for the work we have done.\n  Perhaps even more importantly, we will then have a fighting chance to \ndeal with the retirement of the baby boom generation when it does \nbegin. There is absolutely no way we will be ready for that if we are \nstill running the deficits in the hundreds of billions that those on \nthe other side seem to advocate.\n  So we have a moral obligation to pass a form of this balanced budget \nthis week. Future generations will not look kindly on Members if they \nfail. We should reach together on reaching a consensus on the best form \nof a balanced budget resolution. I pledge to do that.\n  I know my colleague from Illinois is here on the floor. I am yielding \nthe floor in just a moment, but will say that I thoroughly enjoyed \nworking with her, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, on the Entitlements \nCommission. It was a great eye opener for all Members.\n  I wish, in many ways, I had not been on it because it reminded me of \nthat old movie, ``The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' because we learned too \nmuch. We learned where we are headed. Had a lot of good people from \nboth sides of the aisle helping. If we can get through this necessary \npolitical posturing, which I am doing a good bit of myself, and we all \nhave to do this. This is very therapeutic. Then we will settle down and \nget something, because we all know what the stakes are, and we all know \nwhat the numbers are.\n  That has never happened before. It has happened because the \nEntitlements Commission and the great work of Senator Kerrey and \nSenator Danforth. It has happened because the Social Security trustees \nhave said exactly what is going to happen to the systems of Medicare, \nwhich will go broke. That is not something that floated in from the \nwest coast. That is the Social Security trustees saying it. The Social \nSecurity trustees are Donna Shalala, Robert Rubin, Robert Reich, the \nCommissioner, and Democrat and Republican citizens of America saying it \nwill go broke.\n  In the year 2016, the disability insurance fund will go broke. In \n2031, the Social Security system will go broke. That doomsday date used \nto be 2063. It is now 2031. It moves up 3 to 5 years every year.\n  There it is. Fun and games all we want. I am ready to play it. I love \nit. So does the senior Senator from Nebraska who came here with me, and \nin who there is no more spirited and engaging men than Senator Jim \nExon, and the Senator in the chair, and the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  We will do this, and then we should sit down after the shot and the \nshell and the smoke, because there is no smoke and mirrors in this \nbudget. Everyone who has been here as long as I, 16 years, 10 years, 15 \nyears, now know, no smoke, no mirrors. All hard tough votes. I cannot \nwait for the debate. We never needed a balanced budget amendment. Just \nneed to cast those tough votes.\n  Well, hop in and get wet all over.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Smith pertaining to the introduction of S.J. Res. \n34 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Nebraska is recognized to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me begin this by saying that I \nbelieve that the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, has made a good-faith effort to produce a budget \nresolution that frankly few predicted was likely to occur. It reduces \nthe deficit over the next seven years by $961 billion, reduces \nspending, and at the end of that 7-year period, if you exclude Social \nSecurity, you have a balanced budget.\n  It results in a significantly smaller Government. It gives us the \npotential of having lower taxes as well. I must say, Mr. President, \nagain, I believe this is a solid and a good-faith effort. I regret, as \nI have listened to the debate [[Page S6899]] today, that it has been \nconsiderably less than the sort of civil debate that I would have \nthought was possible given some discussions that are going on right now \nbetween a number of us on the Democratic side that would like to \nparticipate in supporting this budget resolution.\n  And I say that because what has happened is the dynamic has really \nchanged. We are engaged in looking at an alternative that we I hope can \nget consideration to, I suspect sometime next week by the time it is \nall done. And we begin with somewhere in the neighborhood of $700 \nbillion of cuts over a 7-year period. That is a substantial shift. The \nPresident's budget, as has been commented on several times, contains no \nsignificant deficit reduction. Suddenly, you have under the leadership \nof the distinguished Senator from New Mexico and the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, a \nbig shift in the Senate and I think large numbers, well in excess of \n60, who would vote for a budget resolution that got us to a point 7 \nyears from now where the deficit would be zero.\n  I have come here this evening to identify a couple of problems, and I \nhope I identify the problems in a constructive fashion because, as I \nsaid, I would like very much and hope very much that the Republican \nchairman and Republican leadership will favorably view, as I said, a \nsignificant number of us who would like to participate in voting for a \nresolution that does approximately what the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico is attempting to accomplish.\n  Let me say for those who doubt the power of deficit reduction, the \nmost impressive number in all of the 7-year forecast is that net \ninterest stays the same. Net interest has been the most rapidly growing \nline in our entire budget, and under the budget resolution before us \nnet interest would flatten out. As an expenditure, Mr. President, it \ncertainly benefits bond holders, but it does not benefit American \ntaxpayers at all. It is a payment that goes out, that buys us nothing \nother than the capacity to service these bonds. It is the most \nimpressive number and one that I think we should pay attention to as we \nlook to try to develop some alternatives.\n  I begin in describing some concerns that I have about this sort of \nevaluating its impact upon me. Earlier today, I heard the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Iowa talking about the fact that this budget \nresolution freezes congressional salary over, I believe, a 7-year life \nof the budget. I am impressed that that is in this budget resolution, \nbut, Mr. President, I do not really feel for someone in the $136,000 or \nwhatever it is plus salary that is a comparable shared sacrifice. I am \nnot one who comes to this floor and says that the problem in America is \nthat rich people are somehow manipulating and abusing poor Americans.\n  I do not believe that at all. But I do believe if we are going to \nhave $1 trillion worth of deficit reduction over a 7-year period, it \nshould be shared sacrifice, and it is reasonable to look at some \nalternatives, whether it is capping the deductions at 28 percent, which \nthe Entitlement Commission recommended would get $80 billion or $90 \nbillion over a 7-year period, or have me and others with incomes over \n$100,000 having to pay a little bit as a consequence. Some would come \nup and say, oh, gee, that is a big tax increase. I do not view it that \nway at all. It is just an attempt to say we ought to pay a little bit \nin order to get this thing to go away.\n  It is not, Mr. President, just because there is a need for shared \nsacrifice, at least from my standpoint. It is also a consequence of \ncoming and saying I am a little bit troubled, looking at some of the \nthings that we are asking Americans to do because it seems to me, at \nleast from my standpoint, I as one individual American am saying, well, \ngosh, now that I have mine, I want everybody else to do things that I \ndid not have to do when I was in trouble or needed help. I have perhaps \nmore than most kind of a schizophrenic attitude toward government. I \nhave had it save my life. I have had it save my business. I have had it \nalmost take my life and almost take my business. It can do both, Mr. \nPresident, but I have to say in the main, if I look at the 51 years of \nmy lifetime the Government of the United States of America, though it \ncan be a menace from time to time, has enable me to do an enormous \namount.\n  Yes, individual initiative is important and my family has been \nimportant and my friends have been important, but there are many key \npoints along my lifetime, Mr. President, where I have been given a \ngreat deal of help and I have been given opportunity in education, been \ngiven opportunity in health care, been given opportunity in my own \nbusiness, and I cannot in good conscience come to the floor and say \nthat as a consequence of my own experience I feel that I am \nparticipating very much in the shared sacrifice needed, that we are all \nconscious of what is needed in order to get this deficit eliminated.\n  So I begin with that, Mr. President. I hope again that the Republican \nleadership and the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee will \nlook to those of us who intend, if we can, to reach agreement, which is \nnot easy to do. If we get an alternative, I hope it is given good, \nsolid consideration. I hope the chairman of the Budget Committee will \nsay that this is a big victory; we started off the year, nobody \nbelieving we could get much in the way of deficit reduction, Democrats \nreally not very enthusiastic about it, according to at least what you \nwould read, and now all of a sudden we have Democrats moving a long \nways in our direction willing to accept--I think we will end up with \nclose to $700 billion over 7 years in real cuts, asking only that we \nlook to ways for all of us to share a little bit in this thing over the \ncourse of the budget.\n  There is a second problem, Mr. President. I do not know if it can be \ndone in this budget resolution. I recognize the constraints of the \nBudget Committee and the Budget Enforcement Act really does not perhaps \nallow the Budget Committee to deal with these issues and maybe it has \nto be dealt with later on in the year. Earlier, the senior Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Simpson] commented upon it. But the Entitlement \nCommission--and I have heard a number of people talk about it--has \nidentified what I think is a serious problem.\n  I am actually borrowing a chart from Senator Bennett, the Senator \nfrom Utah, who had this chart up. But this really does describe the \nproblem that the Entitlement Commission identified which is that \nmandatory spending and net interest are growing so rapidly that \nsometime around the year 2012, something like that, it is consuming all \nrevenue that the Government of the United States is taking in. That \nrevenue has stayed relatively flat. It is about the only thing that has \nstayed constant. We have collected about 19 percent of the GDP except \nin World War II and Vietnam; during those times it went higher. Most of \nthe time it stayed about 19 percent. And unless we change that pattern \nof growth what happens is domestic discretionary continues to get \nsqueezed down.\n  I appreciate the fact that Social Security was not addressed or \nretirement not really addressed in this budget resolution. I think it \nneeds to be, not because there is a short-term budget problem. I am not \narguing that we ought to look at retirement because it contributes to \ndeficit reduction in the short term. But it unquestionably contributes \nto deficit reduction in the long term.\n  That is the problem we have. Some may say, gee, that will be good \nnews, if we can get rid of all Government functions and turn the \nFederal Government into an ATM machine. I do not think that is good \nnews. I believe not just in defense but as I hope I indicated earlier \nall of those things that have helped me have been in the domestic \ndiscretionary account. Everything I have received from the Government \nhas come from domestic discretionary, unless you count the U.S. Navy, \nwhich was an enormous benefit to me as well. I leave out the world's \nlargest and most powerful Navy. That was a wonderful experience, too.\n  All of the rest I have benefited from have come from this domestic \naccount. I am troubled by the budget resolution because it allows that \nmandatory account to continue to grow. It slows it down somewhat, but \nthe mandatory accounts continue to grow and continue to take larger and \nlarger percentages of domestic discretionary. It must be understood the \nbudget resolution improves the current trend, makes it somewhat better, \nbut I do not believe-- [[Page S6900]] and I must say honestly I have \nnot extended it out beyond the 7 years, so I do not know exactly what \nit looks like out there 10, 15, 20, 30 years from now but looking at \nthe 1996 and 2002 trend line, that appears to be the case. For \nemphasis, the one big change that has occurred is that net interest has \nflattened out, and that is a huge benefit to us.\n  So to solve this problem of mandatory spending, we have to look at \nthe long-term situation, not the short term.\n  That is why I say it maybe that the Budget Committee, in looking at a \nbudget resolution that deals with a 7-year period of time, may not have \nbeen able to address this mandatory problem.\n  Senator Simpson and I today introduced a piece of legislation that \nwould complement the Budget Committees work. Maybe it cannot be \nconsidered as a part of this resolution, but it certainly, I hope, gets \nconsideration. And I suspect, whether it is 54 Republican votes or \nwhether the Republicans accept the alternative and we end up with \nRepublican and Democratic votes, I do not know, one way or the other, \nwe are going to get a resolution that requires committees to do a lot \nof reconciliation.\n  There are two things that I hope get considered. The first is one \nthat Senator Simpson and I introduced today. What we say with Social \nSecurity, again, is that we have a long-term problem. The Social \nSecurity trust fund builds to 2012, then it goes down to about 2029 \nwhen it is completely depleted.\n  You may say, what is the big deal? Well, the big deal is our \ngeneration, the baby boomer generation, starts to retire around 2008, \nthe largest generation in the history of the country, reducing the \nnumber of workers per retiree from about five down to about three. And \nwe have big problems out there. The adjustments we would have to make \nare rather substantial if we postpone it, unlike what would have \nhappened in 1983.\n  What Senator Simpson and I do is we change, for the most part, future \nbenefits. We make some adjustments to CPI minus 5. I think the budget \nresolution is CPI minus 2. In the House resolution, we adjust it by .6 \non the House side. We make the COLA more progressive with the cap \nreduction. We do some other things in our proposal that are short term. \nBut most of them, including the extension of the normal eligibility age \nand the early eligibility age, most of those are pushed off into \napproximately the year 2030.\n  Those changes strengthen Social Security, Mr. President, because what \nit does, it says to all generations, every living American--every \nliving American is a Social Security beneficiary at some time; they may \nnot be eligible today, but they will be at some time.\n  So you have a 20-year-old and they look at the current situation. \nThey scratch their head and say, ``Gee, I don't think there is going to \nbe anything there for me.'' Under the legislation Senator Simpson and I \nintroduced today, they would look at the thing and say, ``There will be \nsomething there for me,'' because we bring the Social Security balance \nup to 350 percent of the annual payment and stabilize it there for 75 \nyears. So every generation, every American would say, ``OK, we now know \nthat Social Security is going to be there for us.''\n  The second thing that we do--and it has a big impact, I think, on \nthis whole debate. One of the things we very often forget is that the \ndeficit reduction action, one of the most powerful things about it is \nthat it increases national savings. Deficit financing is an act of \ndissavings. Deficit reduction is an act of savings.\n  It is a fair argument to make that the distribution of it may not be \nterribly equitable. That is one of the reasons I am concerned about, as \nI said, what I am having to pay in this budget resolution and what I am \nrequired to contribute, because there is great inequity when you do \ndeficit reduction. It does not necessarily benefit all Americans \nequally. You have to understand that.\n  If I own stocks and bonds, the deficit reduction looks pretty good to \nme. But if you do not own stocks and bonds, you may say, ``Gosh, in the \nsort short term, there is not a lot of good there for me.''\n  The second part of the Social Security proposal that we made today \nwould also increase national savings, as does the Deficit Reduction \nAct, by establishing a 2-percent account for all Americans. It reduces \nthe employee payroll tax by 2 percent, a $40 billion a year tax cut, \nMr. President. But not just a tax cut, a tax cut with the purpose of \nestablishing for all 137 million American workers a real personal \ninvestment plan, similar to what we have in the thrift savings plan for \nFederal employees. It would increase saving over a 9-year period in \nexcess of $1 trillion, matching this deficit reduction.\n  This Deficit Reduction Act increases savings by almost $1 trillion \nover 7 years. Our proposal would add another trillion to that, but not \njust add a trillion, it would add a trillion in savings spread across \n100 million American households.\n  So the next thing that must be done, in addition to addressing \nretirement, if you want to control the cost of mandatory spending, if \nyou are not troubled by the fact that we are squeezing domestic \ndiscretionary--Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. The next thing you have got to do--and this gets, I know, \nright back into last year's argument --you have to reform health care.\n  Now the budget resolution addresses Medicare and attempts to begin \nthe process of health care reform but, Mr. President, I do not believe \nit does enough. In particular, it does not get at that long-term \nstructural problem that will continue to plague us even if we were to \nbite the--I would not call it a bullet. I would call it more of a \nhowitzer round of this budget reduction. But even if you bite this \nhowitzer round, you are still going to be left with pretty substantial \nincreases in health care costs when the baby boomers retire. So there \nis still going to be a need for us, if you want to control the cost of \nentitlements and stop this rapid increase, there is still going to be a \nneed to get at health care reform and do more than this budget \nresolution would allow.\n  Again, I hope very much that it is possible for those of us on the \nDemocratic side that would like to vote for a budget resolution to get \nfull consideration by Republicans to have shifted the argument of full \nconsideration to two facts. One, we are not really sharing the burden. \nIt really is not an equitable sharing of the burden.\n  All you have to do is ask yourself, as a Member of Congress at \n$136,500, or whatever the number is, ``Gee, what is it going to do to \nme over the next 7 years?'' The only thing you can really say is it has \nfrozen your salary for 7 years. And I do not think you would really get \nan audience out there paying more for Medicare, getting less for \nMedicaid, having college loan restrictions, and many other things going \nin this budget, I do not think you will get a lot of sympathy from \nAmericans saying, ``That's right. You guys have really put your \nshoulder to the wheel here and shared the burden of sacrifice.''\n  That is No. 1. I think that there are ways for us to make it much \nmore equitable, much more fair, if you do not mind using that word.\n  And, second, Mr. President, I believe whether we do it in this budget \nresolution or we do it after the budget resolution, we still have a \nproblem of mandating spending. We still have a problem of mandating \nspending, that if you do not want to convert the Federal Government \ninto an ATM machine, you have to address retirement and you have to \naddress health care and you have to do more than just reduce the size \nof the deficit and increase national savings, as a consequence.\n  Mr. President, as I indicated, I watched the early part of this \ndebate and it seemed to me to be going in the wrong direction. It was \nvery uncivil and very partisan and very unfortunate. I do not mean that \nabout the distinguished Senator from New Mexico or the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska. I thought their opening comments were, you know, \nquite calm and quite reasoned. But it deteriorated in a hurry into \naccusations from that side of the aisle, from some who say, ``Gee, you \nDemocrats don't want to do anything.''\n  Not true. There are a lot of us who are willing to do an awful lot. \n[[Page S6901]] \n  And I heard on this side, as well, some accusations that Republicans \nare heartless and they are trying to cut the heart out of the American \nfamily, on and on and on. I think, in fact, our rhetoric was in excess \nas well.\n  I do not know, Mr. President, if we are going to be able to reach a \npoint where we have a Republican and a Democratic resolution here. I \nsincerely hope that we are able to do it, because I will predict to my \nRepublican friends on the other side of the aisle, once we get to the \ntough task of reconciling these numbers, you are going to say, ``Oh, my \ngosh, will you guys help us? Will you stand with us and lead this \ncountry in the right direction?''\n  Because it will not just be a vote, Mr. President. We have got a lot \nof leadership to exert if we are going to take this country in a \ndifferent direction than the one that it is currently headed.\n  So, again, I thank both the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator \nfrom Nebraska, who I think have made a good-faith effort. Both of them \nI know are deeply troubled by the deficit financing this country is \ndoing. I sincerely hope that between now and Wednesday or whenever it \nis that we vote on final passage that we are able to reconcile the \nobvious differences that we have between our two parties and put \ntogether a bipartisan budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. JEFFORDS). Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Frist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, my message is a brief one. If we are to \nrestore the American dream, we must change the way Washington does \nbusiness, and we can change the way Washington does business by passing \nthe first balanced budget plan in almost 30 years.\n  The plan has been laid out over the course of today, and it is before \nus here. This chart shows Federal budget deficits by year--1995, 1996, \nout to the year 2002. In red is the Clinton budget, approximately $200 \nbillion in 1995, increasing every year to the year 2000 to over $250 \nbillion. Yet we have a choice, and that choice is the Domenici balanced \nbudget plan put before us today. That balanced budget plan results in a \ndecrease in the deficit every year, 1995 to 1996, 1997, down to the \nyear 2002, where the budget will be balanced; we will have zero \ndeficit.\n  We heard a lot about children today. Mr. President, I want to talk \njust a minute about why the Republican budget, the Domenici balanced \nbudget, is the most compassionate thing we can do for our Nation's \nchildren. It is the most morally responsible thing that we can do for \nour Nation's children.\n  Today, we are asking impossible things of our children. I am the \nfather of three young boys, Harrison, 12; Jonathan, 9; and Bryan, 8. \nMany people--even today--ask me why would you run for the U.S. Senate? \nAnd my answer is very clearly, I ran to now serve in the U.S. Senate \nbecause I was concerned about the future of their generation, a future \nin jeopardy because of the projected Clinton budget deficits to \nincrease year after year.\n  But today, we have a choice. We expect today's young people to \nfinance Federal deficits of staggering proportions. A young child born \ntoday is born into this world and given a bill of $19,000, a bill that \nhe or she did not ask for. We give that young child--and it could be \nyour child or my child or a grandchild or a neighbor's child--we give \nthat child a lifetime tax rate today, unless we act, of 82 percent. We \ngive that child today an obligation to pay over $187,000 in taxes over \nthat young child's lifetime just to pay interest on the Federal debt, \nand that child did not ask for this Federal debt. We have given it to \nhim or her.\n  At 7 years of age, when that child would start elementary school, \nMedicare is going to be bankrupt unless we act, and act today. When \nthat young child is 17 years of age, when he or she graduates from high \nschool, spending on Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, Federal and \nmilitary pensions, and interest on the debt will consume the entire \nbudget, leaving no money for defense, education, roads, or any other \npurpose.\n  We are asking that young child today to pay for a health care system \nin the future whose projected costs are running out of control. But the \nDomenici balanced budget plan will reverse that trend. We are trying \nhard to stop the repeating and ongoing flow of Government red ink, and \nlike a family gathered around the kitchen table, Republicans have made \ndifficult choices needed to protect our future.\n  Mr. President, this budget plan will benefit our children by building \na more prosperous tomorrow, a tomorrow of greater opportunity. The \nCongressional Budget Office reports that each percentage point of \ngrowth will result in 600,000 new jobs, and that same budget office has \nsaid that balancing the budget will result in additional growth of 2 to \n3 percent a year. This means greater opportunity for our children, \ngreater possibilities. They will be able to find better jobs and they \nwill be able to work, and someday they will be able to support their \nown children.\n  Lower interest rates will help them in everything that they do. The \nCBO has told us that interest rates will come down by as much as 2 \npercent, and this means that they will have to pay less to buy their \nfirst home. It will cost them less to finance their cars, to finance \ntheir education, to be able to start--even start--their own small \nbusinesses if they want to. Lower interest rates will have a ripple \neffect throughout their lives.\n  Mr. President, the Concord Coalition has told us that the average \nfamily income would be not $35,000 but $50,000 if that family was not \nburdened by the massive Federal debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is time yielded?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes, I yield an additional 3 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. The GAO predicts that if we balance the budget by the year \n2002, the average American will have a real growth in income of 36 \npercent by the year 2020.\n  Mr. President, the best thing we can do for our children is to \nincrease productivity. That will bring higher incomes. The American \ndream is fading for the generation of my young sons unless we act. \nDuring their lifetime, incomes for our young people, those under 24, \nhave fallen by more than 15 percent. A balanced budget will reverse \nthose trends. It will restore the American dream.\n  So I close by saying that we, indeed, have a moral obligation to do \nthis for our children. We must leave them a world of expanding \nopportunities, a world where they can achieve their American dreams. \nEnacting the Republican balanced budget proposal is the responsible \nthing to do. Now is the time to do it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield whatever time is needed to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, according to some of my colleagues, this debate is \nabout whether this Congress should set out a framework for balancing \nthe budget over the next 7 years. They argue with great fervor that the \nchoice before the Senate is a choice between a budget submitted by the \nPresident of the United States that does not balance the budget anytime \nin the foreseeable future, or the resolution now before us. That, \nhowever, is a false choice. The real issue is not whether to begin the \ntask of restoring fiscal discipline. The real issue is how. The real \nissue is whether this budget resolution, in its current form, is a \nblueprint that this country can and should follow.\n  The first step toward answering that question involves asking \nanother; is it fair? Unfortunately, the answer to that question is no.\n  This resolution is not fair to the working poor. American families \nwith incomes of under $28,000 would see an [[Page S6902]] effective \nincrease in their taxes of $1,400 over the next 7 years under the \nchanges in the earned income tax credit [EITC] this resolution \nproposes.\n  It is not fair to seniors. It will likely cost retired Americans \nabout $900 per year in higher premiums, copayments, and deductibles--\n$3,200 over 7 years. For a senior couple, that totals an extra $6,400 \nin out-of-pocket costs. And yet, there is nothing in the resolution \nthat will do anything about the inflation in medical costs that is one \nof the principle factors driving the increases in Medicare spending.\n  It is not fair to students. Four million college students could see \ntheir costs go up by as much as $4,920. Perhaps as many as half a \nmillion or more children would be denied access to preschool education, \nand two million more elementary and secondary school students would see \ntheir math and reading funding cut.\n  It is not fair to maintain sacred cows like defense, which seem \nimmune from reexamination even though we have won the cold war and the \nSoviet Union is no more.\n  And it is not fair to the American people to propose cutting taxes by \n$170 billion in a budget that shreds the social safety net and \ndecimates needed investments in our future.\n  This budget resolution cannot be fair--and it can not work--because \nit does not accurately portray the Federal budget, and because it does \nnot accurately reflect the interests of the American people. This \nbudget resolution is all about numbers--$256 billion in Medicare cuts, \n$14 billion cut from the EITC, $190 billion cut from welfare, \nnutrition, retirement programs, and other mandatory spending--and on \nand on and on. But the numbers do not add up--and they are not \nguideposts to the future we can count on--because they reflect an \nabstract accountancy approach to the Federal Government, with little or \nno understanding of what the numbers really represent. One number \nrepresents the opportunity for young children to participate in \nHeadstart, so that they can enhance their chances to succeed in school, \nand, therefore, to succeed in life. Another number represents access to \nhealth care. Yet another represents retirement security for older \nAmericans. Yet another protects the ability of family farmers to stay \non their farms. And others are about opening the doors of economic \nopportunity by creating incentives to work and to save.\n  What is behind the numbers are the American people--their lives, \ntheir opportunities, and their hopes for the future. People are not \neconomic abstractions, and we cannot afford any budget that treats \npeople as mere numbers. Instead, we need to think about budgets the way \nAmerican families think about them.\n  When a family decides to cut its budget because they owe the bank or \nthe credit card company or the car dealership, they sit down at the \nkitchen table with a calculator and talk numbers. They also talk about \nwhat is important to them, what their actions will mean for their \nchildren, for their parents, for them when the retire. That family at \nthe kitchen table decides to spend money on some things and not others. \nThey decide to pay off their debts a little more slowly so that they \ncan continue to pay for what is essential to their well-being.\n  They may talk about why it is important to cut spending in the first \nplace, so that everyone in the family understands their situation, and \nwhy they have to act, so they can all agree that it is a priority. They \ntry to have all the facts about how their money is actually spent, so \nthat each person understands where the money is going. They discuss \npriorities, talking about expenses they need to continue to meet, and \nactivities they can afford to cut back. They think and talk about how \nthe proposed changes in family spending will affect each member of the \nfamily. And they budget with the future in mind, so that they can meet \ncritically important long-range goals, like ensuring that the children \nin the family are educated, that there is money for things like braces, \nand that they have the cash they need to make a downpayment on a home. \nThey look at how their choices will affect them and their grandchildren \non down in the future.\n  Establishing family budget priorities often involves some very tough \ndecisions. Families could decide to risk their future to support \nvacations or a new car, or a big-screen TV. The family could stop \npaying medical insurance premiums. The family could take their kid out \nof college. They could even sell their house. The family could decide \nto divest themselves of all of their savings and net worth.\n  But the American family realizes that keeping their daughter in \ncollege is important to her achieving the American Dream. And they want \nto be sure that grandmother has adequate healthcare and that she can \nenjoy her retirement years. They know that not having health care \ncoverage means risking a catastrophe. Having a car to go to work and a \nhouse to live in are also critically important to families. After all, \nwithout a car, there are no jobs to support the family, and without a \nhome, they are out on the street. The American family, therefore, would \nnot make cuts that would endanger their ability to secure what is \nreally important to them, their own piece of the American Dream: Health \ncare, transportation, education, jobs, housing--these are the \nessentials.\n  To deal with the Federal budget, the American family--all of us, \ntogether-- must sit down and decide what is important. What it is we \nneed to save, and what it is that can be cut. As a nation, we must do \nwhat any sensible family would do to get themselves back on their feet \nfinancially. We must come together; we must look at the numbers, and \nmost importantly, we must consider what each of the numbers means for \npeople, and for our individual and collective futures.\n\n\n              I. Impact of Budget Deficit on All Americans\n\n  We all know that the budget deficit has an impact on all Americans. \nThe national debt has quadrupled since 1980, growing from $1 trillion \nto over $4.7 trillion, as it is increasing as a share of our overall \neconomy as well. These debts are crippling our ability to meet \nimportant national priorities, like education. They are jeopardizing \nfuture economic opportunity for our children, and the generations that \nwill follow.\n  The budget deficit put pressure on interest rates. Higher interest \nrates make it more costly for Americans to buy homes and cars, and to \neducate their children. Consider what a change in interest rates can \nmean to the ability of Americans to buy their own homes. If a family \nbuys a house for $100,000 and the interest rate is 9 percent, that \nfamily is paying $9,000 per year in interest alone. If we balance the \nbudget interest rates should fall. If interest rates drop even 1 \npercent, that would put an extra $1,000 in the pockets of the family \nthat bought the house. On the other hand, if we do not act, and \ninterest rates go up, that takes money right out of that family's \npockets--or makes it impossible for them to buy the home at all.\n  Persistent deficits not only affect the costs of homes, it also \ncreates inflation pressure. And inflation disproportionately affects \nmoderate and low-income Americans. Since 1980, for example the average \nprice of a home has tripled in the Midwest. But the incomes of \nIllinoisans did not even double. What that means is that more and more \nIllinoisans--and their counterparts in every other state in the union--\nare being priced out of the American Dream.\n\n\n           II. We Need to Know What We Are Spending Money On\n\n  Americans know that, for all too many of them, the American Dream \nseems to be slipping out of reach. And years of discussions of big \ngovernment have convinced many of them that the Federal Government's \nprofligacy is a big part of the reason why. Seemingly endless debates \non ``pork barrel'', waste, fraud, and abuse, and foreign aid have many \nAmericans convinced that is where the Government spends its money. The \ntruth, however, is that foreign aid is less than 1 percent of the \nbudget, and that appropriated spending, whether ``pork barrel'' or \nessential, is shrinking both as a percentage of the Federal budget and \nas a percentage of the economy. The truth is that the major increases \nin Federal spending are not due to ``pork barreling,'' but to increases \nin what is called entitlement or mandatory spending.\n  By the year 2012, unless appropriate policy changes are made, \nspending for the major entitlement programs--Medicare, Medicaid Social \nSecurity, and [[Page S6903]] Federal retirement, together with interest \non the national debt--will consume every single dollar of Federal \nrevenue.\n  By the year 2002, unless there is change, the Medicare trust fund \nwill go broke, and by the year 2029, Social Security will not be able \nto meet its obligations.\n\n\n               III. Resolution Must be Carefully Crafted\n\n  With problems like this looming in the not too distant future, it is \nclear that we must balance the budget. The thing is, we must keep the \ninterests of all American families in mind when we craft a deficit \nreduction package. How we make the cuts is as important as the numbers \nthat we are cutting.\n\n\n                              IV. Medicare\n\n  The Republican plan seeks a $256 billion cut in Medicare funding. If \nthis cut is implemented, all States will suffer. In Illinois for \nexample, over 1.6 million Illinoisans who are covered by Medicare would \nhave to pay an additional $2,770 over 7 years, and an additional $784 \nin 2002 alone in out-of-pocket expenses. On an overall basis, Illinois \nwould lose $9.3 billion in Medicare funds over the next 7 years, $2.6 \nbillion in 2002 alone. Other States face similar cuts.\n  Now, changes need to be made so that the Medicare trust fund will not \ngo bankrupt by 2002. But the changes should not be made at the expense \nof healthcare access. And changes that do not focus on the real \nMedicare problem--health care inflation--make no sense at all. The \ncosts of obtaining quality health care are on the rise. Cutting the \nMedicare budget by an arbitrarily chosen $256 billion is not the answer \nto this problem. It does nothing to deal with the overall inflation of \nhealth prices or the fact that many more people are becoming eligible \nfor benefits each year.\n  The budget resolution does not really propose anything to reduce \nhealth care inflation. Rather, all it does is raise the cost of health \ncare to older Americans--83 percent of Medicare users have an annual \nincome of under $25,000--or reduce their access to health care. Last \nyear's health care debate was all about improving access to health \ncare. This year's budget resolution is all about decreasing access to \nhealth care. Seniors will have to pay more or go without healthcare. \nThis is not right. We cannot retreat from our commitment to ensuring \nthat elderly Americans have access to high-quality, affordable health \ncare.\n  Cutting Medicare does not only impact on elderly Americans, these \ncuts will have direct impacts on all American families. Families will \nhave to shoulder increasing costs for insuring that their loved ones \nreceive proper care if Medicare does not cover the expenses. Cutting \nMedicare by such a record setting amount is essentially equivalent to a \ntax increase since families will have to pay more for adequate health \ncoverage.\n\n\n                              V. Education\n\n  As we work to ensure that all Americans have access to adequate \nhealth care, we also have to work to ensure that all Americans have \nopportunities to pursue the American Dream. We have an obligation to \nour youth to provide them with the education to attain the American \nDream. The budget resolution, however, seeks to stifle that dream, with \nchanges such as more costly student loans. In Illinois, for example, \nalmost 200,000 students would see their monthly student loan payments \nincrease by 18 percent. If the goal of balancing the budget it to \nreduce the debt burden on future generations, what sense does it make \nto increase the debt burden on future college graduates?\n  In fact in a study cited in Sunday's New York Times, the Census \nBureau for the Federal Department of Education found that increases in \nworkers' education levels produce twice the gain in workplace \nefficiency as comparable increases in the value of tools and machinery. \nThe findings are based on interviews with about 3,000 businesses owners \nand managers. It found that a 8.6 percent increase in productivity \ncould be had from a 10 percent increase in educational attainment. \nThese kinds of statistics demonstrate once again how important \neducation is to our economy's productivity, and overall success. Making \nit more difficult for our children to obtain proper training and \neducation will only hurt our nation in the long-run.\n\n\n                                VI. EITC\n\n  Not only does this budget resolution seek to increase the debt burden \non our future college graduates, it also scales back the earned income \ntax credit for working families. The EITC is a refundable tax credit \nfor working families with low incomes. The goals of the EITC are first, \nto encourage families to move from welfare to work by making work pay \nand second, to reward work for working families so parents who work \nfull-time do not have to raise their children in poverty--and families \nwith modest means do not suffer from eroding incomes. By providing an \noffset against other Federal taxes, the EITC increases disposable \nincome for workers and their families.\n  The EITC has long enjoyed bipartisan support; it has been viewed as a \nnonbureaucratic way to make work pay better than welfare. President \nReagan called the EITC ``The best antipoverty, the best pro-family, the \nbest job creation measure to come out of the Congress.'' So why is it \nbeing cut?\n  The Senate Budget Committee would reduce EITC by $13 billion between \nfiscal years 1996 and 2000 and by $21 billion between fiscal years 1996 \nand 2002. About 7.8 million EITC recipients--nearly half of the EITC \nrecipients with children--would be affected by this proposal. On \naverage their EITC would be cut by $270. Families with two or more \nchildren would be hit hardest by this proposal. In Illinois 500,000 \nworking families' taxes will be essentially increased by $1,520 over \nthe next 7 years due to the EITC cut.\n  Our goal should be to encourage families to move from welfare to \nwork, not the opposite. As the minimum wage has not kept pace with \ninflation, low-income families need all the help they can get to make \nends meet. From every added dollar a low income worker earns, payroll \ntaxes take 15.3 cents while food stamp benefits decline by 24 cents. \nFor a low-wage family with two children, the EITC fully offsets these \neffects by providing a 40-cent credit for every dollar earned.\n  American families are the key to our country's success. It is our \nduty to especially help those families that are working hard yet have \ntrouble making ends meet. By helping them succeed we make them stronger \nand in turn our country stronger.\n\n\n                             VII. Tax Cuts\n\n  If the budget resolution's goal is to reduce the deficit to make our \ncountry stronger, it does not seem fiscally responsible to be \ndiscussing cutting taxes. This is the wrong time for cuts. Right now \nour priority should be deficit reduction. Tax cuts now would only \nhinder our ability to reach a balanced budget. If a family was facing \nfinancial problems, they would not voluntarily give up a part-time job \nor turn down overtime just when they desperately need the extra income. \nProviding a tax cut now just when our country needs to address our \nfinancial problems is the wrong thing to do.\n\n\n                     VIII. Obligation to Our Future\n\n  The budget debate is really about our obligation to the future. We \nneed to open the door of economic opportunity for all Americans. We \nneed to invest now in areas like education on which our future success \nwill ultimately depend, and we have an obligation to be honest.\n  AFDC for example, cost $4 billion in 1970 and served 7.4 million \npeople. In 1993, it cost $22 billion and served 14.1 million people. \nThat sounds like a big increase, does it not? When you adjust for \ninflation, however, benefits are not higher than they were in 1970, \nthey are actually 47 percent lower. So when we talk about reducing the \nrate of growth of Medicare from 10 percent to 7 percent, we must \nacknowledge that the result of that kind of change may mean significant \nincreases in out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries, 83 percent \nof whom have incomes of $25,000 or less. We cannot pretend that is not \nso.\n  We also have an obligation to try to open the door to economic \nopportunity to Americans who are now locked out. It is the right thing \nto do, and it is the smart thing to do. If we can use all of the \ntalents of all of our people, we are all better off. That means we need \nwelfare reform designed to bring welfare recipients into the mainstream \nof our economy, not just welfare reform designed to cut spending in the \nshort run. That means we need job training, and housing, and nutrition \nreforms that [[Page S6904]] make sense, and that we need incentives to \nboost jobs and investment in communities that continue to suffer \nunemployment levels above those last seen nationwide in the Great \nDepression.\n\n\n                IX. Timeframe to Achieve Balanced Budget\n\n  As we go forward, it is worth keeping in mind that there is no magic \nassociated with the idea of balancing the budget in 7 years. We could \nbalance it in 9 or 10 years if we are really committed to change. If we \nare honest and we give up gamesmanship and tell the truth to the \nAmerican people, adding a couple of years to the timeframe will not \nundermine our ability to achieve the objective.\n What is important is maintaining our priorities and not retreating \nfrom our obligations to American families.\n\n\n                             X. Conclusion\n\n  We have to keep in mind that what is at stake is our future. We are \nall in this together. We need to make our decisions together, like an \nAmerican family would. We need to base our decisions on the truth and \nthe fiscal realities that we face. When we sit down at the kitchen \ntable and begin to look at what needs to be done, we need to consider \nour core priorities --education, housing, and quality health care for \nall and we ought to make certain that in any event the balance is \nachieved in the burden sharing, and that the shared sacrifice is fair \nto everyone.\n  We can only make those decisions if we keep in mind our core \npriorities. That is what common sense dictates and that is what I hope \nthis budget debate will give us an opportunity to do.\n  That is what any sensible family would do to get themselves back on \ntheir feet financially. And that is what we need to do.\n  I hope that we can come together in the spirit of bipartisan \ncooperation to do what Americans expect of us. Both parties need to \ntell the truth about what is actually in the budget and what the \nchanges will mean for the American people. We need to use honest \nnumbers and economic assumptions and put everything on the table. \nUnfortunately this budget resolution looks only at the numbers, and not \nat the people. For that reason I can not support it in its current \nform.\n  But we have to always be mindful that in the final analysis these \nabstract numbers and the figures that get thrown around in the millions \nand billions of dollars really have very real realities for very real \npeople. And we will not rest easy if the result of the work of this \nbody is to encourage the pain or to put the burden on small groups of \nAmericans at the expense of to the benefit of everybody else.\n  A balanced budget based on an unbalanced burden is a disservice to \nthe American family.\n  Mr. President, I thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might need.\n  I wish to first thank my friend from Nebraska for his comments on the \nbudget, and also the excellent comments just made by my friend and \ncolleague from the State of Illinois for keeping these things in proper \nperspective, which we are trying to do. I appreciate very much the \nconstructive, thoughtful remarks by my colleague from Illinois and my \ncolleague from Nesbraska. I hope that we can continue to move forward.\n  As I said when I started out the debate this noon, I think possibly \nwe could still work out a bipartisanship approach to this. I certainly \nhope and encourage all to keep an open mind as best we can.\n  I would just like to finish up the first day of debate, which I think \ngenerally has been an informative one, by emphasizing once again the \nvery hard hit that the Medicare cuts proposed in the budget that I \nthink must be alleviated as we have maintained all day long.\n  I would like to read a letter into the record from the Nebraska \nAssociation of Hospitals and Health Systems. This letter was written to \nme by a man that I have known for a long time, Mr. Harlan Heald. Harlan \nis the President of the organization known as the Nebraska Association \nof Hospitals and Health Systems. I think his letter, which is not a \nvery long one, really sets up the major concerns that all of us who \nhave, and rural areas in our States should be particularly concerned \nabout.\n  The letter is dated May 10. It is addressed to me. He said:\n       On behalf of the 94 acute care hospitals in Nebraska, I \n     wish to call your attention to a serious potential problem.\n       Clearly, the United States must work its way out of debt. \n     To do that, Federal spending must be cut. It is my \n     understanding that the Senate Budget Committee Chairman's \n     mark is set at an overall reduction of $1.5 trillion by the \n     year 2002. I further understand that in order to achieve a \n     savings of that magnitude, Medicare is targeted for $256 \n     billion reduction in spending over the same seven-year \n     period.\n       Here's the problem. For fiscal year 1993 (FY '93) (the most \n     current completed year), Nebraska hospitals had a net \n     operating margin of -7.5 percent for care rendered to \n     Medicare recipients. Based upon the Chairman's mark for \n     Medicare spending, in the year 2000 Nebraska hospitals would \n     have a net operating margin of -23 percent for Medicare \n     patients. This figure is expected to improve by the year 2002 \n     to a net operating margin loss of only 14.5 percent, because \n     the reductions are ``front loaded.''\n       Putting this into financial terms, in FY '93 Nebraska \n     hospitals lost $383 per case caring for Medicare patients. \n     Based upon the Chairman's mark, in the year 2000 they would \n     lose on average $1,339 per case and in 2002 they would lose \n     $983 per case caring for Medicare patients. This is all \n     compounded by the fact that Nebraska is a state with a higher \n     proportion of elderly citizens in its population.\n       How can hospitals respond to the cuts of this magnitude? \n     Hospitals are caught in a catch-22. They can: (1) shift more \n     costs to the private sector--this is no longer a viable \n     option in today's managed care environment; (2) slash wages \n     and lay-off employees; (3) cut back on the scope of services \n     provided--all of which threatens the quality of care, will \n     close rural hospitals and restrict access. It is a lose-lose \n     situation for community hospitals. Reimbursement reductions \n     of this magnitude in a state with a disproportionate share of \n     the elderly population, a state in which Medicare patients \n     account for 60 to 70 percent of hospital admissions, clearly \n     threatens the health care system upon which all of us depend.\n       Medicare needs to be fixed. There is an opportunity for \n     Congress to change Medicare, but the change must be driven by \n     sound health care policy, not budgetary or political \n     imperatives. The Senate Budget Committee's proposed Medicare \n     reductions would crush Nebraska hospitals.\n       As always, Nebraska's hospitals look to your leadership.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Nebraska Association of\n\n\n                                 Hospitals and Health Systems,\n\n                                                     May 10, 1995.\n     Hon. J. James Exon,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Exon: On behalf of the 94 acute care hospitals \n     in Nebraska, I wish to call your attention to a serious \n     potential problem.\n       Clearly, the United States must work its way out of debt. \n     To do that, Federal spending must be cut.

The distinguished Senator from Texas I know has \nsome remarks. I know of no other speakers seeking recognition on this \nside. I have been advised likewise by the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this is the end of a long day. It is the end of a very \nimportant day for this country. We have heard so many arguments. The \nnumbers are running in people's heads. They are conflicting. One person \nsays there are cuts. The next person comes in, and says they are not \ncuts, they are just fewer increases. But in fact, it really comes down \nto the basic commonsense arguments that the people of America \nunderstand.\n  The debate today is for the soul of America. It is for the future of \nour children. And what we do over the next 50 hours is going to \ndetermine whether our children and grandchildren in fact will have the \nright to inherit the same kind of America that we have been able to \ngrow up in and for which we have known such great advantages.\n  The House of Representatives tonight has taken the first bold step. \nThey have passed a budget resolution that will balance the budget by \nthe year 2002. The Senate is starting on the road that will have the \nsame result.\n  I was talking to a group of leaders from all over the world today. \nThey really had one basic question. Does America have the guts to \nbalance the budget? Will they really do it? Do they really have the \nguts to set a course over the next 7 years that will be very tough but \nwill make the difference in the economy for our country, and for the \nwhole world? And I said emphatically the answer is yes. We do have the \nguts. We do have the courage. We do have the will. And we will set on \nthe course.\n  Will it be easy? No. But we are going to do it because the people of \nthis country made a statement in November 1994. They asked for courage, \nand we are going to give them the courage that they had in the vote \nthey made last November, and that they deserve from the people they \nelected and put their faith in.\n  We have heard so many statements on this floor that I think we must \ntry to correct, as best we can, some of the misstatements that were \nmade.\n  First of all, it was said that this budget resolution has tax cuts \nfor those making $200,000 a year. Well, the fact of the matter is this \nresolution does not have tax cuts at all. This budget resolution does \nnot speak to tax cuts. But it does have a sense of the Senate that, if \nthere are tax cuts that result from cutting spending, they will be \ntargeted and focused to people making under $100,000.\n There are no tax cuts for the rich in this resolution. That is a \nsmokescreen. That is put out by people who do not want us to pass a \nbalanced budget. Then there was the talk about defense spending. There \nwas ranting about the firewall put up for defense spending so that we \nwould have domestic spending and defense spending. Well, in fact, there \nis a firewall, Mr. President. Thank goodness there is a firewall. \nPeople talk as if, when the cold war was over, the world was a safe \nplace.\n\n  I am on the Armed Services Committee, and I am on the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence. I am scared to death about the proliferation \nof nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons all over the world right \nnow. We have as much danger in the world today as we did when Russia \nwas at the height of its strength.\n  It is a different kind of problem. It is a different kind of terror \nwe are seeing in the world today, but nevertheless the greatest \nsuperpower in the world is not going to let down.\n  We are going to have to understand what happens when sarin gas is let \nout in a subway killing people before our very eyes, and when you can \nmake bombs from fertilizer and fuel oil, and we see the loss of over \n100 lives in our own country, and when we see the capability to produce \nmissiles that could take these gases, the biological and chemical \nweapons and the nuclear weapons anywhere in the world. You bet we have \na firewall in this budget resolution. Thank goodness we do for the \ndefense spending, because I think the defense cuts are too much in this \nresolution, and I hope we can fix it because I wish to be on the \nleading edge of technology.\n  When our young men and women give their lives to protect our freedom \nin our armed services, you bet I want them to have the tanks and the \nfighters and the bombers they need to make sure that they do it as \nsafely as possible for themselves and with the strength they need to \nprotect us.\n  So, yes, there is a firewall. Thank goodness there is. And I hope \nthat we can correct even right now in this budget resolution what, I \nthink, is a woefully inadequate amount for defense. But we are not \ngoing to pass a resolution saying we increase defense spending without \nlooking at the priorities and saying where is it going to come from and \nmaking those priority judgments. That is what we are here to do.\n  Does this resolution cut school lunch? No, it does not cut school \nlunches at all. That is an absolute smokescreen.\n  Does it cut the earned income tax credit? No. In fact, the earned \nincome tax credit will remain. That is a good program. It is a program \nfor the working poor. For someone making $20,000 or $18,000 a year, \nthat has one or two children, they do get a tax rebate in this budget \nresolution just as they do today, and in fact that amount increases by \nthe year 2002 because we want to encourage people who are helping \nthemselves. So there is no cut in the earned income tax credit. There \nare only increases. It is important that we set the record straight on \nthat.\n  Now, it has been said that Medicare is going to be cut. Once again, \nMr. President, that is not true. Medicare spending will increase 7 \npercent a year in this budget. Does that mean Medicare is going to be \nthe same as it has always been? I hope not. I hope we can get \nefficiencies that make Medicare more cost conscience because it has \nbeen increasing at a much greater rate than 7 percent per year.\n  We are not cutting Medicare. We are going to try to put some \ninnovative solutions in Medicare so that our seniors who need Medicare \nwill have it available, and they will have other options, and there \nwill be incentives for them to save money, incentives that they will \nearn for themselves and for the taxpayers of America. We are going to \nhave some innovative solutions, but we are not going to cut Medicare. \nWe are going to try to save Medicare. That is going to be one of the \nkey missions of this budget resolution, to save Medicare, so that when \nour future generations grow old it will be there for them.\n  The President's own cabinet officers who sit on the Medicare trust \nfund board have said it is going bankrupt, and it will be bankrupt by \nthe year 2002 if we do not take steps right now to save it. And that is \none of the key purposes of this budget resolution.\n  Now, it has been said that the space station has not been cut. I wish \nit had not been cut, because I do think the space station is one of the \ntechnologies that is going to provide jobs for our future, but it is \ncut. It takes its fair share. It is cut $3.5 billion over the next 5 \nyears. It is taking its fair share of cuts. It is going to be more \nefficient, just like everything else in Government, and hopefully we \nwill have a space station that will provide the new technologies and \nthe new industries and the new jobs for our future. But everything is \ngoing to have to be more efficient, and it is going to have to meet a \nnumber of tests to make sure that it is right for the taxpayers and for \nour future generations.\n  There is a test that I have, and I am going to use it on everything \nthat we vote on when we come to appropriations bills in the next few \nmonths. It is going to be the $100 test. If you take $100 and you put \nit on the kitchen table [[Page S6906]] and you say, now, would you like \nto have this wonderful program that is going to cost $100 for your \nfamily? Most people would probably say, yes, I would like to do good \nthings. Sure, I would like to have that program. But if the choice is \nfor you to keep the $100 on your kitchen table and spend that money for \nwhat you want to spend it for for your family, what is going to be your \nchoice? Are you going to send the $100 to Washington to spend on a \nprogram that sounds very good or are you going to want to keep that \n$100 to make the decisions for your family yourself. We are going to \ntry to keep that $100 on the table for your family, so that you can \ndecide what your priorities are rather than letting someone in \nWashington, DC, you have never met make those decisions for you.\n  Two economists developed a model for the future called generational \naccounting. This model calculates how much short-term budget policies \nwill cost future generations. It looks beyond 5-year budget projections \nand was developed from the help of the President's Office of Management \nand Budget.\n  These two prominent economists have produced some shocking forecasts. \nOn the day a child is born, that child owes $19,000 in Federal debt. \nWhen that child's sibling is born in 4 years, the baby brother or \nsister will be $24,000 in debt. There will be fewer jobs available for \nthat child. And when it comes time to take out a personal loan to buy a \nnew car or to own a home, our children that are being born today will \nfind that Federal deficits have driven the interest rates up 2 percent. \nBut borrowing money for a home will be just a dream for those children. \nIf we continue at the rate we are going right now, what we are really \ngoing to give our children is not the ability to buy a home at all. \nThey will not be able to buy a home because their tax rate will be 82 \npercent--82 percent is what we will be giving to our children and \ngrandchildren if we do not take steps right now to correct the runaway \nspending that this Congress has had for the last 40 years.\n  And yet, this administration has refused to abandon the practices of \nCongresses for the last 40 years. In fact, this administration has \ndealt itself out of this debate. The President submitted a budget but \nit does not balance. It does not balance in the year 2000 or the year \n2002. The President abdicated that responsibility and has left it to \nCongress.\n  Now we are going to get a chance to vote on the President's budget \nthat does not balance. In fact, the President's press secretary said on \nTuesday that that will be a good place for us to begin.\n  In fact, Senator Domenici has decided that that is indeed a good \nplace to begin. So, when I finish my remarks, on behalf of Senator \nDomenici, I am going to submit the President's budget. That will be the \nfirst vote of this budget debate and we will get a chance to see if \npeople want to vote for a budget that may have fewer decreases than \nincreases, but does not balance at the end. We will see who is willing \nto cross the line that will be drawn in the sand to say, we will take \nthe responsible course for this country and we will do what the people \nasked us to do last November.\n  In fact, we are in the toughest debate that we may ever have. No one, \nprobably even Senator Domenici, agrees with everything in this budget \nresolution. I do not agree with everything in it. Not one person in \nthis country probably agrees 100 percent with everything in it. \nBecause, you know, Senator Domenici compromised. He tried to work with \npeople and their priorities. He may not have liked everything that is \nin this resolution even though he is the prime author of the \nresolution. But we are going to rise above our small differences. We \nare going to try to set the priorities. We are going to have \namendments.\n  We may vote for some of those amendments, but in the end, Mr. \nPresident, the people who are doing what is responsible for this \ncountry are going to vote a balanced budget out of the Senate just as \nthey have done in the House today. And we are going to make history. We \nare going to begin to turn the ship of state that started going in the \nwrong direction in the 1930's when we started building up spending and \nbig Government until in 1994 the people said, ``I know I'm going to \nhave to sacrifice. I'm ready.'' The people of this country said that. \nThey understood what they were doing.\n  And when I go home, people say to me, ``You hang tough. Don't back \ndown now.''\n  This is our chance to save our country. And if we miss it, the people \nof America know that we will not have this chance again maybe ever but \ncertainly not in the near future.\n  There is a new spirit in this country. The spirit of the Americans \nwho went to the polls in 1994 and caused a revolution in the way that \nour Founding Fathers provided them to have a revolution. And that was \nthe ballot box. The people had a revolution and they took their \nGovernment back. They have experienced the right of democracy. And now \nthe people of America have said, ``We want you to do what is right. We \nunderstand that it will be tough. We understand that we will have to \nsacrifice. But we are ready. We are ready to do what is right for our \nchildren and our grandchildren.''\n  Mr. President, it is time for us to look to the future, not to the \nnext election.\n  If we do what is right, everything else will take care of itself and \nwe will create the jobs and the future for our children and that is \nwhat we are going to do.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1111\n\n              (Purpose: To propose the President's budget)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Domenici, I send \nto the desk the President's budget and ask that the President's budget \nbe put on the table for consideration beginning tomorrow morning on \nFriday so that we will be able to have our first vote on the \nPresident's budget and we will see who wants to balance the budget and \nwho is willing to take the steps that are necessary to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This report is submitted pursuant to section \n204(c) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. \n1703(c), and section 505(c) of the International Security and \nDevelopment Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9(c). This report \ncovers events through April 18, 1995. It discusses only \n[[Page S6907]] matters concerning the national emergency with respect \nto Iran that was declared in Executive Order No. 12170 and matters \nrelating to Executive Order No. 12613. Matters relating to the March \n15, 1995, Executive Order regarding a ban on investment in the \npetroleum sector, and the May 6, 1995, Executive Order regarding new \ntrade sanctions, will be covered in separate reports. My last report, \ndated November 18, 1994, covered events through October 18, 1994.\n  1. There have been no amendments to the Iranian Transactions \nRegulations, 31 CFR Part 560, or to the Iranian Assets Control \nRegulations, 31 CFR Part 535, since the last report.\n  2. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (``OFAC'') of the Department \nof the Treasury continues to process applications for import licenses \nunder the Iranian Transactions Regulations. However, a substantial \nmajority of such applications are determined to be ineligible for \nlicensing and, consequently, are denied.\n  During the reporting period, the U.S. Customs Service has continued \nto effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin merchandise, primarily \ncarpets, for violation of the import prohibitions of the Iranian \nTransactions Regulations. OFAC and Customs Service investigations of \nthese violations have resulted in forfeiture actions and the imposition \nof civil monetary penalties. Additional forfeiture and civil penalty \nactions are under review.\n  3. The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the ``Tribunal''), \nestablished at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers Accords, continues to \nmake progress in arbitrating the claims before it. However, since my \nlast report, the Tribunal has not rendered any awards although payments \nwere received by claimants in late November for awards rendered during \nthe prior reporting period. Thus, the total number of awards remains at \n557. Of this total, 373 have been awards in favor of American \nclaimants. Two hundred twenty-five (225) of these were awards on agreed \nterms, authorizing and approving payment of settlements negotiated by \nthe parties, and 150 were decisions adjudicated on the merits. The \nTribunal has issued 38 decisions dismissing claims on the merits and 85 \ndecisions dismissing claims for jurisdictional reasons. Of the 59 \nremaining awards, three approved the withdrawal of cases and 56 were in \nfavor of Iranian claimants. As of April 18, 1995, the Federal Reserve \nBank of New York reported that the value of awards to successful \nAmerican claimants from the Security Account held by the NV Settlement \nBank stood at $2,365,160,410.39.\n  Iran has not replenished the Security Account since October 8, 1992, \nand the Account has remained continuously below the balance of $500 \nmillion required by the Algiers Accords since November 5, 1992. As of \nApril 10, 1995, the total amount in the Security Account was \n$191,219,759.23, and the total amount in the Interest Account was \n$24,959,218.79.\n  The United States continues to pursue Case A/28, filed in September \n1993, to require Iran to meet its obligations under the Algiers Accords \nto replenish the Security Account. Iran has yet to file its Statement \nof Defense in that case.\n  4. The Department of State continues to present United States \nGovernment claims against Iran, in coordination with concerned \ngovernment agencies, and to respond to claims brought against the \nUnited States by Iran.\n  On April 18, 1995, the United States filed the first of two parts of \nits consolidated submission on the merits in Case B/61. Case B/61 \ninvolves a claim by Iran for compensation with respect to primarily \nmilitary equipment that Iran alleges it did not receive. The equipment \nwas purchased pursuant to commercial contracts with more than 50 \nprivate American companies. Iran alleges that it suffered direct losses \nand consequential damages in excess of $2 billion in total because of \nthe U.S. Government's refusal to allow the export of the equipment \nafter January 19, 1981, in alleged contravention of the Algiers \nAccords. As directed by the Tribunal, the United States' submission \naddresses Iran's claims regarding both liability and compensation and \ndamages.\n  5. The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (``FSCS'') on February \n24, 1995, successfully completed its case-by-case review of the more \nthan 3,000 so-called ``small claims'' against Iran arising out of the \n1979 Islamic revolution. These ``small claims'' (of $250,000 or less \neach) were originally filed before the Iran-United States Claims \nTribunal, but were transferred to the FCSC pursuant to the May 13, 1990 \nSettlement Agreement between Iran and the United States.\n  The FCSC issued decisions on 3,066 claims for total awards of \n$86,555,795. Of that amount, $41,570,936 represented awards of \nprincipal and $44,984,859 represented awards of interest. Although \noriginally only $50 million were available to pay these awards, the \nfunds earned approximately $9 million in interest over time, for a \ntotal settlement fund of more than $59 million. Thus, all awardees will \nreceive full payment on the principal amounts of their awards, with \ninterest awards paid on a pro rata basis.\n  The FCSC's awards to individuals and corporations covered claims for \nboth real and personal property seized by Iran. In addition, many \nclaims arose out of commercial transactions, including contracts for \nthe sale of goods and contracts for the supply of services such as \nteaching, medical treatment, data processing, and shipping. The FCSC is \nnow working with the Department of the Treasury to facilitate final \npayment on all FCSC awards.\n  6. The situation reviewed above continues to implicate important \ndiplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the United States and its \nnationals and presents an unusual challenge to the national security \nand foreign policy of the United States. The Iranian Assets Control \nRegulations issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12170 continue to \nplay an important role in structuring our relationship with Iran and in \nenabling the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords. \nSimilarly, the Iranian Transactions Regulations issued pursuant to \nExecutive Order No. 12613 continue to advance important objectives in \ncombating international terrorism. I shall continue to exercise the \npowers at my disposal to deal with these problems and will continue to \nreport periodically to the Congress on significant developments.\n                                                  William J.

The new \nExecutive order also expanded certain existing authorities in order to \nstrengthen the U.S. ability to respond to proliferation problems.\n  The following report is made pursuant to section 204 of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act and section 401(c) of the \nNational Emergencies Act regarding activities taken and money spent \npursuant to the emergency declaration. Additional information on \nnuclear, missile, and/or chemical and biological weapons (CBW) \nnonproliferation efforts is contained in the annual report on the \nproliferation of missiles and essential components of nuclear, \nbiological, and chemical weapons, provided to the Congress pursuant to \nsection 1097 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years \n1992 and 1993 (Public Law 102-190), also [[Page S6908]] known as the \n``Nonproliferation Report,'' and the annual report provided to the \nCongress pursuant to section 308 of the Chemical and Biological Weapons \nControl and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-182).\n  The three export control regulations issued under the Enhanced \nProliferation Control Initiative (EPCI) are fully in\n force and continue to be used to control the export of items with \npotential use in chemical or biological weapons or unmanned delivery \nsystems for weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  In the 6 months since I issued Executive Order No. 12938, the number \nof countries that have ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) \nhas reached 27 (out of 159 signatory countries). I am urging the Senate \nto give its advice and consent to ratification as soon as possible. The \nCWC is a critical element of U.S. nonproliferation policy that will \nsignificantly enhance our security and that of our friends and allies. \nI believe that U.S. ratification will help to encourage the \nratification process in other countries and, ultimately, the CWC's \nentry into force.\n  The United States actively participates in the CWC Preparatory \nCommission in The Hague, the deliberative body drafting administrative \nand implementing procedures for the CWC. Last month, this body accepted \nthe U.S. offer of an information management system for the future \nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that will \nimplement the CWC. The United States also is playing a leading role in \ndeveloping a training program for international inspectors.\n  The United States strongly supports international efforts to \nstrengthen the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC). In \nJanuary 1995, the Ad Hoc Group mandated by the September 1994 BWC \nSpecial Conference to draft a legally binding instrument to strengthen \nthe effectiveness and improve the implementation of the BWC held its \nfirst meeting. The Group agreed on a program of work and schedule of \nsubstantive meetings, the first of which will occur in July 1995. The \nUnited States is pressing for completion of the Ad Hoc Group's work and \nconsideration of the legally binding instrument by the next BWC Review \nConference in 1996.\n  The United States maintained its active participation in the 29-\nmember Australia Group (AG), which now includes the Czech Republic, \nPoland, Slovakia, and Romania. The AG reaffirmed\n in December the members' collective belief that full adherence to the \nCWC and the BWC provides the only means to achieve a permanent global \nban on CBW, and that all states adhering to these Conventions have an \nobligation to ensure that their national activities support these \ngoals.\n\n  The AG also reiterated its conviction that harmonized AG export \nlicensing measures are consistent with, and indeed actively support, \nthe requirement under Article I of the CWC that States Parties never \nassist, in any way, the manufacture of chemical weapons. These measures \nalso are consistent with the undertaking in Article XI of the CWC to \nfacilitate the fullest possible exchange of chemical materials and \nrelated information for purposes not prohibited by the Convention, as \nthey focus solely on preventing assistance to activities banned under \nthe CWC. Similarly, such efforts also support existing nonproliferation \nobligations under the BWC.\n  The United States Government determined that three foreign nationals \n(Luciano Moscatelli, Manfred Felber, and Gerhard Merz) had engaged in \nchemical weapons proliferation activities that required the imposition \nof sanctions against them, effective on November 19, 1994. Similar \ndeterminations were made against three foreign companies (Asian Ways \nLimited, Mainway International, and Worldco) effective on February 18, \n1995, and imposed sanctions against them. Additional information on \nthese determinations is contained in a classified report to the \nCongress, provided pursuant to the Chemical and Biological Weapons \nControl and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991. The United States \nGovernment continues to monitor closely activities that may be subject \nto CBW sanctions provisions.\n  The United States continued to control vigilantly U.S. exports that \ncould made a contribution to unmanned delivery systems for weapons of \nmass destruction, exercising restraint in considering all such \ntransfers consistent with the Guidelines of the Missile Technology \nControl Regime (MTCR). The MTCR Partners\n shared information not only with each other but with other possible \nsupplier, consumer, and transshipment states about proliferation \nproblems and also stressed the importance of implementing effective \nexport control systems.\n\n  The United States initiated unilateral efforts and coordinated with \nMTCR Partners in multilateral efforts, aimed at combatting missile \nproliferation by nonmembers and at encouraging nonmembers to adopt \nresponsible export behavior and to adhere to the MTCR Guidelines. On \nOctober 4, 1994, the United States and China signed a Joint Statement \non Missile Nonproliferation in which China reiterated its 1992 \ncommitment to the MTCR Guidelines and agreed to ban the export of \nground-to-ground MTCR-class missiles. In 1995, the United States met \nbilaterally with Ukraine in January, and with Russia in April, to \ndiscuss missile nonproliferation and the implementation of the MTCR \nGuidelines. In May 1995, the United States will participate with other \nMTCR Partners in a regime approach to Ukraine to discuss missile \nnonproliferation and to share information about the MTCR.\n  The United States actively encouraged its MTCR Partners and fellow AG \nparticipants to adopt ``catch-all'' provisions, similar to that of the \nUnited States and EPCI, for items not subject to specific export \ncontrols. Austria, Germany, Norway, and the United Kingdom actually \nhave such provisions in place. The European Union (EU) issued a \ndirective in 1994 calling on member countries to adopt ``catch-all'' \ncontrols. These controls will be implemented July 1, 1995. In line with \nthis harmonization move, several countries, including European States \nthat are not actually members of the EU, have adopted or are \nconsidering putting similar provisions in place.\n  The United States has continued to pursue this Administration's \nnuclear nonproliferation goals. More than 170 nations joined in the \nindefinite, unconditional extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty (NPT) on May 11, 1995. This historic decision strengthens the \nsecurity of all countries, nuclear weapons states and nonweapons states \nalike.\n  South Africa joined the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), increasing NSG \nmembership to 31 countries.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of the Native American history and culture; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n[[Page S6913]]\n\n           THE BUFFALO NICKEL COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this morning I take great personal \npleasure in introducing the Buffalo Nickel Commemorative Coin Act of \n1995.\n  Those of us with more than a little gray hair will remember this \nunique piece of history, with the Indian head design on one side and \nthe buffalo design on the reverse side.\n  This coin was in general circulation from 1913 to 1938, which is a \nvery short timeframe, only 25 years, but it is still one of the most \nrecognizable coins in American history.\n  Now, nearly 60 years after the mint ceased production of the Indian \nhead nickel, I would like this generation of Americans to reacquaint \nthemselves to this unique piece of American heritage.\n  It is also an opportunity to raise some extra needed revenue for the \nNational Park System. For these reasons, Senator Cochran, who has \ncosponsored this legislation with me, and I propose a limited edition \ncommemorative Indian head nickel.\n  The artist who designed the coin over 80 years ago is James Earle \nFraser. He wanted to produce a coin that was truly American, according \nto his original writings, that cannot be confused with the currency of \nany other country. There is no more significant motif, I suppose, than \nthe American bison, the only animal in this country not found in any \nother place in the world.\n  Mr. Fraser himself was a famous artist, having done many works of \nart, including ``End of the Trail,'' which is now in the Cowboy Hall of \nFame in Oklahoma City.\n  The Indian head motif has always been accepted as an impression of \nliberty in this country. The American bison was certainly an important \npart of our history.\n  Mr. Fraser himself said:\n       In designing the buffalo nickel, my first object was to \n     produce a coin which was truly American, and that could not \n     be confused with the currency of any other country. I made \n     sure, therefore, to use none of the attributes that other \n     nations had used in the past. And, in my search for symbols, \n     I found no motif within the boundaries of the United States \n     so distinctive as the American buffalo or bison.\n\n  According to historical sources, the Indian head on the nickel was \ncreated by Fraser based on three models: Iron Tail, an Olala Sioux; Two \nMoons, a northern Cheyenne, a greater leader of the tribe, of which I \nam an enrolled member; Big Tree, a Seneca Iroquois, which is part of \nthe Iroquois Confederation.\n  Supposedly the three Indians were all performers appearing in wild-\nwest shows in New York City at the time they posed for Mr. Fraser.\n  Most historians generally accept that the model for the buffalo on \nthe nickel was a famous bull bison in the Central Park Zoo. The name of \nthe bull was Black Diamond. Unfortunately, after being immortalized on \nthe coin, he was slaughtered for meat and hide in 1915, which was the \nsame demise many of his wild brethren met on the plains.\n  These coins would serve another purpose, appropriate to their \nheritage: Profits from their sale would be earmarked for the \nmaintenance and improvement of our national parks, which are virtually \nbeing ``loved to death'' by far too many people coming to them now.\n  This is not meant, by the way, to replace any of the appropriated \nmoney that now goes to parks. It was meant that the profit would \nsupplement the amount of money they now receive from the appropriations \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, we are working closely with the Citizens Commemorative \nCoin Advisory Committee and the U.S. Treasury to make this \ncommemorative coin a success. Last year, the committee recommended the \nconsideration of a Native American theme for a commemorative coin. I \nthink that the buffalo nickel fits that theme perfectly.\n  I wish I could take credit for having this idea, which I think is a \ngood idea, but I cannot. It was originally suggested to me by a man by \nthe name of Mitchell Simon, who contacted my office and suggested it. \nFormer U.S. Senator Tim Wirth from Colorado also sent me a note saying \nhe thought it was a good idea. And since that time we received a pile \nof postcards from people all over the country saying they thought \nreissuing the buffalo nickel would be well received.\n  Mr. President, I welcome my colleagues to join me in reintroducing \nthis coin act, a coin with deep historical and cultural significance to \nthis Nation. I would especially like to thank my colleagues, Senators \nCochran, Hatch, Mack, DeWine, and McCain who joins me as original \ncosponsor.\n      By Mr. KERREY (for himself and Mr. Simpson):\n  S. 818.

A bill to provide for the long-range solvency of the old-age, \nsurvivors, and disability insurance program, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           social security and retirement reform legislation\n\n Mr. SIMPSON.\n Mr. President, I join my able and steady colleague Senator Bob Kerrey \nfrom Nebraska in introducing a series of proposals we have crafted in \nan effort to address the long-term problems of Social Security.\n\n  I emphasize that our goal is to ``save'' this program--not, as some \nof the senior citizen and other groups will claim, to ``savage'' it. We \nare well aware that it is politically hazardous to even breathe a word \nabout reforming Social Security. But we also believe the people of this \ncountry will be receptive to what we have to say. They know that they, \nor their loved ones, will most surely suffer over the long haul if we \ncontinue to cling blindly to the ``status quo.'' I believe they will \nembrace ``change'' when they are presented with the honest facts and \nthe harsh reality of what the future holds for them if we continue on \nour present course.\n  Before I outline the details of our bills, let me briefly review why \nwe feel compelled to address this issue. Last year, I served on the \nBipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, which was guided \nthrough the deep swamps of entitlement spending by two remarkable and \ncourageous men--Senator Bob Kerrey, who served as our able chairman, \nand our former colleague Senator Jack Danforth, who served as vice \nchairman.\n  From June through December, the Commission held a series of public \nmeetings in which we looked for any [[Page S6914]] and all ways to slow \ndown the incredible pace at which entitlement spending is growing. \nAlong the way, the Commission approved--by a vote of 30 to 1--an \ninterim report which spelled out some highly sobering truths about \nFederal spending. Perhaps the single most important finding in the \ninterim report was that entitlement spending and interest on the debt \ntogether accounted for almost 62 percent of all Federal expenditures in \n1993. Furthermore, according to the Congressional Budget Office, this \nspending will consume fully 72 percent of the Federal budget by he year \n2003 if the present trends continue. These are expenditures that occur \nautomatically without Members of Congress casting so much as a single \nvote. This ought to serve as a ``wake-up call'' to all of us that we \nare headed on a course to disaster.\n  Unfortunately, the Commission concluded its business in December \nwithout reaching an agreement on specific recommendations for bringing \nentitlement spending under control.\n  That was most disappointing to me. However, 24 of the Commission's 32 \nmembers joined in writing a letter to President Clinton, emphasizing \nthe need for ``immediate action'' and outlining various policy \noptions--some of which Senator Kerrey and I have included in the bills \nwe introduce today.\n  On April 3 of this year, another clanging ``wake-up call'' rang from \nthe Social Security and Medicare board of trustees. The trustees \ninformed Congress and the American people in their annual report that--\naccording to their best projections--the Social Security retirement \ntrust fund will be exhausted in 2031, the disability trust fund will \nrun out in 2016, and the Medicare trust fund will be depleted, that is, \nbroke, in 2002.\n  These dates will be upon us sooner than one can imagine. The \n``doomsday'' date for Medicare is only 7 short years away. The \nsituation with Social Security may seem less urgent, but we must not be \nlured into complacency. Although the ``doomsday'' dates are currently \nset at 2031 and 2016 for the retirement and disability programs, the \ntrustees' report also indicates that combined expenditures for the two \nprograms will begin to exceed revenues in the year 2013. From 2013 to \n2019, it will be necessary to ``dip into'' the interest income that is \nearned on the principal in order to pay out benefits. And then, \nbeginning in the year 2020, we will have to ``dip into'' the principal \nitself just to keep the benefits flowing.\n  Because this is such a crucial point that every American must \nrealize, I will repeat it again--to continue paying Social Security \nbenefits, we will have to dip into--that is, spend--the trust fund's \nprincipal and interest beginning in 2013. We will be running a negative \ncash flow beginning in 2013. What this means is that come 2013, the \nGovernment will have several options: borrow money from the Treasury \nand drive up the deficit; raise payroll taxes on current workers; or \nreduce benefits to retirees.\n  These figures are not based on hysteria or fiction. They are cold, \nhard, clear, painful facts. No one can refute them--but we can take \naction to change our course and prevent these forecasts from coming \ntrue. That is why Senator Kerrey and I are here today. We are \nintroducing seven separate bills that taken together will shore up \nSocial Security.\n  We are also introducing a package of bills, some of which duplicate \nthe separate bills. This package will also solve Social Security's \nlong-term solvency crisis. We've shored up Social Security in two ways \nto show our colleagues that there are a variety of ways to do it.\n  Our first bill deals with the Social Security retirement age. Many \nAmericans may not know this, but current law already provides that the \nnormal retirement age--the age at which full benefits can be received--\nwill begin to slowly increase in the year 2000 for people who were born \nafter 1937, and it will continue to gradually increase until it reaches \nage 67 for those who were born after 1959. This law is already ``on the \nbooks.''\n  Senator Kerrey and I are proposing that the increases which are \nalready scheduled be gradually accelerated. Our bill proposes that the \nnormal retirement age begin to increase, beginning in the year 2000, so \nit reaches 66 in the year 2005, 67 in the year 2011, 68 in the year \n2017, 69 in the year 2023, and 70 in the year 2029.\n  We also gradually increase the early retirement age to 65 by 2017 \nbeginning in the year 2000. The early retirement age would reach 63 in \nthe year 2005, 64 in the year 2011 and 65 in the year 2017.\n  I want to emphasize that the first group of people subject to the \nretirement age of 70 are those who are presently in their early 30's. \nCurrent retirees are not affected at all by this proposal. Thus, no one \ncan let out a howl that we are calling for sweeping changes ``at the \nlast minute,'' without giving people a chance to adjust their \nretirement plans. That is not what we are up to.\n  I also think it is useful to review the extent to which life \nexpectancies have increased in the last 50 years. In 1940, the average \nlife expectancy in the United States was 61.4 years for a male and 65.7 \nyears for a female, yet the retirement age was 65. Today, the average \nlife expectancy is about 72 years for men and 79 years for women. \nAccording to the Social Security Administration, more than 75 percent \nof the people who were born 65 years ago are still alive today. These \nindividuals, once they have reached the age of 65, can expect to live \nanother 15 years if they are men and another 19 years if they are \nwomen.\n  The authors of the original Social Security Act of 1935 had no way of \nknowing ``back then'' that today's retirees would be living for so \nlong. Had they known then what we know now, I believe they would have \nagreed that a higher retirement age would be appropriate in the 21st \ncentury.\n  Our second bill would allow taxpayers to reduce their Social Security \npayroll tax payments by 2 percentage points and direct this money into \na personal investment plan [PIP] of their own choice. Workers who \nchoose this option would have their future benefits reduced by a \ncorresponding amount, but this reduction would be offset with earnings \nfrom their personal investment plan. The question of whether lost \nbenefits would be partially, completely or more than offset by these \nearnings would depend upon the decisions each individual makes with \nrespect to his or her private investment plan.\n  I often hear from constituents who insist that if they were allowed \nto invest their Social Security taxes themselves, they could earn a \nmuch higher rate of return than the 8 percent return U.S. Treasury \nsecurities yielded last year. This bill gives them a chance to do just \nthat. Some taxpayers will prove that, indeed, they can do better \ninvesting these funds on their own. Others may learn the hard way that \nprivate sector investments always carry a certain element of risk. \nEither way, I believe it is important to give people more control over \ndecisions relating to their retirement.\n  Our third bill is guaranteed to bring howls of glee from the \nhinterlands. It calls for reductions in the pensions of Members of \nCongress and certain Federal employees. These reductions are achieved \nthrough three separate provisions.\n  First, the accrual rates used to calculate pensions would be reduced \nby one-tenth of 1 percent for future years of service. This means that \nthe pension of a typical Federal employee--whose accrual rate would go \nfrom 1.0 to 0.9--would be reduced by up to 10 percent.\n  Second, the accrual rates used to calculate congressional pensions \nwould be made equal to those used to calculate the pensions of typical \nFederal employees. Thus, a Member of Congress would have his or her \npension calculated on the basis of a 0.9-percent accrual rate for \nfuture years of congressional service instead of a 1.7-percent accrual \nrate, thereby reducing his or her pension by as much as 47 percent.\n  Third, our bill would require that the pensions of certain Federal \nemployees, including Members of Congress, be based on their five \nhighest salary years--instead of their three highest salary years.\n  These provisions demonstrate in the most vivid manner possible that \nwe, as elected officials, are willing to make sacrifices ourselves. \nThis is something we must do to show the American people that we are \nserious about getting our fiscal house in order. We all understand that \nreducing our own pensions won't make a dent in the deficit, but \n[[Page S6915]] the symbolism of this gesture is absolutely crucial to \nour success in other areas.\n  Our fourth bill deals with the retirement benefits that are received \nby individuals who joined the military after July 31, 1986 and \ntherefore aren't able to retire until the middle of\n 2006. We propose that the accrual rates used to calculate their \npensions on be limited to 2 percent per year, regardless of how many \nyears of service an individual may have. Currently, the accrual rate is \n2 percent for each of the first 20 years and 3.5 percent for the 21st \nthrough 30th years of military service. This is an extraordinarily \ngenerous system by any standard.\n  I am fully prepared for the cries of outrage this will bring from \nsome of the many men and women who serve with honor and distinction in \nthe military. I served in the military too, as did Bob Kerrey who won \nthe Medal of Honor for his bravery. We would never do anything to \ndiminish the importance or value of their service. But it is hard to \njustify an accrual rate of 3.5 percent for military retirees when civil \nservice Federal employees have an accrual rate of 1.0 percent and we \nare talking about bringing that down to 0.9 percent. I believe the \nchanges Senator Kerrey and I propose are appropriate in the context of \nwhat we are doing with congressional and civil service pensions.\n  Our fifth bill would change the manner in which cost of living \nadjustments [COLA's] are awarded. We propose that limits be placed on \nthe COLA's of all Social Security beneficiaries and Federal and \nmilitary retirees--except the 30 percent who receive the smallest COLA \nin each program.\n  Under this approach, the ``poorest'' 30 percent of recipients would \ncontinue to receive their full COLA's. The other 70 percent would also \nreceive a COLA each year, but they would receive a COLA that is \nequivalent only to the actual dollar amount of the COLA that is \nreceived by recipients who are down there at the 30-percent level.\n  One important point I want to emphasize with respect to Social \nSecurity is that--since COLA's did not begin until the early 1970's and \nthus were not even included in the original Social Security Act of \n1935--this proposal would not in any way ``break'' or alter the \n``contract'' that is considered to exist between senior citizens and \nSocial Security.\n  It is also important to note that this approach does not discourage \npeople from saving for their retirement. It does not in any way \npenalize seniors who have personal savings or other sources of income. \nThe amount of one's benefit is the sole determinant of whether or not a \nretiree is subject to the COLA cap. There are no other factors \ninvolved.\n  Our sixth bill focuses on the Consumer Price Index [CPI], which is \nused to calculate cost-of-living adjustments [COLA's] for Social \nSecurity beneficiaries and for military and Federal retirees. Alan \nGreenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and other very credible \nwitnesses have testified before the Senate Finance Committee that the \nCPI, as currently calculated, ``overstates'' actual inflation by as \nmuch as one or two percentage points. This may seem like an almost \nbenign or inconsequential fact, but when you consider that hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in Federal payments are increased each year on the \nbasis of the CPI alone--and, furthermore, that the Federal income tax \nbrackets are also adjusted annually according to the CPI--it becomes \nvery clear that this is not a small matter.\n  Senator Kerrey and I are proposing today that the annual CPI \ncalculation be automatically reduced by one-half of a percentage point. \nAccording to the experts who testified before the Senate Finance \nCommittee, this is a conservative estimate of how much the CPI is \noverstated. We also call for the creation of a seven-member commission \nthat would be charged with studying the accuracy of the CPI and \nreporting its findings to the Secretary of Labor and Congress within 1 \nyear. It is our sincere desire that this process would eventually lead \nto a more accurate measure of inflation, thus eliminating the need for \nan automatic reduction each year.\n  The seventh and final bill which Senator Kerrey and I introduce today \nis one that all 100 senators should be able to agree on. We propose \nthat the Congressional Budget Office and the OMB be required to use a \n30-year ``budget window'' instead of a five-year ``budget window'' in \nevaluating any legislation that affects entitlement spending. This is a \nmatter of common sense. By definition, entitlement programs go on \nforever unless Congress takes specific action to stop them. To say that \nwe will look only at the first 5 years of such programs is now \nunacceptable. It is absolutely essential that we begin to view these \nprograms from a longer-term perspective.\n  These seven bills represent the best efforts of my friend Senator \nKerrey and myself to protect and preserve these retirement programs for \nmany generations to come. We invite our colleagues to join us in \nsupporting and advancing these measures--or to come up with various \nalternatives of your own.\n  Each of us has an obligation--not only to our constituents, but to \nourselves and our children and grandchildren--to confront these issues \nhead-on. Whatever outrage and hostility we may encounter from today's \ndefenders of the ``status quo''--and there will be plenty of it--it \nwill pale in comparison to the truly richly deserved scorn we will \nreceive from future generations if we fail to have the courage to act. \nI eagerly look forward to a spirited debate on these issues and I urge \nmy colleagues to join the fray.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I support the Strengthening Social Security \nAct of 1995. I commend my distinguished colleagues, Senators Bob Kerrey \nand Alan Simpson, for their hard work on this important legislation, \nand I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor.\n  I compliment my friends from Nebraska and Wyoming, Mr. President, \nbecause tackling the problems associated with social security takes \nenormous personal and political courage. In an era when news is \nconveyed in quippy, provocative soundbites, ``touching'' social \nsecurity is anathema--even when reforming social security is clearly \nthe only way to save it.\n  For the bottom line is this, Mr. President: if we don't change the \nway we do business around here, spending on entitlements and interest \non the debt will consume all Federal revenues by the year 2012. That \nsame year, social security expenditures will begin to exceed revenues \ncoming into the trust fund, and by the year 2029, the Social Security \ntrust fund will be exhausted.\n  Because of demographics and increasing life expectancies, this Nation \nhas evolved from a system where 15 workers supported each Social \nSecurity beneficiary when the program was created, to five workers for \neach beneficiary today, to just three workers for each beneficiary when \nthe Baby Boom generation retires.\n  It's clear to me, Mr. President, that we have promised our people \nmore than we can deliver, and that our present path is simply \nunsustainable.\n  Unless we act today, we place an unconscionable financial burden on \nour children and our grandchildren--and we fail to ensure the \nretirement security of future generations of Americans.\n  This legislation strengthens the retirement security of future \ngenerations. It abolishes the actuarial deficit in the trust fund and \nallows the fund to pay benefits on an uninterrupted basis for the 75-\nyear timeframe reviewed by the fund's actuaries.\n  More young Americans believe in UFO's than believe that Social \nSecurity will be there for them, and we urgently need to restore in \nyoung Americans a genuine confidence in the system. One of the most \nintriguing and attractive provisions of this bill to me, Mr. President, \nallows for almost 30 percent of payroll taxes to be designated for the \ncreation of a personal investment plan--a tangible account--for future \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, powerful interests will fight even minor changes to \nthe Social Security system, and to succeed, we will have to engage in a \nbattle of our own. This means educating the American people on what the \nproblems are and how to responsibly solve them--convincing our citizens \nthat the time to act is today, when the remedies are so much easier to \nabsorb.\n  This also means persuading our colleagues on both sides of the \ncapitol and both sides of the aisle that touching Social Security does \nnot mean destroying it. Touching Social Security does \n[[Page S6916]] not mean abandoning our senior citizens, who have \ncontributed so much to our country.\n  Reforming Social Security, Mr. President, can mean strengthening it. \nReforming Social Security can mean saving it for future generations. \nAnd reforming Social Security can mean that we in Congress fulfill our \nresponsibility to govern, and to govern well.\n  I urge my colleagues to take an honest look at this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 826. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for the vessel Prime Time, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                      JONES ACT WAIVER LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill today \nto direct that the vessel Prime Time, official number 660944, be \naccorded coastwise trading privileges and be issued a coastwise \nendorsement under 46 U.S.C. sections 12106, 12107 and 12108.\n  This vessel was purchased in 1994 by Everett Ballenger of Columbia, \nSC, to provide charters from Hilton Head Island, SC. This chartering \nbusiness was to be Mr. Ballenger's sole livelihood. Because the vessel \nwas foreign built, it did not meet the requirements for coastwise \ntrading privileges in the United States.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to limit an \nemployer's deduction for health care costs of its employees if the \nemployer fails to honor its commitment to provide health care to its \nretirees; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \nrectify a great disservice done to a number of retired Americans, \nincluding many in my State of South Dakota.\n  Specifically, the retired employees of John Morrell & Co.--a \nmeatpacking plant located in Sioux Falls--were promised life-time \nhealth benefits by the company when they retired. As these workers \nplanned for their retirement, they relied upon the Morrell promise of \ncontinued health care benefits.\n  However, in January of this year, Morrell unilaterally terminated all \nof its retiree health insurance benefits--suddenly leaving about 3,300 \nretirees and their families throughout the country without health \ninsurance. These individuals now find themselves with little or no \noptions for replacing their health insurance.\n  Mr. President, this is patently unfair. As policymakers, we must not \nallow these inequitable actions to remain unchallenged. If we do, we \nrisk establishing a precedent that encourages other companies to \nviolate good faith agreements with their employees' health care \nbenefits.\n  The parent company of Morrell is Chiquita Brands, Inc., a highly \nsuccessful multinational corporation known to many Americans. Chiquita \nhas refused several good faith offers to negotiate with the Morrell \nretirees on this issue. Chiquita has moved to save money for the \ncompany at the expense of those who have no standing to defend \nthemselves.\n  In March of 1991, Morrell sent a letter to its retirees announcing it \nreserved the right, at its sole discretion, ``to alter, modify, or \nterminate'' any benefit at any time. In December, 1991, Morrell \nannounced the first unilateral reduction in retiree health benefits. \nLegal proceedings challenging the action began immediately.\n  So far, efforts to reverse the decision in Federal court have been \nunsuccessful. In October 1992, a Federal district court trial was held \nin South Dakota. The trial court refused to overturn Morrell's action. \nIt concluded that the health benefits were not contractually guaranteed \nby the company. When a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Eighth Circuit affirmed the lower court decision, Morrell \nimmediately terminated all health benefits for all retirees. An appeal \nhas been made to the U.S. Supreme Court, though review is unlikely \ngiven the few cases selected by the Court each year.\n  The Morrell retirees are at the end of their rope. They have tried to \nretain their health benefits through negotiations and through the \ncourts. When it comes to matters such as this, legislation must be \nconsidered the last best alternative. Frankly, we have reached that \npoint. It is time for Congress to step in.\n  Therefore, today I am introducing legislation that is intended to \nstop the transaction in its tracks, and prevent similar injustices from \nbeing done in the future. My bill, the Retiree Health Benefit \nProtection Act, would end these abuses by making it costly for those \ncompanies who entice their employees to rely upon the company's good \nwill and then, subsequently, renege on their promises of continued \nhealth benefits.\n  The Retiree Health Benefit Protection Act would reduce significantly \nthe amount of the current tax deduction that a company can take for \nexpenses made to provide medical care to its employees. Under current \nlaw, companies are allowed to take a 100 percent tax deduction for \nthese expenses. My bill would reduce that to 25 percent--the same rate \nat which a self-employed individual can deduct their expenses--if a \ncompany refuses to honor its prior health benefit commitment to its \nretirees.\n  Mr. President, some will say this bill is tough. It is. As we all \nknow, businesses make their decisions largely by looking at the bottom \nline. For Chiquita, its seems that its bottom line requires it to drop \nhealth benefits to Morrell retirees. My bill is designed to alter the \nbottom line--to make it clear that companies cannot break a promise to \nits retirees without paying a great price. The Morrell retirees are \npaying an unfair and unjustified price right now for Chiquita's action. \nBut what price is Chiquita paying? I do not believe that a company \nshould be allowed to continue to take full advantage of the tax \nbenefits of providing health care if they do not continue to fully \nprovide promised health care benefits. Therefore, my bill is designed \nto impose a price--to alter the bottom line--and in a manner that I \nbelieve will make companies keep the promises they make to their \nemployees.\n  We in Congress have an obligation to be sure that policies that \nimpact our retirees are fair. For many years, retired Americans work \nand plan for a day when they can spend their later years reaping the \nbenefits of hard work. These plans depend largely on promises made by \nothers, including their employers. Retirees make financial decisions \ncounting on these promises being kept.\n  The Federal Government--through the tax code--provides tax breaks to \nthose companies who provide benefits to their workers, such as health \ncare. In short, we use the tax code to reward good faith behavior. It \nis now time to consider using the code to prevent a violation of good \nfaith, or to punish such violations. Chiquita/Morrell made a promise to \ntheir employees. It has an obligation to live up to its word to the \nmany retired Americans who made Morrell an integral part of South \nDakota's economy. [[Page S6917]] \n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 827\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enable each State to assist applicants and \nrecipients of aid to families with dependent children in providing for \nthe economic well-being of their children, to allow States to test new \nways to improve the welfare system, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                     THE FAMILY SUPPORT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.\n   Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of introducing the Family \nSupport Act of 1995. Senators who have been following the subject of \nwelfare policy will recognize this as a successor to the Family Support \nAct of 1988, which was adopted in this Chamber just this side of 7 \nyears ago, on September 29, 1988, by a vote of 96 to 1. I was the \nmanager on our side and recall very specifically the atmosphere, the \nemotion; we knew this bill, from a near unanimous Senate, was going out \nthe door to the House of Representatives where it would be received and \ntreated in much the same manner; only thereafter to go to the White \nHouse where President Reagan, having helped shape the legislation would \nwelcome it, sign it. He would sign what he called ``this landmark \nlegislation'' in the company of such great Senators still in this body \nas our hugely respected majority leader, Senator Dole; my revered \ncolleague, now chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Packwood; our \nformer colleague, subsequently Secretary of the Treasury, Lloyd \nBentsen, as well as Members of the House of Representatives.\n\n  It was a grand moment in the Rose Garden. President Reagan said that \nCongress and those particularly active on this measure would be \nremembered for accomplishing what many have attempted but no one had \nachieved in several decades, ``a meaningful redirection of our welfare \nsystem.''\n  It will seem unimaginable to us today, but the Family Support Act of \n1988 was not a partisan political measure. There in the Rose Garden was \nSenator Dole, Senator Bentsen, the Speaker was there, Mr. Foley, Mr. \nMichel, the minority leader representing the Republicans. The chairman \nof the Governors Association of the United States, William Jefferson \nClinton, was there, having been a wondrous, energetic advocate on \nbehalf of the Governors. And with him his then colleague, as Governor \nof Delaware, the Honorable Mike Castle, now Representative from the \nState of Delaware in the House of Representatives. Democrat and \nRepublican alike, joining in a near unanimous measure to do what needed \ndoing, a good 50 years, a good half century into the experience with \nwhat we have called welfare, under the Social Security Act of 1935.\n  We redefined the statute to bring it in line with a new reality. The \noriginal Social Security Act of 1935, adopted in the midst of the \nDepression, provided for aid to dependent children. Basically, it \nrepresented the Federal Government picking up the widows' pensions \nwhich had been adopted in almost half the States by this point. But \nthese States were under severe economic stress in that Great \nDepression; the Federal Government assumed the responsibility for the \nchildren. In 1939 the mother of the family was included as well so it \nbecame Aid to Families with Dependent Children. And it was expected to \nbe a bridge, very similar to Old Age Assistance, which would last until \nSocial Security having matured, widows with their children were \nentitled to survivors insurance--Old Age and Survivors Insurance \n[OASI].\n  Indeed, that has happened. I think it is the case that only 71 \npercent of the recipients of Social Security benefits are in fact \nretired adults. The rest are, indeed, survivors and dependent children.\n  But then something new happened. Family structure began to change in \nour country. It is not the most comfortable subject to deal with, but \nit is a necessary one, Mr. President, and we have become more open \nabout it. In fact, it is President Clinton who now speaks of this. He \nspoke to us about this in a joint session of the Congress. We now have \na rate of births of children in single-parent families that has reached \n33 percent. At the time the Social Security Act was enacted it was \nprobably 4 percent. Our first hard number is 4 percent, in 1940.\n  We are not alone in this. The same phenomenon has taken place in the \nUnited Kingdom, in France, in Canada. We find it difficult to explain. \nOur other neighbors, as it were, find it difficult to explain. But we \ncannot doubt its reality.\n  In 1992, for example, the ratio in New York City had risen to 46 \npercent, approaching half. It may be at that point now. Because we \nobserve a regular rise, year after year, at a very steady rate of about \n0.86 percent a year. There has not been one year since 1970 in which \nthe ratio has not risen.\n  One of the consequences has been the rise in the number of cases, of \nfamilies receiving Aid to Dependent Children. There was a sharp rise in \nthe late 1960's. It reached a certain plateau in the 1980's, which we \nthink to be--do not know but think to be--a matter of demography. The \nchildbearing population was flat or even declined a little bit. Then, \nstarting in 1989 it begins a very pronounced rise. We go from 3.5 \nmillion to almost 5 million in 4 years. It is dropping just a little \nbit now, but we anticipate an increase in the population of \nchildbearing age such that we have every reason to think there will be \nan increase in this caseload. And we knew those things in 1988. And we \nknew we had to do something quite different. We had to redefine \nwelfare. It was no longer a widow's pension.\n  I have the great honor to know Frances Perkins, the Secretary of \nLabor, who had been chairman of the Committee on Economic Security that \npresented the program to President Roosevelt, and she would describe a \ntypical recipient--this is 1962, 1963--as a West Virginia miner's \nwidow.\n  Miners' women did not work in coal mines, and widows were not \nexpected to do such things in any event. It was a permanent condition. \nSuddenly we found a population of young persons with very young \nchildren who were dependent but ought not to remain so. It is not fair \nto them, it is not fair to their children, it is not fair to the \nsociety that is maintaining them. So the Family Support Act of 1988, \nthe first such act, said we will make a contract. We will say that \nsociety has a responsibility to help dependent families become \nindependent, and they in turn have a responsibility to help \nthemselves--a mutual responsibility. [[Page S6918]] \n  We started the JOBS Program, the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills \nProgram. We said we will expect people to work. Well, of course. I have \nhere a button from one of the JOBS programs in Riverside, CA. We had \ntestimony in the Finance Committee just a while ago. It is a wonderful \nbutton. The director is an enthusiastic man. The button says, ``Life \nWorks If You Work.'' He is right. And there is nothing wrong with that. \nTwenty years ago such ideas would possibly have been thought of as \npunitive, possibly stigmatizing. We are well beyond that in large part \nbecause of the JOBS Program.\n  There is no doubt that we passed this legislation because States had \nbegun to innovate. Those innovations seemed promising, and the Manpower \nDevelopment Research Corp. based in New York City could measure \nresults. And these innovations went right across the political \nspectrum. Governor Dukakis, a liberal Democratic Governor of \nMassachusetts, and Governor Deukmejian, a conservative Republican \nGovernor of California, adopted very similar ideas--get people ready to \nwork, get them thinking they can do it, and get them out of the house \nand into the mainstream.\n  We based our program on those experiments that had taken place. We \nvery carefully said we are going to work on the hardest cases, not the \neasiest ones.\n  If I can say, Mr. President, at the risk of being a little too \nstatistical, the population of the AFDC cases is what statisticians \ncall bimodal. A little less than half, about 40, 45 percent are mature \nwomen whose marriages have broken up, or they are separated, or \ndivorced. They will come into this arrangement for a brief period and \nthey go off on their own. They organize their lives as people do, and \nthe research is very clear on that. You can do all the effort you want \nwith such people. They do not need your help, thanks very much. They \njust need some income support for a period until they get their other \naffairs in shape on their own. But slightly more than half are young \npeople with no marriage, no job experience or little, often in settings \nwhere they are surrounded by such persons.\n  Mr. President, may I ask if I can continue in morning business, there \nbeing no other Senator seeking recognition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  So we launched this program. Having been involved with this subject \nfor 30 years and more, may I say one recognizes in the State \ngovernments enormous creativity. There is scarcely a day or week that \nyou do not read of some new program in one State or another.\n  I believe it was Monday evening on one of the evening news programs, \nit was NBC. It was Lisa Myers interviewing persons in Connecticut \nincluding the Governor where a very bold set of ideas has been \ndeveloped around the principles of the Family Support Act of 1988. You \nare in here, it is a temporary arrangement, we are going to help you \nget out of this. We realized what obstacles we had inadvertently put in \nplace to becoming free of welfare. In 1965 we enacted Medicare and \nMedicaid. So then a welfare mother had health care for her children, \nfull, free health care. The minute she left welfare she lost it. Many \nmothers are going to think twice about that, particularly if a child \nhas a health condition that is chronic and requires care. It would be \nunfair to the child to deprive him or her of that care. We said we will \ngive you a year on Medicaid after you leave the rolls, as the term was. \nWe will give a year of child care. We will help you along in this.\n  States are innovating all the time. Up in Connecticut they are \nsaying, ``Remember. You only have''--as I believe it was--``21 months. \nIn the meantime any job you get you keep it.''\n  That is the kind of waiver which we anticipated in the legislation, \nbipartisan and unanimous legislation, and the Clinton administration \nand Secretary Shalala have been very good about getting these things up \nand out, but not fast enough, a problem addressed by the legislation I \nintroduce today. We say a waiver decision will be handed down in 90 \ndays. The presumption is the States know what they are doing, and we \nwant them to try it.\n  This morning the front page of the Washington Post has a story, \n``Virginia Suburbs To Test Allen Welfare Plan. Area Has Eleven Months \nto Adopt Changes, Find Thousands Work.''\n  Work. ``Life Works If You Work.'' We are not afraid of that. We \nwanted that. We encouraged that. That is what the legislation did. \nGovernor Allen, a Republican Governor. The article says:\n\n       That means one of the country's boldest welfare plans will \n     unfold in the back yard of its top leaders, virtually \n     guaranteeing the attention of Congress and the White House as \n     they shape national policy.\n       ``Virginia is again making history,'' said Allen, a \n     Republican. ``It is the most sweeping and, I think, the most \n     compassionate welfare reform plan anywhere in the nation.''\n\n  This is taking place under the Family Support Act of 1988. And it is \nbeing paid for by the Federal matching funds and the guaranteed \nmatching support for children. There is something very important there \nthat might easily have been missed in that statement. I will say it \nagain.\n  Governor Allen says, ``Virginia is again making history. It is the \nmost sweeping and, I think, the most compassionate welfare reform plan \nanywhere in the nation.''\n  A welfare reform designed to say to people you have got to go to \nwork, you have a set time where you have to get yourself together, and \nwe will help you to get on your way.\n  Years ago no one would have described such an effort as \ncompassionate. Indeed, I have been through these matters and I can say \nto you the slightest suggestion that work might be appropriate for \nwelfare recipients was decried as punitive, and those who suggested it \nsaid, ``No, no, no. There is no such intention.'' Now, openly, \nGovernors will say, if you care about your fellow citizens, you have to \nhelp them get out of the debilitating and unfair situation.\n  And that is what we do. That is what we can do more of. The bill I \nintroduce today will provide an additional $8 billion over 5 years with \nevery penny paid for, every penny provided through closing tax \nloopholes, refining the Supplementary Security Income program.\n I had a hand in the proposals under President Nixon that led to SSI as \nwe called it. It was intended to deal with the problem of adults who \ncould not work, the permanent, totally disabled, and such like. We \nclose loopholes such as that egregious practice we have come upon of \nAmerican citizens renouncing their citizenship in order to avoid their \ntaxes. There will be no more of that. The chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Mr. Packwood, and I agreed as of the day this issue was \nbrought up you cannot do it anymore. This bill will provide funds for \nthat purpose and other such matters. We are not adding a penny to the \ndeficit. I would not dare, particularly with that most formidable and \nknowledgeable chairman of the Budget Committee in the Chamber. We pay \nfor this provision for women and children to help them pay for \nthemselves.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was just passing through. I was not going to even \npass on the Senator's eloquence or arguments, but since the Senator \nmentioned my name, I ask that the Senator particularly use his good \nhead during the next 5 or 6 days and help us get a balanced budget.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I will most assuredly help the Senator do that, and we \nwant to balance the budget for the children of America, too, and we \nhave it here and we are going to pay for it.\n  If the distinguished chairman could just let me point out, in the \nmidst of the Depression of the 1930's, we could provide for dependent \nchildren as a Federal responsibility. In the 1990's, when we have a $7 \ntrillion economy, it has been proposed to take that away.\n  Look at what we have done to our children. The average benefit, in \n1995 dollars, two decades ago was $650. It is down to $350. That is not \nthe social policy the chairman of the Budget Committee is associated \nwith and not the one with which I think this Senate should wish itself \nto be associated.\n  I thank my friend.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. Let me just mention, however--and \nthe Senator would agree--since the early days of that program to help \nour poor children, we have, indeed, passed more [[Page S6919]] than a \ndozen major programs that also help our children that were not in \nexistence then.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Entirely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do believe, from the standpoint of our people who are \ncontributing mightily in tax dollars, they ought to have an \nunderstanding that even though that came down in real dollars, that is \nnot the whole story, and yet I am not here to argue with the good \nSenator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is not the whole story. I was speaking earlier of \nMedicaid.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It was made available in 1965, previously unknown. But \ncuriously a benefit to the children became an obstacle to leaving \nwelfare and that is what we overcame. The Senator was one of the fine \nsupporters of the Family Support Act of 1988. And I will see how we \nproceed at this point. But I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would just add one other comment if the Senator would \npermit.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I would.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Frankly, the reason I am going to start this afternoon \nat noon for the balanced budget 2002 is for the children of this \ncountry. It may not be exactly for the children the Senator is \nreferring to. I am hopeful that will all work out fine. But actually I \nbelieve the continuation of a deficit of the size we are incurring is \nactually antikids, antichildren.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. And antigrand- children.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Please.\n  MR. MOYNIHAN. It is certainly anti-grandchildren.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is right, and I have a few of those. The Senator \nhas a few.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I could not start working into my wallet, but I know \nthe Senator could work into his.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Nobody bids against me when it comes to children and \ngrandchildren. They give up and say, ``That's off the record now.''\n  But anyway, I do believe a continuation of the policies of the past--\nand it is not just now, this year, last year--is probably the meanest \npolicy we could have for the children of the future because they are \ngoing to have to pay our bills, and they are going to have to suffer a \nstandard of living decrease to pay our bills, and we are not adult \nenough to stand up and say we ought to pay for it.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I agree.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I agree, Mr. President, and I would also say that we \nhave an immediate problem of the 14, 14.5 million persons in this \npresent program who are living today. And in very short periods of time \nwe raise children, watch children being raised, we know how quickly \nthings go badly or, alternatively, how quickly things get on the good \nroad and how hard it is to change thereafter.\n  There are those who suggest that some savage removal of this entire \nSocial Security provision will somehow change behavior. And I say, Mr. \nPresident, that is so deeply irresponsible as to make one wonder how it \never could have gained currency.\n  Lawrence Mead, who is a professor at New York University, now \nvisiting professor at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and \nInternational Affairs at Princeton, testified before the Finance \nCommittee on March 9 about the proposals which have come to us, in \neffect, are here now from the House, in H.R. 4, the Personal \nResponsibility Act of 1995.\n  I think Dr. Mead would not in the least object to being described as \na conservative. He has been very much at odds with what he thought of \nas a liberal social policy in the time when it went pretty much \nunchallenged in New York City officialdom. He said to us, however, now, \njust wait a minute. What are you doing? What do you know now that you \ndid not know previously when we enacted the Family Support Act? I do \nnot wish to have him quoted as referring specifically to the Family \nSupport Act, but he was saying what do we know now different from what \nwe have known? I quote him:\n\n       Can the forces behind growing welfare be stemmed? \n     Conservative analysts say that unwed pregnancy is the \n     greatest evil in welfare, the cause not only of dependency \n     but other social ills. On all sides, people call for a family \n     policy that would solve this problem, but we have no such \n     policy. The great fact is that neither policymakers nor \n     researchers have found any incentive, benefit or other \n     intervention that can do much to cut the unwed pregnancy \n     rate.\n\n  This bears repeating, from a social scientist of impeccable \nconservative antecedence, appearing before our committee, the Committee \non Finance, which will deal with this legislation, this area of \nlegislation. He said:\n\n       Can the forces behind growing welfare be stemmed? \n     Conservative analysts say that unwed pregnancy is the \n     greatest evil in welfare, the cause not only of dependency \n     but other social ills. On all sides, people call for a family \n     policy that would solve this problem.\n\n  May I interject that he could be describing this Senator. I have \nspoken of family policy; I have written on the subject for a generation \nnow and watched family circumstances only worsen and have been as \nbaffled as any other.\n  But then to continue Lawrence Mead:\n\n       But we have no such policy. The great fact is that neither \n     policymakers nor researchers have found any incentive, \n     benefit or other intervention that can do much to cut the \n     unwed pregnancy rate.\n  And if we do not know how to do it, how can we possibly decide to do \nnothing, when we have in place a program that is showing some results, \nnot in changing family structure but in the response of dependent \nfamilies to their situation?\n  Dr. Mead has done some analysis of the effects of the JOBS Program \nwhere it has been attempted. It had a problem of coming into place just \nas we went into recession. State governments had not the resources they \nneeded and the Federal funds were not, in fact, fully used. But where \nthey were used, there were responses, not large but real. And every \ntime you succeed, you change the lives of a mother and her children, \nand there can be no larger purpose in domestic social policy.\n  The same sentiments were echoed by Nathan Glazer, perhaps our \nreigning sociologist, professor emeritus now at Harvard University. He \nwrote a paper for an Urban Institute conference here in Washington just \na year ago, anticipating some of the turmoil we have seen in this \ndebate.\n  The Urban Institute, Mr. President, was, of course, established in \nthe mid-1960's in the aftermath of the first turmoil associated with \nsome of these changes in social structure that appeared in American \ncities. President Johnson help sponsored it. It passed the Congress. \nMr. William Gorham has dedicated a very distinguished career to the \nUrban Institute.\n  Here is what Nathan Glazer said on April 12, 1994.\n\n       Do we know that much more than we knew in 1988 to warrant \n     new legislation? I don't not think so. Do we feel confident \n     enough about the programs we prescribed to States to \n     undertake in 1988 to put substantially larger sums into them? \n     It seems doubtful to me. Can we get a substantial part of \n     long-term welfare clients off the welfare roles by increasing \n     their earned income through investments and learning how to \n     work, basic education, training programs, and the like? We \n     cannot.\n\n  That is the passage I quote from Dr. Glazer.\n  I think we can do better than that. I think the record is better than \nthat. I think the case is to be made: Continue what you are doing and \nstrengthen what you are doing.\n  The Family Support Act of 1995 builds on what we have learned, even \nas the original was based on what we had learned. Social learning is \nhard. It takes generations sometimes. No one in 1950 could have \nimagined that our GDP would double and redouble and we would end up \nwith the poverty that we see in cities everywhere in our country, that \nkind of intractable poverty that is not associated with employment or \neconomic growth.\n  There is a measure to which the AFDC caseload responds to cyclical \nchanges in the economy. Dr. David Ellwood, who is the distinguished \nAssistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Policy Planning, \nestimates that somewhere between 10 and 20 percent of the rise in \ncaseload in recent years might fairly be ascribed to the rise in \nunemployment in the beginning of the last recession. And yet, the \nunemployment figures go down, the caseload figures continue to go up. \nThere is a lag, but even so we are not dealing basically with an \neconomic issue in the sense that we think of in terms of employment, \nearnings. We are dealing [[Page S6920]] with social change for which we \nhave little, little explanatory device.\n  And so, Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senate for the kind \nattention in these somewhat extended remarks to the introduction of the \nFamily Support Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na brief summary of the bill; the wonderful remarks on the signing of \nthe Family Support Act of 1988 by President Reagan; and also an item in \nthis morning's New York Times in which representatives of the U.S. \nConference of Mayors and of the National Association of Counties \nobserved that the legislation that has been sent us could be \ndevastating to county government and to city government. I think in \ntime more Governors will recognize the same. We are on a good steady \npath. Steady on.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n            Brief Summary of the Family Support Act of 1995\n\n       The bill builds on the Family Support Act of 1988 as \n     follows:\n       JOBS and child care.--Participation rates under the JOBS \n     program are increased from 20 percent in 1995 to 50 percent \n     in 2001. The Federal matching rate for JOBS and child care is \n     increased from a minimum of 60 percent under current law to a \n     minimum of 70 percent (or, if higher, the State's medicaid \n     matching rate plus 10 percentage points). The funding cap for \n     JOBS is phased up from $1.3 billion in 1995 to $2.5 billion \n     in 2001.\n       The bill also--\n       (1) emphasizes work by requiring States to encourage job \n     placement by using performance measures that reward staff \n     performance, or such other management practice as the State \n     may choose;\n       (2) provides for a job voucher program that uses private \n     profit and nonprofit organizations to place recipients in \n     private employment;\n       (3) eliminates certain Federal requirements to give States \n     additional flexibility in operating their JOBS programs; and\n       (4) allows States to provide JOBS services to non-custodial \n     parents who are unemployed and unable to meet their child \n     support obligations.\n       Teen parents.--For purposes of AFDC, teen parents (under \n     age 18) are required to live at home or in an alternative \n     adult-supervised setting. Teen parents (under age 20) are \n     required to attend school, or participate in other JOBS \n     activity approved by the State.\n       Encourage States to test alternative strategies.--Without \n     requesting a waiver, States may adopt their own AFDC rules \n     for (1) earnings disregards, (2) income and assets, and (3) \n     eligibility for the unemployed parent program, for a period \n     of five years. The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     must evaluate a sufficient number of program changes to \n     determine their impact on AFDC receipt, earnings achieved, \n     program costs, and other factors.\n       Interagency Welfare Review Board.--The bill establishes an \n     Interagency Welfare Review Board to expedite waiver requests \n     that involve more than one Federal agency. In considering an \n     application for a waiver under section 1115 of the Social \n     Security Act, there will be a presumption for approval in the \n     case of a request for a waiver that is similar in substance \n     and scale to one the Secretary has already approved. \n     Decisions on section 1115 waiver requests must be made within \n     90 days after a completed application is received.\n       Child support enforcement.--The bill includes provisions to \n     increase child support collections by establishing a \n     directory of new hires, requiring States to adopt uniform \n     State laws to expedite collections in interstate cases, \n     requiring States to improve their paternity establishment \n     programs, and making other changes.\n       In addition, the bill makes changes in SSI program rules \n     and in rules relating to the deeming of income of sponsors to \n     aliens for purposes of eligibility and benefits under the \n     AFDC, SSI, and food stamp programs, and makes other changes, \n     as follows:\n       SSI.--The bill includes provisions to modify disability \n     eligibility criteria for children, to provide for increased \n     accountability for use of benefits, and to require that \n     retroactive benefits be used on behalf of the child.\n       Alien deeming.--The period during which a sponsor's income \n     is deemed to an alien for purposes of eligibility for AFDC, \n     SSI, and food stamps is extended from 3 to 5 years. \n     Eligibility rules for AFDC, medicaid, SSI, and food stamps \n     are made uniform.\n       Tax responsibilities incident to expatriation.--A taxpayer \n     deciding to expatriate would owe income tax on asset gains \n     that accrued during the period of U.S. citizenship, absent an \n     election to instead continue to treat an asset as subject to \n     U.S. tax. Similar rules would apply to certain long-term U.S. \n     residents relinquishing that status.\n       Earned income tax credit changes.--Eligibility for the \n     earned income tax credit would be limited to those authorized \n     to work in the United States. In addition, the bill would \n     provide more effective rules for verifying EITC claims where \n     tax returns have social security number errors or omissions. \n     Finally, an individual's net capital gains would be added to \n     the categories of unearned income that are currently totalled \n     in determining whether the taxpayer is eligible for the EITC.\n       Treatment of corporate stock redemptions.--The bill \n     includes a provision that would assure the proper tax \n     treatment of corporate stock redemptions. Under the bill, non \n     pro rata stock redemptions received by a corporate \n     shareholder would generally be treated as a sale of the stock \n     to the redeeming corporation rather than as a dividend \n     qualifying for the intercorporate dividends received \n     deduction.\n\n                       Description of Provisions\n\n     A. Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) Program\n\n\n                1. Increase in JOBS Participation Rates\n\n       Present Law.--Under the provisions of the Family Support \n     Act of 1988, 7 percent of adults in single parent families \n     were required to participate in the JOBS program in fiscal \n     year 1991, increasing to 20 percent in 1995. This requirement \n     expires at the end of fiscal year 1995.\n       In the case of a family eligible for AFDC by reason of the \n     unemployment of the parent who is the principal earner, the \n     Family Support Act mandated that the State require at least \n     one parent to participate, for a total of at least 16 hours a \n     week, in a work experience, community work experience, or \n     other work program. The participation rate that the State \n     must meet was set at 40 percent in 1994, increasing to 50 \n     percent in l995, 60 percent in 1996, and 75 percent in 1997 \n     and 1998.\n       Persons exempt from this requirement include individuals \n     who are ill or incapacitated, are needed to care for another \n     individual who is ill or incapacitated, needed to care for a \n     child under age 3 (or age 1 at State option), live in a \n     remote area, work 30 hours or more a week, and children age \n     16 and under who are full time students.\n       Proposed Change.--The participation rate is increased to 30 \n     percent in 1997, 35 percent in 1998, 40 percent in 1999, 45 \n     percent in 2000, and 50 percent in 2001 and years thereafter. \n     Those who combine participation in JOBS and employment for an \n     average of 20 hours a week, and those who are employed for an \n     average of 20 hours a week, are counted as participants in \n     JOBS for purposes of calculating the State's participation \n     rate. The work requirement provisions for unemployed parents \n     are retained.\n\n\n                  2. Change in Purpose of the Program\n\n       Present Law.--The stated purpose of the JOBS program is to \n     assure that needy families with children obtain the \n     education, training, and employment that will help them avoid \n     long-term welfare dependence.\n       Proposed Change.--The purpose of the program is modified by \n     adding: to enable individuals receiving assistance to enter \n     employment as quickly as possible; and to increase job \n     retention.\n\n\n             3. Requirement for Staff Performance Measures\n\n       Present Law.--There is no provision relating to staff \n     performance measures.\n       Proposed Change.--A State will be required to have \n     procedures to: encourage the placement of participants in \n     jobs as quickly as possible, including using performance \n     measures that reward staff performance, or such other \n     management practice as the State may choose; and assist \n     participants in retaining employment after they are hired.\n       The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to \n     provide technical assistance and training to States to assist \n     them in implementing effective management practices and \n     strategies.\n\n\n                    4. Job Placement Voucher Program\n\n       Present Law.--There is no provision for a job placement \n     voucher program.\n       Proposed Change.--The bill provides that, as part of their \n     JOBS programs, States may operate a job placement voucher \n     program to promote unsubsidized employment of welfare \n     applicants and recipients.\n       The State will be required to make available to an eligible \n     AFDC applicant or recipient a list of State-approved job \n     placement organizations that offer job placement and support \n     services. The organizations may be publicly or privately \n     owned and operated.\n       The State agency will give an individual who participates \n     in the program a voucher which the individual may present to \n     the job placement organization of his or her choice. The \n     organization will, in turn, fully redeem the voucher after it \n     has successfully placed the individual in employment for a \n     period of six months, or such longer period as the State \n     determines.\n\n\n       5. Increased Flexibility in Administering the JOBS Program\n\n       Present Law.--The Family Support Act requires States to \n     include in their JOBS programs certain specified services, \n     including education activities, skills training, job \n     readiness, job development, and at least two work programs \n     (including job search, work experience, on-the-job training, \n     and work supplementation). There are also rules relating to \n     when and how long individuals may be required to search for a \n     job, as well as other program rules.\n       Proposed Change.--The bill allows States to establish their \n     own requirements for when and how long a recipient or \n     applicant must participate in job search. It also eliminates \n     the present law requirement that individuals who are age 20 \n     or over and have not graduated from high school (or earned a \n     GED) must be provided with education activities, and \n     eliminates the requirement that States [[Page S6921]] offer \n     specified education and training services. The requirement \n     that the State have at least two work programs is retained.\n\n\n   6. Permit States to Provide Employment Services for Non-custodial \n                                Parents\n\n       Present Law.--The Family Support Act allowed up to 5 States \n     to provide JOBS services to non-custodial parents who are \n     unemployed and unable to meet their child support \n     obligations.\n       Proposed Change.--All States will be given the option of \n     providing JOBS services to non-custodial parents who are \n     unemployed and unable to meet their child support \n     obligations.\n\n\n                    7. Funding for the JOBS Program\n\n       Present Law.--States are entitled to receive their share of \n     Federal matching payments up to a capped amount of $1.3 \n     billion in fiscal year 1995 to operate the JOBS program. The \n     State's share of the capped amount is based on its relative \n     number of adult AFDC recipients.\n       The Federal matching rate is the greater of 60 percent or \n     the State's medicaid matching rate, whichever is higher, for \n     the cost of services; and 50 percent for the cost of \n     administration, and for transportation and other work-related \n     supportive services.\n       Proposed Change.--The Federal matching rate for JOBS \n     expenses by States is increased and simplified. Beginning in \n     fiscal year 1997, the Federal matching rate will be 70 \n     percent or the State's Federal medicaid matching rate plus 10 \n     percentage points, whichever is higher. This rate will apply \n     to all JOBS costs, including administrative costs and the \n     costs of transportation and other work-related supportive \n     services. The cap on Federal spending is $1.3 billion in \n     1997, increasing to $1.6 billion in 1998, $1.9 billion in \n     1999, $2.2 billion in 2000, and $2.5 billion in 2001 and \n     years thereafter.\n\n\n                       8. Funding for Child Care\n\n       Present Law.--States must guarantee child care for \n     individuals who are required to participate in the JOBS \n     program. Child care must also be guaranteed, to the extent \n     the State agency determines it to be necessary for an \n     individual's employment, for a period of 12 months to \n     individuals who leave the AFDC rolls as the result of \n     increased hours of, or increased income from, employment. \n     (Funding for this transitional child care expires at the end \n     of fiscal year 1998.) States are entitled to receive Federal \n     matching for the costs of such care at the State's medicaid \n     matching rate. States are also entitled to receive Federal \n     matching at the medicaid matching rate for care provided to \n     individuals whom the State determines are at risk of becoming \n     eligible for AFDC if such care were not provided. There is a \n     cap on Federal matching for ``at risk'' child care of $300 \n     million in any fiscal year. Funds are distributed to the \n     States on the basis of the relative number of children \n     residing in each State.\n       Proposed Change.--The Federal matching rate for child care \n     is increased to 70 percent, or the State's medicaid matching \n     rate plus ten percentage points, whichever is higher. The \n     authority for Federal funding for transitional child care for \n     persons who leave the AFDC rolls is made permanent.\n\n\n         9. Evaluation of JOBS Programs; Performance Standards\n\n       Present Law.--The Family Support Act of 1988 required the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to evaluate State JOBS \n     programs in order to determine the relative effectiveness of \n     different approaches for assisting long-term and potentially \n     long-term AFDC recipients. The Secretary was required to use \n     outcome measures to test effectiveness, including employment, \n     earnings, welfare receipt, and poverty status. These \n     evaluations are being conducted in large part by the Manpower \n     Demonstration Research Corporation.\n       The Family Support Act also required the Secretary to \n     develop performance standards that measure outcomes that are \n     based, in part, on the results of the JOBS evaluations. On \n     September 30, 1994, the Department of Health and Human \n     Services issued a report on the progress that has been made \n     in developing an outcome-based performance system for JOBS \n     programs. The report stated that recommendations for outcome \n     measures will be transmitted to the Congress by April 1996. \n     Final recommendations on performance standards will be ready \n     before October 1998.\n       Proposed Change.--The bill authorizes such sums as may be \n     necessary for fiscal years 1996-2000 to enable the Secretary \n     to continue evaluating the effectiveness of State JOBS \n     programs. The information derived from these evaluations is \n     to be used to provide guidance to the Secretary in making \n     improvements in the performance standards that were required \n     by the Family Support Act. It is also to be used to enable \n     the Secretary to provide technical assistance to the States \n     to assist them in improving their JOBS programs, and in \n     meeting the required performance standards. The evaluations \n     shall include assessments of cost effectiveness, the level of \n     earnings achieved, welfare receipt, job retention, the \n     effects on children, and such other factors as the State may \n     determine.\n\n           B. Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)\n\n\n                    1. Teen Case Management Services\n\n       Present Law.--There is no requirement in present law that \n     States must provide case management services to teen parents \n     who are receiving AFDC.\n       Proposed Change.--State welfare agencies will be required \n     to assign a case manager to each custodial parent who is \n     under age 20. The case manager will be responsible for \n     assisting teen parents in obtaining services and monitoring \n     their compliance with all program requirements.\n\n\n  2. Requirement for Teen Participation in Education or Other Activity\n\n       Present Law.--The statute provides that States generally \n     must require teen parents under age 20 (regardless of the age \n     of the child) to attend school or participate in another JOBS \n     activity, but only if the program is available where the teen \n     is living, and State resources otherwise permit.\n       Proposed Change.--The rules requiring teens to attend \n     school or participate in another JOBS activity are \n     strengthened. Teen parents under age 20 who have not \n     completed a high school education (or its equivalent) must be \n     required to attend school, participate in a program that \n     combines classroom and job training, or work toward \n     attainment of a GED. A teen parent who has successfully \n     completed a high school education (or its equivalent) must \n     participate in a JOBS activity (including a work activity) \n     approved by the State. States may provide for exceptions to \n     this requirement, in accordance with regulations issued by \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services. However, \n     exceptions to the requirement may not exceed 50 percent of \n     eligible teens by the year 2000.\n       In addition, States may also have programs to provide \n     incentives and penalties for teens to encourage them to \n     complete their high school (or equivalent) education.\n\n\n                3. Living Arrangements for Teen Parents\n\n       Present Law.--States have the option of requiring a teen \n     under the age of 18 and has never married, and who has a \n     dependent child (or is pregnant) to live with a parent, legal \n     guardian, or other adult relative, or reside in a foster \n     home, maternity home, or other adult-supervised supportive \n     living arrangement. The State is required, where possible, to \n     make the AFDC payment to the parent or other responsible \n     adult. Certain exceptions to these requirements are provided \n     in statute.\n       Proposed Change.--The bill requires all States to require a \n     teen under age 18 who has a dependent child (or is pregnant) \n     to live with a parent, legal guardian, or other adult \n     relative, or reside in a foster home, maternity home, or \n     other adult-supervised supportive living arrangement. \n     Assistance will be paid to the teen's parent or other adult \n     on the teen's behalf. Exceptions to this requirement may be \n     made by in cases where the State determines that the physical \n     or emotional health or safety of the teen parent or child \n     would be jeopardized if they lived with the teen's parent, or \n     where the State determines (under regulations issued by the \n     Secretary) that there is good cause. The State agency will \n     have responsibility for assisting teens in locating \n     appropriate living arrangement when this is necessary.\n\n\n          4. Establishment of Interagency Welfare Review Board\n       Present Law.--At the present time there is no interagency \n     board to review requests by States for waivers from Federal \n     program rules that involve more than one agency.\n       Proposed Change.--In order to facilitate the consideration \n     of welfare program requirement waiver requests that involve \n     more than one Federal department or agency, an Interagency \n     Welfare Review Board would be created. Members would include \n     the Secretaries of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, \n     Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Education, or their \n     designees. The President may make such other appointments to \n     the Board as he determines appropriate.\n       The Board will act as the central organization for \n     coordinating the review of State applications for waivers \n     that involve more than one Federal department or agency, and \n     will provide assistance and technical advice to the States. \n     The Board may issue an advisory opinion with respect to a \n     waiver request, but final decisions will be made by the \n     Secretaries of the departments or agencies that have \n     responsibility for the programs involved. The Board must \n     establish a schedule for the consideration of a waiver \n     application to assure that the State will receive a final \n     decision not later than 90 days after the date the completed \n     application is received by the Board.\n\n\n            5. Consideration of Section 1115 Waiver Requests\n\n       Present Law.--Section 1115 of the Social Security Act gives \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services authority to waive \n     State compliance with specified rules under the AFDC, child \n     support and medicaid programs. There is no authority to waive \n     JOBS program rules.\n       The purpose of the waiver authority is to enable States to \n     implement demonstration projects that the Secretary finds \n     will assist in promoting the objectives of the programs. \n     States must evaluate their demonstration programs, and the \n     programs must not increase Federal spending.\n       Proposed Change.--States will be allowed to apply for \n     waivers of JOBS program rules in order to conduct JOBS \n     demonstration projects.\n       In addition, the Secretary will be required to approve or \n     disapprove a section 1115 waiver request within 90 days after \n     the completed [[Page S6922]] application is received. In \n     considering an application for a waiver, there will be a \n     presumption for approval in the case of a request for a \n     waiver that is similar in substance and scale to one that has \n     already been approved.\n\n\n           6. State Authority to Establish Certain AFDC Rules\n\n       Present Law.--The Social Security Act specifies the rules \n     States must follow with respect to income and resource \n     requirements, the disregard of income, and the definition of \n     unemployment and the number of quarters of work required for \n     eligibility under the Unemployed Parent (UP) program.\n       Proposed Change.--Any State may, without receiving a \n     waiver, establish any of the following program changes: \n     income and resource requirements, requirements relating to \n     the disregard of income, standards for defining unemployment \n     that are different from those prescribed by the Secretary in \n     regulations (which currently limit eligibility for UP \n     benefits to families in which the principal earner works \n     fewer than 100 hours a month), and rules that prescribe the \n     numbers of quarters of work that a principal earner must have \n     to qualify for Unemployed Parent benefits. This authority \n     expires at the end of five years.\n       The Secretary is required to evaluate a sufficient number \n     of the program changes established by the States pursuant to \n     this authority to determine the impact of the changes on AFDC \n     recipiency, earnings achieved, program costs, and such other \n     factors as the Secretary may determine. A State chosen by the \n     Secretary for an evaluation must cooperate in carrying out \n     the evaluation.\n\n                  C. Child Support Enforcement Program\n\n       The Family Support Act of 1988 strengthened the Child \n     Support Enforcement program, which was enacted in 1975 (Title \n     IV-D of the Social Security Act), by: requiring States to \n     establish automated tracking and monitoring systems (with 90 \n     percent of the funding provided by the Federal government); \n     requiring wage withholding beginning in 1994 for all support \n     orders (regardless of whether a parent has applied to the \n     child support enforcement agency for services); and requiring \n     judges and other officials to use State guidelines to \n     establish most child support award levels.\n       States were required to review and adjust individual case \n     awards every three years for AFDC cases (and every three \n     years at the request of a parent in other IV-D cases); meet \n     Federal standards for the establishment of paternity; require \n     all parties in a contested paternity case to take a genetic \n     test upon the request of any party (with 90 percent of the \n     laboratory costs paid by the Federal government); and to \n     collect and report a wide variety of statistics related to \n     the performance of the system. The Act also established the \n     U.S. Commission on Interstate Child Support, which issued its \n     report with recommendations in May 1992.\n\n\n1. Require the Adoption by All States of the Uniform Interstate Family \n                          Support Act (UIFSA)\n\n       Present Law.--The Uniform Interstate Family Support Act \n     (UIFSA) was approved by the National Conference of \n     Commissioners on Uniform State laws in August 1992. It \n     contains a wide variety of provisions designed to improve \n     enforcement of interstate child support cases by providing \n     uniformity in State laws and procedures, and creating a \n     framework for determining jurisdiction in interstate cases. \n     Not all States have adopted UIFSA.\n       Proposed Change.--All States are required to adopt UIFSA \n     not later than January 1, 1997.\n\n\n            2. Rules for Paternity Establishment Cooperation\n\n       Present Law.--The statute requires AFDC applicants and \n     recipients, as a condition of aid, to cooperate with the \n     State in establishing paternity and in obtaining support \n     payments unless there is good cause for refusal to cooperate. \n     It does not define what constitutes cooperation. The \n     determination as to whether an individual is cooperating or \n     has good cause for refusing to cooperate is made by the \n     welfare agency.\n       Proposed Change.--Cooperation is defined in statute as the \n     provision by the mother of both a name and any other helpful \n     information to verify the identity of the putative father \n     (such as the present or past address, the present or past \n     place of employment or school, date of birth, names and \n     addresses of parents, friends, or relatives able to provide \n     location information, or other information that could enable \n     service of process). The good cause exemption in present law \n     is retained.\n       For purposes of AFDC eligibility, a mother (or other \n     relative) will not be determined to be cooperating with \n     efforts to establish paternity unless the individual provides \n     the required information. The child support enforcement \n     agency is required to make this determination within 10 days \n     after the individual has been referred for services by the \n     welfare agency. However, the State cannot deny benefits on \n     the basis of lack of cooperation until such determination is \n     made.\n\n\n                3. Streamlining Paternity Establishment\n\n       Present Law.--States are required to have procedures for a \n     simple civil process for voluntarily acknowledging paternity \n     under which the rights and responsibilities of acknowledging \n     paternity are explained, and due process safeguards are \n     afforded. The State's procedures must include a hospital-\n     based program for the voluntary acknowledgement of paternity. \n     States must also have procedures under which the voluntary \n     acknowledgement of paternity creates a rebuttable, or at the \n     option of the State, conclusive presumption of paternity, and \n     under which such voluntary acknowledgment is admissible as \n     evidence of paternity, and procedures under which the \n     voluntary acknowledgment of paternity must be recognized as a \n     basis for seeking a support order without requiring any \n     further proceedings to establish paternity.\n       Proposed Change.--States are required to strengthen \n     procedures relating to establishment of paternity. A parent \n     who has acknowledged paternity has 60 days to rescind the \n     affidavit before the acknowledgement becomes legally binding \n     (with later challenge in court possible only on the basis of \n     fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact). However, minors \n     who sign the affidavit outside the presence of a parent or \n     court-appointed guardian have greater opportunity to rescind \n     the acknowledgement after 60 days. Due process protection is \n     enhanced by requiring that States more adequately inform \n     parents of the effects of acknowledging paternity.\n       The bill also provides that no judicial or administrative \n     procedures may be used to ratify an unchallenged \n     acknowledgement, and that States may not use jury trials for \n     contested paternity cases. Where there is clear and \n     convincing evidence of paternity (such as a genetic test), \n     States must, at a parent's request, issue a temporary order \n     requiring the provision of child support. Finally, States \n     must have procedures ensuring that fathers have a reasonable \n     opportunity to initiate a paternity action.\n\n\n                  4. Paternity Establishment Outreach\n\n       Present Law.--There is no requirement that States have a \n     paternity outreach program.\n       Proposed Change.--States are required to publicize the \n     availability and encourage the use of procedures for \n     voluntary paternity establishment and child support through a \n     variety of means, including distribution of written materials \n     at health care facilities and other locations such as \n     schools; pre-natal programs to educate expectant couples on \n     individual and joint rights and responsibilities with respect \n     to paternity; and reasonable follow-up efforts after a new-\n     born child has been discharged from a hospital if paternity \n     or child support have not been established. States may \n     receive 90 percent Federal matching for these outreach \n     efforts.\n\n\n                   5. Review and Adjustment of Orders\n\n       Present Law.--States are required to review and adjust \n     child support orders at least every 36 months (1) in the case \n     of an AFDC family, unless the State determines that a review \n     would not be in the best interests of the child and neither \n     parent has requested review; and (2) in the case of any other \n     order being enforced by the child support enforcement agency, \n     if either parent has requested review.\n       Proposed Change.--States are required to review both AFDC \n     and non-AFDC child support orders every three years at the \n     request of either parent, and to adjust the order (without a \n     requirement for any other change in circumstances) if the \n     amount of child support under the order differs from the \n     amount that would be awarded based on State guidelines.\n       Upon request at any time of either parent subject to a \n     child support order, the State must review the order and \n     adjust the order in accordance with state guidelines based on \n     a substantial change in the circumstances of either such \n     parent.\n       Child support orders issued or modified after the date of \n     enactment must require the parents to provide each other with \n     an annual statement of their respective financial condition.\n\n\n            6. National Child Support Guidelines Commission\n\n       Present Law.--Among its other recommendations, the U.S. \n     Commission on Interstate Child Support recommended the \n     establishment of a commission to study issues relating to \n     child support guidelines.\n       Proposed Change.--The bill establishes a commission to \n     determine whether it is appropriate to develop a national \n     child support guideline, and if it determines that such a \n     guideline is needed, to develop such a guideline. The \n     commission is to make its report no later than two years \n     after the appointment of its members.\n\n\n7. Establish Centralized State Case Registries and Enforcement Services\n\n       Present Law.--Child support orders and records are often \n     maintained by various branches of government at the local, \n     county, and State level. Under the current program, IV-D \n     services are provided automatically without charge to \n     recipients of AFDC and Medicaid. Other parents must apply for \n     services, and may at State option be required to pay a fee \n     for services.\n       Proposed Change.--The bill requires each State to establish \n     both a Central Registry for all child support orders \n     established or registered in the State, and a centralized \n     payment processing system in order to take advantage of \n     automation and economies of scale, and to simplify the \n     process for employers. For enforcement purposes, States must \n     choose one of two types of systems for payment processing: \n     (a) an ``opt-in'' centralized collections system where one \n     parent would have to apply to the IV-D agency to receive \n     services, or (b) an ``opt-out'' centralized system where all \n     cases would automatically have withholding and enforcement \n     [[Page S6923]] done by IV-D unless both parents make a \n     request to be exempt from the process. Under either option, \n     the centralization process for enforcement would be used for \n     collections and disbursement.\n\n\n 8. Establish Federal Data Systems: A Directory of New Hires Within an \n             Expanded Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS)\n\n       Expanded Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS):\n       Present Law.--State child support agencies now have access \n     to the FPLS, a computerized national location network \n     operated by the Office of Child Support Enforcement, which \n     obtains information from six Federal agencies and the State \n     employment security agencies. This information only relates \n     to a parent's location, and does not include income and asset \n     information. It is used for enforcement of existing child \n     support orders, not to establish paternity or establish and \n     modify orders.\n       Proposed Change.--A New Hire Directory, and a new Data Bank \n     on Child Support Orders which contains information of all \n     cases sent by the State registries, are added to the current \n     FPLS. The FPLS database is expanded to provide States with \n     additional information about not only the location of the \n     individual but also income, assets, and other relevant data. \n     States may access this information for enforcement, \n     establishing paternity, and establishing and modifying \n     orders.\n       a. Directory of New Hires:\n       Present Law.--Employers are currently required, generally \n     on a quarterly basis, to report employee wages to State \n     employment security offices. These reports are used to \n     determine unemployment benefits. In order to more rapidly and \n     effectively implement wage withholding to enforce child \n     support orders, a number of States have adopted laws \n     requiring employers to report information on each newly hired \n     individual within a specified number of days after the \n     individual is hired.\n       Proposed Change.--A national New Hire Directory is created \n     within the FPLS. Employers will be required to report the \n     name, date of birth, and social security number of each newly \n     hired employee to the New Hire Directory within 10 days of \n     hiring. This information will be compared with information in \n     the expanded FPLS, and matches will be sent back to the \n     appropriate States to be used for enforcement.\n\n\n                   9. Require Suspension of Licenses\n\n       Present Law.--There is no provision in present law \n     requiring States to withhold or suspend, or restrict the use \n     of, professional, occupational, recreational and drivers' \n     licenses of delinquent parents.\n       Proposed Change.--States are required to have such \n     procedures and to use them in appropriate cases.\n\n\n            10. Increased Use of Consumer Reporting Agencies\n\n       Present Law.--State child support enforcement agencies are \n     required to report periodically the names of obligors who are \n     at least 2 months delinquent in the payment of support and \n     the amount of the delinquency to consumer reporting agencies. \n     If the amount of the delinquency is less than $1,000, such \n     reporting is optional with the State. The State's procedural \n     due process requirements must be met.\n       Proposed Change.--States are required to report \n     periodically to consumer reporting agencies the name of any \n     parent who is delinquent in the payment of support, but only \n     after the parent has been afforded due process under State \n     law, including notice and a reasonable opportunity to contest \n     the accuracy of the information.\n\n\n                   11. Require Interest on Arrearages\n\n       Present Law.--There is no requirement that States charge \n     interest on child support arrearages.\n       Proposed Change.--States must charge interest on \n     arrearages.\n\n\n               12. Deny Passports for Certain Arrearages\n\n       Present Law.--There is no provision in present law relating \n     to denial of passports for failure to pay child support.\n       Proposed Change.--If the Secretary of HHS receives a \n     certification by a State agency that an individual owes \n     arrearages of child support in an amount exceeding $5,000 or \n     in an amount exceeding 24 months' worth of child support, the \n     Secretary shall transmit such certification to the Secretary \n     of State for action. The Secretary of State shall refuse to \n     issue a passport to such an individual, and may revoke, \n     restrict, or limit a passport issued previously to such \n     individual.\n\n\n                   13. Extend Statute of Limitations\n\n       Present Law.--There is no provision for a statute of \n     limitations for purposes of collecting child support.\n       Proposed Change.--States must have procedures under which \n     the statute of limitations on arrearages of child support \n     extends at least until the child owed such support is 30 \n     years of age.\n\n\n     14. Requirements for Federal Employees and Military Personnel\n\n       Present Law.--The armed forces have their own rules \n     relating to child support enforcement. Procedural rules for \n     wage withholding for Federal and military employees, and for \n     other employees, are not uniform.\n       Proposed Change.--Federal employees are made subject to the \n     same withholding procedures as non-Federal employees. The \n     Secretary of Defense is required to streamline collection and \n     location procedures of military personnel. The military would \n     be treated similarly to a State for purposes of child support \n     enforcement interaction with other States, and more as any \n     other employer for purposes of wage withholding.\n\n\n        15. Grants to States for Access and Visitation Programs\n\n       Present Law.--The 1988 Family Support Act authorized $4 \n     million for each of fiscal years 1990 and 1991 to enable \n     States to conduct demonstration projects to develop and \n     improve activities designed to increase compliance with child \n     access provisions of court orders.\n       Proposed Change.--The bill authorizes $5 million for each \n     of fiscal years 1996 and 1997, and $10 million for each \n     succeeding fiscal year to enable States to establish and \n     administer programs to support and facilitate non-custodial \n     parents' access to and visitation of their children, through \n     mediation, counseling, education, development of parenting \n     plans, visitation enforcement, and development of guidelines \n     for visitation and alternative custody arrangements.\n\n\n                  16. Change Distribution Requirements\n\n       Present Law.--If a family is receiving AFDC, the family \n     receives the first $50 of the monthly child support payment. \n     Additional amounts that are paid are used to reimburse the \n     State and Federal governments for assistance paid to the \n     family. When a family leaves AFDC, the State must pass \n     through all current monthly child support to the family, but \n     has the option whether to first pay the family any arrearages \n     which are collected, or whether to reimburse the State and \n     Federal governments.\n       Proposed Change.--The bill requires States to pay all \n     families who have left AFDC any arrearages due the family for \n     months during which a child did not receive AFDC, before \n     using those arrearages to reimburse the State and Federal \n     government. States are given the option of passing through to \n     families receiving AFDC the difference between the $50 pass-\n     through amount and the amount of child support due for that \n     month.\n\n\n                      17. Change in Lump-Sum Rule\n\n       Present Law.--If a family receiving AFDC receives a lump-\n     sum tax refund, the family loses eligibility for the number \n     of months equal to the amount of the lump sum payment divided \n     by the State payment standard.\n       Proposed Change.--Any lump-sum child support payment \n     withheld from a tax refund for a family receiving AFDC may be \n     placed in a Qualified Asset Account not to exceed $10,000. \n     Funds in this account may only be used for education and \n     training programs, improvements in the employability of an \n     individual (such as through the purchase of an automobile), \n     the purchase of a home, or a change of family residence. They \n     may not be taken into account for purposes of AFDC benefit \n     eligibility.\n\n\n                      18. Increase Federal Funding\n\n       Present Law.--The Federal Government pays 66 percent of \n     most State and local IV-D costs, with a higher matching rate \n     of 90 percent for genetic testing to establish paternity and, \n     until October 1, 1995, for statewide automated data systems. \n     The Federal government also pays States an annual incentive \n     payment equal to a minimum of 6 percent of collections made \n     on behalf of AFDC families plus 6 percent of collections made \n     on behalf of non-AFDC families. The amount of each State's \n     incentive payment can reach a high of 10 percent of AFDC \n     collections plus 10 percent of non-AFDC collections depending \n     on the cost-effectiveness of the State's program. The \n     incentive payments for non-welfare collections may not exceed \n     115 percent of the incentive payments for welfare \n     collections. These incentive payments are financed from the \n     Federal share of collections.\n       Proposed Change.--The Federal matching rate will increase \n     to 75 percent in 1999, and there will be a maintenance of \n     effort required by the State. The Secretary will issue \n     regulations creating a new incentive structure for State IV-D \n     systems based on paternity establishment throughout the State \n     (not just within the IV-D system) and a series of measures of \n     overall performance in collections and cost-effectiveness of \n     the IV-D system. The incentives will range up to 5 percentage \n     points of the matching rate for paternity establishment, and \n     up to 10 percentage points for overall performance measures. \n     States must spend incentive payments on the IV-D system. If a \n     State fails to meet certain performance standards such as for \n     paternity establishment or overall performance, the IV-D \n     agency will be assessed penalties ranging from at least 3 \n     percent of funding as a first sanction, up to 10 percent for \n     a third sanction.\n\n\n19. Limit on Match for Old Systems, and Cap Funding for the New Systems\n\n       Present Law.--The 1988 Family Support Act required States \n     to establish automated tracking and monitoring systems for \n     child support enforcement by October 1, 1995, with 90 percent \n     of the funding for planning, development, installation, or \n     enhancement of such systems provided by the Federal \n     government.\n       Proposed Change.--The Federal matching rate for the new \n     systems requirements in this bill is 80 percent or, if \n     higher, the rate the State is entitled to receive for other \n     program purposes, as described above (combining the new \n     Federal matching rate and the [[Page S6924]] State's \n     incentive payments). Federal spending for this purpose may \n     not exceed $260 million annually for fiscal years 1996 \n     through 2001.\n\n\n                        20. Audit and Reporting\n\n       Present Law.--The statute mandates periodic comprehensive \n     Federal audits of State programs to ensure compliance with \n     Federal requirements. If the Secretary finds that a State has \n     not complied substantially with Federal requirements, the \n     State's AFDC matching is reduced not less than one nor more \n     than two percent for the first finding of noncompliance, \n     increasing to not less than three nor more than five percent, \n     if the finding is the third or a subsequent consecutive such \n     finding.\n       Proposed Change.--The Secretary will establish standards to \n     simplify and modify Federal audit requirements, focusing them \n     more on performance outcomes.\n\n             C. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Program\n\n\n            1. Revised SSI Childhood Disability Regulations\n\n       Present Law.--In determining whether a child under the age \n     of 18 is disabled for the purpose of qualifying for \n     Supplemental Security Income, regulations require the Social \n     Security Administration (SSA) to consider the degree to which \n     an impairment or combination of impairments affects a child's \n     ability to develop, mature and to engage in age-appropriate \n     activities of daily living.\n       In making these evaluations, SSA conducts what is called an \n     ``individualized functional assessment'' (IFA) in which a \n     child's activities are broken into ``domains'' of functioning \n     or development, such as cognition, communication, and motor \n     ability. Under current regulations, the limitation in \n     functioning caused by conduct disorders, or maladaptive \n     behavior, may be considered under several domains.\n       To be found to be disabled based on an IFA under the \n     Commissioner's current regulations, a child's impairment(s) \n     must, at a minimum, cause a moderate limitation in \n     functioning in at least three domains of functioning.\n       Proposed Change.--The Commissioner of Social Security is \n     required to revise SSA's regulations for adjudicating claims \n     for SSI benefits filed for children by reducing the number of \n     domains considered in determining whether a child is disabled \n     based on an individualized functional assessment, to consider \n     maladaptive behavior in only one domain, and to require that, \n     at a minimum, a child's impairment(s) cause a ``marked'' \n     degree of limitation in at least two domains, or an extreme \n     limitation in at least one domain.\n       The Commissioner is required to promulgate the new \n     regulations within 9 months, and, within two additional \n     years, redetermine the eligibility of children on the rolls \n     whose disability was originally determined under the \n     regulations that are revised as a result of this provision.\n\n\n              2. Required Treatment for Disabled Children\n\n       Present Law.--There is no provision that requires a \n     disabled child who qualifies for Supplemental Security Income \n     benefits to receive medical treatment or have a treatment \n     plan.\n       Proposed Change.--Within three months after a child has \n     been found to be eligible for SSI, the parent or \n     representative payee will be required to file a treatment \n     plan for the child with SSA (through the State Disability \n     Determination Service of the State in which the child \n     resides). The plan will be developed by the child's physician \n     or other medical provider. SSA will evaluate compliance with \n     the treatment plan when SSA conducts a continuing disability \n     review for the child.\n       If the parent or representative payee fails, without good \n     cause, to meet these requirements, SSA will appoint another \n     representative payee, which can be the State Medicaid agency \n     of the State in which the child resides, or another State \n     agency or individual.\n\n\n                    3. Continuing Disability Reviews\n\n       Present Law.--Beginning in fiscal year 1996, the \n     Commissioner of Social Security will be required to conduct \n     periodic continuing disability reviews (CDRs) for disabled \n     SSI recipients (including both disabled children and adults). \n     The provision expires in fiscal year 1998, and the \n     Commissioner will be required to conduct CDRs for not more \n     than 100,000 SSI recipients a year for the period 1996-1998.\n       Proposed Change.--The Commissioner is required to conduct \n     periodic CDRs for disabled children who receive SSI. Reviews \n     for all children other than those whose disabilities are not \n     expected to improve must be conducted at least every three \n     years, with more frequent reviews for those whom SSA \n     determines may improve within a shorter period of time. \n     Children who are awarded SSI benefits because of low birth \n     weight must be reviewed after receiving benefits for 18 \n     months.\n\n\n         4. Special Savings Accounts for Children Under Age 18\n\n       Present Law.--Large retroactive payments are often made \n     when a disabled child first qualifies for SSI benefits. The \n     retroactive payment is excluded from the $2,000 resource \n     limit for six months, but thereafter, any remaining portion \n     of the retroactive payment could, alone or in combination \n     with other assets, render the child ineligible for SSI \n     benefits.\n       Proposed Change.--The representative payee of a disabled \n     child will be required to deposit the initial retroactive \n     payment into a special account if the amount of the \n     retroactive payment is equal to or exceeds six times the \n     maximum Federal benefit rate. Smaller retroactive payments \n     and underpayments may be deposited in the special account if \n     the representative payee chooses to do so. The money in the \n     account will not be considered to be a resource and may be \n     used only to benefit the child and only for such purposes as \n     education or job skills training; personal needs assistance; \n     special equipment; housing modification; medical treatment, \n     therapy, or rehabilitation; or other items or services \n     determined appropriate by the Commissioner.\n\n\n             5. Graduated Benefits for Additional Children\n\n       Present Law.--Each disabled child is eligible, under the \n     SSI program, for an amount equal to the full Federal monthly \n     benefit rate, which currently is $458.00, plus any \n     supplementary payment made by the State. The benefit may be \n     reduced because of other income received by the child, or \n     because of parental income that is deemed to the child.\n       Proposed Change.--The amount payable to a child will be \n     reduced if two or more SSI-eligible children reside together \n     in a household. The amount for the first child will be 100 \n     percent of the full benefit; the amount for the second \n     eligible child will be equal to 80 percent of the full \n     benefit; the amount for the third eligible child will be \n     equal to 60 percent of the full benefit; and the amount for \n     the fourth and each subsequent child will be equal to 40 \n     percent of the full benefit. Children living in group homes \n     or in foster care will continue to be eligible for 100 \n     percent of the full benefit. The aggregate amount payable to \n     all SSI-eligible children in a household will be paid to each \n     child on a ``per capita'' basis.\n       For the purpose of determining eligibility for Medicaid, \n     each SSI-eligible child in a household shall be considered to \n     be eligible for an amount equal to 100 percent of the full \n     Federal benefit rate.\n\n\n                      6. Use of Standardized Tests\n\n       Present Law.--There is no provision relating to use of \n     standardized tests for purposes of determining whether a \n     child is disabled.\n       Proposed Change.--The Commissioner of Social Security is \n     required to use standardized tests that provide measures of \n     childhood development or functioning, or criteria of \n     childhood development or function that are equivalent to the \n     findings of a standardized test, wherever such tests or \n     criteria are available and the Commissioner determines their \n     use to be appropriate.\n\n\n                        7. Directory of Services\n\n       Present Law.--There is no provision requiring a directory \n     of services that are available to assist children with \n     disabilities.\n       Proposed Change.--For the purpose of expanding the \n     information base available to members of the public who \n     contact the Social Security Administration, the Commissioner \n     of Social Security shall establish a directory of services \n     for disabled children that are available within the area \n     serviced by each Social Security office. Each such directory \n     shall include the names of service providers, along with each \n     provider's address and telephone number, and shall be \n     accessible electronically to all Social Security employees \n     who provide direct service to the public.\n\n\n                      8. Coordination of Services\n\n       Present Law.--There is no provision that establishes a \n     system for assuring that SSI disabled children have access to \n     available services.\n       Proposed Change.--In order to assure that a child receiving \n     SSI benefits on the basis of disability has access to \n     available medical and other support services, that services \n     are provided in an efficient and effective manner, and that \n     gaps in the provision of services are identified, the State \n     agency that administers the Maternal and Child Health block \n     grant would be made responsible for developing a care \n     coordination plan for each child.\n       The Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary \n     of Education, and the Commissioner of Social Security are \n     directed to take such steps as may be necessary, through \n     issuance of regulations, guidelines, or such other means as \n     they may determine, to assure that, where appropriate, the \n     State medicaid agency, the State Department of Mental Health, \n     the State Disability Determination Service, the State \n     Vocational Rehabilitation Agency, the State Developmental \n     Disabilities Council, and the State Department of Education: \n     (1) assist in the development of the child's care \n     coordination plan; (2) participate in the planning and \n     delivery of the services called for in the care coordination \n     plan; and (3) provide information to the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services with respect to the services that they \n     provide.\n\n                          D. Other Provisions\n\n\n          1. Alien Eligibility for Public Assistance Programs\n\n       Present Law.--The AFDC, SSI, medicaid, and food stamp laws \n     provide for limiting eligibility of immigrants for assistance \n     by means of so-called ``deeming'' rules. The rules provide \n     that for the purpose of determining financial eligibility for \n     benefits and services, immigrants are deemed to have the \n     income and resources of their immigration sponsors available \n     for their support for a period of 3 years. P.L. 103-152, the \n     Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1993, included a \n     provision extending the sponsor-to- [[Page S6925]] alien \n     deeming period for SSI from 3 to 5 years, effective from \n     January 1, 1994 to October 1, 1996.\n       Proposed Change.--The bill makes the SSI 5-year deeming \n     period permanent, and extends it to the AFDC and food stamp \n     programs. It also provides for uniform alien eligibility \n     criteria for the SSI, AFDC, medicaid, and food stamp \n     programs.\n\n\n            2. Tax Responsibilities Incident to Expatriation\n\n       Present Law.--Under current law, a taxpayer's accrued asset \n     gains are not taxed at the time he or she expatriates or \n     gives up U.S. residence. Further, the taxpayer's accrued \n     gains with respect to foreign assets are never taxed by the \n     United States. In cases when it can be demonstrated that a \n     taxpayer expatriated for purposes of tax avoidance, accrued \n     gains with respect to U.S. assets are taxed if a taxable \n     disposition occurs within the ten-year period following \n     relinquishment of U.S. citizenship.\n       Proposed Change.--A U.S. citizen relinquishing citizenship \n     generally would be taxed on any accrued asset gains as of the \n     date of expatriation. Certain long-term residents of the \n     United States would similarly be taxed on accrued gains upon \n     losing such resident status. Exceptions would be provided for \n     the first $600,000 of a taxpayer's gain, gain with respect to \n     U.S. real estate, and pension gains. A taxpayer could elect, \n     on an asset by asset basis, to avoid immediate gain taxation \n     and instead continue to be subject to U.S. taxes with respect \n     to an asset.\n\n\n                  3. Earned Income Tax Credit Changes\n\n       (i) Illegal aliens--\n       Present Law.--Currently, persons resident in the United \n     States for over six months who are not U.S. citizens are \n     eligible for the EITC in some circumstances, even if they are \n     working in the country illegally.\n       Proposed Change.--Eligibility for the EITC would be limited \n     to those residents authorized to work in the United States.\n       (ii) Social Security numbers--\n       Present Law.--Procedurally, the IRS must use its normal \n     deficiency procedures, which involve a series of written \n     communications with the taxpayer, if it decides to challenge \n     a taxpayer's EITC claim that may be erroneous. This is true \n     even in the case of a missing or erroneous social security \n     number.\n       Proposed Change.--The IRS would be provided with the \n     authority to process EITC claims in a more effective manner. \n     Social security numbers (valid for employment purposes in the \n     case of the earner(s)) would be required for the taxpayer, \n     his or her spouse, and each qualifying child. The IRS would \n     be permitted to handle any errors in social security numbers \n     under the simplified procedures currently applicable to math \n     errors on a taxpayer's return, rather than under the normal \n     tax deficiency procedures.\n       (iii) Modification of unearned income test--\n       Present Law.--Individuals with more than $2,350 of interest \n     (taxable and tax-exempt), dividends, net rents and net \n     royalties are not eligible for the EITC. (This provision was \n     enacted this year in H.R. 831.)\n       Proposed Change.--An individual's net capital gains would \n     be added to the other categories of unearned income that are \n     totalled for purposes of determining an individual's \n     eligibility for the EITC.\n\n\n              4. Treatment of Corporate Stock Redemptions\n\n       Present Law.--Corporate shareholders are allowed a special \n     deduction (the ``dividends received deduction'') with respect \n     to qualifying dividends received from taxable domestic \n     corporations. The deduction equals 70 percent of dividends \n     received if the corporation receiving the deduction owns less \n     than 20 percent of the stock of the distributing corporation. \n     The deduction equals 80 percent of the dividends received if \n     20 percent or more of the stock is owned by the receiving \n     corporation. Members of a group of affiliated corporations \n     can elect to claim a 100 percent dividends received deduction \n     for qualifying dividends paid by a member of the affiliated \n     group. No deduction is allowed for dividends received from \n     tax-exempt corporations.\n       An amount treated as a dividend in the case of a non pro \n     rata redemption of stock (or a partial liquidation) is \n     considered an extraordinary dividend under Internal Revenue \n     Code section 1059(e)(1). Generally, the basis of the \n     remaining stock held by a corporation receiving a dividend \n     must be reduced by the nontaxed portion of any extraordinary \n     dividend (i.e., the amount of the dividends received \n     deduction) received by the corporation with respect to the \n     stock.\n       Proposed Change.--The bill would replace the provision \n     under current law (Code sec. 1059(e)(1)) that allows a \n     corporate shareholder to reduce its basis in the remaining \n     stock by the amount of the nontaxed portion of an \n     extraordinary dividend. Instead, the bill would provide that, \n     except as specifically set forth in regulations, any non pro \n     rata redemption (or partial liquidation) would be treated as \n     a sale of the redeemed stock, even if such distribution would \n     otherwise be treated as a dividend and entitled to a \n     dividends received deduction under present law.\n       The bill would be effective for redemptions occurring after \n     May 3, 1995, except for those redemptions occurring pursuant \n     to the terms of a written binding contract in effect on May \n     3, 1995 or pursuant to the terms of a tender offer \n     outstanding on May 3, 1995.\n Remarks of President Reagan on Signing the Family Support Act of 1986\n\n       I am pleased to sign into law today a major reform of our \n     nation's welfare system, the Family Support Act. This bill, \n     H.R. 1720, represents the culmination of more than 2 years of \n     effort and responds to the call in my 1986 State of the Union \n     Message for real welfare reform--reform that will lead to \n     lasting emancipation from welfare dependency.\n       It is fitting that the word ``family'' figures prominently \n     in the title of this legislation. For too long the Federal \n     Government, with the best of intentions, has usurped \n     responsibilities that appropriately lie with parents. In so \n     doing--does anyone have a Stinger? [Laughter] In so doing, it \n     has reinforced dependency and separated welfare recipients \n     from the mainstream of American society. The Family Support \n     Act says to welfare parents, ``We expect of you what we \n     expect of ourselves and our own loved ones: that you will do \n     your share in taking responsibility for your life and for the \n     lives of the children you bring into this world.''\n       Well, the Family Support Act focuses on the two primary \n     areas in which individuals must assume this responsibility. \n     First, the legislation improves our system for securing \n     support from absent parents. Second, it creates a new \n     emphasis on the importance of work for individuals in the \n     welfare system.\n       Under this bill, one parent in a two-parent welfare family \n     will be required to work in the public or private sector for \n     at least 16 hours a week as a condition of receiving \n     benefits. This important work requirement applies to families \n     that come into the welfare rolls as a result of the \n     unemployment of the principal wage earner. It recognizes the \n     need for a family's breadwinner to maintain the habits, \n     skills, and pride achieved through work. This work \n     requirement also allows us to expand coverage for two-parent \n     families to all States without dangerously increasing welfare \n     dependency. A key part of this bill is to make at least one \n     of the parents in a welfare family participate in meaningful \n     work while still getting a needed cash support.\n       Single parent families also share in the message of hope \n     underlying this bill. They, too, will know that there is an \n     alternative to a life on welfare. To ensure that they get a \n     better start in life, young parents who have not completed \n     high school will be required to stay in or return to school \n     to complete the basic education so necessary to a productive \n     life. Other parents will be offered a broad range of \n     education, employment, and training activities designed to \n     lead to work.\n       To provide new employment opportunities to welfare \n     recipients, States will be entitled to receive $6.8 billion \n     over the next 7 years. They also will receive the funding \n     necessary to provide child care and Medicaid benefits. This \n     financial assistance represents a significant and generous \n     national\n      commitment to enhancing the self-sufficiency of welfare \n     recipients. To ensure that meaningful numbers of \n     recipients actually do benefit from welfare reform, each \n     State must be required to involve increasing percentages \n     of welfare families to participate in employment and \n     training activities over time.\n       The Family Support Act also contains significant reforms in \n     our nation's child support enforcement system. These reforms \n     are designed to ensure that parents who do not live with \n     their children nevertheless meet their responsibilities to \n     them. To improve the adequacy of child support awards, judges \n     and other officials will be required to apply support \n     guidelines developed by their States for setting award \n     amounts. And to help ensure that the child support awarded \n     actually is paid, child support payments will be \n     automatically withheld from the responsible parent's \n     paycheck.\n       Reflecting the concern we all share over the Federal budget \n     deficit, the Family Support Act contains funding provisions \n     to offset the increased new spending in the bill. The single \n     largest source of the funding comes from a temporary \n     extension of current authority for the Treasury to collect \n     overdue debts owed the Federal Government by reducing Federal \n     tax refunds of individuals not paying those debts on time.\n       In 1971, when I was Governor of California, we put into law \n     a work-for-welfare requirement similar to the one in the bill \n     before us today. It was called community work experience, and \n     its purpose was to demonstrate to the disadvantaged how \n     ennobling a job could be. And that lesson is as clear today \n     as it was then, and the successes of many fine State programs \n     like that one have made this landmark legislation possible.\n       As lead Governors on welfare reform for the National \n     Governors' Association, Governors Castle and Clinton \n     consistently presented the interests of the States in getting \n     welfare reform enacted. And that interest has been manifested \n     by many States carrying out their own welfare reform \n     programs. Leaders in this effort are Governors Kean, Tommy \n     Thompson, Moore, and Hunt who have paved the way for this \n     legislation through unique welfare reform initiatives in \n     their States. Legislators like Wisconsin's Susan Engeleiter \n     were instrumental in achieving welfare reform and showing \n     Congress how well it works.\n       Many Members of Congress share the credit for the \n     responsible welfare-to-work and child support enforcement \n     reforms in the Family Support Act. In particular, Senators \n     Moynihan, Armstrong, Dole, and Packwood, and Bentsen, and \n     Representatives Rostenkowski, Hank Brown, Michel, Frenzel, \n     and Downey played key roles in forging the consensus for this \n     landmark legislation. They and the members of the \n     administration who [[Page S6926]] worked so diligently on \n     this bill will be remembered for accomplishing what many have \n     attempted, but no one has achieved in several decades: a \n     meaningful redirection of our welfare system.\n       And I think it is time now for me to sign the bill. And I \n     thank all of you, and God bless you all.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 18, 1995]\n\n     GOP Bills To Overhaul Welfare Worry City and County Officials\n\n                            (By Robert Pear)\n       Washington, May 17.--Mayors and other local officials from \n     around the country said today that they opposed major \n     elements of the Republican welfare bills moving through \n     Congress, in part because the bills would eliminate the \n     Federal guarantee of a subsistence income for millions of \n     poor families.\n       The local officials said that cities and counties would \n     ultimately have to deal with the effects of such legislation, \n     which they said could include an increased demand for food, \n     shelter and social services.\n       Mayor Kay Granger of Fort Worth, an independent, speaking \n     for the United States Conference of Mayors, and Randall \n     Frankie of Oregon, a Republican who is president of the \n     National Association of Counties, said their groups opposed \n     the Republican plan to give each state a fixed sum of money \n     each year to assist poor people in any way it chose. These \n     block grants would replace Federal programs that provide \n     benefits to anyone who meets eligibility criteria based on \n     income and other factors.\n       ``We oppose repealing the entitlement status of benefit \n     programs such as Aid to Families With Dependent Children, \n     food stamps, child nutrition programs, Medicaid and foster \n     care,'' Ms. Granger said. ``We believe that the individual \n     entitlement to a minimum level of assistance must be \n     maintained for our children and families.''\n       The National League of Cities and the National School \n     Boards Association expressed similar views at a news \n     conference with mayors and county commissioners. It was the \n     first time local officials had spoken out in a coordinated \n     effort to influence Congress on this issue.\n       The local officials said that Congress had paid too much \n     attention to a small number of Republican governors like John \n     Engler of Michigan and Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, who \n     had lobbied for block grants. Mr. Franke, a member of the \n     Board of Commissioners in Marion County, Ore., said: ``A few \n     Republican governors have had a great influence on\n      this. It hasn't had the kind of broad input from governors, \n     or from local government officials, that it really \n     deserves.''\n       Carolyn Long Banks, a Democrat on the Atlanta City Council, \n     said that city and county officials had been ``left out of \n     the process of decision making,'' but would have to deal with \n     the effects of any welfare legislation adopted by the Federal \n     Government. Mr. Franke said counties were ``the front-line \n     deliverers of basic social services'' in many states.\n       The local officials said it was wrong for the Government to \n     push people off welfare if it did not provide the education, \n     training and child care they needed to get jobs. ``If we \n     simply cut welfare and there's not an organized effort to \n     move them into work, then they land on our doorsteps,'' Mayor \n     Granger said.\n       A welfare bill passed by the House in March would establish \n     block grants to the states in place of the current program of \n     Aid to Families With Dependent Children. Senate Republicans \n     have endorsed the approach. Republicans in the House and the \n     Senate are working on a separate bill to eliminate the \n     individual entitlement to Medicaid and replace it with a \n     block grant.\n       Republican governors say the block grants would free them \n     from burdensome Federal regulations and give them the \n     authority to design their own welfare programs, tailored to \n     local needs.\n       But Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, a Democrat, said the \n     block grants were ``a prescription for disaster'' in fast-\n     growing states like Florida, Texas, California and Arizona.\n       Mr. Chiles said Speaker Newt Gingrich had found ``a few \n     G.O.P. governors--Judas goats--to go along with the idea'' of \n     block grants. ``It's no wonder the Governors of Wisconsin, \n     Michigan and Massachusetts are on this bandwagon,'' because \n     they would not suffer any financial harm and could obtain \n     additional money at the expense of the fast-growing states, \n     Mr. Chiles said.\n       A Judas goat is an animal used to lead others to slaughter. \n     Charles S. Salem, special counsel in Governor Chiles's \n     Washington office, said, ``That is what he intended to say.''\n       In a speech here last week, Mr.\n        Chiles said the formula for distributing Federal money \n     under the Republican welfare bills was inequitable. ``A \n     poor child in Massachusetts would get three times as much \n     as a poor child in Florida,'' he said. ``A poor child in \n     Michigan would get twice as much as a child in my state.''\n       Governor Engler rejected Mr. Chiles' contentions. ``The \n     only successes in welfare reform have been achieved at the \n     state level,'' he said. ``Federal involvement has served only \n     to hogtie state reform efforts.''\n       Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah, chairman of the Republican \n     Governors Association, disputed Mr. Chiles' assertion that \n     fast-growing states would suffer under the Republican \n     proposal to distribute the block grants in proportion to \n     current levels of Federal welfare spending in various states.\n       But another Republican Governor, Fife Symington of Arizona, \n     expressed concerns similar to those of Mr. Chiles. He said \n     the proposal for block grants would penalize states like \n     Arizona with high population growth and comparatively low \n     levels of welfare spending.\n       Governor Symington said the block grants should be based \n     not on past spending, but on each state's share of the total \n     number of Americans living below the official poverty level \n     ($11,817 for a family of three).\n       The block grants ``should not reward states that have been \n     granting excessive benefits and penalize states that have \n     maintained only a modest safety net,'' Mr. Symington said in \n     a letter to Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his kind \nattention.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 829. A bill to provide waivers for the establishment of \neducational opportunity schools; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                         education legislation\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the bill I introduce would make \nit possible, in a limited number of school districts, for students to \nlearn in a single-sex classroom setting if they so wish.\n  Let me emphasize--``If they wish.'' This bill does not compel any \nschool to offer or any student to participate in single-sex classes. It \nmerely allows students--and their parents--in a qualifying school \ndistrict, to exercise that choice.\n  Our Nation has a compelling interest in assuring that all children \nreceive a high-quality education. Providing families with another \nconstructive educational option will further this interest.\n  This legislation has three purposes: First, I want the Secretary of \nEducation to give schools the discretion to experiment with offering \nsame-gender classes to low-income, educationally disadvantaged \nstudents. Second, I want to establish reliable information to determine \nwhether or not single-gender classes make a difference in the \neducational opportunities and achievements of low-income, educationally \ndisadvantaged students. Finally, I want to involve parents in the \neducational choices their children make.\n  Let me stress that this legislation imposes no financial obligation \non the part of the Federal Government. My bill requires the Secretary \nof Education to grant up to 10 waivers to title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972. The bill would not provide school districts or \nschools any additional funding if they apply for and are granted a \nwaiver of title IX. The waiver is very narrowly tailored to ensure the \nunimpeded development and operation of single-gender classes.\n  In recent years, efforts to experiment with same-gender classes and \nschools have been inhibited by lawsuits and threats of lawsuits from \nprivate groups, as well as Government. My bill would ensure that such \nthreats can no longer interfere with educational innovation.\n  Nothing in my legislation affects efforts at overcoming the effects \nof past discrimination made on the basis of sex. Research indicates \nthat single-sex classes can help minorities--girls and boys--perform \nbetter in school. African-American students in single-sex classrooms \nscored nearly a grade level higher than their coeducational \ncounterparts in academic achievement tests. Girls in single-sex schools \nscored a full grade above their coeducational counterparts on academic \nability tests. And girls in single-sex schools outperformed girls in \ncoeducational schools almost a full grade level on science tests \nscores.\n  Some studies indicate that boys may perform better in single-sex \nschools as well. Cornelius Riordan, of Providence College, has found \nthat a cognitive development among boys enrolled in single-sex Catholic \nhigh schools is more advanced than that of boys enrolled in \ncoeducational Catholic high schools.\n  Mr. President, there is a compelling Government interest in granting \nthe Secretary authority to insulate from lawsuits, for a limited time, \na small number of local educational agencies and schools which \nexperiment with same-gender classes.\n  My bill addresses this Government interest, and will allow data to be \ncompiled to prove that single-sex classes can work to the advantage of \nchildren.\n  Most importantly, by offering parents and children a choice, this \nlegislation would re-involve the family in educational decisionmaking \nprocesses. [[Page S6927]] \n  It is my hope that my colleagues will recognize the value of such \nacademic innovation and support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 829\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, with respect to \nfraud and false statements; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                           crime legislation\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Supreme Court \ndecided Hubbard versus United States. Overturning a 1955 decision \ncalled Bramblett versus United States, the Court held that section 1001 \nof title 18 of the United States Code, which prohibits making false \nstatements to the Federal Government applies only to false statements \nmade to executive branch agencies.\n  It is highly unusual that the Supreme Court reverses a prior decision \non a question of statutory interpretation. The reversal of the \nlongstanding decision in Bramblett is particularly troubling because of \nthe nature of the offense.\n  The language of the statute itself criminalizes false statements made \nto any ``department or agency of the United States.'' Relying on the \npurpose and the legislative history of the provision, the Supreme Court \nheld in Bramblett that the statute covered making false statements to \nCongress. The term ``department'' was read as broad enough to cover the \nexecutive, judicial, and legislative branches of government. Since \nthen, it has always been understood to cover Congress and the courts.\n  As Chief Justice Rehnquist argued in his dissent in Hubbard, it has \nbeen ``the very justifiable expectation'' that one who lies to \nCongress, whether or not under oath, would be punished under section \n1001.\n  While perjury laws and other statutes exist to cover false statements \nmade under oath or under specific circumstances, section 1001 was a \nbroad law covering all false statements made to Congress, as well as \nthe courts and executive agencies. In order to protect the Congress, I \nbelieve we must restore section 1001 to its meaning under Bramblett.\n  In order to do so, I am introducing legislation to overturn the \nSupreme Court's decision in Hubbard. We are able to do so because the \nCourt's decision rests solely on a question of statutory \ninterpretation. There is no constitutional dimension to the Court's \ndecision.\n  Accordingly, Congress is able to decide the public policy question \nfor itself. I have no doubt of the importance of having in the law a \nprovision that sets forth clearly and succinctly the principle that it \nis illegal to ``knowingly and willfully falsif[y], conceal[] or cover[] \nup by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make[] any \nfalse, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations'' to \nCongress or any committee or subcommittee in any matter within our \njurisdiction.\n  My bill is quite simple. It will simply add to the text of section \n1001 language that will broaden the newly narrowed statute to cover \nfalse statements made ``in any matter within the jurisdiction of any \ndepartment, agency, or court of the United States, or of Congress or \nany duly constituted committee or subcommittee of Congress.''\n  The purpose of this provision is to restore the meaning of the \nstatute that it was given under Bramblett and to overturn Hubbard. No \nother change in meaning is intended.\n  I believe this bill will not be controversial, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support its prompt enactment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 830\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FRAUD AND FALSE STATEMENTS IN MATTERS WITHIN THE \n                   JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF CONGRESS.\n\n       Section 1001 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking ``any department or agency of the United States'' \n     and inserting ``any department, agency, or court of the \n     United States, or of Congress or any duly constituted \n     committee or subcommittee of Congress,''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Dole, Mr. Helms, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S.J. Res. 34. A joint resolution prohibiting funds for diplomatic \nrelations and most favored nation trading status with the Socialist \nRepublic of Vietnam unless the President certifies to Congress that \nVietnamese officials are being fully cooperative and forthcoming with \nefforts to account for the 2,205 Americans still missing and otherwise \nunaccounted for from the Vietnam war, as determined on the basis of all \ninformation available to the United States Government, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                  vietnam pow/mia full disclosure act\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Dole, Senator \nThurmond, Senator Helms, Senator Grassley, Senator Gramm of Texas, \nSenator Campbell, and Senator Thomas, and myself, I rise to introduce a \njoint resolution entitled ``The Vietnam POW/MIA Full Disclosure Act of \n1995.'' I understand a similar resolution is being introduced in the \nHouse this week by Congressman Ben Gilman, the Chairman of the House \nInternational Relations Committee.\n  This resolution is aimed at getting the maximum amount of information \npossible from Vietnam on Americans still missing from the Vietnam war. \nSpecifically, the resolution prohibits both the establishment of \ndiplomatic relations with Vietnam and the extension of most favored \nnation trading status to Vietnam unless the President informs Congress \nthat we are getting full cooperation and full disclosure by Vietnam on \nthe POW/MIA issue.\n  If the Communist Government in Vietnam is continuing to withhold \ninformation that would account for missing Americans, as I believe they \nare, then now is not the time to normalize relations.\n  I am very pleased that this resolution is supported by the \ndistinguished majority leader and the distinguished chairmen of both \nthe Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, among \nothers. I know Senators Dole, Thurmond, and Helms have been closely \ninvolved with this issue for many, many years, and they share my \nconcerns.\n  Perhaps most importantly, this resolution is supported by virtually \nall of the families of the 2,205 Americans still unaccounted for from \nthe Vietnam war. It is also consistent with the resolutions that have \nbeen passed in recent years by our national veterans organizations.\n  Will every single American support the approach to resolving the POW/\nMIA issue outlined in this resolution? [[Page S6929]] Of course not. \nIndeed, there are Vietnam veterans in this body other than myself who \nadvocate a different approach, or have a different view on the \ncooperation we are getting from Vietnam. Some have said that we should \nnormalize relations with Hanoi because Vietnam is being fully \ncooperative on the POW/MIA issue. Others say we should normalize \nrelations because it would give an incentive for Vietnam to increase \nits cooperation. I still have not figured out which reason the \nPresident used when he lifted our embargo on Vietnam last year.\n  Nonetheless, I reject both these positions and would simply point out \nthat the position of the majority of our Nation's\n veterans and the POW/MIA families is very clear--they want the \nCommunist Government in Hanoi to come clean on the POW/MIA issue before \nwe normalize relations.\n\n  In my judgment, using every reasonable standard I can come up with--\nand I have worked on this issue for 11 years in the Congress--Vietnam \nhas not come clean on the POW/MIA issue. The Communist Government in \nHanoi continues to withhold relevant politburo and military records \npertaining to American POWS and MIAS from the war. There is no \ndisputing that fact.\n  Earlier this week, they dribbled out more records for a high-level \nadministration delegation. They have done this for years. I suspect \nVietnamese officials looked the administration delegation in the eye \nand said ``we just located this information.'' In 1993, they did the \nsame thing when documents surfaced in Russian archives indicating that \nmore Americans were held than those who came home. They suddenly came \nup with records they had withheld for 20 years. They just pulled it off \nthe shelf.\n  This ``timed'' release of documents, only when it is deemed important \nenough for Vietnam, proves to me that Hanoi's Communist Politburo is \ncontinuing to manipulate the POW/MIA issue for its own political \nadvantage. As a result, Vietnam is prolonging the anguish and \nuncertainty of MIA family members.\n  I wrote a letter today, signed it today, and sent it out from a \nfamily who still is anguishing over this with new information that they \nreceived, even as recently as this month.\n  Mr. President, the American people are not naive. They know that many \nrecords could have been turned over long ago. If they held back the \nmost recent set of records until the right moment surfaced, what else \nare they still holding? And why, Mr. President, has this administration \nfailed to vigorously seek access to Vietnam's wartime central committee \nrecords on POWs? Every historian knows that those records might \nconclusively answer the most nagging and haunting questions that keep \nthis issue alive and have kept the family members waiting for so many \nyears.\n  And why is it that there are family members of MIAs who are being \ndenied visas to go to Vietnam to look for answers? Is this a country \nthat is cooperating? I do not think so. I though when the President \nlifted the embargo in 1994, we were supposed to get unprecedented \naccess and cooperation, and the family members who have loved ones \nmissing cannot get a visa to get into Vietnam.\n  My colleagues do not have to accept Bob Smith's judgment on whether \nthere's been full disclosure by Vietnam on missing Americans. Under the \nresolution we have introduced today, the President is required to make \nthe final judgment, whoever the President is, after consultation with \nthe Director of Central Intelligence. If he feels we are getting full \ndisclosure, then he can move forward, so long as he notifies Congress. \nThat is all we are asking.\n  I would remind the President, However, that he was the one who \nstated, following his election in 1992, and I quote, ``I have sent a \nclear message that will be no normalization of relations with any \ncountry that is at all suspected of withholding information on missing \nAmericans.''\n I submit to you that there is still information being withheld.\n\n  The resolution we have introduced today asks the President to keep \nthe promise he made to the MIA families and our Nation's veterans \nduring his last campaign.\n  And that's really what this is all about, Mr. President--keeping our \ncommitment that we will not let Vietnam off the hook until there has \nbeen full disclosure on the fate of our POW's and MIA's.\n  Revisionists are in full bloom these days. There has been a lot of \nrevisionist history and frankly a lot of propaganda recently as we \nmarked the 20th anniversary of the Communist victory over South \nVietnam. But make no mistake about it--Vietnam needs us more then we \nneed Vietnam. And if the last 20 years have taught us anything about \nCommunist Vietnamese behavior, it is this--Vietnam only responds on the \nPOW/MIA issue when it is clear to them that the United States will go \nno further to meet Vietnam's agenda. If Vietnam is that desperate for \nAmerican business investment and diplomatic relations, then let them \ncome clean on the POW/MIA issue.\n  Unfortunately, there have been mixed signals, which have been fueled, \nin part, by certain lobbyists in the American business community who \nwant to put business over principle. My response to this lobbying \neffort is let us put principle over profit, not vice-versa. The only \nbusiness we should be doing with Vietnam is the business of getting \nHanoi to come clean on the POW/MIA issue.\n  Then and only then, should we normalize or restore any type of \ndiplomatic relations. It is only fair. Think of the suffering of these \nfamilies. How could we possibly want to do anything else but honor \nthem?\n  There have also been statements from some administration officials \nseem eager to move forward with Vietnam by lowering the priority that \nwas placed on the POW/MIA issue by Presidents Reagan and Bush. Perhaps \nthese officials have become exhausted. I can understand that. It has \nbeen a long, long time.\n  Maybe they are embarrassed by their inability to convince Hanoi to \ncome clean on the POW/MIA issue before we normalize. Maybe they would \nlike this issue to go away.\n I know the families would like it to go away. But it ought to go away \non honorable terms, honorable terms, a full accounting, a full \naccounting. That is the only way the issue should go away. In this \nenvironment, I would not be surprised if Vietnam might be thinking that \nthey can hold out on disclosing their central committee records and \nmeeting our intelligence community's expectations on what they can \nstill do to help resolve this issue. They might think that they can \nachieve their economic and political goals just by waiting us out. That \nis the message we are sending.\n\n  Mr. President, I would simply say that I am not going to stay silent \nand let that happen. I have a responsibility here. This week, the \nPresident's top defense official on the POW/MIA issue, Deputy Assistant \nSecretary Jim Wold, stated that the decision on whether to move forward \nwith Vietnam ``will be made by the President alone.'' The resolution we \nhave introduced today states that Congress expects to be informed on \nwhether there has been full disclosure by Vietnam on POW's and MIA's \nbefore the President moves forward. That is a very reasonable \nrequirement. I am confident that the American people want this question \nanswered before normalizing with Vietnam. That is a reasonable \nrequirement, and I am confident the American people would like an \nanswer to this question before we move forward with Vietnam.\n  I would remind my colleagues of something the English novelist Aldous \nHuxley once said--``Facts do not cease to exist just because they are \nignored.'' Our intelligence community has made assessments of what \nVietnam could still do if it truly wanted to come clean on the POW/MIA \nissue.\n  Those facts exist. Those facts are a matter of public record in some \ncases, and in other cases where they are not public, they are available \nfor my colleagues to see.\n  This Chamber is also awaiting a final response from the Secretary of \nDefense on the total number of POW/MIA cases where the likelihood is \ngreatest that Vietnam could produce additional information or remains, \nor perhaps in some cases possibly even a live American. This was a \nrequirement, which I originally sponsored in last year's Defense \nAuthorization Act. In February, we were told that only 50 percent of \n[[Page S6930]] this work had thus far been done and that we will have \nto wait several more months just to get a complete list of names. We \nshould have a chance to review this information required by law, Mr. \nPresident, before we even consider further overtures to Vietnam.\n  Finally, I would point out that President Clinton himself stated on \nJanuary 26 of this year that he is not fully satisfied that progress on \nthe POW/MIA issue has been sufficient to justify moving beyond the \nsteps agreed to last year when we lifted the embargo.\n  I would say to the President, ``Keep your promise, Mr. President, \nbecause they have not made the progress that you asked for since we \nlifted the embargo.''\n  On that point, I would agree with the President. For those who take \nthe time to really study this issue, as I have, it is difficult to see \nhow you can come to any other conclusion--there has not been full \ndisclosure by Vietnam.\n  With that in mind, I would urge my colleagues to join with the \nmajority leader, and our distinguished committee chairmen and others by \ncosponsoring this resolution. Let us send a clear signal to Vietnam. \nLet us tell them that, while we appreciate some of the cooperation we \nhave received to date, we will accept nothing less than full disclosure \non the POW/MIA issue before agreeing to normalize relations.\n  That is the way to honor the men and women who served, and the men \nand women who are missing, and the families of the missing.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Smith's \nVietnam POW/MIA bill. As the members of this Chamber know, Senator \nSmith has worked long and hard in the effort to make Hanoi account for \nour missing in action and prisoners of war from Vietnam. This bill is \nnot only the most recent example of that fine work, but also a reminder \nto the administration and other supporters of rushing to diplomatic \nrelations with Vietnam that Hanoi has 2,000 unanswered questions to \nanswer before proceeding with recognition.\n  My association with Vietnam POW/MIA's goes way back to 1970. I helped \nfound the National League of Families of POW/MIAs. I remember going to \nPresident Nixon and saying we had to do something about the POW and MIA \nproblem--answers had to be given before the people of America could \nrest easy that all had been done to find their loved ones and account \nfor their fate.\n  Mr. President, this is not an onerous bill. It requires Presidential \ncertification on three key issues before moving ahead on normalization: \n(1) a listing of cases for which the likelihood is the greatest that \nVietnam has information; (2) that Vietnam is fully cooperating in the \nfour key areas outlined by President Clinton; and (3) that Vietnam is \ncooperating in providing access to records concerning Americans \ncaptured during the war.\n  Mr. President, I note that the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Helms and the distinguished chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, as well as Senators \nThomas, Grassley, Campbell, and Gramm of Texas are original sponsors of \nthe Vietnam POW/MIA Full Disclosure Act of 1995. Once again, I commend \nSenator Smith for his leadership on this issue and yield the floor.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6912-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 194\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Murkowski] was added as a cosponsor of S. 194, a bill to repeal \nthe Medicare and Medicaid Coverage Data Bank, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 358\n\n  At the request of Mr. Heflin, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n[Mr. Johnston] was added as a cosponsor of S. 358, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for an excise tax exemption \nfor certain emergency medical transportation by air ambulance.\n\n\n                                 S. 553\n\n  At the request of Ms. Moseley-Braun, the name of the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Gregg] was added as a cosponsor of S. 553, a bill to \namend the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to reinstate an \nexemption for certain bona fide hiring and retirement plans applicable \nto State and local firefighters and law enforcement officers, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 582\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatfield, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Lott] was added as a cosponsor of S. 582, a bill to \namend title 28, United States Code, to provide that certain voluntary \ndisclosures of violations of Federal laws made pursuant to an \nenvironmental audit shall not be subject to discovery or admitted into \nevidence during a Federal judicial or administrative proceeding, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 770\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the names of the Senator from New Mexico \n[Mr. Domenici], the Senator from Connecticut, [Mr. Lieberman], the \nSenator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. \nSantorum, and the Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 770, a bill to provide for the relocation of the \nUnited States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6930-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED ON MAY 17, 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                    THE MEDICARE SELECT ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 CHAFEE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1108\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Packwood, Mr. Dole, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Gorton) proposed an amendment to the \nbill (H.R. 483) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \npermit Medicare select policies to be offered in all States, and for \nother purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as I promised I would do several weeks \nago, today I am submitting, on behalf of myself, Senators Feingold, \nLautenberg, and Baucus, the tough, comprehensive gift ban that some of \nus have been pushing for over 2 years. These are exactly the same gift \nban provisions that were developed last year by House-Senate conferees, \nbut that were blocked at the end of last Congress, and again at the \nbeginning of this Congress, by opponents of reform. They are the same \ngift ban provisions that were contained in last year's conference \nreport on S. 349, the Lobbying Disclosure Act. So that there is no \nconfusion, let me repeat that: these are exactly the same gift ban \nprovisions that were contained in the conference report on the Lobbying \nDisclosure Act last year, and that have been supported by the vast \nmajority of Democrats and Republicans on this Senate floor last year.\n  I do not need to rehearse the long history on this legislation, which \nmade an arduous journey, with many twists and turns, through both \nhouses of Congress last year, and through a House-Senate conference \ncommittee, only to be stopped by a Senate filibuster at the end of the \n103d Congress. I intend to continue to press it forward, and I also \nintend to support efforts to enact promptly the lobbying disclosure \nbill to which this gift ban was attached in the last Congress. I \nbelieve that because the registration bill contains tighter definitions \nof who exactly is a lobbyist than current law, and actually imposes \nsanctions against representatives of special interests who fail to \ncomply with the new rules, they work most effectively in tandem. But I \nalso believe that because there will likely again be attempts to direct \nseemingly high-minded, though false, criticisms against the purported \n``chilling effect'' on lobbying of the lobbying disclosure bill--a \ncharge that is preposterous on its face, since the bill simply requires \npaid, professional lobbyists to register, it doesn't limit their \nactivity--there should be another straight up or down debate and vote \non the gift ban itself. These attacks, as they did last year, could \ncome from the lobbying community, from right-wing radio talk show \nhosts, and others, even though the language which they claimed to be \nconcerned about had been deleted altogether from the bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to support both without weakening changes.\n  Today I am filing the gift ban as a proposed amendment to S. 652, the \ntelecommunications legislation that is currently pending on the Senate \nCalendar. This has been one of the most heavily lobbied pieces of \nlegislation in recent memory, from all sides, so it is appropriate that \nthis be a vehicle for the gift ban--and perhaps also for the lobbying \ndisclosure legislation to which it was attached last year.\n  I intend to bring the gift ban amendment to a vote in the Senate soon \nafter we turn to this bill. If the Senate does not soon turn to the \ntelecommunications bill, then I intend to continue to survey other \nappropriate vehicles for such an amendment. I suspect that the decision \nnot to turn the telecommunications bill immediately following the \nbudget resolution might have been affected by our decision to move \nforward now on the gift ban legislation as a proposed amendment to it. \nBut whatever the vehicle, I intend at the very least to prompt a full \nand thorough debate on this issue, and I hope to get it voted on soon.\n  I hope that this time, unlike in January, the Majority Leader and my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle will support this important \nlegislation, as they publicly indicated they would do last year. In \nfact, last year 37 Republicans cosponsored these same gift ban \nprovisions, but then proceeded to vote against them in January, after \nan indication from the Majority Leader that he intended to deal with \nthis issue on the Senate floor this month.\n  Americans are watching closely to see if the new majority in Congress \ndelivers on its promise of reforms. So far, they have not. This should \nnot come as a surprise, since these were the same people who blocked \nmajor reform last year in each of these areas, solely out of a \npolitical concern that Democrats might get some credit for cleaning up \nWashington. Their reform promises have rung hollow all the way along, \nand they ring hollow today.\n  In a recent editorial the Washington Post again challenged the new \ncongressional majority to enact a number of tough, sweeping political \nreform measures that have been opposed by congressional incumbents and \nbogged down for a number of years. They observed that the simplest and \nmost straightforward of these reforms is legislation to impose a tough, \nsweeping ban on the gifts, meals, vacation travel and other perks--the \nsame provisions that were killed at the end of the last Congress.\n  The President is prepared to sign this bill now, and I think we could \nand should have it on his desk within a few weeks. The President called \nfor lobbying reform and a gift ban in his State of the Union Address, \nand yet my colleagues in the majority have blocked our bill and put \nforward no alternative. As I observed 2 weeks ago on this floor, our \nmajority colleagues, frozen like deer in headlights, refuse to move \nforward on the gift ban. Enthusiastic about slashing free or reduced-\nprice lunches for children, opponents wither when it comes to \neliminating free lunches for Members of Congress. This bitter irony has \nnot been lost on the American people. Passing the gift ban, and tough \nnew lobby disclosure rules [[Page S6936]] developed in tough bipartisan \nnegotiations last year led by Senator Levin, is one of the best ways we \nhave to begin to restore the confidence of Americans in the integrity \nof the legislative process.\n  It is long past time for enactment of this gift ban. This amendment \nwould help to significantly change the Washington culture of special \ninterest perks, favors, meals, travel, and gifts being provided to \nMembers of Congress. There is no doubt that these kinds of gifts and \nother favors from lobbyists have contributed to Americans deepening \ndistrust of government. They give the appearance of special access and \ninfluence, eroding public confidence in Congress as an institution and \nin each Member individually as a representative of his or her \nconstituents.\n  This legislation imposes a sweeping ban on gifts, meals, \nentertainment and lobbyist-sponsored vacation travel, and imposes tough \nnew restrictions on non-lobbyists. It should be passed and enacted this \nmonth, if necessary over the objections of those would-be reformers who \nhave talked so much about reform out of one side of their mouths, while \nopposing it out of the other.\n  I point out again that these are the same provisions that were \nopposed by the Majority Leader when we offered them as an amendment to \nthe Congressional Accountability Act in January. At that time, the \nMajority Leader indicated that he intended to have an alternative gift \nban bill on the floor in May. Now it is well into May, and nothing has \nhappened.\n  No hearings have been held, no bills have been introduced, nothing on \ngift reform is scheduled for floor consideration anytime soon. In the \nother body, it is basically the same story. The question today is: \nWhere is the Majority Leader and where are the Republicans with their \nversion of gift reform? Since 37 of them, including the Majority \nLeader, already cosponsored, at the end of last year, the same \nprovisions that we offered in January, and will offer again soon to an \nappropriate vehicle here on the floor, what changes do they intend to \ntry to make in the bill?\n  Do they again intend, as some did last year, to try to gut the \nprovisions on charitable vacation travel to golf and tennis hotspots \nlike Vail, Aspen, Florida, or the Bahamas, where Members and their \nfamilies are wined and dined at the expense of lobbyists and major \ncorporations? I hope not, but I expect that\n such an attempt will be made.\n\n  Do they again intend to try to hollow out gift ban reforms by just \nslightly lowering the existing thresholds for expensive meals, sports \ntickets, and other gifts paid for by special interests here in \nWashington, so they can say they are for reform? Again, I hope not, but \nis possible.\n  Do they really intend in this climate to try to stall their way \nthrough another Congress, or worse to sneak something through Congress \nthat's not real reform? I hope not, and I will do everything I can to \nmake sure that doesn't happen.\n  It is not by change that the so-called ``Contract with America'' \ncontains not a word about real reforms like these that would clean up \nthe way Washington works. It is because there is seemingly no \ncommitment to the real reform agenda of campaign reform, lobby reform, \nand the gift ban on the part of the new Congressional majority. In the \nother body, proponents of the gift ban announced recently that they \nhave again been forced to resort to complex procedural strategies to \ncircumvent the normal committee process by trying to discharge gift ban \nlegislation, in order to even get a vote on it in that body.\n  The real standard for gift ban reform is the tight, tough bill that \nSenator Levin and I and others put forward in January, the same \nprovisions as were contained in last year's House-Senate conference \nreport which after months of struggling had been supported by \noverwhelming bipartisan majorities in both houses--until push came to \nshove at the end of the Congress and the bill was killed in the face of \na massive disinformation campaign by the Republican leadership and \ntheir friends in the right-wing talk show circuit.\n  In the past there have been those on both sides of the aisle who have \nopposed a ban of gifts and other perks. But in the end, overwhelming \nmajorities of both parties have voted for this legislation. And \noverwhelming majorities would support it again. We have waited over two \nyears for a bill that should have taken us two weeks to enact into law. \nI intend to fight to make sure this bill is enacted into law this year.\n  Since it was decided that Members and the Ethics Committee would have \nneeded some time to digest these new rules, last year's bill would not \nhave become effective until the end of this month. There is no good \nreason that we cannot have new rules in place to meet the deadline. As \nthose of us who have pushed this issue forward for two years said \nbefore the congressional recess, we are tired of waiting. The American \npeople are tired of waiting. It is long past time to act on tough new \ngift reforms.\n  The Senate should act, now, on tough, sweeping gift ban reforms. And \nwe should follow it up with comprehensive lobbying registration and \ncampaign finance laws. That is the real reform agenda. That is what \nAmericans are really looking for as they press for changes that will \nclean up Washington. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, \nand I invite them to cosponsor our amendment which embodies a tough \ngift ban bill when it comes to the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Senator from \nMinnesota for his persistence on this issue and join with him in once \nagain pointing out the need for legislation that will fundamentally \nreform the way Congress deals with the thousands and thousands of gifts \nand other perks that are offered to Members each year from individuals, \nlobbyists and associations that seek special access and influence on \nCapitol Hill.\n  It has been roughly one year since this body approved a strong, \nbipartisan gift ban bill by a vote of 95 to 4. 95 to 4. That bill would \nhave strictly limited the acceptance of gifts from lobbyists and \nprovided only a few limited exceptions for non-lobbyists. One would \nthink, that on a 95 to 4 vote, that this body, invigorated by the new \nRepublican leadership supposedly determined to change the way \nWashington does business and to bring government back to the people, \nwould have no problem raising this issue in the new Congress and \npassing another strong bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  But here we are, several months into the new Congress, and still no \naction from the Republican leadership.\n  Perhaps some of our Republican colleagues feel that there is not \nreally a problem with gift-giving to elected officials and their \nstaffs.\n  Maybe they feel that the American people really do have faith and \ntrust in their government and their elected officials.\n  But the fact is, once you leave the greater Washington area, you \ncannot help but immediately sense the anger and the cynicism with which \nthe American people have come to look upon this institution. They do \nnot see the beltway as a simple road encircling this city--they have \ncome to see it almost as a boundary separating the rest of America from \na kingdom of special interest influence known as Washington, D.C.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that there should not be an easier \nvote to cast than a vote to ban the gift-giving practice. I have said \nbefore that this should be a no-brainer. I have held nearly 175 \nlistening sessions in my home State of Wisconsin in the past 2\\1/2\\ \nyears. Thousands of constituents have raised their concerns and \nexpressed their views on a wide spectrum of issues at these listening \nsessions. There is almost always disagreement about these issues, \nwhether it is government spending, trade agreements, gun control or \nreforming our health and welfare systems.\n  But on this issue of gift-giving, the audience sentiment is almost \nalways in perfect unanimity. They are disgusted that this practice is \npermitted. Without exception, every time I raise the idea of a gift ban \nI cannot even get a full sentence out before the audience breaks out in \nspontaneous applause and approval of free gifts and trips.\n  I have said it now a number of times here on the floor and I will say \nit again: the Wisconsin State Legislature has had a strict gift \nprohibition in place for over 20 years now and it has worked fine. In \nfact, the Wisconsin Legislature is regarded as one of the most ethical \nlegislative bodies in the [[Page S6937]] country. And as has been \npointed out by my former colleague in the Senate, Congressman Tom \nBarrett, no one in the Wisconsin State Legislature has starved to death \nbecause of the gift ban.\n  Well, Mr. President, there are several of us who are determined to \nbring this practice to an end. Acting on a tough gift ban will \nfundamentally reform the way Congress deals with the many gifts and \nother perks that are offered to members each year, and would mark a sea \nchange in the way Washington, D.C. does business.\n  But we need to do more than simply pass though gift ban legislation. \nWe need to strengthen our current lobbying disclosure laws that are \nriddled with gaping loopholes. We need to shut down the revolving door \nthat allows public officials to trade on their government experience \nand contracts for lucrative post-employment in the private sector.\n  But most importantly, Mr. President, most importantly we need to pass \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform that will level the playing field \nbetween incumbents and challengers, and diminish the role of special \ninterest money that has come to dominate our election system. It is my \nsincere hope that this body will begin this process of reform by acting \non this measure at the earliest possibility.\n  These are all links in a chain of special interest influence that is \nwrapped around the U.S. Capitol. Each link of the chain must be broken \nand this would mark a dramatic first step.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6931-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6937-S6940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      DOMENICI AMENDMENT NO. 1111\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON (for Mr. Domenici) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution (S.

Mr. President, today, I would like to share an \nimportant Chicago Sun-Times article with my colleagues. It examines yet \nanother example of the sometimes deadly link between federally licensed \nfirearms dealer and the sale of weapons to criminals.\n  James L. Bush, of Bolingbrook, IL, a federally licensed gun dealer, \nhas pleaded guilty to selling 350 guns to criminals. To make extra \nmoney, he and a friend used a grinding stone attached to an electric \ndrill to erase the guns' serial numbers, and then sold those guns to \ngang members and drug dealers in the market for guns. Those guns were \nthen added to the explosion of weapons on the streets of our \ncommunities. Mr. Bush's case reminds me of the 1992 arrest of James \nBoard of Highland, IN, who police say sold more than 1,000 guns to \nChicago street gangs. At least 50 of those guns have been recovered \nfrom crime scenes, according to an ATF spokesman.\n  Certainly, Mr. Bush is responsible for his criminal actions, but we \nshould not disregard the fact that since receiving his license in \nJanuary 1990, he heard from an ATF agent only once. In Illinois, 15 ATF \ninspectors must monitor 6,529 federally licensed firearms dealers. \nThese inspectors are overburdened and underfunded. Given the evident \nconnection between unmonitored licensees and the presence of illegal \nweapons on our streets, we must ensure that licensees undergo \nsufficient scrutiny to detect such criminal activity.\n  That is why I sponsored Federal firearms dealer license reforms last \nyear. As a result of my reforms, Federal firearms licenses now require \na photograph and fingerprints, dealers are required to comply with \nState and local laws, and the ATF now has 60 days, instead of 45, to \ninvestigate before granting a license. Additional reforms raised the \nlicensing fee from a mere $30 to $200.\n  As a result of these common-sense reforms, there is some good news. \nSince [[Page S6942]] licensing reform was enacted in December 1993, the \nnumber of dealers in the United States has dropped from 283,000 to \n239,000 in December 1994. For the first time in years, according to the \nViolence Policy Center, there are now more gas stations than gun \ndealers in this country.\n  Opponents of gun control legislation say that measures such as these \nmake no difference in crime and the flow of illegal weapons. Even \nsupporters of gun control legislation often dismiss these type of \nreforms as too small, too narrow, and insufficient to address such \noverwhelming problems.\n  Clearly, these reforms do not solve our problems with violence and \ncrime. But there should no longer be any doubt that small steps make a \nbig difference. The struggle to free our communities from rampant gun \nviolence will only be won with commitment, determination and measures \njust like these. I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n   Confessions of a Gun Runner; How Suburbanite Supplied Chicago Gang\n\n                          (By Alex Rodriguez)\n\n       Easy money, James L. Bush thought to himself. Buy a gun for \n     $100, sell it for $250 on the streets. And in the bullet-\n     scarred neighborhoods of the West Side, customers weren't \n     hard to find.\n       So several times last winter Bush--suburbanite, homeowner \n     and father of two--drove to the city and sold boxes of guns \n     to the Vice Lords street gang. He drove away with a wallet \n     stuffed with cash.\n       Getting the guns wasn't a problem. Bush owned a federal \n     firearms dealer license, about as easy to get as a library \n     card.\n       ``It was very easy to abuse the system,'' Bush, 39, said \n     during a recent interview at his home in Bolingbrook. A \n     federal judge will sentence him this summer on a conviction \n     of illegal delivery of firearms.\n       ``There are probably people out there doing it right now,'' \n     he continued, ``but they just haven't gotten caught.''\n       Just how significant a role crooked federal firearms \n     dealers play in the availability of guns to criminals is hard \n     to measure, federal officials say. Most federal firearms \n     dealers don't break the law, and law enforcement agencies \n     don't keep statistics on those who do.\n       Still, the access to volume that comes with the license \n     means that just one crooked firearms dealer can become a \n     street gang's conduit for hundreds, even thousands of guns, \n     federal law enforcement officials say. Bush supplied gang \n     members and drug dealers with more than 350 guns before \n     federal agents arrested him in February. In 1992, federal \n     agents arrested James Board of Highland, Ind., who police say \n     sold more than 1,000 guns to Chicago street gangs.\n       At least 50 of those guns have been recovered from crime \n     scenes, said Jerry Singer, spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Board pleaded guilty to one \n     count of illegal firearms delivery and was sentenced to 21 \n     months in jail.\n       The federal government has responded by tightening \n     regulations governing the issuance of federal firearms \n     licenses.\n       Before the changes, anyone could obtain a federal firearms \n     license by paying $30 and filling out a one-page application.\n       With that license, they could buy and sell large numbers of \n     guns across state lines--from home if they wanted. They could \n     buy in volume because they bought wholesale.\n       License holders can still do all that, but now applicants \n     must pay $200 for a license, submit fingerprints and live in \n     a town without laws prohibiting gun dealerships.\n       Gun proponents have decried the new regulations as \n     unnecessary and misguided.\n       ``We see (ATF) as committed to driving down the number of \n     federal firearms license holders as a ploy to drive down \n     lawful gun ownership,'' said Mary Sue Faulkner, spokeswoman \n     for the National Rifle Association. ``It's like gun control. \n     There are already plenty of laws on the books to enforce.''\n       ATF officials, however, say the new regulations are needed \n     to pare down the universe of license holders. One reason the \n     agency struggles to ferret out crooked firearms dealers is \n     that it isn't armed with enough inspectors to monitor them.\n       In Illinois, 15 inspectors must cover 6,529 federally \n     licensed firearms dealers along with countless other duties, \n     including making sure distilleries, breweries and wineries \n     pay federal liquor taxes.\n       ``It's a very difficult job, when you have that few \n     inspectors for that many federal firearms licenses,'' Singer \n     said. ``There's only so much resources to go around.''\n       If the goal is fewer dealers, the new regulations are \n     working. Before December, 1993, when the federal government \n     raised the application fee from $30 to $200, ATF had to \n     oversee some 284,000 license holders nationwide. Nine months \n     later, the number of licensed dealers dropped to around \n     255,000.\n       Then in September, Congress enacted new rules that required \n     applicants to submit fingerprints, notify their local police \n     chief of their application and certify that their dealership \n     isn't prohibited by local law.\n       Since then, the number of licensed dealers has dropped to \n     223,476. By 1997, ATF officials predict the number of \n     licensed dealers will dwindle to 80,000.\n       ``Maybe by 1997 we'll have a more manageable universe,'' \n     said ATF spokesman Michael Fitzgerald.\n       Bush only heard once from the ATF after getting his federal \n     firearms license in January, 1990. An agent visited him \n     February, 1993, to review his records. Later that month, the \n     agency renewed his license.\n       At the time, Bush was a Chicago Transit Authority \n     purchasing clerk living with his family in a $180,000 house \n     in Bolingbrook, but struggling to erase a $40,000 debt from a \n     failed laundromat business, according to Bush and court \n     documents.\n       In September, 1994, an acquaintance of Bush--not named in \n     court documents--offered to find Bush gang members and drug \n     dealers in the market for guns, court records showed. The two \n     agreed to split the profits.\n       According to court records, Bush sold 350 guns to \n     criminals, at first with the help of his friend--a driver \n     with United Parcel Service--and later on his own. The two \n     used a grinding stone attached to a cordless drill to erase \n     the guns' serial numbers.\n       Bush was arrested Feb. 2 after selling 47 guns to an \n     undercover ATF agent. He pleaded guilty April 4 and faces \n     sentencing in July.\n       Bush, who is black, says he wrestles daily with the \n     knowledge that he sold guns in mostly black neighborhoods \n     under siege from gangs for decades.\n       ``I know it wasn't right,'' Bush said. ``They were going in \n     the hands of gang-bangers, and it was mostly black-on-black \n     crime. Maybe by me getting busted, that was God's way to tell \n     me to stop.''\n       As a federally licensed firearms dealer, James L. Bush \n     supplied West Side gang members with more than 350 guns \n     before U.S. agents arrested him in February, seizing dozens \n     of weapons. The Bolingbrook resident was convicted in April \n     of illegal firearms delivery.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6941-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6942-S6944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   CHELSEA NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSING SERVICES, INC., AND CITIZENS BANK OF \n                             MASSACHUSETTS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to commend Chelsea \nNeighborhood Housing Services, Inc. [CNHS], and Citizens Bank of \nMassachusetts [Citizens], which were nationally recognized for their \nexceptional partnership achievements by the Social Compact in its 1995 \nOutstanding Community Investment Awards Program Tuesday night. \nTogether, CNHS and Citizens have developed a unique pilot program that \nhelps former low-income renters become homeowners and building \nmanagers. The two organizations have designed this successful program \nspecifically to meet the needs of low-income residents in Chelsea, MA.\n  Chelsea, historically a city of immigrants, has a population that \noften is the last hired and the first fired. Consequently, when the \nState of Massachusetts experienced a severe economic downturn in the \nearly 1990's, Chelsea's residents were greatly affected. This \npopulation, with a per capita income of less than $8,600, is unable to \naccumulate savings for downpayments or closing costs for home \npurchases, even when working overtime or holding two jobs. \nNevertheless, despite the problems, many residents are determined to \nstay in Chelsea and buy their own homes.\n  Citizens--formerly known as Boston Five--originally approached CNHS \nto discuss a collaboration because it wanted to increase loans in \nChelsea and create a successful program that could be replicated in \nother cities. When CNHS and Citizens designed rent-to-own, they \ncarefully considered the needs of Chelsea residents. They recognized \nthat additional financial assistance would be needed for first-time \nhomehbuyers in order for them to have downpayments and meet closing \ncost requirements. Triple-decker properties, three-story buildings with \na two-bedroom apartment on the ground floor and two three-bedroom \napartments upstairs, provided part of the answer. The income from \nrental units helps decrease the barrier to homeownership. To qualify \nfor the program, the potential managers/buyers must commit to a 3-year \nprogram that requires them to attend monthly training sessions and \nlearn how to be good landlords. In return for their work and training, \nthey receive 100 points a month and are docked if absent from training \nor if they do not fulfill management responsibilities. At the end of \neach year, the points earned are converted to a maximum of $1,200 and \ndeposited to an escrow account at Citizens Bank. After 2 years, the \naccount's balance--potentially $2,400--is considered the manager/\nbuyer's cash downpayment toward the average purchase price of $120,000 \nfor his or her home. [[Page S6943]] \n  CNHS piloted the program in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the \ncity. With initial financial assistance from Citizens and further \nassistance from the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, a State \ngrant from the corpus of the Federal community development block grant \nto Massachusetts, Neighborhood Housing Services of America, and the \nState Executive Office of Communities and Development, CNHS bought a \nvacant and vandalized condominium and converted the early 20th-century \nbuilding into four triple-deckers now called Garden Apartments I.\n  The commitment of Citizens to the rent-to-own project is impressive. \nOver 150 hours of staff time was logged to develop and shape a program \nthat would fit the needs of both clients and sponsoring institutions. \nAdditionally, Citizens' senior staff worked with CHHS to gain approval \nof the program for Fannie Mae's secondary market.\n  Since the first days of occupancy, the rent-to-own project has been \nself-sufficient. The residents keep the building immaculate, so its \npresence visibly improves the entire neighborhood. Both partners are \npleased--Citizens is achieving its original mission, the development of \na model program that can be expanded and adapted in other cities, and \nCNHS has a program that serves its special constituency. They are now \nacquiring one building a month, and 50 percent of those will be rent-\nto-own units.\n  On behalf of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I commend Chelsea \nNeighborhood Housing Services and Citizens Bank for their distinguished \ncooperation and success, and suggest that their model be considered for \nreplication throughout the country.\n                H_______________________________________\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384-22   \n                                                       U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR TRAVEL FROM JAN. 1 TO MAR. 31, 1995                                                      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total         \n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n                     Name and country                             Name of currency          Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.  \n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenator Patrick Leahy.....................................                                                                                                                                      \n    Haiti.................................................

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize this week \nas Nursing Home Week in Tennessee, and to commend one of the finest \nnursing homes in east Tennessee for its excellent staff and the \ngenerous care it provides its residents--the Mountain City Care Center \nin Mountain City, TN.\n  Nursing homes in Tennessee are reviewed each year in a Tennessee \nState survey, with the results highlighting each center's strengths and \nweaknesses. Just 2 years ago, Mountain City Care Center was widely \nrecognized as one of the worst facilities in east Tennessee, and it was \nalmost forced to close. After receiving poor State survey results, the \nstaff and new management of the facility immediately began retraining \nand hiring new care providers. Within 90 days, the State found that \nsignificant changes were being made, and Mountain City Care Center's \nsurveys, as well as public opinion about the facility, have been \nimproving ever since.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the care center received its best inspection yet in \nthe annual surveys, and it is widely recognized as one of the most \nimproved, progressive nursing homes in east Tennessee. Mountain City \nCare Center even sponsors school projects, Johnson County Little \nLeague, sports programs, Rotary Club, American Red Cross, and other \ncommunity programs.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank the Tennesseans who were \ninvolved in turning around Mountain City Care Center and turning it \ninto one of the best facilities in the State. Without their hard work \nand dedication to quality care, elderly residents in Mountain City \nwould not receive the attention and care that they deserve.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6945-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             MUSICALYMPICS\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, earlier this week an article in the \nScience Times section of the New York Times explored what it called \n``the mystery of music.'' Scientists are attempting to find how and \nwhere the sense and art of music arise in the brain. It is a search in \nwhich much remains to be discovered, but it has already produced \nfascinating results, including the possibility that, even as it \nprovides the child with a constructive source of pleasure and reward, \nearly musical training may also enhance the ability to think and reason \nin terms of time and space. That possibility suggests, in turn, the \nsignificant role that music and musical education play in achieving the \nfundamental goals of our educational system.\n  That suggestion lends a special emphasis to an innovative musical \nprogram inaugurated this spring at three Los Angeles-area high schools. \nThis program, I believe, serves as an excellent model for improving \neducation through the cooperation of the private and public sectors.\n  ``Musicalympics,'' an artistic competition for high schools, was \nconceived by David Griffin, a Warner Brothers Records representative. \nGriffin enlisted the interest of Warner Brothers Records chairman, \nDanny Goldberg, who signed the record company on as the Musicalympics' \nfounding benefactor, the first, Griffin hopes, of other corporate \nsponsors to follow. Similarly, he hopes to see this year's inaugural \ncompetition among the three high schools extended to other schools in \nthe future. The thoughtful design of the competition and the solid \nprofessional backing it is receiving make its prospects good, I \nbelieve, on both counts.\n  Each school participating in Musicalympics has created a team of \nstudent songwriters, musicians, choreographers, dancers, costume \ndesigners, set designers and production personnel such as television \ncamera operators, lighting designers and recording engineers to pursue \nthe creation of a musical performance from the writing of an original \nsong to the final television production. Each school has been given a \nsmall cash stipend to underwrite expenses, and production professionals \nhave guided the students in mastering technical production details.\n  Professional Musicalympics television crews have visited each school \nperiodically to videotape students preparing their productions. David \nGriffin is producing and directing a television documentary special \nwhich showcases the competition, which will end in a complete \ntelevision performance of each school's production. The competition is \nbeing judged by Griffin, a Warner Records artist and other television \nprofessionals.

Mr. President, earlier this week an article in the \nScience Times section of the New York Times explored what it called \n``the mystery of music.'' Scientists are attempting to find how and \nwhere the sense and art of music arise in the brain. It is a search in \nwhich much remains to be discovered, but it has already produced \nfascinating results, including the possibility that, even as it \nprovides the child with a constructive source of pleasure and reward, \nearly musical training may also enhance the ability to think and reason \nin terms of time and space. That possibility suggests, in turn, the \nsignificant role that music and musical education play in achieving the \nfundamental goals of our educational system.\n  That suggestion lends a special emphasis to an innovative musical \nprogram inaugurated this spring at three Los Angeles-area high schools. \nThis program, I believe, serves as an excellent model for improving \neducation through the cooperation of the private and public sectors.\n  ``Musicalympics,'' an artistic competition for high schools, was \nconceived by David Griffin, a Warner Brothers Records representative. \nGriffin enlisted the interest of Warner Brothers Records chairman, \nDanny Goldberg, who signed the record company on as the Musicalympics' \nfounding benefactor, the first, Griffin hopes, of other corporate \nsponsors to follow. Similarly, he hopes to see this year's inaugural \ncompetition among the three high schools extended to other schools in \nthe future. The thoughtful design of the competition and the solid \nprofessional backing it is receiving make its prospects good, I \nbelieve, on both counts.\n  Each school participating in Musicalympics has created a team of \nstudent songwriters, musicians, choreographers, dancers, costume \ndesigners, set designers and production personnel such as television \ncamera operators, lighting designers and recording engineers to pursue \nthe creation of a musical performance from the writing of an original \nsong to the final television production. Each school has been given a \nsmall cash stipend to underwrite expenses, and production professionals \nhave guided the students in mastering technical production details.\n  Professional Musicalympics television crews have visited each school \nperiodically to videotape students preparing their productions. David \nGriffin is producing and directing a television documentary special \nwhich showcases the competition, which will end in a complete \ntelevision performance of each school's production. The competition is \nbeing judged by Griffin, a Warner Records artist and other television \nprofessionals. The documentary will premiere early next month and the \nwinning school will be announced before each school's participating \nstudents and invited guests, sponsors, contributors and other key \nsupporters. Each participating student will receive a videotape of the \nfinished television program, and all three participating schools will \nreceive cash prizes, or musical instruments and recording equipment.\n  Mr. President, the Musicalympics directly addresses a number of \neducational dimensions which concern the Nation today. In the first \nplace, it offers an opportunity for interested students to participate \ndirectly in the creation of an original artistic performance; it \nprovides those students with an intimate, personal perspective on the \norigin and nature of a production in one of the performing arts which \nare a chief feature of our culture.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nconcerns about proposals in the House of Representatives that would \nabolish the National Endowment for the Arts. Support for the arts and \nhumanities is the hallmark of a civilized society and since our \nnation's founding, the arts have held a respected place in our country.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for \nthe Humanities were created 30 years ago with the passage of the \nNational Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965. This act \nwas conceived fundamentally to maintain intellectual freedom and \npreserve American culture for future generations. Since its inception, \nthe National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities have become the \nprincipal funding organizations for many of our national museums, \nhistorical sights, and cultural institutions.\n  While we are currently facing a time of serious budgetary \nconstraints, it is important for us to remember how small our \ninvestment in the arts really is. If you look at other civilized \ncountries, they do far more from the public treasury in helping support \nthe arts and humanities than we do in this country. Currently, the \nUnited States spends 64 cents per American per year, the equivalent of \n2 postage stamps. In light of the tremendous return on investment in \nthe arts and humanities, proposals to terminate funding for the \nEndowments seem shortsighted.\n  Federal support for the arts and humanities constitutes only five to \nten percent of the total funding for the arts in this nation. This \nsmall investment functions as a catalyst to draw into the arts very \nsignificant amounts of money from the state and local levels as well as \nfrom private sources.\n  A grant from the NEA or NEH gives a tremendous boost to organizations \nsuch as symphonies and museums by assisting them in fundraising efforts \nin their own communities. Organizations all across the State of \nMaryland--from Baltimore's Museum of Art to Hagerstown's Maryland \nSymphony Orchestra--have all been able to use their NEA grant awards to \nleverage much-needed funding from their own communities. In fact, $1 \nendowment attracts $11 for the arts from States and local governments, \nregional and local art agencies, foundations and corporations, and \nbusinesses and individuals.\n  All of these contributions recognize the tremendous return on an \ninvestment in the arts. The arts have [[Page S6946]] brought increased \neconomic development to communities across the Nation's revitalizing \ninner cities, stimulating revenue and creating jobs. Nationally, the \nnonprofit arts industry generates an estimated $37 billion in economic \nactivity and employs 1.3 million Americans. The arts attract tourist \ndollars, encourage business development, spur urban renewal, and \nimprove the overall quality of life in our cities and towns.\n  Endowment grants also support important education and public \nprograms. In my own State of Maryland, NEH grants are assisting Essex \nCommunity College in developing its curriculum and training faculty \nmembers to teach it; aiding in the preservation of historic Maryland \nnewspapers such as the Log Cabin Advocate and the Independent Farmer; \nand funding museum exhibits such as the one on enlisted airmen in World \nWar II at the Airmen Memorial Museum in Suitland, Maryland.\n  Endowment grants enrich the lives of all Americans by bringing \ndiverse aspects of our cultural heritage right into our own \ncommunities. Among the most important beneficiaries of the arts are the \nchildren of this Nation. Exposure to the arts motivates children--\nstimulating their imaginations and increasing their confidence. For \nyoung people especially, a whole new world opens up to them when they \nenter a museum. The House proposals terminating funding for the arts \nwould effectively slam the door to that new world. In my view, it is \nimperative that we keep that door open for Americans of all \nages.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/18/senate-section/article/S6945-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  OFFICE FOR RARE DISEASE RESEARCH ACT\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.
