Mr. President, we have a long, hard few weeks ahead of us, \nprobably the most crucial 6 or 7 weeks or so that we have had in many \nyears--at least 12 or 15 years, in my own experience. Between now and \nThanksgiving, every Member of this Congress will make decisions that \ncan only be described as historic. The votes we cast in the weeks ahead \non Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, and the whole legislative package known \nas the reconciliation bill, will determine the course of the American \nRepublic for at least the next generation.\n  When I go home to Mississippi and I use this word ``reconciliation,'' \nconstituents ask what that means. I explain that ``reconciliation'' is \njust a fancy word for saying this is the time when we keep our word, \nwhen we actually do what we said we were going to do in earlier \nlegislation we passed this year--in the budget resolution, for \ninstance.\n  So, this is an historic time. That is no exaggeration. This year's \nbudget showdown is quite different from the budgetary experiences of \npast years. In the past, we have implemented budgets with so-called \nspending cuts that never seem to reduce spending and with revenue \nincreases that got spent before the taxpayers ever saw what they had \nearned. This time I really believe it is going to be different. This \ntime the reductions in spending are going to be real. They are going to \nbe structural, that is, actually changing the nature of many programs \nto build into them fiscal safeguards.\n  As long as most of us have been in the Congress, everyone has talked \na good game about entitlement reform. It never happened. But this time \nit is actually underway. This time around, the taxpayers are going to \nget the benefit of our holding down spending.\n  Radical as it may seem to much of official Washington, we are going \nto leave more money in the hands of those who actually earn it; the \nworkers, the families, and investors of America. That is the goal we \nhave been working toward all year. It has been our guiding light, our \npolar star during the tough contests over the budget, the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment, the appropriations bills, and \nentitlement reform. We have won some. We have lost a few. But all the \nwhile we have kept our focus on the greater goal of the financial \nindependence of the American home.\n\n  In that way, we have laid the groundwork for reducing the size and \nscope of the Federal Government. We started the process of returning \ndecisionmaking to the States and to the citizens of the States. What we \nare doing this year is only the beginning of the most profound power \nshift this country has seen since King George's colonial governors were \nsent packing back from where they came. \n\n[[Page S 15182]]\n\n  That is what makes our work this autumn so historic. By themselves, \ntax cuts come and, sadly, tax cuts usually go. But once you downsize \nGovernment, once you break its appetite for the public's purse, once \nyou take away its reason for devouring so much of the public's \nresources, then you have started a process that is almost impossible to \nreverse. You have rewritten the equation of power, if you can do that. \nYou have changed the rules of the game, and that is what we want to do. \nThat is what is happening in Congress this year, and that is what we \nwill be focused on for the next 6 weeks or so.\n  The transfer of power is seldom a neat process. Our effort to return \npower to the American people through the reconciliation bill of 1995 is \nno exception. None of us will get exactly what we want in this \nlegislation. There is bound to be something in there that makes each \none of us swallow a little hard, perhaps something that hits too close \nto our own home States. So be it. Some losses will be well worth the \noverall result: Medicare preserved and strengthened, welfare finally \ntied to work and to personal responsibility, the tax burden eased for \nfamilies with children, and the Federal Government locked on track \ntoward a balanced budget within 7 years.\n  That last item is worth repeating. The bill will put the Federal \nGovernment on track to budgetary balance by the year 2002.\n  Through all my years in the House and Senate, I have heard the \nnaysayers insist that it could not be done, it just could not be done, \nbut now that we are actually doing it, they have changed their tune. \nNow they say it should not be done. It is too fast; it is too much; it \nis too soon; too little spending; too much tax relief. In short, just \ntoo much change.\n  And yet in today's Washington Post, a very interesting editorial \ncolumn by James Glassman pointed out that even with these spending \ncontrols, Federal spending will increase by $2.6 trillion over the next \n7 years, while revenues will increase by $3.3 trillion. Yet there are \nthose in Washington who are screaming: Oh, you are cutting things so \ndeeply. How do you reconcile an increase of several billion dollars \nover what we are now spending with the accusation that we are cutting \nspending? In fact, we are not really cutting. We are just controlling \nthe rate of growth of Government. In fact, in my State, many people \nsay: Why is it taking 7 years to balance the budget? You really should \ndo it sooner.\n  But the important thing is that we are doing it. We are getting \nlocked in on this path, and the Congressional Budget Office is going to \ncertify that we are actually getting the job done.\n  When it comes to restraining the size and spending of Government, the \ncitizens I hear from do not think there is such a thing as too much \nchange. They do not understand why their elected officials cannot \nrestrain the spending appetite and habit in this city. They do not \nunderstand why a handful of Senators abandoned their longstanding \nsupport for the balanced budget constitutional amendment and voted to \nkill that amendment earlier this year. And most of all, they do not \nunderstand why the President has made himself the defender and guardian \nof the status quo.\n  I do not know how to explain President Clinton's extraordinary record \nthis year on the budget except to describe it as ``Bill's Peculiar \nAdventure.'' This is why; here is the script.\n  Earlier this year, the President submitted to Congress a budget that \nwas so shamelessly out of step with the wishes of the public that the \nSenate voted 99 to zero to reject it. That vote, for the record, \noccurred on May 19. Thereafter, both the Senate and the House passed \nbudget resolutions which the Congressional Budget Office said would \nresult in a balanced budget in the fiscal year 2002. CBO's assurance \nwas, of course, critical because, as President Clinton said himself, \nthe ``Congressional Budget Office was normally more conservative than \nwhat was going to happen and closer to right than previous Presidents \nhave been.''\n  Those were wise words then, and I believe they still are applicable \ntoday. For whatever reason, perhaps because he was left behind in an \nuntenable position, President Clinton took the exceptional step of \ndevising another budget, President Clinton's Budget II. This he \nsubmitted to Congress on June 13, contending that it would achieve \nbalance in the fiscal year 2005. This second Clinton budget was an \ninteresting effort and in some ways a definite improvement over the \nadministration's first try.\n  CBO estimates that it would achieve savings of $120 billion in \nMedicare through the year 2002, and $295 billion through 2005. Note \nthese savings were not described as cuts but as savings. CBO also \nestimated that Clinton II would reduce Federal revenues--that means \nallowing for tax cuts--by $97 billion over 7 years and $156 billion \nover 10 years. Those amounts were more than offset by President \nClinton's proposed savings--not cuts--from Medicare. That did not mean, \nof course, that he was using Medicare money for tax breaks because, as \nwe all know, the two items are entirely separate, as should be our \ndecisions concerning them.\n  So far so good. But the CBO had some bad news, too. The President's \nsecond budget would result in deficits in excess of $200 billion in \neach of the next 10 years. Let us add that up. By my calculation, that \ncomes to a 10-year deficit of more than $2 trillion. In fact, even that \nfigure of $2 trillion underestimates the President's proposed deficit, \nfor he included in revenues the surpluses that are expected in Social \nSecurity. He counted against his deficit spending the resources of the \nold age, survivors and disability insurance trust funds. Whether this \nwas an ominous sign of long-range intentions or whatever else might \nhave been involved, perhaps just sloppy bookkeeping at OMB, I leave for \nothers to determine. But it is an area of concern for those who have \nlooked at how these trust funds might be impacted.\n  In any case, the Congressional Budget Office, in which President \nClinton had, quite accurately, told the Nation to repose its trust, \nscored President Clinton's second budget as a loser. But even so, the \nPresident has never renounced it. In fact, he still refers to it on \noccasion, though only in passing, and he still cultivates the illusion \nthat he has offered Congress something to work with when really there \nis not much there except some broad principles.\n  I wonder how many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nbelieve that Clinton II is something with which we can work. Perhaps we \nshould find out. We will be casting scores of budget-related votes in \nthe weeks ahead, and a vote on Clinton II might well be one of them. \nThat would be a clear referendum on what the President has done and has \nnot done with regard to spending, taxes, Medicare and the deficit. I \nsuspect it would fail by a wide margin.\n  With all due respect to the Presidency and to President Clinton, the \noffice he holds has a way of insulating its occupants from the \nrealities the rest of us have to face. That is the most charitable \nexplanation I can devise from some of the things that are being said \nfrom the White House. For example, in a conference call with hospital \nadministrators last week, President Clinton opined that ``the budget \ncuts that Republicans are pushing in Congress are excessive and not \nnecessary--not necessary--to balance the budget.''\n  How would he propose to do it? Obviously, he does not propose to do \nit. His inaction in that regard is as unacceptable as his proposal just \nlast week that we move toward a grand compromise on spending and taxes \nby adopting the administration's economic projections. Never mind what \nhe said in the past to a joint session of Congress about the accuracy \nof the Congressional Budget Office as opposed to the politically \nslanted estimates that come from OMB. All of a sudden, we are being \ntold we have these big differences between what the Congress is trying \nto do and what the President wants to do, and the way to solve that \nproblem is just to have different economic assumptions.\n  I have seen that happen before, unfortunately, in previous \nadministrations and previous Congresses. It is not the way to do \nbusiness.\n  We have not come this far in fulfilling our pledges to the American \npeople just to cop out by using phony numbers. Speaker Gingrich spoke \nfor many of us in his response to the President when he said, ``This is \nexactly what's sick about this city. [Somebody says] Let's find another \nsmoke-and-mirrors. \n\n[[Page S 15183]]\nIt's only been, after all, 60 years of deficits.'' It is time to get \nthe job done.\n  Now, I am no stranger to differences between parties. We have a two-\nparty system. That is so we can have good, wholesome debates between \ncompeting programs. But eventually we need to vote and get the job \ndone, and I think we are prepared to do that.\n  We can take our politics straight up, face to face, but when that is \ndone, we have got to face the budget problems. We must deal with tax \nrelief for the American people, and we must move toward a balanced \nbudget.\n  Official Washington is looking toward mid-November for what is \ncommonly called a legislative train wreck. I think it is a misnomer, \nbut that's the term being used to describe a showdown over the budget, \nthe appropriations bills and the debt ceiling. I prefer to think of \nthat conjunction in a different way. I think of it as a day of \naccounting, a time when truth will finally prevail.\n  The President and his senior staffers have been talking a lot lately \nabout using the veto to block virtually everything that would move this \ncountry toward a balanced budget. President Clinton has made his veto \npen the last desperate defense of big government.\n  Over the past 20 years, I have watched the budgets we have dealt with \nand the appropriations bills. I don't remember a President threatening \nto veto appropriations bills because they did not spend enough. It was \nalways because Congress could not control its insatiable appetite in \nspending too much. Now we have a President who is threatening to veto \nalmost all the appropriations bills, with only one or two exceptions, \nbecause he wants more spending, increases over last year, increases \nthat will add to the deficit.\n  So we have a tough task before us. Many people wonder if we will be \nable to get the job done. I believe we will. I would like for it to be \ndone with cooperation between the two Houses of Congress, across the \naisle between the two parties, and, yes, with the President. I \nencourage the President to join us in this discussion.\n  This is a crucial time. Over the next few weeks we have to make tough \ndecisions. It is time that we engage. We need the President to get \ninvolved, to roll up his sleeves and say we are going to do what is \nright for our country's future.\n  Today Senate Republicans look both to the immediate opinion of the \nAmerican people and to the judgment of their posterity. It is, after \nall, our children and our grandchildren, most of all, for whom we are \ndoing this. They, rather than any party, will be the big winners in the \nreconciliation bill in 1995.\n  That is why I and my colleagues approach the arguments, the \ndecisions, and perhaps the crises ahead with a confidence that goes \nbeyond political assurance. Like the Quaker poet of the last century, \nJohn Greenleaf Whittier, said, we know we have ``the safe appeal of \ntruth to time.'' That is what this is all about. And now is the time \nfor historic decisions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. And I observe the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15181-6", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15183-S15184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEDICARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, with the press and all the reports and the \ndialog continuing on Medicare, I guess for most of us who are trying to \ndo some things to reform Medicare, to strengthen it and save the \nprogram, which has broad-based public support, we have become \nfrustrated about what is really at issue here. We know that there have \nbeen ways devised in order to save and strengthen the program and to \nincrease the spending on each beneficiary between now and the year \n2002.\n  With those that would be critical of the plan that has been put \nforward and with continuing to call what some would say are cuts in \nMedicare, then maybe we should approach it from a situation that maybe \nif you think it is a big cut, let us just freeze it, let us just freeze \nit at current levels. And I wonder if they would start counting the \napples that are in their basket.\n  You know, it seems to me that math is a funny subject to study. But, \nnonetheless, if you have 48 apples in your basket, and by the year 2002 \nwe are going to add some apples to that basket to where you have 67, in \nother words, 2\\1/2\\ apples--that is pretty tough to do, add a half \napple a year to your basket--that does not sound like a cut to me. It \nsounds like an increase to me. But the cost per beneficiary will go \nfrom $4,800 presently being spent per beneficiary to $6,700 in the year \n2002. That is under the plan that is presently called for in the budget \nresolution that passed this body and this Congress.\n  What started this whole debate is right here, this little report. Now \nwe cannot get very many of them because they did not print very many of \nthem. But it is the status of Social Security and Medicare programs \ndone by the trustees, of which four of the seven are President \nClinton's own appointees.\n  They said it pretty plainly, ``The Medicare Program is clearly \nunsustainable in its present form''--in this little report.\n  There have been other reports that have come out in the past that \nsaid Social Security will run out of money. Other reports say, in 2 \nyears, Medicare will run out of money. Those reports are OK, but this \none is a little bit different because next year is the first time in \nthe history of the Medicare Program, which is 30 years old this year, \nthe first time when we will be spending more money in outlays to the \nbeneficiaries than we have money coming in--for the first time. That \nchanges the debate a little bit, and it also should change the way we \nlook at this problem and the way we want to deal with it.\n  So the trustees say we have to do something about Medicare. Secretary \nof Health and Human Services Shalala, Secretary Reich of Labor, \nSecretary Rubin of Treasury, Commissioner of Social Security, Shirley \nChater, all appointees of President Clinton, said:\n\n       We feel strongly that comprehensive Medicare reforms should \n     be undertaken to make this program financially sound now and \n     over the long term.\n\n  We went through a situation in Montana, when I was a county \ncommissioner, of falling property values. We had an initiative passed \nin Montana that froze all property taxes, the mills that we could levy, \nand we were in pretty tough straits trying to finance county \ngovernment. That may not sound very important to us who work in this \ntown but, nonetheless, the people who live in our counties and our \ncities across the Nation would say that is pretty important because \nthat operates our schools, takes care of our sheriff departments, \npublic safety, our roads, bridges.\n  You had to act then to make some adjustments to our outlays, or we \nwould find ourselves in financial difficulty that we could not get \nourselves out of. If you do not take into consideration that next year \nwe will be paying out more than taking in, and as that escalates, \npretty soon if we go 2 or 3 years, then you will find even this \nGovernment will be incapable of dealing with the debt that has been \ncreated by overextension of payments out of the Medicare Program.\n  So, basically, what they said was that we had to take some actions \nnow.\n  Let me show another chart. They also said:\n\n       We strongly recommend that the crisis presented by the \n     financial condition of the Medicare trust funds be urgently \n     addressed on a comprehensive basis, including a review of the \n     program's financing methods, benefit provisions, and delivery \n     mechanisms.\n\n  In other words, let us take a look at the whole program, and we tried \nto do that.\n\n       Today, Medicaid and Medicare are going up three times the \n     rate of inflation. We propose to let it go up at two times \n     the rate of inflation. That is not a Medicare or Medicaid \n     cut. So when you hear all this business about cuts, let me \n     caution you that is not what is going on. We are going to \n     have increases in Medicare and Medicaid, and a reduction in \n     the rate of growth.\n\n  Guess who said that? President Clinton, October 5, 1993.\n  Who is fooling whom? We have to take a look at all of it. This is \nwhat the President wants. He is saying, let us limit the growth to 7 \npercent; the budget resolution says 6.4. We have an area where we can \nreally, really compromise and come up with a program. \n\n[[Page S 15184]]\n\n  So we have established that there are not going to be any cuts in \nMedicare. So how do we deal with it? We say, ``Mr. President, that is \nexactly what we have proposed in this Congress.'' So how is it that \nPresident Clinton proposes a reduced growth rate and it seems \nacceptable and yet, when the Republicans propose the exact same thing, \nit is splashed all over papers and televisions and all across our \nStates by the folks on the other side of the aisle as ``devastating \ncuts.'' I think it is time for a little fairness here, and I also \nadvise all of us, you cannot have it both ways.\n  So if you do not like the cuts, let us just freeze them. Think about \nthat for a little bit. We will freeze it at levels right now. I am \nwondering if that will be acceptable to the other side. The senior \nSenator from Montana recently wrote a guest column in the Missoula \npaper. He said, ``There is no crisis here.'' Their report clearly \nstates the crisis needs to be urgently addressed. It does not say we \nshould start to think about maybe making some changes. It says now is \nthe time to do it. That is, deal with it when we have the ability to \ndeal with it. We cannot stick our heads in the sand, not for very long \nanyway, because you know what is exposed the most.\n  We have to worry about the financing. Any savings in this plan--any \nsavings--even in part B, goes back into the plan. It can go nowhere \nelse. It must stay in the system of Medicare, either part A, which is \nthe hospital trust fund, or part B, which is the dollars. It has to \nstay there. Any savings goes back into the plan. It can go nowhere \nelse. It can finance no other part of government. So the trustees' \nreport requires us to act.\n  Anyone who says otherwise is not being very candid with the American \npeople. It is not being very honest if we are to preserve the system \nwhile expanding the choices the beneficiaries will have if we do \nnothing at all. With the proposal now on the table, spending continues \nto increase around 6.4 percent a year. That is twice the rate of \ninflation. That means spending per beneficiary will go from $4,800 a \nyear to $6,700 in just 7 short years. And I ask you, can that be a cut?\n  So when the other side and the media say we are cutting Medicare to \ngive tax cuts to the rich--we have heard all about that--it sells good \nbut it ``ain't'' necessarily so. In fact, it is not so.\n  A colleague of mine recently remarked the new Democratic mascot \nshould be the ostrich. We do not want to get into a situation like \nthat.\n  I also heard the expression other day that maybe it is not Medicare, \nmaybe it is ``Mediscare.'' Every day is Halloween for the other side, \nbecause they just like to scare folks.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, we are trying to be honest \nwith America, just honest with America. Get the figures down and make \nsure that we do what this report says we should do and also maybe \naccept some leadership from our President who said, yes, we have to do \nsome things, and he said it on October 5, 1993.\n  I do not think he is too far off the mark, and I do not think America \nthinks that either. I know we do not, and we have undertaken this very, \nvery seriously.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the 1994 elections were elections about \nreform. Those of us sent here by the people of America were asked to \nmake substantial changes in the way this body conducts business, the \nway in which Government is carried out in this country. The people \nasked us to make significant changes. In return, we made promises which \nresulted in their entrusting to us the sacred opportunity to serve the \npeople. The promises we made were important promises. They were \npromises to end politics as usual, to curtail an imperial Congress. \nThey were promises to balance the budget. They were promises to change \nthe welfare system profoundly.\n  Mr. President, I believe they were important promises. I believe they \nwere promises upon which the people relied, and have a substantial \nexpectation. We have made progress in satisfying those promises in a \nsignificant way.\n  Earlier this year, the American people were optimistic about our \nefforts, about our willingness to change Washington. This fall, though, \nthe American people tell a different story. Those who keep their finger \non the pulse of the American public have indicated a signal from the \npeople--a serious discomfort with what is coming. The public's faith in \ntheir elected officials has again plummeted to an all-time low. Once \nmore, Ross Perot, talks about putting an end to the two-party system, \nand once more he is heard.\n  What has happened? What is the reason for the new season of \ndiscontent? I believe it is, in part, because the people have asked us \nto commit to the reforms we promised and they feel that some of their \nagenda is being ignored. One of those agenda items which we have not \ndirectly addressed, that we have not spoken too clearly on, one that is \non the minds of the American people indelibly, is the idea and concept \nof term limits. People are familiar with that. Forty Governors have \nterm limits. Twenty-three States have, out of their own capacity and \nability, attempted to impose term limits on the Congress. They see the \nCongress as being a place which bogs down in beltway politics instead \nof reflecting the agenda of America, and does so because of individuals \nwho come here and just stay. Certainly, it is an agenda that the people \nexpected us to carry forward. Seventy-four percent of the people \nsupport the concept of term limits. They believe, and I believe, it \nought to be a part of the agenda of the 104th Congress.\n  Leadership is about the messages that we send, the signals we give--\nsignals not of rhetoric but of action, signals of real reform. Last \nMarch, our class came to the floor to support a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. We spoke of a common commitment to \nchange and a new day in the Congress. It mattered very little that we \nfell short of the 67 votes we needed. It was clear what we were doing \nand the depth of our commitment and the sense of our real dedication to \nthat objective. I think the people understood there were some who stood \nin the way of that objective. But what truly mattered was the signal we \nsent as a class. It was a signal of promises made and promises kept.\n  What matters is that we fought the fight, we kept the faith, we kept \nour promise, and we will keep moving toward that objective. We have \nalready moved toward the objective in the budget, and we are moving \ntoward the objective in the appropriations, and we will again move \ntoward that objective by way of a resolution to have a constitutional \namendment.\n  We must decide what signals we will be sending this fall as the \nAmerican people monitor our performance. It is out of concern for those \nsignals that I believe we should vote on a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment relating to the limitation of terms of Members of Congress. \nWe are talking about the number of terms people in the Congress can \nserve.\n  This afternoon, barring any legislative maneuvering, we will have a \nvote on that amendment. It will be the first time in 50 years that \nthere has been a vote on term limits in the U.S. Senate. I believe it \nwill be an important vote, it will be a historic vote. It does not \ncarry with it the power of law, so it is not a binding amendment. It \nis, however, an identifying amendment. It is the power of a clear and \nprincipled statement of the purpose and resolve of \n\n[[Page S 15185]]\nthis body to enact term limits, to provide the people of this country \nwith an opportunity to change the Constitution of this country, to \nreflect the fact that the biggest perk of all in Washington is the perk \nof incumbency. The playing field is so inordinately tilted toward \nincumbents that individuals from outside have a very difficult time \nchallenging.\n  I am glad that the majority leader has expressed his commitment to \nvoting on this sense-of-the-Senate term-limit amendment. We will send \nan important signal to the American people that we remain serious about \nserious reform, that we have an agenda which is the agenda of the \nAmerican people. We will again say that those of us who were sent here \nin 1994 made promises--promises that we will be keeping.\n  The promises we made are not options--they are commitments, they are \nour mandate. We did not cook up the idea of term limits as an election \ngimmick. Term limits are part of the fabric of the political philosophy \nof the same American people who have seen it work for hundreds of years \nat both the State and local level. They have seen it work when \nvoluntarily embraced by Presidents from George Washington forward. They \nhave enacted it into the Constitution of the United States in the 22d \namendment. They expect us to make it possible to enact term-limits into \nthe Constitution of the United States and provide real reform in the \nU.S. Congress.\n  Promises made, promises kept. These promises are not an option, they \nare our mandate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am recognized for 15 minutes, I \nunderstand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15184-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened this morning to a \ndiscussion about Medicare, and I want to make a couple of points about \nit, although that was not why I originally sought to take the floor \nthis morning.\n  It is interesting to me that people say this is not about politics. \nThis is about the sanctity of the Medicare Program, about the solvency \nof the Medicare Program. Nothing to do with tax cuts, tax cuts for the \naffluent, but the Medicare Program and its solvency.\n  I cannot resist pointing out when Medicare was initially offered, 97 \npercent of the Republicans voted against it. They did not like it. They \ndid not want it. We still have some today who think it is a terrible \nprogram, that it is tantamount to socialism.\n  Now, most people, including most Republicans, think the Medicare \nProgram is a pretty decent program and has been very helpful to people \nin this country.\n  No one should misunderstand what is going on here. No amount of \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate should be allowed to persuade \npeople this is something other than what it really is.\n  I brought a chart to the floor that describes what Kevin Phillips, a \nRepublican political analyst, noted author, noted Republican analyst, \nsays: ``The revolutionary ideology driving the new Republican Medicare \nproposal is also simple. Cut middle-class programs as much as possible \nand give the money back to private sector business, finance, and high-\nincome taxpayers.''\n  That is not from me. That is a description of what this is about from \na Republican.\n  Let me give another comment from Kevin Phillips--again, a Republican. \nThis is not a Democrat, but a Republican speaking. ``Let's be blunt. If \nthe Republican Medicare form proposal was a movie, its most appropriate \ntitle would be `Health Fraud II.' ''\n  Do not say that is a Democrat standing up attacking a Republican \nplan. This is a Republican telling us what the Republican plan is all \nabout.\n  I flew into Minot, ND, on Saturday morning this week. A lady at the \nairport asked if she could speak to me, and we stepped off to the side \nwhere there was a big crowd. She quietly began to ask me a couple of \nquestions.\n  She was probably 75 or 80 years old. As she began to speak, her chin \nbegan to tremble and quiver and she began to get tears in her eyes. She \nsaid, ``My husband is in a nursing home and he has been there 3 years. \nI am paying for the nursing home care. We had a few quarter sections of \nland. We owned a farm. I have sold most of that farm now to pay for his \nnursing home care. I cannot get Medicaid help for him, and now I am \nworried that I will lose my house and not be able to continue to live \nin my house.''\n  By then she was a person with tears in her eyes and expressing the \nanguish that a lot of Americans have about what is going on in this \ncountry. This is not about statistics or theory; this is about someone \nwho lives on a farm for 55 years, does not take, always contributes, \nalways helps, always extends and reaches out, and then they reach the \nend of their life and one spouse is in a nursing home and the other is \nworried about losing their home.\n  Or an Indian school that I visited not so long ago where children who \ncome from dysfunctional families, from backgrounds of alcoholism and \nchemical abuse, are trying to make a go of it and get an education, get \nsome therapy, get some help, told me about one little fourth grader \nwho, when she came to the Indian boarding school, would show up every \nday down at the school administrative office and ask whether a letter \nhad come from home.\n  ``Has a letter come from home?'' Every day they said, ``No, no letter \nfor you.'' Every day for weeks, the same routine. ``Has a letter come \nfrom home?'' Actually, her home was not her parents'. It was her aunt \nand uncle, because her parents were elsewhere. She was living with an \naunt and uncle. Finally, she stopped coming to the office to ask \nwhether a letter had come.\n  The last week of the school year she got her letter and it was the \n$5--$5 that she was given by her aunt and uncle for the year, $5 \nspending money that this poor little girl had counted on because they \nsaid they would try to send her some help. Every day she went to see \nwhether that money had come, but it had not. She finally got $5 at the \nend of the year.\n  That is the kind of human condition that exists in this country. \nPolicies are wonderful to debate here on the floor of the Senate, but \nwe are talking about little fourth graders, little kids whose lives are \nprofoundly impacted by public policies. We are talking about senior \ncitizens, 75 and 80-year-olds who fear that they will lose their home, \nwho fear they will not have health care, who fear they will get sick \nand have no money.\n  People say we are not cutting Medicare; it is growing. We will cut \n$270 billion from what is needed to fund Medicare at its current level. \nThat is a fact.\n  Yes, it will increase, but the fact is we will have more senior \ncitizens. That is why it is increasing. And you have health care \ninflation. That is why it is increasing. But the $270 billion necessary \nto provide the same kind of care will not be available.\n  They say this is not about anything other than trying to make the \nsystem work. This is about cutting taxes for the rich. That is what \nKevin Phillips, a Republican, says it is about. ``Let's be blunt. If \nthe Republican Medicare reform proposal was a movie, its most \nappropriate title would be `Health Fraud II.' ''\n  We will have more debate on Medicare. Do we need to make some \nadjustments? Yes. Should we take money out of the Medicare Program, a \nprogram that works and is so important to people, in order to provide a \ntax cut to Donald Trump, Ross Perot, and the folks who have it pretty \nwell in this country? I do not think so. That is not what we need to do \nat this point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15185-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15185-S15187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me turn to another subject. One of the \nthings that is interesting to me is why we are told daily in the \nnewspapers that the GDP, the gross domestic product, in America is up, \nour economy is moving forward and we are doing so well. The economists, \nsome politicians, say, gee, things are really moving along. We measure \nprogress in America \n\n[[Page S 15186]]\nby the gross domestic product. They say NAFTA and GATT--more jobs, more \nprogress. We are better off because the GDP goes up. Experts worship \nit. Economists worship at the altar of the GDP.\n  The Federal Reserve Board comes to the Congress in the last year and \na half and says the economy is growing too fast based on the GDP. What \nwe really need to do is create more unemployment and less economic \ngrowth. That is what we hear from some of these economists.\n  Why, when Americans are working longer and harder just to keep up, \nwhy are we told that things are so good, that the GDP is a measure of \nenormous progress?\n  Finally, there is a cover story in the recent issue of the Atlantic \nMonthly that provides some clue. It is called, ``If the Economy Is Up, \nWhy Is America Down?'' I urge my colleagues to read this article \nbecause it helps explain the big gap between what the economists talk \nabout in economic progress and what the American people feel or \nactually experience.\n  Economists, this article says, view the economy through kind of a \nwarped and myopic system, a counting system called the gross domestic \nproduct. The GDP was invented actually during the Second World War to \nguide the Nation's production through the Second World War. It is \nbasically a tool of planning of industrial policy that was never really \ndesigned to serve as a guide to how well the economy is doing, but that \nis how the experts, economists, and politicians use it here in \nWashington.\n  Essentially, the gross domestic product adds up everything Americans \nspend and declares that as the total good. The more money people have \nto spend, the better this weird accounting system says we are doing.\n  As a result, all of the pain and all the misery, the social \nbreakdown, shows up in the computer screens in Washington, DC, as \neconomic gain. The hundreds of billions of dollars that Americans spend \nto cope with crime, the lawyers, the social breakdown costs is all \nGDP--car crashes, fender benders in front of the Capitol--gross \ndomestic product increasing. Mr. President, $200 billion a year in \nrepair bills and hospital bills, car accidents give this country a real \nboost.\n  Americans lose some time with their children because wages are \nfalling, so they work longer these days, and both parents often have to \nwork. When the kids go into day care, that is more GDP. When the roads \nare so congested it takes more time to drive to work, the gas people \nburn in their car to sit and wait, that is more GDP.\n  The lists goes on. Almost everything Americans experience as bad \nshows up in the gross domestic product as good. They do not take \naccount--the economists--of the contribution of the family and the \nhousehold as an example.\n  It is a curious circumstance that the sectors of the economy which \nare crucial to economic well-being in this country, the social realm--\nthat is the economic functions performed by households, by the \ncommunities and all across the country, by people in their natural \nhabitat--those do not count. Those are not part of the national \naccounting system. Most of the Nation's important work that goes on, \nfrom caring for children to older people volunteering their work in \nmany different forms--that is the social glue in this country. Yet \nbecause no money changes hands, no one scores that. That is invisible \nto the conventional economists.\n  GDP does not count at all in these circumstances, because it means \nthe more our families and communities decline and a monetized service \nsector takes over, the more the GDP goes up and the more these \neconomists think our country is doing better. They count the poisons in \nour air and water as double gain, once when the factory spews it out \nand also, then, again when we have to buy bottled water and air \npurifiers to deal with it. Then the Government has to spend billions to \nclean up the Superfund site, so it gets counted again.\n  We are awash in this kind of phony accounting. It is like a gas gauge \non a car that goes up as your car is running out of gas. That is the \nproblem with the GDP measurement and, as the authors in the Atlantic \narticle point out, by the curious standards of the GDP, the Nation's \neconomic hero is a terminal cancer patient who is going through a \ndivorce. They say the happiest event is an earthquake or a hurricane.\n  I pointed out on the floor before that when hurricane Andrew came \nthrough and leveled Florida, the economists counted that as a one-half \nof 1 percent gain of the gross domestic product in our country. The \nsame phony accounting labels lead to political double-talk when you are \ntalking about GDP and what makes the economy tick. When politicians \nwant to push tax breaks for big corporations or for top executives, \nthey talk about growth, by which they mean GDP. When they want to earn \npolitical Brownie points, they blast Time Warner for gangsta rap, for \nexample. Gangsta rap is GDP.\n  Entertainment is one of the fastest growing parts of the economy and \nso is gambling and so is prison building. It is all GDP. So, when the \npoliticians say they want more GDP, what are they calling for, more \ntelevision programs with violence? That is GDP. Is there any \ndistinction between what is good and what is bad, what advances our \ncountry's interests and what retards it?\n  The family or business that uses this kind of a system to measure its \nprogress would not last very long at all. They would be bankrupt in a \nmonth. Yet, America has been making economic policy by using this \nindicator of progress for 50 years, and we need to change.\n  I do not agree with everything in the article that I referred to in \nthe Atlantic. Some things I disagree with. But I think it is a useful \nthing for us in this country to begin exploring. Does the gross \ndomestic product really measure anything, anything useful--a gross \ndomestic product that leaves out the value of the care that someone \ngives for a sick parent, that includes the value of the cleanup from a \nhurricane but does not include the damage from a hurricane, does not \ninclude the damage from a car accident?\n  You know, another economic all star with the GDP is someone with a \ncardiac problem. You talk about a heart attack, we are talking about \nreal GDP. The whole system swings into action with a heart attack, and \nthat advances the country's economic interests, right? Of course it \ndoes not. Of course it does not.\n  I hope my colleagues will read not only the Atlantic article, but I \nam going to include in the Record an article written by Lars-Erik \nNelson in the Daily News and an article in the Financial Times by \nMichael Prowse on this same issue.\n  This is an important issue, and I hope we will begin to look at it in \na thoughtful way and evaluate what do you measure to determine what \nadvances American economic interests.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have those articles printed \nin the Record, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Daily News, Sept. 29, 1995]\n\n               A Funky Way of Looking at U.S. ``Growth''\n\n       Washington--If the economy is growing as all the economists \n     tell us, why are Americans in such a foul mood? This is the \n     question that undermined Reaganomics, defeated President \n     George Bush and has President Clinton muttering about a \n     national funk.\n       And now we have an answer, both simple and blindingly \n     clear. The people are not wrong. The economists are. What \n     they measure as growth in the Gross Domestic Product is \n     merely increased spending--not what that spending actually \n     buys.\n       Under the currently accepted definition of growth, if you \n     sit stuck every day in a traffic jam, burning gasoline and \n     wasting your time, you are contributing to growth. If you \n     spend more and more money, $65 billion a year, to protect \n     your self against crime--locks, insurance policies, \n     replacement of stolen goods--that's growth.\n       The GDP does not care whether the money is spent for useful \n     purposes or for decay. Spending on food and pornography rank \n     equally. Divorce is a major contributor to our ``economic \n     growth'' since it piles up lawyers' fees, the cost of a \n     second home and counseling.\n       And the GDP assigns no value to intangibles like air \n     pollution or the loss of leisure time. If you're to busy to \n     cook or read stories for your children and so you buy them \n     prepared meals and leave them in front of a VCR that's \n     counted as pure economic growth.\n       This flash of insight is spelled out in the October \n     Atlantic Monthly by Clifford Cobb. Ted Halstead and Jonathan \n     Rowe, ``By the curious standard of the GDP,'' they write, \n     ``the nation's economic hero is a terminal \n\n[[Page S 15187]]\n     cancer patient who is going through a costly divorce. The happiest \n     event is an earthquake or a hurricane. The most desirable \n     habitat is a multi-billion-dollar Superfund site. All these \n     add to the GDP because they cause money to change hands.''\n       The most bizarre example is the $32 billion diet industry. \n     ``[The GDP] counts the food that people wish they didn't eat \n     and then the billions they spend to lose the added pounds \n     that result.''\n       Instead of GDP, the authors propose a different measure--a \n     Genuine Progress Indicator--that would total up the nation's \n     expenditures (including intangibles like the value of \n     parenting) and then subtract the obviously negative \n     components: costs of crimes, family breakdown, loss of \n     leisure time, commuting, automobile accidents, pollution and \n     environmental damage.\n       Lo and behold, they come up with figures--debatable to be \n     sure--indicating that in terms of genuine progress we have \n     not come very far since 1960. We have an abundance of gadgets \n     but the costs--in family breakdown, safe neighborhoods, good \n     public schools, jobs that let a single earner raise a \n     family--have offset the technological gains.\n       The ``growth'' myth has been a terrific weapon in \n     persuading Americans to accept a worse qualify of life NAFTA, \n     the Mexican trade agreement, is good for us because it will \n     add to ``growth''--never mind what it does to a community \n     that loses a factory. Cutting down old-growth forests adds to \n     growth. The gambling industry is growth. Gangster rap is \n     growth. ``Showgirls is growth. The millions spent on the O.J. \n     Simpson trial--it all adds to our economic ``growth''.\n       What the three authors have figured out is that we spend so \n     much of our incomes not to add to our quality of life but \n     merely to insulate ourselves from a world that has grown less \n     civil. We work harder, spend more, have less time, and the \n     economists tell us we are growing. No wonder there's a funk.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Financial Times, Oct. 2, 1995]\n\n                    Better Ways To Measure Progress\n\n       It may be time to consider new yardsticks of economic and \n     social progress. Gross domestic product has grown robustly \n     for years in the US and many other countries. Yet, ordinary \n     families believe they are worse off than in the past. The \n     official data do not appear to measure economic life as it is \n     experienced by real people. They ignore the ``feel bad'' \n     aspect of growth.\n       GDP has acquired an extraordinary aura of authority over \n     the years. Yet it is worth recalling that national accounts \n     in their present form were invented quite recently. They were \n     a response to the needs of the generation that endured the \n     Great Depression and fought in the second world war. The \n     priority then was to find ways of utilising spare resources, \n     first to combat unemployment and then to further the war \n     effort. A measure of ``final monetary demand'' was essential \n     if Keynesian policies were to succeed. GDP filled the bill \n     perfectly. And, in an age of slide rules, it was not \n     practicable to supplement it with more sophisticated measures \n     of economic well-being.\n       Today's needs are different. Our ability to sustain the \n     growth of monetary demand is not in question. The focus of \n     attention is now on ecological and social concerns. After \n     decades of rapid industrial expansion, we worry that growth \n     may inflict irreparable damage on the natural environment. We \n     also worry that the social fabric of nations is being ripped \n     apart. Economic growth will not bring happiness if the \n     quality of life is simultaneously being destroyed by social \n     shortcomings, such as rampant crime, family breakdown, \n     inadequate education and so forth.\n       The Roosevelt generation devised the statistical measures \n     it required to solve its problem. Should we not do the same? \n     This seems to be the thought underlying two recent attempts \n     to devise broader measures of economic well-being. A group at \n     the World Bank argues that economic health is best measured \n     by a broad yardstick of wealth or net worth, not by the \n     annual flow of monetary income. Instead of simply focusing on \n     ``produced assets''--the products of the market economy--it \n     draws attention to three other classes of assets: natural \n     capital (such as forests and mineral deposits); human \n     resources (the value represented by education) and social \n     capital (the value of human organisations and institutions).\n       A Californian think-tank called Redefining Progress has a \n     somewhat similar philosophy. It is promoting a new measure of \n     economic health called the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), \n     which adjusts for many social and ecological factors ignored \n     in GDP figures. The group has persuaded 400 US economists to \n     sign an anti-GDP manifesto stating that ``new indicators of \n     progress are urgently needed to guide our society: ones that \n     include the presently unpriced value of natural and social \n     capital''. Luminaries backing the GPI initiative include Prof \n     Herbert Simon, a Nobel economics laureate, Alvin Toffler, the \n     futurologist, and Ted Turner, the media magnate.\n       How economic well-being is measured makes a bigger \n     difference than you might suspect. Measured by per capita \n     GDP, the US is one of the world's richest nations. Yet it \n     ranks a poor 12th on the bank's per capita wealth measure, \n     behind countries such as Norway and Denmark. Per capita \n     GDP figures indicate that the US has been growing robustly \n     for decades. Per capita GPI, on the other hand, peaked in \n     1969 and has since fallen substantially.\n       These large discrepancies are not altogether surprising if \n     you remember that the alternative measures are trying to \n     capture wealth not reflected in monetary transactions. The \n     bank team discovered, to its surprise, that the value of \n     human resources-accounts for about two-thirds of the typical \n     nations's total wealth. One reason is that people tend to \n     become more valuable over time: they learn as they generate \n     income and so become capable of generating more income. \n     Produced assets such as durable goods and factories, by \n     contrast, rapidly become obsolescent. Yet this principal \n     source of national wealth is ignored in conventional national \n     accounts.\n       The rational for GPI is explored at length in the October \n     issue of the Atlantic Monthly magazine. The main reason why \n     it shows a decline in US economic welfare is because it \n     insists on fully accounting for the depletion of non-\n     renewable natural resources, the cost of pollution and many \n     other forms of environmental degradation not captured in GDP \n     figures.\n       But it also allows for many aspects of social welfare \n     ignored in official statistics, such as the economic value of \n     housework, volunteer labour and leisure time. It treats many \n     types of market transaction as negatives rather than \n     positives; for example the spending associated with crime, \n     family breakdown and commuting are regarded as costs not \n     benefits. It even adjusts for income distribution, deeming \n     greater inequality a negative for social and economic \n     progress.\n       I have reservations about all ``macro'' indicators. Any \n     attempt to measure ``social welfare'' involves a host of \n     subjective judgments. A measure such as GDP that fails to \n     value natural capital or non-market labour can hardly be \n     construed as neutral or objective. The issue is not whether \n     we have macro indicators, but whether we have indicators that \n     are relevant to people's needs. We cannot live forever on the \n     Roosevelt generation's intellectual capital. We have to move \n     beyond GDP.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

Mr. President, my purpose in requesting an hour was to \nshare with my freshman colleagues an opportunity to talk some about \nchange, an opportunity to talk about the real chance we have to bring \nabout change here in the next 3 weeks. So I intend to take 10 minutes \nand share the rest, then, with other members of the freshman and \nsophomore class. I wanted to talk just a little bit about change. I \nwanted to talk a little bit about the development of policy.\n  I must confess, I am concerned we are seeking increasingly to \nformulate public policy in this country based on something other than \nfacts, to formulate public policy based on what seems to be a marketing \ntechnique to oppose change. I want to talk about that just a little \nbit.\n  My friend from North Dakota just finished. He just finished talking \nin some areas I think are not factual, that I think probably do not \nrepresent where we are really going with policymaking in Medicare.\n  What we are doing is, those who are opposed to change in Medicare are \nseeking to use scare tactics to cause people to think Medicare is going \nout the window, we are not going to do it, when the fact is if we do \nnot make some changes, then we will lose Medicare. Those of us who want \nMedicare for the elderly, for those of us who want Medicare soon for \nourselves and others, know you have to make some changes. The idea we \nare going to cut and ravage Medicare just is not true. Whether it is \nPhillips or whoever it is, the fact is that the spending is going to \nincrease. What we are talking about doing is changing a growth pattern \nthat is not maintainable--more than 10 percent--bringing it down to 6.5 \npercent.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, inasmuch as the Senator from Wyoming \nmentioned my name, I wonder if I might just ask the Senator from \nWyoming a brief question. If the Senator from Wyoming believes----\n  Mr. THOMAS. The Senator has had his time. I really do not yield to \nhim. I would like to go ahead and make my presentation, sir. You have \nmade yours.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The only reason I ask the question is the Senator from \nWyoming suggested they were not facts coming from this side; in fact, \nwe were misstating facts. I wonder if the Senator would be prepared \nduring the hour at some point to discuss specifically \n\n[[Page S 15188]]\nwhat he means by that, so we can discuss what he means is factual and \nnot factual.\n  Mr. THOMAS. If the Senator will yield back my time, I will be happy \nto, because I intend to do that. We are talking here that it is being \ndone to save taxes. That is not true. That is just not true. If there \nwas no budget crisis at all, if there were no tax reductions being \ntalked about, you have to do something with part A of Medicare. Kevin \nPhillips and others seem to ignore that.\n  The fact is, the money that goes into part A of Medicare is taken \nfrom your salary and mine, 2.9 percent, and goes into this fund. And \nthis fund, according to the trustees, three out of six of whom are \nCabinet members, they say that by the year 2002 that fund will be \npaying out more than it is taking in. That is a fact.\n  The fact is, even if you did not have anything to do with the budget, \nyou would have to do something if you want to continue to have Medicare \nbased on that premise of paying for part A from what is withheld from \nsalary and from the employer. That is a fact.\n  So, that is where we are. The people who oppose change do not talk \nabout that. They get into this tax thing, which really, really has \nnothing to do with it. And, on the contrary, the opposite is they do \nnot have any suggestions. They simply want to complain about the idea \nthat people are saying we need to make some changes there. And our \nfriends stand up and say ``Oh, yes, we need to make changes,'' and then \nresist every change that is made.\n  So, I think we need to start talking a little more about the facts \nand get a little off this idea of a marketing rhetoric that is \ndesigned, simply, to oppose what it is we are doing. We have a basic \ndifference in philosophy. I understand that. That is perfectly \nlegitimate. That is what elections are about. That is what two parties \nare about.\n  I happen to think we are better with less government and less taxes, \nand trying to find a way to reduce the costs of Medicare, not to simply \nfind more money to put in it.\n  Do you want to talk about fraud? The Senator mentioned fraud. Most \nexperts indicate that there is $30 billion of fraud in Medicare now. So \nI feel very strongly that, if we are going to have public policy that \nis good public policy for all of us, public policy needs to be made \nbased on some facts and not simply some kind of marketing technique.\n  The other is change. Mr. President, we have a great opportunity now \nto make change. We have an opportunity in the next several weeks to \nfinish the job the American voters asked us to start last November, to \nfinish the job we said we would do: To have a less intrusive \nGovernment, to have a Government that costs less, to have a Government \nwhere the programs that are in place have been evaluated in terms of \ntheir effectiveness, whether or not the expenditure of taxpayers' money \nis getting to the people it is designed to assist. For a program such \nas welfare, the job is evaluating whether it is indeed accomplishing \nwhat it set about to do, and that is to help people who need help and \nthen to help those people into a position to help themselves. Is that \nhappening? The answer is no.\n  So, if you would like to have different results, I think it is \nimperative that you change. It is pretty hopeless to look for something \nto happen, to continue to do the same thing and expect different \nresults. Mr. President, that does not happen.\n  We have a great opportunity in the next several weeks to talk about \nfundamental change for the first time in 40 years; for the first time \nin 25 years, to balance the budget. Who would argue with the idea that \nwe need to balance the budget, that it is not morally and fiscally \nresponsible to balance the budget? We hear that--yes, yes, that is a \ngood thing to do. But, when we seek to do it, all we hear is resistance \nto it.\n  We are going to do that. We are going to save Medicare, and Medicare \nhas to be changed to be saved. We are going to reform welfare. These \nare the things we are setting about, necessarily, to do.\n  It is tough when you talk about change. It is hard to change the \ndirection of Government. It is increasingly difficult as the Government \nis in more and more programs, that more and more people are involved in \nlobbying for those programs, that more and more people are involved in \nthe bureaucracy that supports those programs. So it is difficult to \nmake change.\n  Change is what President Clinton talked about almost 3 years ago when \nhe was elected. Has he brought about change? The biggest change was the \nlargest tax increase we have had in the history of this country. But I \nthink change was the basis for the 1994 elections. I think change is \nsomething that almost everybody embraces, but it is difficult to do, \nand I do understand that. But if we are to have different results, we \nhave to change the way we do things.\n  Mr. President, we have worked now for a number of months. We are down \nto the critical decision time, when all this work now will result in a \ndecision and we will decide whether we are going to balance the budget. \nWe will decide what kind of country we want to transfer to our kids and \ntheir kids, as we go into another century.\n  What happens if we do not? In a few weeks we will be talking about \nvoting on a debt extension to $5 trillion. In just a year or two, \nunless we change, we will find that all the available tax revenues will \nbe used for entitlements and interest on the debt. If we do not change, \nwe will not have a Medicare Program by the year 2002.\n  So, change is not an option, in my view. Change is exactly what has \nto be done, and, of course, there are different views of how you do it. \nBut the idea that you use a marketing rhetoric designed to scare people \nand say change will devastate the programs that the country is \ncommitted to carrying out just is not the case.\n  I think we need to continue to say, here are the good things that \nhappen when we balance the budget and ultimately reduce the amount of \nmoney we take out of families to pay for Government. We can reduce the \ngrowing inflation. We can create more jobs by putting more dollars into \nthe private sector. And we can be more effective in what we do.\n  So we are talking about change. We are talking about public policy \nbased on facts. We disagree, then, as to the remedy. But we ought to \nstart, at least, by recognizing these facts that are there, that are \ndescribed not by the Members of Congress but by the trustees of \nMedicare.\n  Mr. President, our time is to be shared among several of our freshman \ncolleagues, so I would like now to yield to my colleague and friend \nfrom Georgia. And he then will be followed by another. I yield to the \nSenator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15187-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15188-S15189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISTORIC DECISIONMAKING\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as my good colleague from Wyoming has \nnoted, the contemporary custodians of this great democracy are coming \nupon a decision in the next several weeks that will be historic. For \nthe first time, we will be considering major questions with regard to \nhow we are going to govern ourselves. We will be taking under \nadvisement major changes. We will be talking about balancing the budget \nfor the first time in 32 years. We will be talking about dramatically \nchanging the welfare system that has been developed over the last 30 or \n40 years. We will have before us a proposal to protect Medicare, and we \nwill be talking about lowering the economic burden on every working \nfamily and business by lowering taxes.\n  Obviously, when you are talking about changes of this magnitude, \nwhich I believe the vast majority of Americans believe should occur, \nthey want taxes lowered. They are tired of a welfare program that does \nnot work. They cannot believe we do not balance our budgets, and they \nare worried about a Medicare Program that is collapsing.\n  In the midst of this, of course, you will have very adversarial \ndebate, contentious debate. Essentially, the debate is centered between \ntwo very different ideas about governing America. On the one hand, \nmostly on the other side of the aisle, we have defenders of Washington \nas it is, that we should not balance our budgets, it is too difficult \nto balance our budgets; we do not need \n\n[[Page S 15189]]\nto lower taxes--in fact, we should raise them; Medicare is just fine \nthe way it is, put a Band-Aid on it and it will be OK; and we ought to \nleave the welfare system just the way it is today. Obviously, these two \nviews take the country into the new century very differently. If we \nleave things the way they are, I think we are turning our back on the \nAmerican people.\n  Coming back to my point, though, about the contentious debate, I was \nwith a group of people from my State last week. I was very interested, \nas they tried to sort out these two presentations, change or leave it \nthe way it is, and I purposely asked them were they aware of the \nMedicare trustees' report? They really were not.\n  Then I asked them: Do you know about the bipartisan entitlement \ncommission work that was issued earlier this year? They had not even \nheard of that.\n  So the point I would like to make this morning to every citizen who \nmay be listening is, in addition to listening to this debate, which is \nhistoric, on their own they ought to get a copy of the bipartisan \nentitlement commission report, which was chaired by Senator Kerrey, a \nDemocrat, and Senator Danforth, a Republican, appointed by President \nClinton, and they should for themselves read the report, or scan it. \nBeyond listening to the debate going on back and forth, go get a copy \nof the report. It was issued early this year. Get a copy of the \nMedicare trustees' report for themselves and their family and look at \nwhat it says. That is not a political ad. That is not a political \nspeech. That is just an objective statement about the condition of the \nfinancial affairs of the United States. Read it for yourselves. You can \nskip the ads. You can almost skip these debates, but just look at the \ndocuments themselves among your own family.\n  What does the bipartisan entitlement commission report say? It says \nthat within 10 years, maybe 8, maybe 12, all U.S. resources are \nexhausted--all of our revenues, the vast revenues of the United States \nare exhausted--by just five expenditures.\n  The five expenditures are: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, \nFederal retirement, and the interest on our debt. And then there is \nnothing left. So we will not be arguing about the size of the Defense \nDepartment; there will not be one. And the debate that went on in the \nHouse about school lunches, we will not have to worry about that; there \nwill not be enough to deal with it.\n  Five expenditures; nothing left. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, \nFederal retirement, and the interest on our debt, and it is all gone. \nThat ought to be a wakeup call for anybody.\n  Now, the Medicare trustees' report came out in April. It says the \nfirst entitlement to run out is Medicare in 2001, 6 years and it is all \nover; there will not be any money to write a check. And then it goes on \nto say the Congress and the President need to take bold and corrective \nactions to make this program solvent.\n  The balanced budget that we will be dealing with in the next 3 to 4 \nweeks attacks all of these issues. It balanced the budget so it quits \nadding debt. That is a plus. It takes Medicare and tries to reconfigure \nit, save money, so that it stays solvent longer. That is a plus. It \ntakes Medicaid and starts to restructure it and move it to the States \nso that it can be more efficiently run. That is a plus. It lowers \ntaxes, which expands the economy, which makes it easier for us to deal \nwith these problems. That is a plus.\n  Now, meanwhile, the President first said he was not going to give us \na budget. Then he gave us a budget that was unbalanced as far as the \neye could see. And then he said, ``I'm going to give you a balanced \nbudget. It will balance in 10 years.'' He has gone across the country \nsaying that. And the Congressional Budget Office says that is phony, \nthat that budget does not balance in 5 years, which he promised when he \nran for President. It does not balance in 7 years, like the majority of \nthis Congress is trying to do. And it does not balance in 10 years like \nhe said it does. It is never balanced.\n  I do not think you have to be a math major to understand that if you \njust keep submitting budget after budget and it never balances, we are \nnot going to solve these problems that these two reports have told \nAmerica about.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, let me just say that while these are \nsober messages and this is an important debate, we ought to remember \nthat if the United States, this great democracy, this only superpower, \ntakes control of its own finances and manages them, we will create \nunlimited opportunity for America as it comes into the new century. And \nwe will start reaping the benefits very quickly.\n  We are going to lower interest rates because our budgets are \nbalanced. That means every family that buys a car, borrows money to \neducate, or buys a refrigerator or new home saves money that they can \nuse to carry out their mission in their own family. It means we are \ngoing to create millions of new jobs. And it means America is going to \nbe strong when it comes into the new century, able to defend itself and \nits stature in the world and make this a more peaceful world and a more \nsecure world for every son and daughter of America and the world \nitself.\n  Mr. President, we have everything to gain and everything to lose. And \nthe decision about what this country is going to be as we get into the \nnew century is going to be made on our watch. I like to tell Americans \nwhenever I am speaking to them that they are sitting next to the \nAmerican right now that is going to make the decision. We cannot pass \nthis to another generation. We are going to make this decision.\n  If we do it right, we will have done what every generation of \nAmericans has done, protected the great democracy and given it to the \nfuture with broader and greater opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15188-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15189-S15190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as an author of the $500 per child tax \ncredit, I want to join other Republicans this morning and am very \npleased to express my support for the Senate Finance Committee's tax-\ncut package. I want to congratulate the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, for keeping his pledge to fight for the entire \n$245 billion tax-cut package and also for making the $500 per child tax \ncredit the centerpiece of the committee's plan.\n  This plan represents the true change that the American voters called \nfor last November. Contrary to the longstanding belief inside the \nWashington beltway, tax dollars do not belong to the Government; they \nbelong to the taxpayers. Cutting taxes is not some kind of reward to \nthe American people; it is rightfully their money to keep.\n  Now, when I introduced the $500 per child tax credit as part of my \nFamily First legislation in 1993, I had high expectations, but I never \nthought we would make so much progress so quickly. But then, again, I \nnever counted on a revolution in 1994.\n  As we Americans know, revolutions do occur over tax policy. Just \nthink of the Boston Tea Party, which paved the way toward the American \nRevolution, which was staged over a tax of just one-half of 1 percent. \nNow, that does not seem like much when it is compared to the \nPresident's $255 billion tax hike that we were fighting just 2 years \nago, the largest tax increase in American history.\n  Then came November 1994, a second American revolution, which turned \nthe Washington elite on their heads. With it, along with the dramatic \nchange demanded by the voters, comes the opportunity to disprove the \nliberals' well-worn philosophy that your salary somehow belongs to the \nGovernment. With just one election the American people stopped this \ntax-and-spend trend in its tracks, and it reminded Washington to get \noff our backs and to get out of our back pockets.\n  By passing the $500 per child tax credit, the Senate will give nearly \n$500 million a year in tax relief to families in Minnesota every year. \nIt will be $25 billion in tax relief for Americans across this country \nevery year. And the benefits of this tax credit will be directed where \nit is needed most, and that is to the middle-class Minnesotans and all \nAmericans who work hard, pay their bills, and finance the Federal \nGovernment with their tax dollars.\n  But most important, we will keep the promises we made to the American \npeople. Minnesotans elected me to the \n\n[[Page S 15190]]\nSenate to balance the budget, reduce the size of Government, and to \nallow average working-class people to keep more of their hard-earned \ntax dollars. And the passage of the $500 per child tax credit is the \nbest message that we can send that our promises will be kept.\n  While we still may need to work out all the details of this plan, we \nshould all agree on the overall thrust of empowering people, not \nGovernment; rewarding taxpayers, not the bureaucrats; and take money \nout of Washington and leave it in the hands of the people who have \nearned it.\n  We cannot back down now. We must continue to push ahead in spite of \nthe criticism that is aimed our way by the defenders of the status quo. \nThey will try to chip away at this tax cut in an attempt to maintain \nthe grip that they have held on your salary for the past 40 years. So I \nencourage my colleagues to resist these attacks, to be proud of our \nefforts to cut taxes, because it is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I again commend Chairman Roth and the majority leader \nfor producing this tax package. I look forward to supporting a balanced \nbudget and a $245 billion tax-cut plan here on the Senate floor. We can \ndo both. We must. We will cut taxes and we will balance the budget this \nyear.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15189-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15190-S15191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, earlier this year the Congress had the \nopportunity to pass the balanced budget amendment and put an end to \nchronic budget deficits. As we know, the amendment failed by a single \nvote. A number of those who opposed it did so saying it was not needed, \nthat Congress could balance the budget if only it had the courage and \nthe will to do so.\n  Well, those of us who heard the message that the American people sent \nso loudly and clearly just about a year ago pledged that with or \nwithout the balanced budget amendment, we would work to balance the \nbudget by the year 2002, just as we promised the American people last \nfall. Failing to address the budget problem not only threatens the \neconomic well-being of generations to come, but also the ability of our \nGovernment today to respond to our needs.\n\n  The national debt now amounts to about $18,500 for every man, woman, \nand child in the country. In 1994, every American paid an average of \nabout $800 in taxes just to pay the interest on the national accident. \nMy new grandson, born just 5 months ago, can expect to pay $187,000 in \nhis lifetime just to service the debt, just to pay the interest on the \ndebt. I cannot look at him without thinking of that obligation, without \nthinking of our responsibility to every child like him where this \nCongress and the Congresses before us have run up the credit card debt \nand, in effect, as we leave the stage, we will be handing that to our \nchildren and our grandchildren. It is immoral, Mr. President.\n  The gross interest on the national debt will amount to nearly $300 \nbillion this year. That is $300 billion of lost opportunity now, money \nthat cannot be spent on health care or housing for the poor, nutrition, \nlaw enforcement, and defense--anything else. We cannot afford not to \nbalance the budget given these realities.\n  A failure to balance the budget means condemning our children and \ngrandchildren to a declining standard of living just because we are \nunwilling to pay our bills today.\n  Balancing the budget will not only pay dividends to future \ngenerations in that they will have less in taxes to service the debt \nand thus get more out of their Government for every dollar they pay, it \nwill also pay dividends to our generation as well.\n  The Congressional Budget Office predicts that a balanced budget by \nthe year 2002 would facilitate a reduction in long-term real interest \nrates of between 1 and 2 percent.\n  For business, a 2-percent interest rate reduction would result in \nlower investment costs, opening up new opportunities for job creation \nand business expansion.\n  A 2-percent reduction on a typical 30-year $80,000 mortgage would \nsave homeowners $107 a month, that is $1,284 a year, or over $38,000 \nover the life of the mortgage.\n  A 2-percent reduction in interest rates on a 4-year $15,000 new car \nloan would save the car buyer $676.\n  A 2-percent reduction on a typical 10-year student loan for a 4-year \nprivate college would save students and their parents nearly $9,000 in \ninterest costs, an 8.5-percent cost reduction.\n  Critics will not argue these points, but they are not willing to make \nthe difficult choices to balance the budget either. They are avoiding \ntheir responsibility.\n  Frankly, as the Senator from Georgia pointed out a moment ago, \nPresident Clinton has no plan to balance the budget and, therefore, \nmust accept key responsibility today. The CBO projects that the \nPresident's so-called balanced budget plan would result in $200 billion \nannual deficits for the foreseeable future. So that is not an \nalternative.\n  Let us put the Republican budget into perspective. This year, the \nFederal Government will spend about $1.59 trillion, a sum of money that \nnone of us can really comprehend, Mr. President, but that is \n$1,590,000,000,000.\n  In 7 years, by the year 2002, we will be spending $1.88 trillion--\n$1,880,000,000,000 that is an additional $300 million, or an increase \nof 18 percent.\n  One of the areas of growth is Medicare. Even under the Republican \nbudget, Medicare spending will rise from about $178 billion this year \nto $274 billion in the fiscal year 2002, that is an average increase of \nabout 6.4 percent per year. Medicare spending will be 54 percent higher \nby the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, I was just informed before I came over to the floor \nthat my office has begun receiving a lot of telephone calls from \nseniors who have received a bulletin from the AARP warning of a cut in \nMedicare. With all due respect to the people who prepared that \nbulletin, I think we need to assure the senior citizens of this country \nthat that bulletin is wrong; that they need not be worried about a cut \nin Medicare because, as I just said, under the budget that is being \ncriticized, Medicare spending will rise from $178 billion today to $274 \nbillion 7 years from now. In other words, we will be spending 50 \npercent more in 7 years than we spend today.\n  Total Medicare spending will be $1.6 trillion over the next 7 years, \n73 percent higher than what was spent over the previous 7 years. And on \naverage, per beneficiary, Medicare spending will increase from about \n$4,800 per person this year to $6,700 by the year 2002. That is a \n$1,900 increase. I think that it is totally irresponsible for any \norganization to be scaring America's senior citizens, asserting that a \n$1,900 increase is a cut.\n  The money that we are spending on Medicare is a lot of money, but we \nbelieve it is necessary to care for our senior citizens. We also know \nthat it is necessary to prevent the Medicare Program from going broke. \nThe Republican budget will slow the growth in Medicare because the \nMedicare trustees have warned us that without doing so, the system will \ngo broke.\n  But are we cutting the growth in Medicare in order to pay for tax \ncuts for the rich? No. Revenues in fiscal year 1996 are projected to be \n$1.4 trillion. By 2002, they will total $1.88 trillion. That is 34 \npercent more than this year. So revenues to the Federal Treasury are \nincreasing, not declining. We are proposing that those revenues just \nnot increase quite so much, just like we are proposing that spending \njust not increase by quite so much; that a tax cut is not reducing the \nrevenues to the Federal Treasury. They are still going up by 34 \npercent.\n  Many in the opposition do not want to concede that Medicare spending \nconstraint is needed because, frankly, they like big Government--the \nGovernment that chooses the doctors people see, the procedures that \nthey perform. They do not want to see tax relief because it deprives \nthem of the revenue to expand Government even further into our lives.\n  Let me conclude by talking for a moment about our proposed tax cuts. \nTax relief is really the dividend we are giving the American people \nfrom the downsizing of the other parts of the Government: The $200 \nmillion reduction in the congressional budget, which the President has \nvetoed; elimination of the Commerce Department, which he \n\n[[Page S 15191]]\nthreatens to veto; reforming welfare to get people back to work, to \nstrengthen families and force deadbeat dads to pay support; and \nconsolidate and eliminate other programs. So the tax relief is the \ndividend to the American people for Congress downsizing this \nGovernment.\n  Some oppose tax relief because they do not believe the American \npeople can make better decisions on how to spend the money that they \nworked so hard to earn. The Republican Party puts faith in the American \npeople and the States. I would not be rich but I would be wealthier \nthan I am if I had a dollar for every time somebody on the other side \nof the aisle proclaimed that it was necessary for the Federal \nGovernment to make these decisions because we cannot trust the States.\n  Mr. President, you and I know it is a whole lot easier to influence \ndirectly the people at the State and local levels who are making the \ndecisions than it is to get the Federal Government to slow down, to \nchange direction and to begin moving in the right direction.\n  The opposition's bottom line is, support big Government. They do not \nwant to see programs and agencies eliminated. But the bottom line is \nthat the Government is the problem. As Bill Bennett, former Education \nSecretary said earlier this year in testimony before the Senate Budget \nCommittee:\n\n       We have created a nanny state that takes too much from us \n     in order to do too much for us. This has created \n     inefficiency, sapped individual responsibility, and intruded \n     on personal liberty.\n\n  Mr. President, I could not say it better. It is time for us to take a \nstand. Congress cannot duck its responsibility and neither can the \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTennessee has 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15190-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE REPUBLICAN COMMITMENT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to join my freshman Republican \ncolleagues in discussing further the Republican commitment to the \nAmerican people, initially made last year in the elections and carried \nthrough to today. We promised essentially four things: to balance the \nFederal budget, and to do that in 7 years; to end welfare as we know \nit; to save Medicare, to have the courage to save Medicare and, at the \nsame time, as pointed out by my colleague from Arizona, to strengthen \nMedicare and preserve it for that next generation, and to not just put \nBand-Aids on a system that is literally hemorrhaging but to prepare \nthat system and strengthen that system on into the next century; \nfourth, to reduce taxes in a way that provides relief to families with \nchildren, allowing them to keep some of the money they have earned in \ntheir own pockets, and to stimulate growth and generate jobs.\n  The bottom line is very clearly that the future of our Nation and the \nfuture of our children depends upon whether we have the courage to \nbalance the budget, to save Medicare, to strengthen Medicare, to end \nwelfare as we know it, and to give some degree of tax relief.\n  The current path of this country leads to uncontrolled Federal \nspending and borrowing, skyrocketing annual deficits--$200 to $300 \nbillion by the year 2000 and even higher deficits thereafter. In fact, \nthe deficit spending increases approximately $320,000 every minute, \nwhich means just in the short period of time that I have been talking, \nit has increased about a million dollars.\n  Our current path leads to another $1.2 trillion added to our national \ndebt. It is unacceptable. It will bring, by the year 2000, that debt to \nabout $6.7 trillion. Our current path, if we were to do nothing, leaves \na Medicare Program that goes broke, a Medicaid Program that doubles in \nsize, with no tax base that can support that.\n  Our current path, if we do nothing, leads to an enormous, \nunsustainable tax burden on young workers, on our children today, who \nwill be forced to face an 82-percent tax burden over the course of \ntheir lives. Unless we do something, and do something courageously and \naggressively, our current path will lead to the first generation of \nAmericans in our history who have fewer opportunities than their \nparents.\n  What will happen if we balance the budget? The Senator from Arizona \npointed out a number of interesting facts. Again, we have to face the \ntruth. We have to return to see what the facts actually are. A lot of \nscare tactics are being used today--especially in the field of health \ncare, against our seniors--which are in essence, I think, cruel. In \nthat same debate, we have to come back to the facts of what can be \naccomplished, what the realities are today.\n  Similarly, by just balancing the budget, what are the facts? \nEconomists calculate, again--everyone that has come through--that \ninterest rates will fall incrementally by 1 to 2 percent once we \nbalance the budget. The higher interest rate people pay today because \nof the debt means that people pay more for car loans, for mortgages, \nfor credit card balances, and for equipment for their small businesses.\n  Thus, if we can balance the budget--and we need to do it within 7 \nyears, again, with no phony numbers, but accurate numbers--we can do \nthe following: lower interest rates, which to the average family will \nmean that they can save as much as $1,200 each year on a $75,000, 30-\nyear mortgage. It means on the purchase of a car, say $15,000, over the \nlife of that loan a family will be able to keep $1,000 additionally in \ntheir pocket to invest, put in their small business or to put in \neducation. For a typical credit card balance of $1,800--which is what \nit is in this country--an individual or family will save $36 per year \nby just balancing the budget. Over the next 6 to 8 weeks, the blueprint \nwill be out there. A family can save as much as $1,100 over the life of \na loan on a small business or for a typical piece of farm equipment.\n  For business, lower interest rates will mean that businesses--by \nthat, I mean small businesses--one- and two-person operations, as well \nas large businesses--will be able to grow because an investment will \ncost less. Profit margins will exist or be higher. Short-term loans \nwill be less expensive. Inventories will cost less to store. Expansion \nwill increase and innovation will be less costly.\n  By simply putting a blueprint out there in law over the next 6 to 8 \nweeks to balance the budget, we will also, in addition to allowing \ninterest rates to come down, allow businesses to grow, new jobs to be \ncreated. And as businesses invest and grow and our Nation's output \nbegins to rise, opportunities for every American will expand. According \nto recent studies, as many as 6 million new jobs--new jobs--will be \ncreated.\n  According to a well-known economic forecasting firm, if we balance \nthe budget by the year 2002, the gross national product will be $170 \nbillion higher than if we do nothing and we do not balance the budget. \nThat represents, overall, a 2.5-percent increase in productivity for \nbusinesses. That translates down to an average family's standard of \nliving being increased by about $1,000 a year.\n  What does it take? Courage. It takes us acting as elected \nrepresentatives in a responsible way. The outcome of the budget battle \nwill clearly determine in what direction our country will move for the \nremainder of this century, the next 6 years, but also well into the \nnext. It will take the courage of each of us, the President of the \nUnited States, every Member of Congress, and every American citizen, to \nmake sure that the direction we choose is the right one.\n  We will either have the courage to make tough choices, to face facts, \nso we can march into the future secure in the knowledge that the \npromise of America will be as bright for our children as it was for our \nparents.\n  The alternative is to sink deeper and deeper into debt, until the \ndespair that many Americans now register in the polls will be \njustified. The President talks a lot about common ground today, but \nreally what this country needs is common sense--common sense and the \ncourage to carry out the blueprint.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15191-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15191-S15192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE MISSION BEFORE US\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to join today with my freshman \nand sophomore colleagues to talk about the mission before us here in \nthe next several weeks. We here in the Senate, and in the House, and \nthe American public are now focused on the mission at hand, which is to \ntry to balance \n\n[[Page S 15192]]\nthis budget over the next 7 years and come up with a plan for reforming \na number of areas of Government.\n  It is, I think, one of the most important times in our country's \nhistory, certainly from a financial standpoint and a long-term economic \nsecurity standpoint. I think this debate is as important as the debate \nthat occurred during the Great Depression when we were trying to right \nthe ship of state and preserve a long-term future during that crisis.\n  We are at a similar crisis, I believe, in our country's time, with \nthe mountains of debt that we continue to pile up, and, really, no end \nis in sight. The fact is that we have over half of our Government on \nautomatic pilot, spending money without any idea of how much it is \ngoing to go up. We have projections that Medicare is going to go up 10 \npercent a year, Medicare 8 percent a year, whatever the case may be. \nBut we do not know what it is. We add up the bills at the end of the \nyear and that is what we pay out.\n  Can you imagine a family or a business saying, well, half of the \nmoney we spend, we have absolutely no idea what it is going to be at \nthe end of the year because we promised people we were going to pay \nthese things, and whether we have enough money or not, it does not \nmatter because we promised we were going to pay it. That is the \ninsanity we are in that causes the deficits to be at this level--now \nalmost $5 trillion in the national debt.\n  We have an opportunity to do something about that now. It is really \nthe first time since I have been in the Congress--I was in the House 4 \nyears prior to coming to the Senate. This is the first chance I have \nhad to seriously address the issue which, when I first got elected to \nthe House of Representatives, I promised I would come down here and \ndo--to do things differently, to put our fiscal house in order, to \nestablish America--as many speakers here talked about the moral \nauthority of a Government that lived within its means and understands \nthat we cannot continue to tax and penalize and put through very \ndifficult times, because of the excesses of today. I think we have that \nmoral obligation to act from that perspective.\n\n  We also have an obligation, I think, a moral obligation, to act from \nthe perspective that we promised. We promised back in 1994--and many of \nus who ran for office promised many times throughout our careers--we \npromised to come to Washington and seek to balance the budget.\n  It is not an easy thing to do. I think if it was easy, it would have \nbeen done a long time ago. It is difficult. I think the American public \nunderstands it is difficult. But we promised. We have a Contract With \nAmerica that says we will balance the budget.\n  I think almost every Member on this side, and I know many Members on \nthe other side when they ran for election talked about how crucial it \nwas for the long-term future of this country to get our fiscal house in \norder and to balance the budget. We promised.\n  You can put up all the arguments, charts, and graphs and say we \nshould do this because it will help future generations, we are going to \ndo this because it will lower interest rates or it will create more \neconomic growth, or we will get rid of wasteful programs or create more \nfreedom and opportunity, we will reform the welfare system, we will \nsave Medicare.\n  Those are all very good reasons to balance the budget. All very good \nreasons why we should act on the reconciliation package that will be \ncoming up in the next several weeks. I have listed only a few. There \nare innumerable reasons why we should balance this budget. Possibly \nparamount among all of those is the fact that we promised.\n  One thing I have heard from people, whether it is Democrats or \nRepublicans, liberals or conservatives, the reason they are so \ndisgruntled with government, whether it is at the State or national \nlevel, is there is a lack of trust that people who get elected actually \nfollow through with what they promised when they run their campaigns. \nThere is a dislink. There is the politician the candidate, and then the \npolitician the elected official. What one says during the campaign does \nnot jive with what one does when they are elected to office.\n  We elect leaders of this country who promise all sorts of things and \ncome down and do exactly the opposite. Then you ask people, how can you \nsupport someone who does that? Well, they all do it. It does not make \nany difference. They all say what they need to say to get elected. But \nthey all do it. Why is he or she any worse than the rest? We can \nforgive that, I guess.\n  I think those days are gone. I do not think the public will forgive \nthat any more. I do not think they should forgive it in the first \nplace, and I hope they do not. I think the least people should expect \nout of their elected representatives is they keep their promises. We \nmade 10 promises in a Contract With America. I think probably paramount \nof all those promises was to balance the budget.\n  Promises are important. If people do not have faith in their elected \nofficials and institutions, that erosion of faith in support of our \nGovernment has very long-term consequences to the future and safety and \nfreedom of this country.\n  This is a big one. This is not a little white promise, a little white \nlie that we will tell. This is a big one. This is a major promise that \nwe made to the American public.\n  I heard a preacher the other day tell the story about this subject--\nnot the balanced budget--but about the importance of that trust. He \ntalked of a man who headed up a college, I believe it was in South \nCarolina, a Bible college.\n  His father had started this school, and all throughout his life \ngrowing up his dream was to succeed his father and run this school \nwhere people would have their avocation to become preachers and \nministers. This was very important for him. He felt it was a calling \nfrom God to do this.\n  He did. He succeeded his father in that position and ran that college \nvery, very well. Unfortunately, his wife of many years contracted \nAlzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's is a devastating disease that \neventually deteriorates the mind to the point where a person is no \nlonger able to take care of themselves and needs full-time care. This \nhappened to this woman at a very young age, unfortunately. She did \ndeteriorate to the point where she was simply not able to take care of \nherself and needed full-time care.\n  This husband, the man who had been called to run this college, this \npassion of his, decided to resign as president of the college, to take \nthe time and spend the time to take care of his wife, who was a victim \nof Alzheimer's.\n  His friends and people on the board of the college came up to him and \nsaid:\n\n       Why are you doing this? She has Alzheimer's. She has no \n     idea who you are. She has no idea who is taking care of her. \n     Anyone can take care of her. Anyone can take care of her. You \n     have a calling. You are serving the Lord. You are doing what \n     you are good at. You may be the only one who can do this. How \n     can you leave that to do something that anyone can do?\n\n  He said two things. First, he said: ``She may not know who I am, but \nI know who she is and I promised her when we got married to be there \nuntil death do us part. I promised.''\n  Promises mean something. Promises are important for relationships, \nfor the future of this country, between its elected representatives and \nthe people. We promised. Now it is time to deliver. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I inquire of the Chair how much time is \nremaining on the time of the Senator from Wyoming?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is 13 minutes 20 seconds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15191-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15192-S15193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I want to congratulate my freshman \ncolleagues who have been on the floor the last hour. I think they have \nbrought to the floor today an understanding of what this national \ndebate that is going on is all about and what the debate that we will \nbe having for the next few weeks in this Chamber is all about.\n  It is appropriate that the freshman Members, myself included, are \nmaking this debate today as we have in the past, because we were the \nones who came through the last election and listened to what the \nAmerican people had to say, as, of course, all our colleagues did. In a \nsense, we were a little closer to that.\n  My colleagues who preceded me today have talked very eloquently. I \nthink if I could summarize, I would say \n\n[[Page S 15193]]\nthat what they have talked about is to try to give us real \nunderstanding about what this debate that we are engaging in this \nCongress is all about.\n  The term ``reconciliation'' may be a term that is not familiar to the \nAmerican people today, but I suspect in the next 3 or 4 weeks it may \nbecome more familiar.\n  We are going to be talking about a lot of specifics that are \ncontained in the reconciliation bill. We will talk about some \nprovisions of this bill that, frankly, I may not like. I suspect there \nare few Members on this floor, if they were very candid, who would not \npoint out a provision or two or more of the reconciliation bill that we \nwill be considering that they may not like.\n  But, instead of focusing on the minutiae, I think it is important for \nus to step back, as we tried to do during this last 50 minutes of \ndebate, and keep our eye on the ball and talk about the big picture and \nwhat is at stake.\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, who just concluded, \nI think, said it very, very well when he talked about promises that \nwere made. What are those promises? What were those promises? How will \nthis Congress be judged? I think we will ultimately be judged on four \nthings, the four big promises that were made.\n  First, to balance the budget; to do something that this Congress has \nnot done since I was a senior at Miami University in Ohio in 1969--a \nlong time ago, a quarter of a century--that is to balance the Federal \nbudget, and to set us on the path so that we will, within that \nreasonable period of time of 7 years, have a balanced budget and do \nsomething we have not done for a quarter of a century and to make sure \nthe figures are real, the promises kept.\n  Second, to save Medicare. I use the term save because, as my \ncolleague from Tennessee, who is currently presiding, has very \neloquently pointed out, that is what this debate about Medicare is \nreally all about: to save it, to preserve it, to strengthen it.\n  Third, is to reform welfare. We passed a welfare bill. The House has \npassed one. We understand if we are really going to change the \ndirection of this country, we have to first start with a change in \nwelfare.\n  And the fourth: commitment. The fourth thing I think this Congress \nwill be judged on is our commitment to have a modest tax cut--it is a \nmodest tax cut--for working men and women in this country. So, I think \nit is important for us to truly keep our eye on the ball.\n  Let me conclude by saying the comments of my colleague from Tennessee \nI thought were most appropriate as was the chart that was displayed \nhere a few moments ago. What these promises, once they are kept, will \nreally do is to improve dramatically the quality of life for the \naverage man, woman, and child--particularly child--in this country. \nBecause, as he so eloquently pointed out, interest rates and other \nthings that silently affect our ability to purchase a home, for a \nyoung, newly married couple to purchase a home, have their interests \nrates down, to have a newer car, a safer car, all of these will be \naffected by what we do with the Federal deficit. The quality of life of \npeople who are struggling to get out of poverty will be affected by \nwhat we have done and will do in regard to true welfare reform.\n  I think sometimes we forget the big picture. Sometimes we spend a lot \nof time on this floor talking about individual bills, which we should, \nand what impact some small bill, relatively small bill, is going to \nhave on individuals. Sometimes we forget what we do in regard to the \nbig picture, what we do in regard to welfare reform, what we do in \nregard to a meaningful tax cut for working men and women, what we do in \nregard to balancing the budget, what we do in regard to saving \nMedicare. This big picture will affect, ultimately, the quality of life \nof our children much more than what we do on any individual program.\n  I again congratulate my colleagues, congratulate my friend and \ncolleague from Tennessee, whose statistics and chart I think pointed \nthat out very, very well. So, as we head into this debate and as we \ntalk about the minutiae of reconciliation--I see my friend from New \nMexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee, who is, obviously, going \nto be involved very much in that debate--I think it is important to \nkeep our eye on the ball, keep our eye on the commitments, what we told \nthe American people we were going to do, why we were coming to \nWashington. And, as we cast these tough and, frankly, very unpleasant \nvotes we are going to have to cast in the weeks ahead, it is important \nfor us to do that, to keep our eye on the ball and remember the big \npicture.\n  Remember, it is the big actions that we take in the four areas I have \ntalked about that are going to impact the quality of life of our \nchildren and our grandchildren much more than any one particular bill, \nany one particular amendment, any one particular vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is there any \norder that we have agreed upon? I do not want to impose if there is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators can have up to 5 minutes. The Senator \nfrom Illinois has 45 minutes reserved, which he has not yet used.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if we could complete our argument in about 6 \nor 7 minutes and then the Senator could have his time?\n  Mr. SIMON. I yield to my colleague from New Mexico, as I almost \nalways do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15192-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15193-S15195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very, very proud of the Republican \nSenators who have taken to the floor today to talk about the most \nsignificant issue for the American people, all of the American people. \nI know some ask, on whose side are we? We are on everybody's side. \nBecause if you do not get a balanced budget, sooner rather than later, \nyou are probably never going to get one. And if you do not get one \nsoon, you are literally giving away a legacy to the next generation and \nthe next generation that could have been prosperity, economic gain, a \nbetter chance to take care of yourselves--you are giving that away by \nimposing a silent tax on all the young people, all the children yet \nunborn, where they will have to pay our debt.\n  You cannot escape it. Some say, what is this debt? This debt means \nthat millions of people, banks, insurance companies, foreign countries, \nlent us money. We gave them a nice little promissory note, and we said: \n``Thank you for lending us the money. We will pay you back.''\n  So we owe it--in fact, we owe part of it to the Social Security trust \nfund. Frankly, sooner or later, the bell will toll. And this is our \nlast best chance to get a real balanced budget. When they ask who are \nthey who are for it, a vision comes to my mind of a big American \nshopping center with people in the center from all walks of life. If \nyou are in a shopping center in New Mexico, you will see a cowboy with \ncowboy boots, and you will see a dressed up, almost aristocratic \nperson, and then you will see all ages, some with new T-shirts with \ntheir latest words on it of support for the Bulls or the Cavaliers or \neven the march.\n  All of those people--not one piece of them, all of them--anxiously \nexpect that the U.S. Government will not let them and their children \ndown as we promise them a decent life and, if they will work hard, a \ndecent return and if we will do our job, that they expect a little \nbetter life with each passing decade.\n  Almost all of that is tied up in whether we get a balanced budget, \nMr. President. And I thank you very much, I say to the Senator from \nTennessee, for your comments of just how important to every day events \na balanced budget is.\n  I wish to talk today about the President's budget, and I do not know \nif Members on the other side are up here in the Chamber defending the \nPresident's budget. I think we voted on his first budget, did we not, \nin the budget debate? And I do not think one Senator voted for it. We \nall forget that. Not one. I think every single Member including \neveryone on that side voted no.\n  Now the issue comes, since the President gave us a new budget about 3 \nmonths ago, how many on that side of the aisle would vote for it. I am \ngoing to try in about the next 5 or 6 minutes to convince the American \npeople that \n\n[[Page S 15194]]\nnone of them would, and that a great big hoax is being perpetrated on \nthe American people by the President.\n  So let me start by saying to all of you if you do not have to cut \nanything because you have jimmied up the numbers, you can run across \nAmerica beating up on the Republican budget. You can say I did not do \nthat. I do not have to do that. You can say I wish to go slower. I do \nnot want to change the programs that fast.\n  Let me remind you. The only way you can do that and have a balanced \nbudget is to phony up the numbers.\n  Let me give you a little history. In the Reagan era, there became a \nrather famous asterisk which I think my friend, Senator Simon, recalls, \nthe Stockman asterisk. My memory is not precise; it was either $24 \nbillion or $34 billion. It was sort of we don't know how we are going \nto get that last amount, but let's just put an asterisk there and say \nwe will get it.\n  Now, friends, the President of the United States has a $475 billion \nasterisk. And it says I changed what the Congressional Budget Office \nsays, the authenticator of the budget. In whose name and under whose \npower did the Congressional Budget Office become the authenticator of \nthe budget? None other than the President of the United States.\n  Two years ago, in a State of the Union Message, he said the CBO was \nnormally more conservative in what is really going to happen and closer \nto right. Why is it, I say to my good friend, Senator Simon, who is \nadvocating a balanced budget, who came down here talking about a \nconstitutional amendment, why is it that the President of the United \nStates decided 1 year after he admonished us to abandon the \nCongressional Budget Office and do what? Use his own numbers. You know \nhe has experts. The Congressional Budget Office is the expert for \neverybody. He has an OMB. He has economic advisers, I say to my friend \nfrom Tennessee, and what he decided to do was to let them make the \npredictions for the future--make the predictions for the future.\n  The best I can tell you, fellow Senators and Americans, it is tough \nto explain, but I looked around for an explanation of what the \nPresident has done, and the best I could find is the former \nCongressional Budget Office Director. If he is not a Democrat, he is an \nindependent but, indeed, he is independent and here is what he said \nabout how this administration got to the balanced budget that they run \nacross America now and say we are not like those bad Republicans \nbecause we do not have to do all those things.\n  Listen to a quote from the former Director, a very simple quote:\n\n       The administration conveniently lowered the bar and jumped \n     over it.\n       The administration conveniently lowered the bar and jumped \n     over it.\n\n  That means if the world record was 6 foot 6 on the high jump, and the \nRepublicans had jumped it, the President comes along and what does he \ndo? He lowers the bar and then jumps it. So he puts it down to 6 feet \nand he jumps it, and he said, lo and behold, I set the same record you \ndid.\n  If the bar is the balanced budget and the President decides with his \nown experts to lower the bar and jump it, what does that tell us? Mr. \nPresident and fellow Senators and Americans, it tells us that the \nCongressional Budget Office is warning us that if you use the \nPresident's bar, the lowered bar, you will never get to balance.\n  I do not want to take a lot of time talking about the manipulation, \nthe smoke and mirrors. In fact, it is so much smoke and mirrors I was \ntrying to find a new word or new words to describe it, but I cannot. \nSomebody suggested the fog machine instead of smoke and mirrors. But \nlet me just give you an example of what has happened.\n  I say to Senator Simon, had your balanced budget constitutional \namendment passed and the Senate had come together and said it is law \nnow, let us have a balanced budget in 7 years, and we said let us \nlisten to the Congressional Budget Office on how we should do it, and \nwe did it, along comes the President and he says, ``Whoa there. You do \nnot have to do all that.'' In fact, he said in his second budget you \ncan get there by doing $475 billion less. Got it. He lowered the bar \n$475 billion.\n  Let me tell you just precisely how he did that. I do not know if in \nhis negotiations he lowered the bar a little bit at a time or just \nwaited around until his own estimators lowered it all the way, but here \nis what he did.\n  First, Medicare spending will come down over 7 years by $55 billion. \nGot it. Fifth-five billion dollars less in Medicare savings, I say to \nthe occupant of the chair. But he did not change anything about the \nprogram. He did not say this or that or the other. He just said it is \ngoing to cost less.\n  I ask for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He merely said we have decided that Medicare will cost \n$55 billion less. Put it down. Take the bar down $55 billion. He did \nnot change anything, did not reform anything, did not make it more \nsolvent excepting that they came up with new numbers on what it would \ncost and disagreed with the Congressional Budget Office, which we were \ntold to follow, which we think is closer to right over the last 14 \nyears, especially long-term figures, much more accurate than Democrat \nor Republican executive branch estimates.\n  Medicare, the bar has been taken down by $55 billion. Now he comes \nalong and says, do not worry so much about Medicaid because it, too, is \ngoing to come down, I say to the Senator from Illinois, on its own. You \ndo not have to change anything. It is going to come down $68 billion. \nSo he brought the bar down $68 billion.\n  He has not done anything yet, has not changed the program, has not \nreformed an entitlement, has not cut a single program of any type but \nnow that is $68 billion. And then he looked out at the farm subsidy \nprogram, other pensions and the welfare programs and he said oh, even \nif we do not change anything, they are going to come down $85 billion.\n  Now the bar has come down $55 billion in Medicare without changing \nanything, $68 billion in Medicaid by wishing and hoping that it will \nnot cost so much, $85 billion from farm pensions and others, and we are \nnot there yet. Hold on--$70 billion from lower interest rates. And \nthen, believe it or not, $175 billion because he assumes better \neconomic assumptions, rosy economic assumptions. They will say they are \nsmall. The differences with the Congress are small. That one is $175 \nbillion without changing anything.\n  When you add them up, $475 billion that we had to work at, to change \nprograms, to say entitlements are coming down instead of going up, the \nPresident of the United States found them like a bird's nest on the \nground by putting his team together and saying it really is not going \nto cost all that much to run our Government. So why do we not just \nchange the numbers?\n\n  Now, let me suggest to everyone who takes the floor and says to the \nRepublicans, ``You should not be doing this, you should not be doing \nthat,'' I ask them, are you following the President's blueprint in \nsuggesting that we do not have to do that? If you are, you will be \nstartled, and so will the American people, because if we did it your \nway, there would be no balanced budget come time that we commit it.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute. I will wrap it up \nnow.\n  Mr. SIMON. I will be generous with my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Let me say this is part of the reason that the U.S. Congressional \nBudget Office has said the President's budget never comes into balance.\n  But I think it is more serious than that. It is the real reason that \nthe President can stop over here and there picking the issues and say, \n``The Republicans are cutting too much. We ought not have to do that. \nWe can take a longer time to get it,'' when, as a matter of fact, if we \ndid it his way, we would be inventing 475 billion dollars' worth of \nreductions that the experts say are probably not going to happen and \nrunning around and saying, ``It doesn't matter which budget, they are \nboth in balance.'' I submit that is not the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the remaining time \nis under the control of the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from \nIowa.\n\n[[Page S 15195]]\n\n  Mr. SIMON. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, since we \noriginally agreed to 45 minutes, that the time be extended to 12:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15193-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15195-S15199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         STUDENT DIRECT LENDING\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, Senator Harkin and I are going to talk a \nlittle bit about direct lending and what is happening in the area of \nstudent aid. Here is an area where we can save real money. It is very \ninteresting what happened when direct lending was under consideration. \nSallie Mae, the student loan marketing association which we created--\nthe chief executive officer of Sallie Mae, I say to the Presiding \nOfficer and about to be Presiding Officer--they said that direct \nlending would cost the average school $219,000. Here is what they said \nin their letter of March 31, 1993.\n\n       As a result of our indepth visit with 10 schools, it is \n     abundantly clear that direct lending will mean increased \n     costs, additional personnel, and upfront investment.\n\n  This is Sallie Mae. They had big ads about what a great job they are \ndoing. And they have done some good.\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SIMON. What is the experience now that we have had direct \nlending? The experience, Mr. President, is that it cuts redtape, it \neliminates layers of bureaucracy--how many speeches have we made about \nthat on the floor--uses competition and market forces, and is simple \nand consumer friendly, promotes accountability, is flexible, and \nprovides education opportunity.\n  My colleague from Iowa went to Iowa State University. Instead of \nhaving the experience that Sallie Mae talked about, Iowa State \nUniversity has been able to shift four people from student loans over \nto other fields, and they have canceled eight computers, at a savings \nof $200 each month. Less bureaucracy; direct lending.\n  Here is a student newspaper. ``Direct Loan Ends Long Lines,'' from \nthe Daily Egyptian of Southern Illinois University. The Milwaukee \nJournal, ``Direct Student Loans Pay Off.'' The Chicago Sun Times, \n``Direct Loan Program Is Good Deal for All.'' The St. Louis Post-\nDispatch--Mr. President, I know the Presiding Officer is familiar with \nthat newspaper--``Loans Should Help Students, Not Bankers.'' The St. \nLouis Post-Dispatch is right.\n  ``Student Loans: The Wrong Cuts, With This Vital Program Republicans \nAppear to Prefer a Wasteful Monopoly to Effective Competition.'' That \nis the Washington Monthly.\n  The University of Florida. Here is their experience in the first week \nof classes under the old program. They had $3.7 million in for \nstudents. Their first year under direct student lending, the first week \nthey had $9.1 million. But this current year, $21 million in the first \nweek. And it is similar in the other statistics here.\n  The University of Colorado in Boulder, under the old program, 3,068 \nloans disbursed; under the new program, the first year 4,800, the \nsecond year 6,500.\n  Here is a USA Today editorial: ``Banks Cash In, Taxpayers Lose on \nLoan Program.'' And then it says in a subheading in this editorial in \nUSA Today, ``Congress in a sweet deal for the banks is on the verge of \nkilling direct student loans.''\n  We hear a lot about unfunded mandates around here. If we go ahead \nwith the bill that came out of our committee, Mr. President, what we \nare saying to the banks and the guarantee agencies is, ``You have an 80 \npercent monopoly, 20 percent will be limited for direct lending.''\n  In my State of Illinois, because they have seen what a good program \nit is, over half the loans right now are direct loans. It is \ninteresting that not a single college or university that has gone to \ndirect lending is moving away from it; not a single one anywhere in the \n50 States, including Missouri and Illinois.\n  Unfunded mandates? What we are doing is we are imposing costs on \nuniversities if we do not take that 20-percent cap off and permit \nchoice--that is all I ask. I am not going along with the administration \nthat says it ought to be 100 percent direct lending. I recognize that \nwould save money. But let us give colleges and universities the choice. \nLet competition prevail.\n  What did we do in order to somehow make the old program, the \nguaranteed loan program, appear to be a money saver? Well, in the words \nof the Chicago Tribune editorial, ``Cooking the books on student \nloans,'' that is what we did. We passed in the budget resolution a \nprovision that said on the old guaranteed student loans, ``You will not \ncount administrative costs, while you will on the direct loans.''\n  We asked CBO--and my colleague who is presiding, and I see my \ncolleague from Michigan here--we asked CBO, ``If you don't take this \nrigging that took place in the budget resolution, if you just put under \nthe old law what we would save or what it would cost''--under the old \nCongressional Budget Act the cost of going to this 20-percent \nlimitation would be $4.64 billion instead of a phony savings--I heard \nSenator Domenici talking about phonying up numbers. That is what we did \nin a major way in order to protect the banks and the guarantee \nagencies. I think we have to do what is right.\n  Our former colleague--and, Mr. President, you did not serve with him \nnor did the Senator from Michigan--but Senator David Durenberger said, \n``This is not the free market. It is a free lunch.'' He is talking \nabout the old guaranteed student loan program.\n  Take a look at the numbers of Government personnel involved in the \nold program: 2,500 or more in the guarantee system, only about 500 \nunder full direct lending. And this does not count college and \nuniversity personnel. Every college and university says that a direct \nloan program reduces paperwork, reduces personnel demands. Just take a \nlook at the personnel under the Federal Government and the guarantee \nagencies paid for by the Federal Government under the direct loan \nprogram and under the guaranteed loan program and add on top of this, \nMr. President, the colleges and universities.\n  Now, why, if this is so obviously good, why are we having opposition? \nWhy do we have this 20-percent limitation? The banks, my friends--and I \nam all for healthy banks; I have a house mortgage on my home in \nsouthern Illinois--the banks make more money on student loans than they \ndo on house mortgages, on car loans, on any other enterprise other than \non their credit cards. And they are interested.\n  And the guarantee agencies are interested. Take a look at what \nhappens--forget all the other things--what happens on the collection of \ndefaulted loans. Under the old program--Mr. President, I direct this to \nyou because I know you are a fiscal conservative. Under the old program \nwe want to guarantee 80 percent to the old programs. We say to these \nfinancial institutions, ``You get 27 percent on defaulted loans for \ncollection.''\n  Take a look at what happens under the direct program. Instead of just \ngiving people a monopoly, we put it out for competitive bidding. Do you \nknow what it is turning out to be? Fourteen percent. You want to save \nmoney? Here are millions and millions of dollars that you can save.\n  Why are the guarantee agencies, which do not have--these are not \nstockholders. This is not private enterprise versus Government. It is \nGovernment versus Government. But the guarantee agency in Indiana, \ncalled USA Group--their CEO incidentally, Roy Nicholson's 1993 salary \nwas $619,949, not too bad for an agency that does not have any private \nfunds in it. We pay the President of the United States $200,000 a year. \nThey are spending $750,000 to lobby against direct lending. This is \njust one group.\n  Let me tell you, this Guaranteed Student Loan Program was fine for \nits time, and I would say in fairness to these groups, they helped \nstudents when we were trying to find our way, but we certainly ought to \ndo it the right way. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to print \nin the Record a letter from the president, Dallas Martin, of the \nNational Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 16, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul Simon,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simon: On behalf of the National Association \n     of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA) representing \n     professional student aid administrators at over 3,100 \n     postsecondary institutions across the nation, I am writing to \n     strongly urge you to include in any floor amendment to the \n     Reconciliation bill four provisions to benefit \n\n[[Page S 15196]]\n     students and postsecondary institutions. We believe any amendment must \n     include retention of the grace period for student loan \n     borrowers; elimination of the .85 percent tax on annual \n     school loan volume; allowing schools the choice to join in \n     the Direct Loan Program without elimination of current \n     participating institutions; and, retention of the current \n     interest rate calculation and caps in the PLUS loan program. \n     Each of these provisions is so critical for students and \n     postsecondary institutions that NASFAA would seriously \n     consider not supporting any amendment package that does not \n     include each of these four provisions.\n       Retention of the grace period is important to ensure \n     students do not have even greater loan debt as they begin \n     their chosen careers. Depending on how much a student \n     borrowed, elimination of the grace period would add up to \n     $2,500 to their loan debt possibly leading students to alter \n     career plans, default in greater numbers, or defer major life \n     and consumer decisions for the future.\n       Every student in the country and every postsecondary \n     institution would be affected by the .85 percent tax on a \n     school's annual loan volume. If this fee is approved, \n     postsecondary institutions would either cut their budgets in \n     various areas leading to decreased academic or student \n     services, or schools will pass this cost onto their enrolled \n     students in the form of increased tuition or fees. This would \n     be an unfortunate escalation of student costs imposed by \n     Congress at a time when American families are already having \n     difficulties financing postsecondary education.\n       NASFAA believes Congress should follow through on its \n     earlier commitment to operate a Federal Direct Loan Program, \n     along with the Federal Family Education Loan Program for a \n     minimum five-year period. In 1993, when the William D. Ford \n     Federal Direct Loan Program was authorized, institutions were \n     assured this new program would operate for a minimum five-\n     year period in order to determine whether such an approach \n     might prove more cost-effective and efficient than the \n     existing Federal Family Education Loan Program. For the first \n     time in many years there is healthy competition occurring \n     between the two Federal loan programs.\n       The quality of service being offered by both programs, \n     however, is much better than it was with a single program, \n     and students and institutions are being better served. \n     Therefore, NASFAA supports inclusion in any amendment to the \n     Reconciliation bill ``plus demand'' language to ensure \n     postsecondary institutions have the freedom to choose the \n     Direct Loan Program if that best serves the needs of its \n     students. Under the committee-reported bill reducing loan \n     volume to twenty percent, half of the current Direct Lending \n     Program participants would be arbitrarily removed from that \n     program. Further, the committee-reported bill would eliminate \n     scores of schools from participating in the current award \n     year since the legislation mandates a drop of Direct Loan \n     Program volume to thirty percent in academic year 1995-96. \n     This would not be a ``minor inconvenience'' to these \n     postsecondary institutions that have invested heavily in \n     changing operating procedures, hardware and software systems, \n     and explanatory materials to students.\n       The cost of a PLUS loan could increase by as much as $5,000 \n     unless this provision is stricken from the bill. This large \n     increase could potentially lead to greater defaults in this \n     program when combined with an increase in the PLUS loan cap \n     or discourage parents from assuming their responsibility to \n     pay for their children's postsecondary education expenses.\n       NASFAA is thankful for your leadership efforts to develop \n     an amendment reducing the impact of cuts mandated by the \n     Reconciliation bill. While we appreciate your efforts, again, \n     NASFAA must strongly urge you to include in any amendment all \n     of the above four elements benefiting students, families, and \n     schools.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Dallas Martin,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, they say what I think makes sense: Give \npeople the choice. We are going to have an amendment to do precisely \nthat.\n  Then, finally, Mr. President, the inspector general of the Department \nof Education testified that with these guarantee agencies who are \nhandling Federal funds, we have $11 billion at risk. Indiana \nUniversity, ``What we have learned'': Ninety percent less paperwork, \nthis is under direct lending; 25 percent fewer errors, easier \nadjustments, faster disbursement.\n  Director of financial aid, University of Idaho:\n\n       On registration day, we had 46 percent more funds available \n     for students who did not have to wait for the whole process. \n     Every school that has gone with the direct loan program sees \n     it as a simpler program for students. It saves taxpayers \n     money and provides the students with more options.\n\n  Kay Jacks, director of financial aid, Colorado State University:\n\n       I can hardly talk about eliminating the direct lending \n     program without crying. Students are happy, universities are \n     happy. Why they want to cut it, I just don't get it.\n\n  Every college and university, I repeat, that has the direct lending \nprogram wants it to continue. Not a single one wants to back off.\n  It ought to be clear, Mr. President, that we ought to give colleges \nand universities choice, and when reconciliation comes up on the floor, \nthere will be an amendment, I hope a bipartisan amendment, which will \nsave money for taxpayers, save paperwork, give colleges and \nuniversities the choice. That is what it ought to be about.\n  One other not so minor point, Mr. President, under the old program, \nmany, many students could not qualify. Under the changes we made when \nwe first adopted this program, any student can qualify, including \nmiddle-income students. I hope we do the sensible thing.\n  I am pleased to yield the remainder of this time to my colleague from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Simon for his statement. I \nwant to also thank him for being a great leader on direct lending all \nthese years and especially the statement just made this morning.\n  I might differ one little bit from my friend and colleague from \nIllinois. I happened to have gone to college in the late fifties, and I \nremember a program came in under the Eisenhower administration. I did \nnot have it my first couple years of college, but I had it in my last \nyears of college, the National Defense Student Loan Program, a direct \nlending program. You went to the window and got your money.\n  I always thought it was a great program for a lot of reasons: You got \nyour money right there. There was not a lot of hassle. It was right \nthere at the school. And then when you got out of college, well, if you \nwent in the military, you did not have to pay anything. No interest \naccrued on the loan during the time you were in college.\n  If you went in the military, no interest accrued during that time or \nif you went on to school after that. I am quite frank to admit that \nafter college, I spent 5 years in the military and then 3 years in law \nschool. I had a year's grace period after that. So no interest accrued \nfor almost 9 years from the time I graduated from college.\n  For someone like me whose parents had no income at all--my father was \non Social Security when I started college, very modest Social Security, \nwe had no assets whatsoever--it was a godsend. So I always thought it \nwas a great program.\n  Then we went to the guaranteed student loan program. Maybe it did \nwork all right for a period of time. But, the banks, frankly, made a \nlot of money on that. Fine, good, that's their business. But why should \nwe continue doing business as usual when we have a better way of doing \nit, and the better way of doing it is the direct lending program.\n  The Senator from Illinois started his comments by saying about how \nthe long lines have dwindled. I always say one picture is worth a \nthousand words. This is at the University of Northern Iowa, one of our \nregent schools in Iowa. This is a picture last year before we had \ndirect lending. This is the line for students to get their guaranteed \nstudent loans and get it processed. These are all the students that are \nhaving problems with their loans.\n  I was told the picture does not do it justice, because if you look \nback to the doorway, the line goes on down the hall. But you get the \nidea. There is a line of students waiting to get their guaranteed \nstudent loans. That was last year. They have now instituted direct \nlending.\n  Here is the same picture, same place, same financial aid office. No \nlines at all. No one waiting in line, and that has been the story at \nall of the schools in Iowa that have used direct lending. We have 38 \nIowa schools right now. What I have heard from all of them is just \npositive comments about how the direct lending program is working. No \nlines, no hassle, students get their loans, and they are able to get \nabout their business of studying.\n  Earlier the Senator from New Mexico was on the floor talking about \nthe budget. We do have to bring our deficit down. No one is arguing \nabout that. The Senator from Illinois has been a leader in the effort \nto reach a balanced budget and to get us moving toward a \n\n[[Page S 15197]]\nbalanced budget. That is not the debate here. The debate is how we get \nthere, out of whose hide do we take it? Who pays the most? Who \nsacrifices the most? That is the debate. I am sorry I have to disagree \nwith my friend from New Mexico. He makes it seem as though the debate \nis whether or not we are going to have a balanced budget. That is not \nthe debate. We all agree on the need to bring down the deficit. The \ndebate is how, who pays, and what is the end result if one group pays \nmore than the other.\n  I daresay that if we are going to take it out of the hides of our \nstudents, if we are going to make it tougher on middle-income and \nbelow-middle-income students to get a college education, then I daresay \nthat our deficit will not come down, it will probably grow in the \nfuture. To get out of the debt we are in, we are going to need the best \nwork force possible, the most motivated, and you are not going to get \nout of our debt situation, you are not going to lower our national debt \nby increasing the debt of students in college.\n\n  The Senator from Illinois--and, again, I commend him--has been a \nleader in this effort. I might also add, Mr. President, that Iowa State \nUniversity, my alma mater, was one of the first 104 schools to \nparticipate in direct lending. Last spring, Earl Dowling, the financial \naid director, testified at an oversight hearing on direct lending. He \ntold the committee that ISU is running a larger loan program with fewer \nstaff. That is not a bad deal. He has been involved in the \nadministration and management of student financial aid programs for 23 \nyears and said, ``Direct lending is the first new program in those 23 \nyears that was such a definite improvement over its predecessor.''\n  The financial aid director for the University of Northern Iowa, \nRoland Carrillo, said that direct lending has been a ``resounding \nsuccess.'' He said, ``* * * there is no question that direct lending is \nthe most efficient method of delivering financial aid dollars to \nstudents.''\n  As the Senator from Illinois pointed out, in the collection of those \nloans later on, we pay less money under the direct loan program by \nputting out for competitive bids than we did under the old program. So, \nagain, Mr. President, the direct lending program has worked. It is \nworking well. The last thing we need to do is throw that overboard, in \nsome kind of mistaken idea that somehow this is going to help reduce \nthe deficit. Absolutely not. It is going to do just the opposite. I \nwant to take most of my time, Mr. President, to talk about taxes and \nabout the taxes that are being levied by the GOP's proposal that will \nbe before us here in the so-called budget resolution. There is going to \nbe a lot of talk about cutting taxes. I understand there is a big tax \nbreak in that bill. But what is not going to be talked about, and what \nI want to talk about, are the hidden taxes that are included in that \nreconciliation bill that will be before us.\n  As I said--and I will keep repeating the argument--the debate is not \nabout reducing the deficit. It is, who pays and how much do they pay, \nand does it reach a good result in the end? It will be middle-class \nworking families already pinched that will be asked to pay these new \nhidden taxes, stealth taxes. Most Americans will get less, but pay \nmore, so that a few people on the top can get a tax break.\n  People ask me, Mr. President, to describe what is going on in \nWashington these days and I say it is not easy to explain it. When \nideology gets ahead of common sense, when I see the agenda of these \nextremists, I have to say they have turned the Nike add slogan on its \nhead. You know, the ad that says, ``just do it.'' I think the new motto \nfor the GOP ought to be, ``just undo it.'' Do not analyze, do not \nquestion, do not even have hearings, just undo it. Undo laws that give \nour seniors quality health care. Undo laws to protect workers on the \njob, and undo our Nation's commitment to quality education.\n  The GOP says provide more tax breaks for the wealthiest. Pump \nbillions more into the Pentagon--$7 billion more than they asked for. \nPut education on the chopping block. To that, I say: We have been \nthere, we have done that. We tried that in the 1980's, and it dug us \ninto the biggest debt hole our Nation has ever been in. Let us use some \ncommon sense and cut down the spending for the Pentagon. Let us cut the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. Let us cut the tax breaks.\n  We do not need tax breaks now. I figured it out. It would be maybe a \ndollar a day, at the most, to people in the upper income brackets. I do \nnot know what they are going to do with that--maybe buy another Big Mac \nand a Coke. You cannot even get that for a buck anymore. Maybe you can \nget a giant Coke. In downtown Washington, maybe you can get a cup of \ncoffee. Maybe it will buy an extra cup of coffee a day. That means if \nwe are going to have those tax breaks, we are going to have these \nhidden taxes on student loans.\n  The budget proposal cuts about $11 billion from student loans. This \nwill result in increased student debt, a new direct tax on schools, \nelimination of the successful direct lending program, about which \nSenator Simon spoke. The GOP plan adds an extra $700 to $2,500 of debt \nper student. How? By eliminating the interest subsidy during the 6-\nmonth grace period. People say, well, that is not a big deal, 6 months. \nWell, it is a big deal. When you are out of school and trying to find a \njob and jobs are hard to find, and maybe you want to get married and \nstart raising a family, you bet it is a big deal. Well, you say maybe \nit is a little bit of a hit.\n  This is the seventh time, Mr. President, since 1981, we have \nincreased the cost of student loan programs. It is always just a little \nbit, a little bit, and a little bit, until finally the straw breaks the \ncamel's back. That is what is happening here. Not only is it more than \njust a little bit, what is worse about it is that the lower income the \nstudent, the higher their debt load. Why? Well, the poorer student \nborrows the most money, so they have the most debt. They get out of \nschool and have to start paying interest during the grace period, and \nthey have to start paying more money right away than higher income \nstudents. What kind of sense does that make? Well, also, the GOP plan \nadds up to $5,000 in additional costs for families who use the PLUS \nloan by raising interest rates, and a new Federal tax of 0.85 percent \non colleges and universities participating. Well, they say that is not \nmuch. But it is a lot when you look at a college in my State of Iowa. \nWhere are these colleges going to get it? They have to pass it on to \nstudents. The plan will also force at least half of the schools \nparticipating in the direct student loan program out by rolling back \nthe successful program.\n  So we are going to hear a lot about tax breaks. How about the taxes \nthat are in the GOP plan? Taxes on students, taxes on their families, \ntaxes on the schools. All of it added together--you can say, this is a \nlittle bit here and here. But you add it all up, and it is a direct \nassault on higher education, a direct assault on middle and lower-\nincome students having the ability to go to college, and to get ahead \nand to work and be productive members of society and help us reduce the \ndeficit in our country.\n  Mr. President, I heard a comment a week or so ago in the committee \nabout how students are going to have to sacrifice, too, because we have \nthis big debt and we have to reduce the debt. As I said, we all want to \nreduce the debt. I think we ought to think about this and look at \nhistory a little bit. I know the occupant of the Chair heard me say \nthis because he was in the committee when I said it. I will say it \nagain because it needs repeating and repeating and repeating. Right \nnow, our debt to gross national product is somewhere in the \nneighborhood of 70 to 75 percent. That is bad. I am not saying that is \ngood. That is bad. It ought to be reduced. As our gross national \nproduct goes up, we have to start reducing that debt so that gap \nwidens. Well, we had another period of time when our debt to gross \nnational product was bad. That was after World War II. Our debt was \nactually greater than our gross national product.\n  Now, did President Truman and the Congress stick their heads in the \nsand and say, oh, my gosh, our debt is more than our gross national \nproduct, so we cannot afford student loans, to send kids to college? \nNo. What they recognized was that the best way out of the debt \nsituation was to send kids to school. So President Truman and the \nCongress passed the GI bill. \n\n[[Page S 15198]]\n\n\n  Now, I just might point out, in 1945 our debt was 122 percent of our \ngross national product. This year it is estimated to be 69.9 percent. I \nwas close, 70 percent.\n  What happened, in 1945, our debt was 122 percent of gross national \nproduct. They passed the GI bill. Mr. President, this was not even a \nloan. They gave the money to them. They built housing all over America, \nsent the kids to school, and did not ask them to pay back a cent.\n  Did they pay us back? You bet they did.\n  Mr. SIMON. Would my colleague yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SIMON. I think the point is extremely important. The GI bill was \na grant. If you were to take the average grant and put the inflation \nfactor on it, today it would be a grant of $9,400--an incredible \namount. There is not a school in Iowa or Illinois or any other State \nwhere students get that kind of a grant.\n  Let me point out one other little bit of history that I did not know. \nThe immediate past national commander of the American Legion stopped in \nmy office last week and he said in the old GI bill which we all--\neveryone looks back to and said what a great thing it was--the American \nLegion and the other veterans groups were in a fight. The other \nveterans groups wanted a cash bonus instead of the GI bill for \neducation. The American Legion prevailed.\n  Ironically, we are going through the same fight today. Is it a cash \nbonus of tax reduction, or do we put the money into education?\n  We ought to learn from history. The lesson from history is that the \nNation benefits when instead of a cash bonus we put the money invested \nin education.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Illinois for pointing that out. \nThat is a good lesson in history. I was unaware of that.\n  What the Senator said, if you took the GI bill, what they gave as a \ngrant to those students to go to college, in today's dollars, it would \nbe $9,400--a grant to go to college. I do not know of any grant program \naround that is anywhere near that. Pell grants are down to about \n$2,000, if I am not mistaken.\n  Mr. SIMON. Pell grants are about $2,400, and you have to be below a \ncertain income level. Most students do not qualify.\n  The GI bill was available to everyone no matter what your income was. \nOf course, you had to be a veteran.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There were no income guidelines. They just gave the money \nto students to go to college.\n  I point out because it is interesting another little tidbit of \nhistory. These students went to college, got out. They made higher \nincomes--probably the greatest period of productivity, inventiveness, \ninnovations, in our Nation's history and the world's history.\n  The debt in 1945 was 122 percent of our gross national product. By \n1981, it had gone down to 33 percent--the lowest point that we had ever \nhad. I think that is because we were riding on the shoulders of those \nGI's who went to school and got an education and produced this miracle \nof innovation and inventiveness in America.\n  I think if you look at what has happened since 1981, we have \nretreated and gone the other way in education. We are making it \ntougher. As I said, Mr. President, seven times since 1981 we have taken \na hit on students, and made them pay more, make it more costly to go to \ncollege.\n  What is happening? Our national debt keeps getting bigger and bigger \nand bigger. I am not saying that is the only cause. There are a lot of \nother causes.\n  I will say this: Unless and until we invest upfront in education and \nin higher education and in making sure students can go to college and \nnot be burdened with heavy debts themselves, unless and until we do \nthat, we will never get out of our deficit situation.\n  I do not care what we do around here. You can cut programs, you can \ncut all the things the Government does, but if our productivity does \nnot stay high, if we do not have the kind of high paying jobs that are \ngoing to take us into the next century, forget it. We will not work \nourselves out of this debt.\n  Mr. President, I went to college under a direct loan program, as I \nsaid. I went up to the window, got a direct loan. I did not have to pay \nit back for about 9 years. I had the GI bill when I went to law school. \nI still had the GI bill available to go to law school. I did not have \nto pay it back. They just gave me money to go to school.\n  Well, I think it is time we learned from that. All I can say is I \nunderstand that the Speaker of the House also went to school under that \nkind of a program. All I can say, if it was good enough for the Speaker \nof the House, it ought to be good enough for students today. It was \ngood enough for me, it ought to be good enough for students today, too.\n  Here is what is happening in Iowa with the student debt. Right now, \nthis is a percentage of financial aid dollars awarded as loans out of \nthe total financial aid grants and everything, percent as loans. Here \nat the University of Northern Iowa, at the top, it has gone from \nslightly over 40 percent to almost 60 percent. This is a regent school, \nnot a private college. Here is Iowa State, which went from about 34 \npercent to 48 percent, my alma mater. That is from 1991 to 1995, not a \nlong period of time, 3 to 4 years.\n  Here is the University of Iowa, which went from about 28 percent to \nabout 38 percent--again in the last 4 years. So what has happened is \nthat students are taking on bigger and bigger debt loads, all the time \nmaking it tougher for them to pay it back.\n  Now, it has another impact. Right now, indebtedness for a student \ngraduating from the University of Iowa last spring is about $11,278; \nfrom Iowa State, $14,900; the University of Northern Iowa, $14,681. On \naverage they pay about $170 per month for student loans.\n  You say that does not sound like much. Sure it does. You know what a \nstarting salary for a secondary schoolteacher in Iowa is? About $18,000 \na year. That $170 a month they are paying they could be using to buy a \nhome, maybe even to buy a new car, to maybe get their lives going and \nstart building our economy. But no, they be will saddled with more and \nmore debt to pay for their education.\n  Grant aid has declined at our three universities in Iowa. It was 30 \npercent in 1990, and now is down to 25 percent.\n  Instead of creating more debt per student, why not go after the \ndeadbeats who owe about $50 billion to the U.S. taxpayers in nontax \ndebt? There is a lot of debt out there that people owe the Federal \nGovernment. I am not just talking students but a lot of people. We \nought to go after those rather than hitting the students.\n  Finally, I just wanted to bring this to an end and close my remarks \nby showing what it means for an individual. The average loan on a per-\nstudent basis at the University of Northern Iowa, our smallest regent \nschool in the State of Iowa, the average loan indebtedness, in 1992 was \n$2,589. Now it is $4,395 per student basis.\n  When they graduate, the indebtedness will be $14,641. But this is the \naverage debt per student, per year at the University of Northern Iowa; \nnot quite doubled, but pretty darned close to doubling in just the last \n4 years.\n  So, yes, the debt of the United States is bad. We have to reduce our \ndeficit and our total debt. We do want to reach a balanced budget. But \nthe way the GOP is going about it with their reconciliation bill, \nespecially how they are hitting students, is going to cause more debt \nin our country, less productivity, less ability for us to raise our \ngross national product and get out of this debt. It is almost as if the \nproponents of our reconciliation bill with all of the cuts they have, \ntaking away the direct loans for students--it is almost like, ``We are \nin debt, so let's go to debtors prison.''\n  That is not the answer. The answer is to provide our people in this \ncountry with the wherewithal to earn more, make more, climb that ladder \nof opportunity and success, pay more when they earn more so more \nrevenue comes into the Government, so we are able to make better \nproducts and sell better products and compete around the world. That is \nthe way. That is the way out of the mess we are in. This GOP proposal, \nI must say in all frankness, is a ``stick your head in the sand'' \napproach to the deficit problems we have in America.\n  The Senator from Illinois has it exactly right. By keeping our \ncommitment to direct student loans, we are \n\n[[Page S 15199]]\nsaving a bundle of money. We are making it easier for students to go to \ncollege. Beyond that, we have to do whatever we can, I believe, to \npoint out the hidden taxes in the GOP proposal: The taxes on students, \nthe taxes on their parents, and the taxes on the schools. This is a \ndirect hit at education in this country. All for what reason? To reduce \nthe deficit? No. To pay for a big tax break that might amount to about \na dollar a day, about a dollar a day for people in upper-income \nbrackets. What a foolish waste of money.\n  If we want to use our money wisely, put it into education. I thank \nthe Senator from Illinois for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, in the 2 minutes that are remaining, let me \njust thank my colleague and underscore what he is saying. We face, \nreally, the same choice we faced right after World War II. The \nPresiding Officer was not here when it was mentioned. The GI bill, \nwhich we look to now with so much pride, was a matter of great \ncontroversy. The American Legion wanted the GI bill. The other veterans \ngroups wanted a cash bonus. And now we face the same question: A cash \nbonus in a tax reduction or investing money in education?\n  I am pleased the Senator from Iowa, along with the Senator from \nWashington, are among those who voted for a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. Our experience with legislative efforts is \nthey last about 2 years and then there is too much political drag.\n  The particular difficulty of this approach right now, with the tax \ncut, is without a constitutional amendment, basically the budget \namendment that we adopted--and in the Budget Committee, I voted along \nwith the Senator from Washington for that goal of balancing in 7 \nyears--but it is like a New Year's resolution on a diet. Only we are \ngoing to start the diet with a great big dessert called the tax cut.\n  What we are saying here is, let us see if we cannot get bipartisan \nagreement to reduce that dessert just a little bit. Let us take $10 \nbillion of that dessert and put it into education. And we are going to \nhave a much better country if we do it. That should not be a partisan \nthing. We ought to be able to agree on that across the aisle and I hope \nwe can work something out on that line.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I might just ask the Senator from Illinois, all this \ntalk about these tax cuts--what the heck, I will be honest about it, I \nhave friends who make over $100,000 a year, because the Senator from \nIllinois is a friend of mine. We are paid more than that every year, \nthe Senators. But I have friends who make more than $100,000 a year. I \nwill be frank about it. I have not had one person come to me and say \nthey need a tax break; not one.\n  I would ask the Senator from Illinois, has he had anyone coming to \nhim begging for tax breaks?\n  Mr. SIMON. I share that experience, including people who make many \ntimes what the Senator and I make, who tell us this really does not \nmake sense.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It does not make sense.\n  Mr. SIMON. I commend our colleague, Senator Feingold from Wisconsin, \nfor leading a fight on this. We are going to have an amendment on this \non the floor. I hope sounder heads will prevail.\n  We all love to hand goodies out. But this is a time for restraint and \nnot handing goodies out, and certainly not taking back from educational \nopportunity.\n  Mr. President, I see I am getting a signal up there our time is \nexpired. I thank my colleague from Iowa again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15195-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues an issue of great importance to Nevada, but should be of \nconcern to those from other States as well.\n  Mr. President, for 13 years, since 1982, Nevada has been the prime \ntarget of the nuclear power industry for the disposal of its high level \ncommercial nuclear waste.\n  In spite of the fact that Nevada has no nuclear reactors, commercial \nor otherwise, and never benefited from nuclear power, Nevada has been \nidentified by the nuclear power special interest lobby as its chosen \nsite for the disposal of one of the most poisonous, dangerous \nsubstances known to mankind.\n  Since 1987, as the result of a backroom deal reached during the \ndeliberations of a conference committee, Yucca Mountain, 90 miles \nnorthwest of Nevada, has been the sole site being studied by the \nFederal Government for a high-level nuclear waste dump.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, the repository program has been a \ndismal failure.\n  Despite the expenditure of nearly $5 billion, a repository is no \ncloser to being built today than it was in 1982, when the original \nNuclear Waste Policy Act was passed by Congress.\n  Faced with the failure of the permanent repository program, and \nfrustrated by the Federal Government's obvious inability to accept \nnuclear waste from commercial reactors anytime near the originally \nplanned 1998 deadline, the nuclear power industry and its advocates \ndecided to initiate another, even more dangerous, assault on Nevada.\n  Raising the specter of widespread shutdowns of nuclear power reactors \nacross the Nation, and demanding adherence to the obviously impossible \n1998 deadline, the nuclear power industry now demands that the Federal \nGovernment immediately build so-called interim storage facilities at \nthe Nevada test site.\n  This new attack on the health and safety of Nevadans is coming at us \nfrom all angles.\n  Numerous bills have been introduced in the House and Senate to target \nNevada for interim storage--all written by the nuclear power industry, \nand all fiercely opposed by Nevada's Governor and congressional \ndelegation, and the vast majority of Nevadans.\n  At the same time, we face the prospect of another back room deal on a \nconference report singling Nevada out for a dump it wants no part of.\n  In spite of the fact that neither the House or Senate energy and \nwater appropriations bills would allow interim storage to be \nconstructed in Nevada, by all indications, the conference report may \ntarget Nevada as the sole site for interim storage.\n  Mr. President, nothing could be less fair to the citizens of my State \nand I, and the rest of the Nevada congressional delegation, will do \neverything possible to see that this provision does not pass.\n  Mr. President, as you may expect, we in Nevada fear that should a \nnuclear waste dump of any type ever be built in our State, the health \nand safety of Nevadans will be severely threatened.\n  With 16,000 shipments of highly toxic waste arriving from across the \nNation, the potential for a catastrophic accident near Las Vegas, a \ncommunity of 1 million residents, is enormous.\n  Mr. President, while Nevada faces the greatest risk, and is at the \nmost peril should the nuclear power industry get its way with Congress, \nevery Senator should take a careful look at exactly what is being \nproposed.\n  As citizens across the Nation are slowly beginning to realize, the \nnuclear power industry is proposing to ship, at the earliest date \npossible, an unprecedented volume of shipments of extremely poisonous, \nhighly toxic high level nuclear waste--over 16,000 shipments across 43 \nStates, by both rail and truck.\n  Mr. President, I invite my colleagues' attention to the proposed \nshipment routes. Each Senator will note that his or her State may be a \ncandidate for this massive shipment with all the risks that are here by \nway of accident or other unforeseen consequence. Even though the plan \nsadly targets Nevada out here as the ultimate repository, it will pass \nthrough the States of most of my colleagues. I emphasize that they too \nand their constituents are at risk, as are my constituents.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues should look closely at this map, because \nthis map shows the likely routes for the transportation of high-level \nwaste in the very near future.\n  As I pointed out a moment ago, nearly every State would be effected.\n  The nuclear power industry, of course, is quick to claim that we have \nnothing to worry about, that nuclear waste transport is perfectly safe.\n  Mr. President, I doubt many of my constituents, or those of other \nMembers, would put much faith in the nuclear power industry's \nassertions.\n  Quite simply, accidents do happen. While only a relative few make the \nnational news, the United States has nearly 1,500 rail derailments a \nyear.\n  Heavy truck accidents occur approximately six times for each million \nmiles traveled which, if applied to the thousands of truck shipments \nunder the nuclear power industry's plan, would result in at least 15 \ntruck accidents involving nuclear waste each and every year.\n  The events of the past week raise even more frightening \npossibilities. In addition to the potential for accidents, nuclear \nwaste shipments could become prime targets for acts of sabotage or \nterrorism.\n  Monday's sabotage of the Sunset Limited near Hyder, AZ, is a stark \nreminder of the dangers we face from criminals and terrorists every \nday. In a matter of minutes, those responsible for the Sunset Limited \nwreck created a derailment which took the life of one passenger, and \ninjured numerous others.\n  From the reports that I have read, Mr. President, that sabotage took \napproximately 10 minutes to effect.\n  In an ironic twist, this week's act of sabotage appears to be a \ncopycat of the August, 1939 derailment near Harney, NV, that killed 24 \npassengers.\n  The simple fact is that no one, not the nuclear power industry, not \nthe Department of Energy, and not the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, no \none can guarantee the safety of the transportation of nuclear waste.\n  Sound public policy dictates a cautious approach to the transport of \nsuch hazardous materials. They should only be moved if absolutely \nnecessary. This is simply not the case with nuclear waste.\n  Nuclear waste is currently stored on-site, at the 109 nuclear power \nreactors in the United States--80 percent of them east of the \nMississippi River.\n  These sites, of necessity, will remain storage facilities for nuclear \nmaterials at least as long as the reactor continues to operate--several \ndecades, if not longer. Technology Mr. President, currently exists--dry \ncask storage--that is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and \navailable for utilities to purchase if they need additional storage.\n  Numerous utilities have taken advantage of this technology, and have \nmoved to dry cask storage. Outside of the local political problems many \nreactors face when they try to increase storage, there is simply no \nreason any utility needing additional storage could not do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would advise the Senator that his 8 \nminutes has expired.\n\n[[Page S 15201]]\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent for \nan additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank again the Chair for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, the point I would seek to make this afternoon is this \nis not just a Nevada issue. Look at the map. Forty-three States are \naffected by these proposed nuclear waste shipment proposals. And each \nState bears a risk of an accident or an act of sabotage, an act of \nterrorism with all of the frightening consequences that brings to bear \non those States and the constituents of those States being represented \nhere in the U.S. Senate.\n  The plans being advanced by the nuclear power industry threaten the \nhealth and safety of citizens across the Nation, for no good reason.\n  The crisis mentality generated by nuclear power industry propaganda \nis nothing new. In the early 1980's, advocates for the nuclear power \nindustry argued on the Senate floor, and elsewhere, that unless some \naway-from-reactor plan called AFR storage was provided by the Federal \nGovernment soon, reactors across the Nation would shut down, creating \nan electricity crisis for millions of Americans. Of course, no reactors \nhave ever shut down for lack of storage, and there is no crisis. The \nsame is true today.\n  Mr. President, the reality is that the nuclear power industry is a \ndying industry. No new reactors have been ordered for over a decade, \nnot because of lack of storage, but because nuclear power is simply not \ncompetitive in the marketplace. In an ill-founded and irresponsible \nattempt to jump-start a dying industry, nuclear utilities have advanced \na proposal that places the population of 43 States at risk, all for the \nbenefit of the bottom line of the commercial nuclear power industry.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the nuclear power industry's interim \nstorage proposal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one habit or custom that the President and \nI have in common is that we are runners--I know I can say in my case, I \nbelieve in his case, not particularly gifted or particularly fast, but \nnonetheless we are runners as a method of keeping in good physical \ncondition. I believe that the President, as I have, has on some \noccasions run in these rather large races where there are a large \nnumber of people and one tests oneself against the clock.\n  We always will attempt to beat our previous best time in a given \nrace, but at least in this connection, we never attempt to do so by \nsaying, ``Gosh, I just can't break 45 minutes for 10 kilometers, so \nI'll shorten the race. I'll shorten it to 8 kilometers, but I'll call \nit 10, and then I will have broken 45 minutes.''\n  The President of the United States would not consider doing that in a \nroad race, but that is precisely what he has done with respect to our \ndispute over a balanced budget.\n  Shortly after Mr. Clinton took the Office of the Presidency of the \nUnited States, he sought to lay to rest a dispute, which the Presiding \nOfficer will remember, as I do, over economic assumptions. Through all \nof the Reagan administration and all of the Bush administration, we on \nthis side of the aisle were criticized for using assumptions about the \nfuture state of the economy that were too optimistic, too rosy and, \nthereby, underestimating the challenge presented to us by continuing \nhuge deficits in the budget of the United States.\n  Almost without exception, those budget assumptions in the Reagan and \nBush administrations presented by the administrations were more \noptimistic than those presented to us by the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  So President Clinton, on taking office, said, ``Let's end this \ndispute. Let's all agree that in the past, the Congressional Budget \nOffice has been both more cautious and more conservative and more \naccurate and we will debate substance in the future. We will all work \noff the same set of projections. We will all work out of the same \nbooks.''\n  I think everyone, both Republicans and Democrats, took that as a \nstatement of good faith and a significant step forward, because the \nmotivation to overestimate growth in the economy on the part of an \nadministration and, thus, to make its budgeting job easier is not \nlimited either to Republicans or Democrats. There is always an easy way \nout.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, when push came to shove, the President \nabandoned that salutary way of making estimates and has gone back into \nexactly what he criticized his predecessors for--estimating or \nprojecting his way out of difficulties. And so while this Congress, \nboth in the Senate and in the House, has accepted without reservation \nthe economic projections of the Congressional Budget Office and has \nproposed to balance the budget within 7 years, under the rules which \nthe Congressional Budget Office has set out, as difficult as they are \nand although as a consequence we, in order to bring the budget into \nbalance, have been forced to propose relatively drastic changes in \npolicies which would reduce the growth of spending in the United States \nacross the broad spectrum of all of the items which the Government of \nthe United States funds, we find a President saying, well, there is not \nreally much difference between us. The President says: I want to take a \nlittle longer, 9 or 10 years to balance the budget, while the \nRepublicans want to do it in 7. We can easily reach an agreement or an \naccommodation on those two goals, they are so close to one another. \n\n[[Page S 15202]]\n\n  But the President gets there by cooking the books. He gets there by \nabandoning his commitment of 1993 and doing exactly what he criticized \nothers for doing and getting more than 50 percent of the way to a \nbalanced budget simply by saying, ``I do not think we are going to \nspend as much as the Congressional Budget Office says. I think interest \nrates are going to be lower, and I believe that the tax system will \ntake in more money.'' It amounts to a tremendous amount of dollars, Mr. \nPresident.\n  President Clinton simply estimates $55 billion more in Medicare \nspending savings, without changing Medicare at all; he estimates that \nMedicare will cost $68 billion less; he estimates that farm programs, \npension programs, and other welfare programs, will cost $85 billion \nless; he estimates that we will save $70 billion more in interest costs \nbecause interest rates will be lower; and he estimates that we will \ntake in $175 billion more because the economy will grow more rapidly, \nfor a net of $475 billion between now and the year 2002--a trillion \ndollars over the next 10 years, Mr. President.\n  Well, he could just as easily have made these estimates a little bit \nmore optimistic and we would not have any deficit problem at all. It \nwould go away without doing anything.\n  That is the great difference in the debate which we are about to \nbegin. Are you willing to look realistically at the future of our \neconomy and the growth in our spending programs and do something about \nthem as a matter of substance? Or, on the other hand, Mr. President, do \nyou just say times are going to be good, the problem will go away by \nitself? That is the difference.\n  Well, if the experience of the last 15 years holds true, the problem \nwill not go away by itself. We need to begin from a common basis. The \nPresident is simply wrong in overestimating the strength of the economy \nand telling the American people that no sacrifices are needed, no \nchanges in policies are needed. All we need to do is reestimate the \neconomy and everything comes up smelling like roses.\n  Now, Mr. President, I started speaking about 10 kilometer versus 8 \nkilometer races. I must admit that there is one difference, one with \nrespect to that analogy, that does not work. Neither of us, those of us \nwho depend conservatively on the Congressional Budget Office nor the \nPresident, can be precisely certain that that side is correct. Economic \nprojections are notoriously difficult to make even a year in advance, \nmuch less 7 years in advance. And we must admit that it is clearly \npossible that the President might be right in spite of the experience \nof the last 15 years, just as he, I suspect, if he were forced to \nanswer the question, might be willing to admit that perhaps he is wrong \nand that the Congressional Budget Office projections are better.\n  But what are the contrasting consequences of being wrong in this \ncase, Mr. President? Well, if President Clinton is wrong and we are \ncorrect, the budget deficit will never be less than $200 billion a \nyear. In the next decade, another $2 trillion will be added to the \nburden of debt imposed on the people of the United States, money which \nwe spend, the bills which we send to our children and to our \ngrandchildren. That would be the consequence, Mr. President, of \nPresident Clinton being in error. The problem of the budget will never \nhave been addressed if we accept his policies.\n  By contrast, Mr. President, what would the consequences be if we are \nwrong, if we are too conservative, too cautious, and if in fact the \neconomy does grow as rapidly as the President predicts in his easy-\ndoes-it budget? Well, Mr. President, the budget might be balanced in \nthe year 1999 or 2000 rather than in 2002. Is that a horrendous \nconsequence? No, Mr. President, that is exactly the goal we seek with \nour conservative projections and with the very real policy changes we \npropose. We only claim we will get to balance by the year 2002. But \neven that claim carried out by changes in policies will, from the \nperspective of almost every economist, itself build a stronger and \nbetter economy, provide more opportunities for generations looking for \nthose opportunities in the future, lower interest rates, lessen the \nburdens of Government on not only this generation but the next \ngeneration and the generation after that. And if we do better than we \nthought, that burden will be even lighter and we will get rid of the \ndeficit even earlier.\n  So if we are wrong and too cautious, we reach the goal all of us \nshare more quickly. If President Clinton is wrong, we never reach that \ngoal at all, and we continue to add to the burden of debt on our \nchildren and on our grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, both from a policy standpoint and from the point of \nview of having an intelligent debate, the rights and wrongs of which \nthe American people can understand, and from the moral point of view of \nbringing to an end this huge addition to the burden of debt on future \ngenerations, we must and we should agree on the starting point, on the \nprojections we are going to use. What better way in which to start that \npart of the debate, Mr. President, can there be than to have President \nClinton keep the commitment that he made 2\\1/2\\ short years ago.\n  We are not going to debate the projections. We will take the \nprojections of the neutral objective Congressional Budget Office and \nwork our debate. We will work our debate off of them.\n  If we do that, we will see clearly how necessary the budget is that \nwe have already passed, the reconciliation bill which we will debate in \nthe next 2 or 3 weeks in order to enforce it.\n  Mr. President, we should start from a common ground and make that \ncommon ground the ground the President of the United States himself \nstood on 2\\1/2\\ short years ago. We should not try to shorten the race \nand pretend we are running faster.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may proceed for \nup to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15201-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15202-S15203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HILDA SPECTER MORGENSTERN\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, permit me a personal moment or two on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate and in the Congressional Record to comment on \nmy own family values on the occasion of the 74th birthday of my sister, \nHilda Specter Morgenstern. It is a major occasion for our family \nbecause Hilda is the first member of the Specter family to reach a 74th \nbirthday. My father died at 72, my mother and brother, Morton, at 73.\n\n  An excellent indicator of family values is longevity of marriage, and \nI speak with great pride about the Specter family on that subject.\n  My parents, Harry and Lillie Specter, were married 45 years before my \nfather's death in 1964. My brother, Morton, and his wife, Joyce, were \nmarried 51 years before his death in 1993. My sister, Hilda, and her \nhusband, Arthur, have been married 52 years. My sister, Shirley, and \nher husband, Dr. Edwin Kety, were married 46 years before his death \nlast August. Joan and I celebrated our 42d anniversary last June 14. \nThat is a total of 236 years without a divorce.\n  On Sunday last, October 15, 1995, Hilda Specter Morgenstern \ncelebrated her 74th birthday with her husband, her four children, and \nmost of her 9 grandchildren in Teaneck, NJ, on a visit from her home in \nJerusalem.\n  A beautiful redhead, Hilda married Arthur Morgenstern after they met \nin the synagogue at Rosh Hashanah services in Wichita, KS, in 1942, \nwhile Arthur was in the cavalry at Fort Riley, KS. She was a straight \n``A'' student and a real academic inspiration for me. When she saw my \nreport card in the seventh grade, my first testing with A's and B's, \nshe scoffed at my one A and seven B's and offered a dollar for every \n``A'' I got thereafter. When I graduated from college, she and Arthur \nhanded me a check for $266.\n  Hilda Specter was an honor student and an excellent debater at the \nUniversity of Wichita where she was a member of the prestigious \nAssociation of American University Women. She was studying for her \nmasters degree at Syracuse University in the spring of 1942 when Arthur \nreceived his orders to embark to the South Pacific as an Army artillery \nofficer. After a coast-to-coast train ride to San Francisco, they \nmarried. Their wartime romance gave them only a weekend together before \nhe sailed for a 31-month tour of duty in the South Pacific.\n  After the war, Hilda, Arthur, and their family of four children lived \nin \n\n[[Page S 15203]]\nRussell, KS, without the benefit of a Jewish education, so they moved \nto Wichita where Hilda became superintendent to the Hebrew school. When \nthey found the Jewish education there insufficient, they moved to \nDenver. When that proved insufficient, they moved to New York City. \nWhen that was not enough, they moved to Jerusalem where Hilda and \nArthur now reside--except for periodic visits to the United States to \nhelp in my many campaigns.\n  Hilda Specter Morgenstern is a model wife, mother, grandmother, and \ngreat-grandmother. She is a real matriarch of the family. She tackles \nwith equal ease an analysis of the ABM Treaty to help me in my Senate \nduties, or the change of diapers for her new, great-grandson.\n  I have urged her to follow the model of Golda Meir, the Milwaukee-\nborn American, who later became Prime Minister of Israel. Hilda \nresponded by telling me to become President of the United States first.\n  Happy 74th birthday, Hilda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15202-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN HONOR OF MORTON SPECTER\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, 2 days from today, on October 19, 1993, \nthe second anniversary will be marked of the passing of my brother, \nMorton Specter, an honest, hard-working American who paid more than \nenough taxes to be memorialized in a brief statement in the \nCongressional Record.\n  I now ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Congressional \nRecord the eulogy which I delivered at his funeral in October 1993.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Ours is a very close family, so Morton's passing came as a \n     real shock--not that it was totally unexpected because he had \n     many medical problems--but perhaps a family is never really \n     prepared for the finality of it all.\n       The words ``family value'' were never used in the Specter \n     household. It wasn't necessary because we had them without \n     talking about them. They evolved naturally from the example \n     of our parents who struggled to achieve for their children \n     what they never had--education and opportunity. As the oldest \n     of four children, Morton set the example for Hilda, Shirley, \n     and me. None of us would even consider doing less than our \n     best or doing anything to embarrass our parents, considering \n     their sacrifices.\n       The 1920's Depression left its mark on Morton at the tender \n     age of ten. From his earliest days, he was a tireless \n     worker--the hardest worker I've ever seen. At 11 or 12, he \n     rode his bicycle on the streets of Wichita delivering bills \n     of lading to railroad offices for Beyer Grain Co. As a \n     teenager, he would go after dark to the golf courses, and \n     wade the lakes to find golf balls which he would make \n     sparkling white with peroxide bleach and sell in downtown \n     office buildings.\n       When he wanted to get a job to earn money right after high \n     school, my father talked him into going to Wichita U. for one \n     year which turned into four and a college degree. In college \n     he boxed, careful to protect his strikingly handsome face, \n     and acted in the school plays. He made a short trip to \n     Hollywood when he was 19 or 20--hoping, I think to meet--or \n     maybe even to become another Robert Taylor.\n       During World War II he answered the call of his country and \n     went to Officers Candidate School and became an Ensign. We \n     talked about reading the text books at that school after \n     lights were out with a flashlight under his blanket.\n       After the war, he sold magazines door to door. His crew \n     chief Walter Lewis said he covered twice as many houses as \n     anyone else. I joined him in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in \n     June 1945 and at the first house we visited, where he was \n     showing me the sales speech, the lady complimented him on \n     being a super salesman. When he approached one house, a young \n     girl ran excitedly to the house shouting: ``Mommie, Mommie, \n     here comes Dennis Morgan''--then a famous movie actor.\n       After the war he joined our father and Hilda's husband, \n     Arthur Morgenstern, at the Russell Iron & Metal Co.--at first \n     a junkyard, then an oil field equipment company and \n     ultimately modest oil production.\n       He worked long hours Monday through Saturday, making \n     telephone calls in the evenings, and on Sundays he would \n     drive to the surrounding counties to look at oil rigs to \n     salvage.\n       Morton did find time to meet and marry a beautiful young \n     woman, Joyce Hacker. She stood by his side sharing his \n     strenuous work schedules and the Kansas hot summers and windy \n     cold winters. Last November 19th, they celebrated their 50th \n     anniversary--a very rare quality in modern America. Joyce's \n     steadfast devotion to Morton--especially during the last \n     difficult years--was extraordinary.\n       Hilda, Shirley, and I returned to Kansas often to visit \n     Morton and Joyce just as they traveled to our homes--as long \n     as he was able. Our family was always on the telephone. \n     Morton would also often call his nephews and nieces and their \n     children and his aunts and uncles and cousins. He was a \n     generous man, making certain his contribution to Allied \n     Jewish Appeal was completed before the end of each year.\n       Morton made many trips to and through Pennsylvania to help \n     on our many campaigns. There's nothing like a brother or a \n     sister traveling upstate to local newspaper and radio \n     stations to talk about their candidate brother.\n       When I saw him last Monday at the Wesley Hospital in \n     Wichita, he wanted to know what was going on in the Senate \n     and how Bob Dole was doing.\n       Bob's father and our father were friends in Russell more \n     than 50 years ago. In the 1940's Harry Specter weighed \n     truckloads of junk at the Russell Grainery operated by Doran \n     Dole.\n       Our parents were very proud of him. How often I heard our \n     mother Lillie Shanin Specter call him her ``Motala.'' He will \n     rest beside her as he expressed his wish during his lifetime \n     in Montelfiore Cemetery. For my sisters and me, he was a role \n     model of integrity and hard work. He was a man of total \n     honesty who valued his good name and impeccable reputation.\n       We have not waited until his funeral to tell him how we \n     feel. We have expressed our feelings over the years--by \n     words, but more importantly by deeds--visits and calls and \n     caring.\n       For Joyce and our entire family and his many friends--I \n     say: We all loved him very much and we all will miss him very \n     much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15203-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15203-S15205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY [LIBERTAD] ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the cloture motion which will \nbe voted on this afternoon at 5 o'clock, because I believe that it is \nvery important that this legislation be considered by the Senate and \nacted upon by the Senate.\n  While I ordinarily support an active international role for the \nUnited States and active involvement with other nations around the \nworld, I believe that the current situation in Cuba presents a \nsituation where we ought not to do anything to strengthen the hand of \nFidel Castro. I believe that the legislation will increase the pressure \non the Castro regime and lay the groundwork for future U.S. support for \na democratic transition.\n  The State Department's 1994 human rights report to Congress paints a \ngrotesque picture of repression by the Castro regime. It shows \nGovernment-organized mob attacks on dissidents. It shows nationwide \npolitical surveillance. It shows extrajudicial killings of Cubans \nattempting to flee; for example, the sinking of boats loaded with \nrefugees by Government forces last year. It shows, by every significant \nhuman rights standard, the Castro regime has an appalling record on \nfreedom of speech, of assembly, and freedom from arbitrary arrest.\n  Castro has been largely immune to the democratic changes that have \nswept the hemisphere during the past 10 years and what that regime has \nin common with totalitarian states such as the ones created by Erich \nHonecker in East Germany and Kim Il-song in North Korea.\n  Mr. President, the legislation will be a significant step forward in \nisolating Fidel Castro and in hastening the day when democracy can \nreturn to Cuba so that that community, that nation, may be liberated \nfrom Castro's totalitarian regime and may take its place in the family \nof nations as a productive nation and a productive society.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, at the outset, I want to make it \nclear that I strongly endorse the central objective of H.R. 927, \nnamely, the peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba. The Cuban people \nhave too long been deprived the freedoms of speech, association, and \nself-expression. Like almost every American, I want to see that the \nrepression of the Cuban people by the Cuban Government is ended. And, \nlike almost every American, I want to see that long overdue economic \nreforms in Cuba are implemented, so that ordinary Cuban people can \nimprove their standard of living.\n  These are not, however, the questions before the Senate. What is \nbefore the Senate is H.R. 927, and what we have to decide is whether \nthe provisions of this bill will help move Cuba toward freedom, \ndemocracy, and greater economic \n\n[[Page S 15204]]\nopportunity, or not. I would like to say that I believe the bill will \nwork, but the simple fact is that it will not.\n  This legislation pursues a laudable objective the wrong way. It seeks \nto increase the pressure and isolation of Cuba by further tightening \nthe trade embargo and encouraging United States allies and trading \npartners to terminate their trade relations with Cuba through punitive \nand retributive measures. That policy cannot and will not work.\n  The United States approach to Cuba has been virtually unchanged since \nthe early 1960's. Since then, the United States has maintained a \ncomprehensive trade embargo to isolate the Castro regime politically, \nto weaken it economically and, thereby, to pressure the Cuban \nGovernment into making the desired reforms. H.R. 927 is simply the \nlatest in a series of legislative proposals that purport to provide the \nfinal push that will force the Cuban Government over the brink.\n  This new final push, though, is perhaps even less likely than the \nseries of past final pushes to succeed, because it is not based on the \neconomic, political, and diplomatic facts. Despite close to 35 years of \nU.S. trade embargo, the Castro regime remains in place.\n  Even more importantly, the embargo represents a policy orientation \nthat the rest of the world seems to be abandoning. Our most loyal \nallies and other countries do not support the United States position on \nCuba. In fact, the United States is the only country in the Western \nHemisphere with a trade embargo of Cuba and one of only five countries \nthat does not have formal ties with Cuba.\n  Moreover, it was only last year, October 1994, that the world \ncommunity soundly rejected a proposal that was similar to H.R. 927--one \nthat would broaden the embargo against Cuba--by a vote of 101 to 2. \nApparently, our neighbors in the hemisphere and allies around the world \nbelieve that dialog and engagement, not confrontation, isolation, and \nthreats, are the best ways to encourage change in Cuba.\n  The fact is that, without support of our allies and other countries, \nunilateral United States action against Cuba is unlikely to succeed and \ncould have the unintended effect of unnecessarily increasing friction \nbetween the United States and its allies and trading partners.\n  For economic sanctions to work, strong international cooperation is \nrequired. When we have that cooperation, as in the case of South \nAfrica, sanctions can work and can make sense as a policy alternative. \nThe success of the sanctions directed at South Africa was due, almost \nexclusively, to our ability to convince our allies and other countries, \nthrough moral suasion, not punitive or retributive legislation, to \nsupport economic sanctions to change the domestic policies and behavior \nof South Africa.\n  On the other hand, when the United States acts unilaterally and tries \nto bludgeon the rest of the world into line with our policy, the result \nis often failure. It is worth keeping in mind what happened when the \nUnited States acted unilaterally to try to prevent a natural gas \npipeline in the former Soviet Union from being completed. The policy \nwas a failure; the pipeline was built. However, major U.S. exporters \nwere hurt. Caterpillar, in my own State of Illinois, lost a major sale \nto its largest international competitor, Komatsu, weakening \nCaterpillar, and strengthening Komatsu, in international markets for a \nlong time.\n  Moreover, the United States policy created a major controversy \nwith our closest NATO ally, Great Britain, and with France. They saw \nthe U.S. policy as an infringement on their sovereignty.\n\n  This legislation raises important governmental, as well as practical \nand diplomatic, issues. Many experts see it as an encroachment on the \nPresident's authority under the Constitution to conduct the foreign \naffairs of the United States. For example, the President would be \nprohibited from providing foreign aid or international development aid \ncredits to Russia and the other Newly Independent States if they \ncontinue to trade with or give money to Cuba. As the only remaining \nworld superpower, we have widespread global interests, interests which \ndo not all turn on the status of a particular country's trade relations \nwith Cuba.\n  Mr. President, H.R. 927 is therefore unlikely to advance United \nStates interests in Cuba. Instead, what it is more likely to do is to \ndamage other U.S. interests. Increased political and economic pressure \non Cuba is more likely to enable Castro to play his nationalistic card \nand use the United States as a scapegoat to explain away Cuba's \neconomic problems than to weaken his grip on Cuba.\n  And even though it is unlikely to achieve the objectives for Cuba we \nall share, title III of this legislation will create a nightmare for \nthe United States judicial system, potentially costing United States \ntaxpayers billions of dollars to provide access to United States courts \nfor property claim lawsuits filed by or on behalf of individuals who \nwere not legally entitled to have their claims adjudicated in United \nStates courts when their claims initially arose. The bill, in effect, \nextends a benefit to Cuban-Americans denied to other groups, including \nPolish-Americans, Italian-Americans, Americans of Eastern European \ndescent, Chinese-Americans, and Vietnamese-Americans. Finally, U.S. \ntaxpayers will also have to foot the bill for the litigation of trade \nsuits pursuant to NAFTA and GATT/WTO.\n  Mr. President, what we really need is a new, innovative, and bold \napproach to Cuba, an approach based on the realities of the situation, \nan approach that can and will succeed. We need a policy based on our \nsuccesses. If we can create a situation where we can get the same kind \nof cooperating on sanctions against Cuba that we were able to put \ntogether in the case of South Africa, then a sanctions policy could \nwork, and could be pursued. But if we cannot, we ought to take a lesson \nfrom some of our other successes. After all, we did not win the cold \nwar by isolating the now former-Soviet Union, through a sophisticated, \nflexible policy that engaged the U.S.S.R. where that made sense.\n  Since unilateral United States sanctions are unlikely to be \neffective, and since legislation designed to force our trading partners \ninto tighter sanctions against Cuba is more likely to create new \nproblems than to solve the Castro problem, we ought to at least \nconsider new approaches. We need to at least examine, for example, \nwhether more extensive United States contacts with Cuba would \nstrengthen Castro or strengthen the prospects for real democratic and \neconomic reform in Cuba. What we cannot afford to do is to continue to \npursue a policy that has not succeeded in the past, and that offers \neven smaller chances of success in the future. Unfortunately, that is \nfundamentally what H.R. 927 is all about; I therefore cannot support \nit. I urge the Senate to defeat this legislation, and to work toward a \nnew policy toward Cuba that offers a better chance of bringing long \noverdue, fundamental democratic and economic reform to the Cuban \npeople.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to address the vote for cloture on \nthe Dole-Helms amendment to the Sanctions Act.\n  I will be voting for cloture because I wish to see this process move \nalong. This bill has been pending all year, and it is time we addressed \nit and moved on. In voting for cloture, however, I want to make clear \nthat I do not support this legislation. I think it is a mistake, and I \ndo not believe it will achieve the intended results.\n  First, this bill will impose trade sanctions on many of our closest \nallies and trading partners throughout the world. That is not going to \nhelp the people of Cuba in any way, but it is going to hurt American \ncompanies doing business around the world.\n  Second, the bill creates an unprecedented right of action for legal \nclaims of former property owners in Cuba. Not only will that impose a \nsevere burden on our court system, it will do so without, in anyway \nhelping the people who need it most--families and small property owners \nwho lost their homes and businesses to the Castro regime. This new \nright of action will also put us into conflict with some companies \nheadquartered in some of our closest allies who are now operating \nplants in Cuba.\n  As a result of both of these problems, the United States will find \nitself under immediate attack in the World Trade Organization.\n  This legislation will only add to the already overwhelming misery of \nthe \n\n[[Page S 15205]]\nCuban people. I do not want to do that, and I know none of my \ncolleagues do either. Certainly, we all want to see an end to the \nCastro regime--a cold war relic whose time has passed. I believe, \nhowever, that Castro's days are numbered. Communism has fallen around \nthe world, and it will fall in Cuba as well. We should let it fall of \nits own weight, and then be there to assist the Cuban people in \ndeveloping and nurturing a new democratic successor. This bill will not \nachieve that goal--in fact, it will move in the other direction. I urge \nSenators to oppose it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to now \nproceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to discuss a matter \nthat I have discussed on several other occasions on this floor over the \nlast few months, and that is the issue of schoolbus safety in this \ncountry. I would like to update the Senate on the progress that we are \nmaking in this particular area.\n  The bad news, Mr. President, is that there are still, we believe, \nover 100,000 unsafe schoolbuses on the road in this country today, \n100,000 schoolbuses that at this moment, at least in the Eastern time \nzone, the Eastern part of the country, are in the process of taking \nchildren home from school.\n  I have been involved in, and my staff has been involved in, trying to \nalert the school officials, schoolbus safety officials, in all the 50 \nStates to this particular problem. And I think we are making progress \non a number of fronts.\n  First, one of the major causes, as I have talked about before on this \nfloor, of schoolbus fatalities is the drawstrings that appear around \nthe waist and other parts of clothing of the coats worn by many \nschoolchildren today. As children get off of schoolbuses, this \ndrawstring is liable to get snagged in the gap that exists between the \nbus wall and the handrail itself.\n  Since 1991, at least five children that we know of have been killed \nin this manner, have been stuck on the bus that that particular \ndrawstring has caught, and they have been dragged by the bus and they \nhave been killed.\n  I am pleased, Mr. President, to report that the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission is taking action on this problem. Last month they \nrecommended to the American Society of Testing Materials, the ASTM, \nthat the drawstrings be shortened. Experts agree that this measure will \nhelp prevent these accidents.\n  This is, Mr. President, a big step--a big step--in the right \ndirection. As a result of CPSC's recommendation, the ASTM has already \nannounced a voluntary standard for the drawstrings. Drawstrings that \nare 4 or 5 inches in length are now banned.\n  The ASTM also announced plans for a research project to determine if \nthere is any ideally safe drawstring length. The results of this study \nare to be announced on November 30.\n  Second, we, as a country, are starting to fix the buses. A bus \nmanufacturing company bought some of the assets of another bus company, \na company had gone out of business, a defunct bus company that was \npurchased. And the new bus company has decided voluntarily to provide \nmaterials to retrofit many of the dangerous buses made by the defunct \ncompany. It will do this at cost. That particular company is also \ntrying to identify other unsafe buses that are still on the road so \nthey, too, can be retrofitted.\n  Third, I have brought with me to the floor, Mr. President, a copy of \na pamphlet that children are getting in an elementary school in my \nhometown of Cedarville, OH. This particular pamphlet gives good advice \nto parents. ``Teach your children to look out for the straps and \ndrawstrings. Be very careful when you are getting on and off the \nschoolbus.''\n  This was provided courtesy of the Pupil Transportation Safety \nInstitute, 1-800-836-2210. It is a very simple brochure, but a brochure \nthat we hope will do some good.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I think parents all over America should \nget a pamphlet just like this. It is available from the Pupil \nTransportation Safety Institute. Let me again repeat the number, 1-800-\n836-2210. As the pamphlet says, ``Schoolbus safety is a team effort.'' \nSo, Mr. President, let us work together to make all these schoolbuses \nas safe as they can be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15205-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15205-S15206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would also like to talk about another \nissue this afternoon, and that is an issue that I discussed briefly \nthis morning, an issue that we in the Senate will be debating for the \nnext few weeks and an issue that has, I believe, historic importance, \nnot just in this Senate but to this country, not just to this \ngeneration but to our children's generation and our grandchildren's.\n  I rise specifically today, Mr. President, to discuss the \nreconciliation bill that we expect to reach the floor sometime in the \nnext 2 weeks.\n  This bill embodies the decision that the American people expressed \nlast November. The American people last December decided that we need \nto make a fundamental change in course for our U.S. Government\n  Many of us ran, many of us talked about these issues, and what were \nthe commitments? I think we can summarize them as follows. There are \nmany, but four essential commitments were made last November, four \ncommitments that we will work over the next few weeks to carry out:\n  First, we need to balance the budget.\n  Second, we need to replace the welfare system with a system that \nrewards work and creates opportunity.\n  Third, we need to rescue Medicare from bankruptcy.\n  And fourth, we need to give some tax relief to the hard-working \nfamilies of this country. Four basic simple things that I believe, if \npassed, if enacted, will fundamentally change the direction of this \ncountry.\n  While these are simple, I think it is fair to say that this is really \nan extremely ambitious agenda. Even to consider an agenda of this \nmagnitude would make this a truly historic Congress. But in this \nreconciliation package, the Senate is about to pass this agenda, to \nactually pass it, and to send it on to the President of the United \nStates.\n  Except for a few days at the beginning of 1953, the last time a \nDemocratic President had to deal with a Republican Congress--with a \nRepublican Congress--was from 1947 to 1949. In the 1948 election, the \nDemocratic President accused the Republicans of running a do-nothing \nCongress. The current President is very well equipped with rhetorical \nammunition. They work very hard on this at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue, but I think that the charge that this is a do-\nnothing Congress is not one the White House will be using any time \nsoon, or at least the White House will be using successfully any time \nsoon, because the fact is, this Congress has stepped up to the plate \nand made some extremely tough decisions.\n  This Congress has passed a balanced budget plan for the first time, \nif we carry it out, since 1969. This Congress is fundamentally \noverhauling the welfare system, and just a few weeks ago on this floor, \nthis Senate passed a historic welfare bill.\n  I believe this Congress will take the steps to save Medicare from \nbankruptcy.\n  This Congress is working to relieve the tax burden on working \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, this is the historic agenda the 104th Congress is \nprepared to send to the President of the United States. Let us make no \nmistake, this reconciliation package is the only proposal on the table \nthat will achieve the goals of the American people.\n  Our national goals are to balance the budget and to let working \nfamilies keep more of their own money. The Republican reconciliation \npackage accomplishes both of these goals. Indeed, Mr. President, if you \nlook at it a certain way, these two are, in fact, the \n\n[[Page S 15206]]\nsame goal. If we do not take action now to balance the budget, the tax \nburden will only get worse and worse for American families in the \nfuture.\n  The report of the bipartisan entitlement commission could not be more \nclear: If we do not change our present course by the year 2012, every \nsingle penny in the Federal budget will be consumed by entitlements and \ninterest on the national debt. If in the year 2012 we want Government \nto do anything at all, such as run the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, \nrun a program for women, infants, and children, the WIC Program, or any \nother things we consider important, it would have to mean a tax \nincrease, a huge, staggering tax increase. You would have to have a tax \nincrease, because there is no money left to do these things.\n  Let me try to put our present course in historical perspective and \ntalk about an American family.\n  When my parents graduated from high school in early 1940's, the debt \non each child who graduated that year was approximately $360. By the \ntime my wife, Fran, and I graduated in 1965, it was up to $1,600 for \neach child.\n  When our older children, Patrick, Jill, and Becky, graduated in the \nmid-1980's, that figure had risen per child. The debt for each child \ngraduating those years was $9,000. If we continue to go the way we have \nbeen going, by the year 2012, just 1 year after our grandson, Albert, \ngraduates from high school and just 1 year after our daughter, Anna, \nenters college, by that year 2012, that figure will be $25,000. That \nwill be $25,000 in debt for each person--each man, woman, child--in \nthis country.\n  What a staggering debt, what a horrible legacy we would be leaving to \nour children and our grandchildren. Clearly, the longer we wait to \nchange course, the worse it will be for the American people.\n  The reconciliation package that we will be considering balances the \nbudget by slowing the rate of growth of Federal spending. Let me repeat \nthat. It balances the budget by slowing the rate of growth.\n  Columnist James Glassman of the Washington Post has proposed a useful \nway of looking at this bill, this package. Add up all the spending by \nthe Federal Government over the last 7 years and compare it with the \ntotal this budget proposes to spend over the next 7 years. The result: \nSpending over the next 7 years will increase over the last 7 years by \n$2.6 trillion.\n  Let me repeat that. Spending will increase. The truth is that by \nlimiting spending growth to just a little more than the expected rate \nof inflation, by doing this, what would seem to be, simple act, we can \nbalance the budget.\n  If we as a nation cannot summon the will and the courage to make that \nrelatively small sacrifice, how on Earth can we expect the next \ngeneration to face a budget with no money in the discretionary account, \nno money for defense, no money for social programs, and $25,000 of debt \nowed by every single American?\n  Mr. President, over a working lifetime, the interest alone on the \nnational debt will cost an American child born today a total of \n$187,000.\n  It is clear to me as well as to the American people this could very \nwell be our last chance to solve this problem before it is really too \nlate. This is a grave responsibility, and I do not believe that we can \nback away from it.\n  Is there an alternative? Is there anything else we can do? The \nPresident has proposed a different approach. His budget, according to \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the budget office that he \ntold us we should be following, contains deficits, according to their \ncalculation. His budget, the President's budget, contains deficits of \n$200 billion as far as the eye can see, for the foreseeable future. His \nbudget never gets to balance. Let me repeat that. According to CBO, the \nPresident's budget never gets to balance. In other words, no balanced \nbudget, staggering deficits as far as the eye can see.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that is how America wants to begin a \nnew millennium. For over 200 years, we have given hope to all the \nnations of the world--hope that free men and women are, in fact, \ncapable of self-government, capable of making responsible choices to \nensure a prosperous future for our families, our children, and for our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, a vote for the Republican reconciliation package is a \nvote to balance the budget so that we can start reducing the national \ndebt and so we can put America on course toward a future we can be \nproud to leave our children.\n  The administration's budget proposal would take today's staggering \ndeficits, add 24 percent, and then ask our children and grandchildren \nto pay our bills. Often in the past, Americans have faced up to a \nchoice, a choice between two futures. The choice we make in this \nhistoric Congress will rank with some of the most important in our \nNation's history. As Congress decides and as America decides, I believe \nwe should stay true to our national calling. We should prove, Mr. \nPresident, that America is in fact capable of responsibility. We must \nbalance the budget so that our children and grandchildren do not have \nto pay our bills. We must, we should, put the future first and support \nthe reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15205-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15206-S15217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY [LIBERTAD] ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2916, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I appreciate the passion with which the \nauthor of this term limitation amendment believes in his cause. I can \nalso appreciate the fact that he is adamant in having the Senate debate \nthe issue of term limits. But I strongly suggest that the remaining \ndays of the first session of the 104th Congress are not the time to \nundertake this debate. There will be plenty of opportunity when we \nreturn next year, as the able and distinguished majority leader has \nindicated, for the Senate to consider a constitutional amendment \nlimiting the terms of service. I urge my colleagues to not vote for \ncloture today and to reject the amendment.\n  Notwithstanding the logistics, I believe that the Founding Fathers \nwere exactly correct when they declined to establish in the \nConstitution arbitrary limits beyond those that are set forth in the \nConstitution regarding congressional service. It is not that the idea \nhad not occurred to them. On the contrary, the Framers of our great \ncharter deliberately rejected this structural prescription--one might \ncall it a proscription; it is both a prescription and a proscription. \nInstead, they opted for having the number of terms a Member could serve \nlimited not by the calendar, but rather by the Member's performance, \nmeasured through regular and periodic elections. After more than 200 \nyears under that principle, we would all be correct to question why it \ndeserves radical change.\n  Proponents may argue that it is, in fact, necessary to amend our \nConstitution in order to preserve the Framers' original vision of a \ncitizen-legislator who would set aside his plow to serve the Republic, \nonly to return to his fields as swiftly as possible. But when I think \nabout those men who painstakingly crafted our Constitution--men like \nMadison, Washington, Franklin, Hamilton, Wilson, Mason, and others--I \nhave serious doubts about the strength of such vision. These were men \nwho devoted nearly all of their adult lives to public service. And that \nsuch men could truly embrace that bucolic notion is dubious, at best. \nThe fact is that the citizen-legislator has long been a political myth. \nNow, with the ever-increasing complexities of public affairs, it is \nalso an unrealistic myth.\n  For the same reason we have professional doctors, professional \naccountants, professional teachers and professional engineers, we need \nan experienced Congress. In each of the cases I have mentioned, \nexperience counts, and it should count. No one would go to an untrained \nand inexperienced heart surgeon. If they want to do that, they could \ncome to me. That surgeon only \n\n[[Page S 15207]]\nbecomes so professional through a long period of schooling and an \nequally long residency at a hospital.\n  In the same light, the only way to become a better, more efficient, \nmore professional legislator is through years of practical experience \nhere in the Congress. Richard Russell, Everett Dirksen, Sam Rayburn, \nand Hubert Humphrey did not become the legislators that they became \nthrough limited terms. Just the opposite is true. They became \nproficient and experienced lawmakers through long years of dedicated \nservice, learning their craft and honing their skills.\n  And finally, Mr. President, although I will have more to say to this \nissue at the appropriate time, I hope Senators will reject this notion \nof term limits for the most obvious of reasons: the surest and most \neffective term limit is that which can already be imposed by the \nvoters. When the term of any Member of the House of Representatives or \nthe Senate expires, the American voter can turn any Member of this body \nor of the House of Representatives out of office for any reason. They, \nthe voters, alone pick and choose whom they wish to have represent \nthem. They alone, and not some arbitrary calendar, determine who will \nserve in this body. And no constitutional amendment, no matter how well \nintentioned, can improve upon that situation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. What is the pending business, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is H.R. 927.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I gather there is no time agreement \nother than the set rollcall, as I understand it, at 5 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit at this time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as I understand it, the matter of \nstrengthening sanctions on the Cuban Government is the underlying \nlegislation, with the pending amendment being one offered by the \ndistinguished colleague from Missouri with regarding term limits. I \nwish to talk on a subject relating to term limits, specifically the \nneed to retain a sense of history around this place. I oppose term \nlimits by way of any further provision other than that in the \nConstitution, that we in the Senate have to run every 6 years. I have \nfaced the voters in six elections since I first came to the U.S. \nSenate.\n  In attempting to change the existing restraints, we are in danger of \nlosing the sense of history that is necessary in a democratic \ngovernment. Specifically, I want to address the budget and the \nreconciliation measure that will soon be considered, the so-called \ntrain wreck, to see if we can all talk in one vocabulary relative to \nthis budget, and to specifically demonstrate that there is no plan at \nthe present time that balances the budget.\n  If you were to go out on the sidewalk and ask any of the relatively \ninformed passers-by, they would tell you, ``Well, there is a Republican \nplan to balance the budget by the year 2002, but the Democrats want to \nspend more money.'' The fact is, neither the President nor the \nDemocrats nor the Republicans have a plan to balance the budget by the \nyear 2002--or 2005, for the simple reason we refuse to face the truth; \nto face the reality.\n  Let me ask the staff to put copies of our budget tables around on all \nthe desks and some upstairs for the media.\n  When Senator Howard Baker was the majority leader back in 1981, we \nsaw that we were on a collision course. Specifically, we knew you could \nnot cut taxes and raise revenues. Finally, the press seems to be \ncatching on. I read with pleasure the first ``truth in budgeting'' \narticle that I have seen this year, entitled ``GOP Tax Cuts Will Add \n$93 Billion to the United States Debt, Budget Analysts Say,'' by Jackie \nCalmes.\n  I have called to congratulate the young lady since yesterday. I am \ngoing to continue to try to find her, because she really has made \nhistory.\n  I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in its entirety at \nthis point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 16, 1995]\n\n  GOP Tax Cuts Will Add $93 Billion to U.S. Debt, Budget Analysts Say\n\n                           (By Jackie Calmes)\n\n       Washington.--Despite Republicans' claims to the contrary, \n     their tax cuts will add billions to the nation's nearly $5 \n     trillion debt even as the GOP seeks to balance the budget by \n     2002.\n       An estimated $93 billion in extra debt will pile up as a \n     result of the Republicans' proposed $245 billion in seven-\n     year tax cuts, according to calculations from GOP \n     congressional budget analysts. And that's assuming the \n     economy gets the huge $170 billion fiscal stimulus that \n     Republicans are counting on as a consequence of balancing the \n     budget over seven years, thanks mostly to lower interest \n     rates.\n       GOP leaders agreed last summer, as part of a House-Senate \n     budget compromise, to apply that hypothetical $170 billion \n     ``fiscal dividend'' toward their proposed $245 billion in tax \n     cuts. That left $75 billion in revenue losses unaccounted \n     for. Interest on that amount would add about $18 billion, for \n     the total $93 billion in debt.\n       Meanwhile, the Republican architects of the plan boast that \n     the tax cuts are all paid for with spending cuts. Senate \n     Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, announcing his \n     panel's draft $245 billion tax-cut package last Friday, said \n     it would be completely financed with lower interest rates and \n     smaller government. ``Other factors like that will add up to \n     $245 billion,'' the Delaware-Republican said.\n       And Oklahoma Sen. Don Nickles, another Finance Committee \n     panelist and a member of the Senate GOP leadership, added, \n     ``We will not pass this tax cut until we have a letter'' from \n     the Congressional Budget Office reporting that Republicans' \n     proposed spending cuts through 2002 will give us a balanced \n     budget and a surplus of at least $245 billion.'' He added, \n     ``It's all paid for.''\n       The confusion has to do with the frequently misunderstood \n     distinction between the nation's accumulated debt, now \n     approaching $4.9 trillion, and its annual budget deficits, \n     which have built up at roughly $200 billion a year.\n       Republicans' spending cuts, it's projected, generally will \n     put the annual deficit on a downward path until the fiscal \n     2002 budget shows a minimal surplus. But the annual deficits \n     until then, while declining, together add nearly $1 trillion \n     more to the cumulative debt. Meanwhile, the GOP tax cuts add \n     to those annual deficits in the early years--in fact, the \n     fiscal 1997 deficit would show an increase from the previous \n     year. Thus the debt, and the interest on the debt, would be \n     that much higher.\n       Interviews in recent weeks indicate that many House and \n     Senate GOP members are unaware of the calculus. And some are \n     unfazed even when they hear of it. ``It would bother me if I \n     thought we were adding to the debt,'' said Texas Sen. Phil \n     Gramm, now seeking the presidency on his record as a fiscal \n     conservative, ``but I don't think we are.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I worked with Senator Baker when he was \nin the majority, and the majority leader, in pushing for a freeze; \nnamely, to take this year's budget for next year. We reasoned that if \nwe could just hold the line, we would save billions and billions of \ndollars.\n  I was asked to go ahead and offer the budget freeze. Senator Baker \ngave some laudatory remarks. He could not endorse it. Unfortunately, we \nwere tackled from behind, by Don Regan, the Secretary of Treasury, and \nDave Stockman. Since I have started putting articles in, let me get \nright to the subject of tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, let me quote what the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, Mr. Stockman had to a couple of years ago, when \nI quote from an article in which he wrote:\n\n       The root problem goes back to the July 1981 frenzy of \n     excessive and imprudent tax cutting that shattered the \n     Nation's fiscal stability. A noisy faction of Republicans \n     have willfully denied this giant mistake of fiscal governance \n     and their own culpability in it ever since. Instead, they \n     have incessantly poisoned the political debate with a \n     mindless stream of antitax venom while pretending that \n     economic growth and spending cuts alone could cure the \n     deficit. It ought to be obvious by now that we can't grow our \n     way out of it.\n\n  We have had none other than the better words of Mr. Stockman, who was \none of the leaders of the tax-cut Reaganomics, Kemp-Roth approach.\n  I have heard the distinguished Chair and others talk about a balanced \nbudget, and I want to shed some light on the reality that you are not \nsaving money or making money with tax cuts. If we are going to get rid \nof the deficit and the debt, we are going to have to have spending \ncuts, spending freezes, tax loophole closings, and we are going \n\n[[Page S 15208]]\nto have to deny ourselves programs. I support the idea of voluntarism \nand helped to start the Peace Corps. But when went to start AmeriCorps, \nI withheld my support because there was a new multi-billion-dollar \nprogram that we just could not afford. So, it takes sacrifices, but it \nalso takes a balanced approach with spending freezes, spending cuts, \nloophole closings, withholding of new programs, and a revenue \nincreases.\n  The reason we are in this particular dilemma is that nobody in public \noffice can use the expression ``tax increase'' and get by with it. They \ndescribe it as some kind of lunatic fringe. The media, which is charged \nwith the responsibility of exposing the truth and bringing us in public \noffice to task, has joined the conspiracy. They are one of the major \nculprits--by constantly quoting inaccurate deficit numbers and to \nbudget that are balanced when they should know otherwise.\n  Take this particular budget we will soon be discussing. I ask you to \nrefer to Mr. Kasich, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1996. Mr. Kasich in \nthe conference report on page 3, and I read under the entitlement \nsubsection 4, ``deficits,'' fiscal year 2002, a deficit of $108.4 \nbillion. So, please, spare me from all this balanced budget talk. The \nmedia, the politicians, the White House, both parties and everybody \nelse--let us start talking reality. The Republican plan that claims to \nbalance budgets has no idea of being balanced. Indeed, Chairman Kasich \nhimself in his conference report projects a deficit of $108.4 billion.\n  Let me focus for a moment on this tax-cut nonsense that we have to \nlisten to in our debate. We talk about whether the cut is for the \nmiddle class, or the rich, or whether you are going to get credit, or \nwe get credit or how much, or whatever it is, but no one really wants \nto come and say that the tax cut is going to lose revenues. That is why \nI have inserted this article that appeared yesterday in the Wall Street \nJournal, entitled ``GOP Tax Cuts Will Add $93 billion to the United \nStates Debt.''\n  Going just to the October 23 issue of the New Republic, let me quote:\n\n       Neoconman in the late 1970's and early 1980's, Irving \n     Crystal, editor of the Public Interest, helped lend \n     intellectual credibility to the supply side theory that \n     cutting taxes would not increase the deficit. Crystal opened \n     the public interests to supplysiders and introduced Jack \n     Kemp, author of the Kemp-Roth tax bill that initiated the era \n     of disastrous deficits, to supply side guru Jude Waninsky. In \n     the 30th anniversary of the Public Interest, Crystal now \n     confesses that he and his allies never really understood \n     economics. They were merely after a something-for-nothing \n     gimmick that could help elect Republicans.\n\n  Now he quotes from that particular statement in Public Interest, and \nI quote it.\n\n       Among the core social scientists around the Public Interest \n     there were no economists. They came later as we matured. This \n     explains my own rather cavalier attitude toward the budget \n     deficit and other monetary or fiscal problems. The task, as I \n     saw it, was to create a Republican majority so political \n     effectiveness was the priority, not the accounting \n     deficiencies of Government.\n\n  I quote just a couple other sentences from that particular article:\n\n       Now he tells us. Thanks anyway, Irving, for the confession \n     of complete political cynicism. The accounting deficiencies \n     of Government, by the way, at last count add up to $4.9 \n     trillion.\n\n  If you look at the historical budget tables that I have distributed, \nI started back when we balanced the budget. This Senator has voted for \na balanced budget. Yes, I am an endangered species--one of a very few \nleft around here. But in 1968-1969, under President Lyndon Baines \nJohnson, you can see that the unified budget was in surplus by $3.2 \nbillion, or the real budget surplus was $2.9 billion.\n  These are CBO figures, by the way. And I have researched them all the \nway back to the 1940's. But I wanted to have these figures on one piece \nof paper showing the Government budget in outlays, the trust funds and \nthe unified deficit--which together make up for the real deficit--the \ngross Federal debt, and the gross interest costs.\n  I know people get bored listening to figures, but they better listen \nto this because they are going to have to live with these figures. You \ncannot avoid them. You cannot avoid death. You cannot avoid taxes. And \nyou cannot avoid the interest costs on the national debt.\n  Right here in 1996, the present fiscal year, you can see that the \nCongressional Budget Office has projected an interest cost on the \nnational debt of $348 billion. That is $1 billion a day. There are only \n365 days in a year. So we have got automatic spending--or, rather, \nspending on automatic pilot of $1 billion a day.\n  This cancer has got to be excised. It cannot be defrauded. It cannot \nbe finessed.\n  The present budget for 1996 increases spending. You will find at the \nbottom of the page not only the Kasich conference report which shows a \n$108 billion deficit in the year 2002--where they say on the face of \nthe document itself there is a deficit and not a balanced budget--but \nalso the 1996 budget outlay of $1.5756 trillion. Then look just below \nthat, of course, is 1995, last year's, $1.518 trillion. So as you go \nfrom 1995 to 1996, you have increased spending.\n  Here is the best of the best that have come to town, the 74 freshmen \non the House side that are controlling the agenda and are said to be \nbeyond the control of the distinguished Speaker. And instead of cutting \nspending, they have increased spending $57.6 billion. That envisions, \nof course, abolishing the Department of Commerce, the Office of \nTechnology and Assessment, the Advanced Technology Program, cutting \neducation, cutting housing, cutting all of these other things, and \nGovernment outlays still increase.\n  Mr. President, here we have also listed the CBO baseline assuming \npassage of legislation to enact the budget resolution. The outlays for \nthe year 2002 are $1.876 trillion, and the revenues of $1.883 trillion. \nSo that is close enough. We call that a balanced budget. But now look \ndown below, how they get to that particular outlay figure. They do that \nby extending the freeze on discretionary spending through the year \n2002.\n  This fact is assumed rather than stated in the document prepared by \nthe Republican Budget Committee staff entitled, ``Conference Agreement \nCompared to Baseline.'' It is used by Senator Domenici, our \ndistinguished chairman and shows $1.876 trillion in outlays. The way \nyou get it down to those outlays is starting from a figure at the top \nof the sheet called ``Current Law Deficit.''\n  Well, if you have not been in the budget game, you might say, ``Wait \na minute. What in the world is a current law deficit?'' Translated into \nreality, it says, ``Assume that the discretionary caps do not expire in \n1998 and continue them for the year 1999, the year 2000, the year 2001, \nand the year 2002.'' They pick up $91 billion--by extending the \ndiscretionary freeze through 2002.\n  Then they say, ``the necessary spending cuts of total deficit \nreduction'' on the work sheet. This is using the chairman of the \nRepublican Budget Committee's own document. I am not playing games with \nfigures. I want to assume everything they say is true and show you they \nstill do not have a cause of action.\n  If we assume everything they say is true, they still do not have a \nbalanced budget. Why? Because they say you have got to cut in the year \n2002 a reduction of $235 billion in addition to the freeze of $91 \nbillion. And then comparing apples to apples, we must subtract from \nthat $1.876 trillion, the $109 billion surplus in the Social Security \ntrust fund. So the total reduction needed in the year 2002, is a $435 \nbillion reduction.\n  Now, Mr. President, look at what we are doing here. In the year 1996 \nwe are trying to get a $10 billion reduction in non-defense spending--\n$10 billion. And, at the present time, we cannot get it. That is why we \nhave not passed all of the appropriations bill. Our colleagues on the \nRepublican side, as well as the colleagues on the Democratic side, are \nstruggling to find $10 billion in discretionary cuts, much less $435 \nbillion.\n  In the debate on the State, Justice, Commerce Appropriations bill, I \nused the expression that if the present budget plan balanced by the \nyear 2002, I would jump off the Capitol dome. The chairman of the \nBudget Committee, my colleague, Senator Domenici, said, ``Well, you \nbetter take hang gliding lessons.'' I said, ``I'm not going to take \nthem from you because I know I will crash, just like this budget.''\n  I can tell you here and now, if we cannot cut $10 billion in this \nstruggle \n\n[[Page S 15209]]\nwith the best of the best and the sincere intent of the newcomers \nclaiming that all we have to do is cut spending, I know I have a safe \nbet when you look at the year 2002, and try to cut $435 billion.\n  Now, that is a swing, Mr. President, from this present year of a \n$57.6 billion increase. If you want to talk reality, rather than \nincreasing $57.6 billion, you need to turn around and cut $435 billion. \nThat is an almost $500 billion change in position. It is not going to \nhappen.\n  Why do the distinguished newcomers have such difficulty in stomaching \nthese cuts? The mistaken assumption is that Government began when they \ngot elected--that we had not been cutting. President Ronald Reagan, the \nbest of the cutters, was here for 8 years, and I worked with him. I was \non the Grace Commission. That is when we tried the freeze, and then \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings. When we could not get the freezes, we said we \nhad to have automatic cuts across the board. If the budget did not come \nout as you had predicted, what you had to do was automatically cut \nacross the board, otherwise known as a sequester. A majority of the \nDemocrats and a majority of the Republicans voted for Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings.\n  Now, right to the point, Senator Gramm went along with the repeal of \nthat on October 19, 1990, at 12:41 a.m. Look at the Record. I raised \nthe point of order. I said that if we did not follow through with \nautomatic cuts across the board, we would instead start increasing \nspending. We do not have truth in budgeting.\n  We not only cut under President Reagan, we cut under President Bush. \nIncidentally, I had gone from the attempts of the freeze and cuts \nacross the board with Gramm-Rudman-Hollings to supporting of closing of \ntax loopholes. We worked it out with the Finance Committee, and passed \nthe Tax Reform Act of 1986. We had supposedly done away with corporate \nwelfare, but now they are beginning to talk about it again.\n  Then in 1989 and 1990, I talked to the President, and particularly to \nDick Darman, the Director of his Office of Management and Budget. I \nsaid, ``This thing is getting out of hand. The debt is so big and \ninterest is so high that we are not getting on top of just paying the \ninterest on the national debt.'' It was something like Alice in \nWonderland's character whereby you have to run faster to stay where you \nare.\n  So I said to Darman, what we need is a value-added tax across the \nboard in America. He said, ``How are you going to get votes for it?'' I \nsaid, ``We will get it in the Budget Committee. If you and the \nPresident will come out for it, we will run with them and get on top of \nit. If you don't, by 1992, you are going to be in real trouble.''\n  The truth is, in 1992, President Bush was in real trouble. The \ndeficit was up to $400 billion and President Clinton did not so much as \nwin that election as President Bush lost it. The people said: ``We hear \nall the rhetoric about what all they are going to do with balanced \nbudgets, but like Tennessee Ernie, another day longer and deeper in \ndebt;'' and there we are, Mr. President, you can understand exactly \nwhat I am talking about.\n  We had been to the Budget Committee and we got eight votes to \nincrease taxes across the board. We had Senator Boschwitz. We had \nSenator Danforth. It was bipartisan. We got eight votes in the Budget \nCommittee, but the Bush administration would not follow through. As a \nresult, as I stated in 1992, we were up against $400 billion deficits.\n  President Reagan came to office in 1988 and pledged to balance the \nbudget in 1 year. Of course, he soon backtracked and said, ``Oops, this \nis way worse than I ever thought. It is going to take me 3 years.'' \nWell, here was the pledge made; they are all talking about pledges and \nI want to get to this one. The pledge made was to balance the budget in \na year, and then in 3 years, and they instead paved the way for truly \nastronomical deficits.\n  Mr. President, gross Federal debt in 1980 was $909 billion; in 1981, \nit was $994.8 billion.\n  Former OMB Director Stockman called this gross incompetence--let me \nuse the exact expression he used. I had it here just a minute ago. To \nquote Mr. Stockman: ``Willfully denying this giant mistake of fiscal \ngovernance.''\n  Giant mistake of fiscal governance, whereby in almost 200 years of \nhistory and 38 Presidents, Republican and Democrat, we had not reached \na trillion-dollar debt. Now, in 12 short years, add on 3 under Clinton, \n15 years, we are up to $5 trillion. We have quintupled the debt of the \nUnited States of America.\n  Senator Thurmond and I are going to get by. We are up there now in \nage, so we do not have to worry. It is not going to be us paying. It \nwill be our children and grandchildren. We have to constantly hear this \ncaterwaul over on the other side of the aisle: ``We want people to get \nout of the wagon and start pulling''----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allocated to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, I am about to \ncomplete my thought here, to extend for another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, my only question will be, there are some of \nus who want to speak on the Cuban matter before the vote. The vote is \nat 5 o'clock. I do not know how many people are lined up to speak. I am \nenjoying the Senator's speech. I would like to listen to it. Can we \nextend the vote for 5 or 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent to change the \ntime of the vote, which is now set for 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent that it be extended to 5 past 5 \nand that I be allowed to speak.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremaining time be equally divided between the two sides in the usual \nform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the point should be made that for years \nnow up here, at least for the past 15 years, we in the Congress have \njumped up into the wagon. We have not paid a bill in 15 years, and we \nhave crowded out the children; we have crowded out the hungry; we have \ncrowded out the poor and the sick; and we have been up in that wagon. \nSo do not give me this stuff about let us help pull the wagon when we \ndo not pay our own way.\n  There is one fellow in this town, one individual that is not \nresponsible for this deficit, and that is William Jefferson Clinton. \nPresident Clinton was down in Little Rock, AR, when this sham and fraud \nstarted. He came to town and cut the deficit 500 billion bucks. He \nincreased taxes even on Social Security. He cut defense without a \nsingle vote on that side of the aisle.\n  Yet, they constantly appear talking about a balanced budget when they \nknow it is not balanced, and continue to chastise the one person who \ndid something about it.\n  Last year when the Medicare trustees reported that Medicare was going \nbroke in the year 2001, they cried, ``What is the matter? We have the \nbest health system. There's nothing wrong.'' They would not do \nanything.\n  So President Clinton has tried. Now we are trying again. I ask these \nfellows to get off that high horse of this fraudulent nonsense about \ntheir balanced budget plan when it is far from being balanced--they \nreport it themselves as a $108 billion deficit--and start working with \nus and cut out the sham about who is in the wagon.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague and ask that the document that I \nhave referred to throughout my speech entitled, ``Budget Tables'' be \nprinted at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                                                                                \n\n[[Page S 15210]]\n                                                        BUDGET TABLES: SENATOR ERNEST F.

There is 10 minutes for the proponents and 10 \nminutes for the opponents.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I assume the proponents as being those \nseeking cloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. What is the amount of time for the opponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes on each side.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask the Senator from Connecticut, through the Chair, \nif he would yield me time to speak in opposition to the motion.\n  Mr. DODD. It is my understanding that the time remaining is equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Helms bill \non Cuba. As I have said on the floor several times before, it advances \nthe wrong policy at the wrong time.\n  Fidel Castro is finally, reluctantly, finding that his government \nmust accept the realities of the 1990's: that free trade and political \nliberalization are fundamental to the promotion of enlightened self-\ninterest. As we have seen time and again, once a people have tasted the \nfruit of freedoms they invariably demand the only atmosphere in which \nfree markets and human rights flourish. That, of course, is democracy \nand a government protective of a phalanx of rights: the free exchange \nof ideas and information; respect for human rights; the right to seek \none's livelihood unhindered by government fiat. We are seeing the first \ntentative steps toward an emerging market economy in Cuba; the first \nsteps, we can all agree and hope, which point towards and end of this \ndictatorship.\n  So I find it ironic that at the very moment when the United States is \npresented with the best opportunity in nearly four decades to encourage \nand influence the move toward positive change in Cuba, the Senator \nseeks to legislate that opportunity out of existence. Rather than \nencourage the Cuban Government to move into the 1990's, the Helms bill \nwould have it slide back into the 1960's, dragging the administration \nas well into continuing and, indeed, strengthening a fossilized policy \nof isolation that did not work even when, it could be argued, a bipolar \nworld justified such short-term thinking.\n  In fact, rather than seek to promote the kind of positive change \nadministrations, Republican and Democratic, have sought for decades, \nand which at long last holds out the promise to lift the Cuban people \nout of the misery visited on them by Castro's totalitarian regime, the \nHelms bill, incredibly, would increase their pain by further isolating \nCuba. It is wishful thinking--nearly 40 years of wishful thinking--that \na tightened embargo will provide the final push leading to the downfall \nof the Castro regime. We can be certain, rather, that Castro will put \nthis pain to good effect: if the history of recent Cuban-American \nrelations has taught us anything, it is that to this day Castro can \nstill rally a proud people against the bogeyman of Yanqui imperialism.\n  But Senator Helms' bill does not stop at increasing the hardship of \nCuba's people. It seeks to impose on other nations--close allies in \nmany cases--extraterritorial provisions which conflict with \ninternational law and various treaties to which the United States is \nparty. I note that the embargo is already considered by many of our \nallies to be a hopelessly out-dated affront to their sovereignty: the \nHelms proposal will only lead to retaliation at a time when we seek \ntheir cooperation on issues of greater complexity and, frankly, of more \nimmediate import to our national interests.\n  I would add, as well, that our Latin American friends see efforts \nsuch as the Helms bill as a vestige of the gunboat diplomacy which, to \nthis day, leaves them wary of our intentions. But it is not enough that \nthis bill would hurt the average Cuban, enrage our allies, and renew \nthe suspicions of our Latin American friends. It would also strike at \nthe American taxpayer. Senator Helms would have the administration \nseek--in vain, in my opinion--to expand TV Marti, a failed program \nwhich figuratively and literally crashed in a Florida swamp. The Cuban \npeople have not seen the truth from TV Marti, because they never see TV \nMarti.\n\n  Rather, the truth is more likely to come to them as Cuba gains more \naccess to international television, engages in dialogs about the rest \nof the world, and integrates into the international community. \nTherefore, we should encourage policies and dialogs which will lead to \nthe political changes and freedoms sought by the Cuban people.\n  The administration's October 5 announcement that it will seek to put \nin place measures designed to promote the flow of information into and \nout of \n\n[[Page S 15211]]\nCuba is a step in that direction. To further promote, rather than \nstrangle, democratic transition in Cuba, United States NGO's would now \nbe authorized to help independent Cuban NGO's provide training to Cuban \nhuman rights activists. Without employing the expensive baloondoggle of \ntaxpayer-funded TV Marti, for example, United States news bureaus would \nset up shop directly in Cuba and Cuban news agencies here in the United \nStates. The new regulations are also family friendly, easing procedures \nfor Cuban-Americans who want to visit relatives in Cuba.\n  However, the proposed policy will not reward a totalitarian regime \nwhich continues to violate basic human rights with impunity. In fact, \nthe administration proposes enhanced enforcement of the embargo and the \nU.S. Neutrality Act. This mixed bag approach--injecting into Castro's \nsystem the poison of free thought while continuing to restrict his \naccess to the relief found in free trade--may not be the perfect \nsolution. I think it is time for a new strategy in Cuba, rather than \nmore of the same, which the Helms bill advocates and which has clearly \nfailed. I believe an incremental approach, which minimizes the pain to \nthe Cuban people and the cost to the American taxpayer, while making \nclear our determination to not do business as usual with the Castro \nregime, offers the best current hope of effecting change. The Helms \namendment does everything but that, so I urge its defeat.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that Juan Alsace be granted the \nprivilege of the floor during the consideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity \nAct currently before the Senate presents us with a difficult decision. \nI am sure we all favor the early return of freedom in Cuba. I am sure \nthe sponsor of this act believes that this legislation would contribute \nto that aim. There are those of us, though, who have grave doubts.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly concerned about the impact of this \nproposed legislation on our Nation's national security interests. For \nthat reason, I requested the views of our responsible military \ncommander Jack Sheehan, commander in chief of the United States \nAtlantic command, under whose command Cuba falls.\n  I would like to share the letter I received, dated October 15, from \nGeneral Sheehan, who is in direct charge of the security aspects of \nCuba under his command. It says:\n\n       Dear Senator Nunn: I am writing to provide my assessment of \n     the potential effect of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic \n     Solidarity Act * * * could have on the United States Atlantic \n     command and operations in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. There are \n     currently 8,000 Cuban migrants in camps at Guantanamo Bay, \n     down from 20,000 5 months ago. The Department of Defense has \n     processed more than 100,000 Cuban and Haitian migrants in \n     Guantanamo Bay over the last few years. When the migrant \n     population was at its peak, it cost the Department of Defense \n     over $1 million a day in operation and maintenance--money \n     which was not in the budget. Additionally, prior to the White \n     House policy announcement in May, we had more than 6,000 U.S. \n     personnel in a potentially explosive situation--guarding and \n     caring for Cuban migrants who were frustrated because there \n     was no hope of leaving the camps.\n       From a military perspective, the current version of the \n     Helms-Burton bill could create conditions for more migrants. \n     I believe the Cuban economy is at a low point. I have this on \n     interviews of more than 40,000 Cubans who have been through \n     Guantanamo. They say one of the primary reasons for leaving \n     Cuba is to be able to provide a basic quality of food and \n     shelter for their families. The bill in its current form \n     could further punish the people, not Castro or the privileged \n     elites. Furthermore, rather than promoting a peaceful \n     transition in Cuba, the bill could give Castro an excuse to \n     maintain his focus on ``U.S. aggression,'' rather than his \n     own failed ideology. I also question the bill's implied \n     assumption that strengthening the embargo would lead to a \n     revolt from within and create the conditions for a transition \n     to democracy. Cuba is not Haiti--the circumstances which \n     allowed for a successful intervention in Haiti, with only one \n     American casualty, do not exist in Cuba. Any operations \n     involving U.S. forces in Cuba would likely have a much higher \n     cost in terms of lives and national treasury.\n       Our policy objective should be the peaceful transition of \n     power in Cuba, and I support any congressional language that \n     brings about that change.\n\n  Mr. President, in short, General Sheehan believes that our policy \nobjective should be the peaceful transition of power in Cuba to \ndemocracy. But he does not believe the legislation before us will make \na net contribution to this objective. He believes that this \nlegislation, in fact, will have the opposite effect and that it will \nbasically cause an increase in the very migration that has now finally \nsubsided.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can work out, before this legislation is \nconcluded, a satisfactory bill that can be agreed to on both sides of \nthe aisle and supported by the administration. I do not believe this \nlegislation meets that test.\n  I thank the Senator for the time. I yield back whatever time I have \nremaining.\n  I ask unanimous consent that General Sheehan's letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               Commander in Chief,\n\n\n                                        U.S. Atlantic Command,\n\n                                                 October 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     Senate, Committee on Armed Services, Senate Russell Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: I am writing to provide my assessment of \n     the potential effect the Cuban Liberty and Democratic \n     Solidarity Act (The Helms/Burton Bill) could have on the \n     United States Atlantic Command and operations in Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba. There are currently 8,000 Cuban migrants in camps \n     at Guantanamo Bay, down from 20,000 five months ago.

Sheehan,\n                                       General, U.S. Marine Corps.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I do not see any of the proponents on the \nfloor at this point. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes, forty seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me take the time. I presume the Senator from North \nCarolina may come to the floor shortly.\n  Mr. President, I want to spend some time this afternoon explaining \nthe very complex issue of how the U.S. Government deals with property \nclaims by U.S. citizens who have had their property expropriated by a \nforeign government and who failed to receive adequate and effective \ncompensation for such action.\n  I believe that it is important to do so, because what we are prepared \nto do today, if we enact this pending legislation into law, is to \ntotally reverse more than 46 years of practice on how we as a \ngovernment have dealt with this question. Not only would it alter the \nscope of claimants who would be able to seek some remedy from the U.S. \nGovernment for acts against property held abroad, it would also change \nthe manner in which the U.S. Government seeks to ensure that claimants \nare compensated.\n  So, how have property claims been handled in the past? for which \ncountries? What have been the results?\n\n[[Page S 15212]]\n\n  Claims by U.S. citizens for losses arising from a foreign \ngovernment's nationalization, expropriation, or other takeover of their \nproperty are administered under provisions of the International Claims \nSettlement Act of 1949. That act originally authorized the \ninternational claims commission to adjudicate claims pursuant to an \nagreement negotiated between the United States Government and the \nGovernment of Yugoslavia.\n  During ensuring years the act has been amended a number of times to \nauthorized the commission--now called the Foreign Claims Settlement \nCommission--to determine claims against a number of other \nforeign governments, including Cuba that have expropriated property \nfrom our citizens.\n\n  The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission has already processed the \nclaims of United States citizens who lost property in Cuba. That is why \nwe can say with certainty today that thee are 5,911 certified U.S. \nclaimants who have not been compensated for their losses.\n  It is not the responsibility of the Commission to actually make \npayment of the awards for these certified claims. That responsibility \nrests with the Secretary of the Treasury, as funds become available for \npayment of claims. Funds generally come available through negotiated \nagreements between the U.S. and the foreign government in question.\n  Since 1949, the Commission has undertaken claims programs in 36 \ncountries--including most recently--Yugoslavia, Panama, Poland, \nEthiopia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Italy, the Soviet Union, \nCzechoslovakia, Cuba, the People's Republic of China, East Germany, \nIran, Vietnam, and most recently Albania. That means that the \nCommission has processed or is processing claims by American citizens \nthat their property was taken by the government in question.\n  Claims settlement agreements have been reached with a number of these \ncountries including Yugoslavia, Panama, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, \nRomania, Italy, China, and Vietnam. That means that the United States \nand the government in question have reached agreement on a sum of money \nwhich such government has agreed to provide to the United States for \ndistribution to the claimants.\n  In the case of Cuban claims, the Commission evaluated some 8,800 \nUnited States claims over a 5-year review period--1967-1972--and \ndetermined that some 5,911 were in fact valid claims. Once the United \nStates and the Cuban Government have reached agreement on a sum of \nmoney to compensate these claimants then the funds will be paid out by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury for these claims.\n  In none of these cases were property claims of non-U.S. citizens \nincluded in these claims settlement procedures. One of the key \nqualifications in each one of these claims programs is that the \nclaimant must first and foremost have been a U.S. citizen at the time \nthe property was taken. The reason for this is obvious. While we may \nnot agree with the manner in which another government regulates or \notherwise makes decisions about the property of its citizens, how that \nissue gets resolved is to be sorted out between that citizen and his or \nher government.\n  Now, not only are we going to jettison the Foreign Claims Settlement \nCommission as a method of adjudicating property claims, we are going to \ndramatically increase the scope of claimants. The bill would change the \ndefinition of who is eligible for U.S. assistance in resolving his or \nher claims.\n  The bill before us would have the Federal district courts be the \nvenue for resolving these suits. Any Cuban-American whose property was \ntaken and is currently being used in a commercial activity is eligible \nto sue for up to triple damages for such losses.\n  How many claims are we talking about? There is clearly some dispute \nhere. In one of the earlier versions of the Helms legislation, it was \nasserted that this figure was in the hundreds of thousands. Analysis by \noutside experts have indicated that there is a range of possibilities \nreaching as high as $430,000. No one knows for sure. Yet some in this \nchamber are prepared to vote for this legislation anyway, in the name \nof being tough on Castro.\n  This is the height of irresponsibility in my view. The only one that \nwe are being tough on is ourselves and our own judicial system. The \nonly one we are being tough on is this administration and future \nadministrations that will have to deal with the court logjam in the \ncontext of forging normal relations with any post-Castro government.\n  Mr. President, let me point out to my colleagues once again that the \nheart of this legislation is title III of the bill. Again, briefly, \nwhat this title III of the bill will do is expand the universe, the \npopulation of those who would be able to utilize the U.S. system in \norder to be compensated for lands that were expropriated from them. \nWhat it does is carve out a unique group of citizens in our country--in \nfact, people not even citizens of this country--to be able to take \nadvantage of our claims compensation program.\n  Under more than four decades of law, Mr. President, we have provided \nassistance to United States citizens whose lands were expropriated by a \nforeign government. There are some 6,000--in fact, we know the exact \nnumber, which is 5,911 claimants, who have been certified as bona fide \nclaimants. This legislation would say that you no longer have to be a \nUnited States citizen when it comes to Cuba, that even if you are not a \ncitizen of the United States today, but you incorporate yourself for \nthat purpose, you can take advantage of the law that is designed \nspecifically to assist United States citizens.\n  Now, Mr. President, that would expand the universe from 5,911 \ncertified claimants to one estimate of 430,000 people, at a cost of \n$4,500 to process each claim. My colleagues can do the math and see the \nexplosive costs here. Beyond the costs, there are 37 other nations in \nthe world with whom we have expropriation cases pending on behalf of \nU.S. citizens. We do not carve out or create a situation where those \nwho have left those countries and have become citizens or are not \ncitizens of this country, but would incorporate themselves for the \npurpose of having those claims processed by the United States, are \nincluded. So nations such as Poland, Vietnam, People's Republic of \nChina, and others, would not be given the same benefits, with all due \nrespect to Cuban-Americans, Cubans who left Cuba to seek redress under \nthis law we are adopting.\n  I am sympathetic to the people who had lands expropriated without \ncompensation, but the law was written specifically to assist U.S. \ncitizens at the time of the expropriation. If we want to change the \nlaw, we ought to do so with all nations, not just one. Certainly, \nPolish-Americans, those who were left in East Germany, and others, \nwould have just as much right, it seems to me, if we are going to carve \nout an exception as those so poorly treated in Cuba. For that reason, \ntitle III deserves special attention.\n  Let me echo the comments of my colleague from Georgia. I would love \nnothing more than to see democracy come this evening to Cuba. But we \nneed to think smartly, intelligently, and prudently as to how we can \nexpedite that conclusion.\n  Jude Winitisky wrote an excellent piece in the Houston Chronicle, \nwhich I inserted in the Record last week. I encourage my colleagues to \nreview that article.\n  He makes a strong case that we have a wonderful opportunity, I think, \nto create that kind of a change. This legislation would set us back in \nthat process.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against this cloture \nmotion in hopes we might be able to come up with some sort of a bill \nhere that makes far more sense, with all due respect, than the one that \nwould come before the Senate if cloture is adopted. I urge the \nrejection of the cloture motion.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, some opponents of the pending Libertad \nbill, I am sad to say, appear to be willing to say almost anything to \ndefeat this bill, a bill that Cubans inside of Fidel Castro's land are \npleading with us daily to \n\n[[Page S 15213]]\n\npass so that they could have an opportunity for freedom.\n  These people in Cuba are writing to me every day. We have had--I do \nnot know how many letters--50 or 60. Yet the forces who oppose this \nbill have repeatedly misrepresented what the bill does and have ignored \nthe support that this bill has among the American certified claimant \ncommunity as well as among Cubans inside Cuba.\n  Now, the record needs to be set straight about what these two groups \nare saying about the Libertad Act.\n  Last week, for example, this Senate was told that all certified \nclaimants oppose this bill. Not so. For example, Colgate-Palmolive, a \ncertified claimant whose stolen property is valued at over $14 million \nin 1960 dollars, wrote to me stating this communication is to state for \nthe record the support of Colgate-Palmolive Co. for Senate bill S. 381. \nThis is the bill pending right now.\n  Then Procter & Gamble, another company who had property seized by \nFidel Castro's crowd and is therefore a certified claimant, wrote to me \nand said, We support this legislation as currently written, and agree \nwith the aims and goals of the Cuban Liberty and Solidarity Act.\n  Then there is another claimant company, Consolidated Development \nCorp., whose president, Alberto Diaz-Masvidal, testified before the \nForeign Relations Committee this past June in strong support of this \nbill.\n  The United States-Cuban Business Council, the largest private sector \norganization addressing Cuban issues of interest to businessmen--\nparticularly American certified claimants--has actively encouraged its \nmembers to support this legislation. In September, a letter went to all \nof its members asserting that the Council considers the Libertad Act to \nbe beneficial for the United States business community, protection of \nUnited States property rights, and the economic development of a free \nmarket, democratic Cuba.\n  Another American property owner supporting the Libertad bill is the \nCintas Foundation, which is a New York charitable organization. This \norganization owns artwork on loan right now to the National Museum in \nHavana and it, too, has been victimized by Castro's thievery. In 1991, \ntwo pieces from the Cintas collection appeared for auction in London. \nSee, what is happening? Castro is stealing this stuff and selling it \noverseas. The Cintas Foundation submitted testimony to the Foreign \nRelations Committee saying that the Libertad bill provides an important \nlegal avenue for the Cintas Foundation to prevent any further attempts \nby the Castro regime to break up and sell off this valuable art \ncollection.\n  These are just a few examples. Now, then, the truth deserves to be \nheard.\n  There have been specious suggestions that the Cuban people are \nopposed to the Libertad bill, the pending bill. Absolutely untrue. Yet \nit has been said on this Senate floor that that is the case.\n  Scores of letters and cassette tapes have been smuggled out of \nCastro's Cuba and delivered to me expressing support for the Dole-Helms \nbill or the Helms-Burton bill, or however you want to describe it.\n  These are Cubans who are very well aware that in speaking out against \nCastro they will be persecuted, to say the very least. They go ahead \nand speak at great personal risk because they are willing to put their \nlives on the line to help get this bill passed. Yet we have voices in \nthis Senate and we have voices in the news media saying this is a \nterrible bill.\n  Mr. President, let me read from one or two of the letters. A vast \nnumber of Cuban citizens on October 8 signed a letter to me saying:\n\n       We, as members of the internal opposition to the \n     dictatorial regime that oppresses us, ask you, in the name of \n     the men and women who languish in Castro's prisons or who saw \n     the ends of their days before a firing squad, that you \n     cooperate to remove the last tyrant in our continent.\n\n  Then they said:\n\n       A vote in favor of Helms-Burton will bring joy and hope to \n     all Cubans. It is not the embargo that keeps the Cuban people \n     hungry and desperate, but the Castro dictatorship, and that, \n     all of Cuba knows well.\n\n  Then there is an October 10 statement delivered by cassette tape \nrepresenting the views of more than a dozen leaders of human rights and \ndissident groups in Cuba saying:\n\n       The U.S. embargo works. The few changes that have taken \n     place in Cuba are a result of economic, political, and \n     diplomatic pressures. Those pressures should be intensified. \n     We support the Helms-Burton initiative. We call upon the \n     Executive not to veto it, if passed. It is a peaceful \n     measure, aimed only at preventing that foreign investors \n     continue buying from the Cuban Government properties \n     confiscated from and not paid to United States and other \n     citizens. By passing this bill, you will be taking a fair \n     ethical decision in the name of freedom and democracy.\n\n  In September, the leader of another dissident group, Democratic \nSolidarity Party in Cuba, wrote,\n\n       We want freedom from oppression, we want respect for our \n     rights, but most democratic government seems to ignore this, \n     * * * But we know that we are not alone in this problem, and \n     you are proof of that Sir. * * * We are deeply thankful of \n     you, and all the politicians who are not forgetting the \n     ultimate interest of the Cuban people * * * to live in \n     freedom and democracy.\n\n  There are many more, but I think Senators get the point, which is \nthis: American citizens whose property was stolen by Castro want this \nbill passed. The Cuban people are begging that it be enacted. I simply \ncannot be a party to our turning our backs on them. The Cuban people \ndeserve freedom. They are pleading for our help.\n  The question just will not go away. Can we in good conscience, Mr. \nPresident, turn away from them and walk away on the other side of the \nroad?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters and \nstatements previously referred to in my brief remarks be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material has ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   U.S.-Cuba Business Council,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1995.\n       Dear Council Member: As you know, the US-Cuba Business \n     Council has closely monitored congressional and Executive \n     Branch action on the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity \n     Act of 1995 [H.R. 1868], known as the LIBERTAD Act of the \n     Helms-Burton bill. The LIBERTAD Act has undergone significant \n     change since the bill was originally introduced. Council \n     members have inquired as to how the Council views the \n     potential impact of this bill on the US business community.\n       The measure, in its current form, addresses many of the \n     concerns expressed by the Executive Branch, the business \n     community and legal scholars. As modified, we believe that \n     the LIBERTAD Act is fundamentally consistent with the goal of \n     current US policy on Cuba designed to foster a democratic \n     change with guarantees of freedom and human rights under the \n     rule of law. Congressional action on the bill may take place \n     as early as this week.\n       Chapter I of the bill includes measures to strengthen the \n     embargo against Cuba. Questions have been raised about the \n     ``extra-territoriality'' of these provisions. As currently \n     drafted, LIBERTAD Act is consistent with US obligations under \n     the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and does not involve secondary \n     boycotts.\n       Chapter II establishes a framework for trade with, and \n     economic assistance to, a transitional or democratic \n     government in Cuba. Some US certified claimants have \n     expressed concerns that Section 737 of the bill may diminish \n     the pool of available assets for American property claimants \n     by conditioning US assistance to Cuba on resolution of claims \n     held by those who were not US citizens at the time of \n     confiscation. Section 737 of the LIBERTAD Act has been \n     significantly modified to address such concerns. As amended, \n     this section protects the rights of certified US claimants by \n     conditioning assistance to a transitional government in Cuba \n     on U.S. Presidential certification that the Cuban government \n     is taking appropriate steps to resolve property claims \n     involving US claimants as described in Section 620(a)(2) of \n     the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.\n       A key element of the LIBERTAD Act involves measures under \n     Chapter III to defend US property rights and discourage \n     foreign investors from trafficking in confiscated US \n     properties. Under these provisions, foreign firms trafficking \n     in stolen US property in Cuba would risk action by US \n     claimants against their US-based assets [(Chapter III) \n     Sections 741-744] and invite US action to revoke entry visas \n     of foreign corporate executives trafficking in confiscated US \n     properties.\n       We believe these measures will enhance the leverage of US \n     claimants seeking to discourage prospective foreign investors \n     from trafficking in their confiscated properties in Cuba, \n     facilitate the rapid and effective resolution of claims \n     disputes, and level the playing field for US firms preparing \n     to participate in the economic development of a democratic \n     Cuba.\n       Some US claimants have expressed concerns about allowing \n     Cuban American claimants to file suits against traffickers or \n     to obtain default judgements against the Cuban government. \n     Sections 742 and 744 of the LIBERTAD Act have also been \n     modified to \n\n[[Page S 15214]]\n     clarify that the bill does not authorize the President to espouse the \n     claims of naturalized US citizens in any settlement with Cuba \n     and will not dilute the pool of assets available to US \n     claimants. As modified, the LIBERTAD Act significantly \n     narrows and limits the filing of suits to effectively target \n     foreign firms trafficking in confiscated US-owned property.\n       In the new version of LIBERTAD, it is not possible to \n     obtain a default judgement against the current government of \n     Cuba. Moreover, the right of action to sue a trafficker in \n     stolen US assets applies almost exclusively to commercial \n     property. Claimants must provide suspected traffickers with \n     180 days notice before filing legal action and the case must \n     involve property worth more than $50,000. The Cuban \n     government claims a total of 212 joint ventures on the \n     island. Few of those enterprises are likely to have US-based \n     subsidiaries or other assets. Thus, only a handful of cases \n     against foreign firms in the US would qualify for \n     consideration in US courts. Accordingly, the Congressional \n     Budget Office estimated that the cost of enforcement of the \n     LIBERTAD Act would be less than $7 million. Furthermore, \n     under current law the President could halt such suits through \n     is authority under the International Emergency Economic \n     Powers Act once a transition regime is in power in Cuba.\n       On balance, the Council considers the LIBERTAD Act, in its \n     current form, to be consistent with the Council's mission \n     statement and beneficial for the US business community, \n     protection of US property rights, and the economic \n     development of the free market, democratic Cuba.\n       Please contact me or USCBC Executive Director Tom Cox in \n     our Washington office (202) 293-4995 if you need further \n     information on issues relating to this measure. I look \n     forward to hearing from you.\n       Best regards.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Otto J. Reich.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                        Colgate-Palmolive Co.,\n\n                                      New York, NY, June 20, 1995.\n     Subject: Cuba\n\n     Chairman Helms,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Foreign Relations, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, This communication is to state for the \n     record the support of Colgate-Palmolive Company for Senate \n     Bill S. 381 in the form of its June 12, 1995 draft.\n           Sincerely,\n     Emilio Alvarez-Recio.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           Adolfo Fernandez Sains,\n\n\n                              Partido Solidaridad Democratica,\n\n                                       Havana, September 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Senator Jesse Helms,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Hon. Senator Jesse Helms: We admire your courage, and we \n     thank you for your help.\n       We regret that you are so right. Because you are right sir, \n     if you were wrong, than we the cuban people would be facing a \n     lesser problem, but our problem is serious indeed. We want \n     freedom from oppression, we want respect for our rights, but \n     most democratic governments seem to ignore this, most \n     important newspapers ignore this, but we know that we are not \n     alone, in this problem, and you are aproof of that Sir.\n       Our problem is, that we are rule by intolerance. We are not \n     going to ignore this, and we should not reward intolerance.\n       A glance at the conduct of the cuban government will tell \n     you, the only language they understand is might, and never \n     reason.\n       Some seek dialogue, we deeply regret that they are wrong. \n     They are trying to dialogue with a non-repentant dictator \n     with all the power in his hands.\n       We would certainly prefer dialogue, but we cannot ignore \n     the truth.\n       Our prisons are full of political prisoners, and convicts, \n     that are convicts only in Cuba, their crimes are crimes only \n     in Cuba.\n       Our problem is not only economic, solving the economic \n     problem, and ignoring the political one, would leave us in \n     the hands of tyranny.\n       America has the right to defend their property, economic \n     sanctions are right, they are applied daily everywhere.\n       We are deeply thankful of you, and all the politicians who \n     are not forgetting the ultimate interest of the cuban people, \n     the ultimate right of the cuban people, to live in freedom, \n     and democracy.\n       Our struggle is not about the right we have to invest in \n     our own country, that is obvious. We are not opposing Fidel \n     Castro's government, because we want to be the owners of a \n     laundry shop, or a bar, or even a sugar factory.\n       We want all that for our people, but we also want to \n     publish an article in a newspaper, to establish an \n     association independent from the government, to create a \n     political party without having to go to prison for that.\n       Nobody should forget or ignore this. We think that the U.S. \n     government has so far understood this, and has remain firm, \n     and we appreciate it deeply.\n       You have been extremely generous with the cubans, so we are \n     very thankful to you, Senator personally, for all you have \n     done for us in this very difficult time, of our history, and \n     we have a history of friendship, and understanding, and good \n     neighborliness between our two people, and we want to go back \n     to that situation again.\n     Adolfo Fernandez Sains.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                               Party of Democratic Solidarity,\n\n                                  City of Habana, October 8, 1995.\n       Distinguished U.S. Senators: Today you are not simply \n     debating a law, you are debating the future of a nation. We, \n     as members of the internal opposition to the dictatorial \n     regime that oppresses us, ask you, in the name of the men and \n     women who languish in Castro's prisons or who saw the end of \n     their days before a firing squad, that you cooperate to \n     remove the last tyrant in our continent. It is dishonorable \n     to allow a dictator, who with terror maintains an entire \n     nation in the dark ages, to continue to blatantly ignore the \n     rights of the men and women in the land of Jose Marti.\n       A vote in favor of Helms-Burton in the Senate of the U.S. \n     will bring joy and hope to all Cubans. It is not the embargo \n     that keeps the Cuban people hungry and desperate, but the \n     Castro dictatorship, and that, all of Cuba knows well.\n       May God illuminate you and allow you, and the rest of the \n     world, to clearly declare enough is enough! to the bloody \n     dictatorship that misgoverns our country.\n     Miguel Angel Aldana Ruiz,\n                                                  President of the\n                                               Marti Civic League.\n     Ramon Varela Sanchez,\n                                                   (In detention),\n                                                   Vice-president.\n     Annia Navarro Gonzalez.\n     Omar Acosta Rodriguez.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 October 10, 1995.\n     Message to: Senator Robert Dole, President of the Senate, \n         Senator Jessie Helms, Chairman of the Foreign Relations \n         Committee, the U.S. Senate.\n       Cuba is the country with the highest rate of suicide, \n     prisoners, exiled nationals and abortions in the Americas, \n     and probably in the whole world. That will be enough to \n     oppose Castro's government, even if it were not a 36 year old \n     dictatorship that has plunged the Cuban people into poverty, \n     divided the Cuban family, and brought to the country an \n     ideology, enemy of Democracy and Freedom, alien to our \n     traditions and our environment, and on behalf of which the \n     human rights of the Cuban people are violated.\n       The Cuban government has not shown the necessary political \n     will to bring about changes in the country. We believe that \n     the Cuban government does not understand any language, other \n     than pressure, and coercion measures. Even if the Cuban \n     government decided to effect a true economic reform, leading \n     to a market economy, something it has not done, and in our \n     opinion, will not do, we would still be in the hands of a \n     dictatorship.\n       President Clinton recently announced a package of measures, \n     adopted unilaterally by the U.S. Government in relation to \n     Cuba. We consider it counter-productive to send the Havana \n     regime a mixed signal, giving them a certain hope that with \n     our holding free, fair and internationally supervised \n     elections, an amnesty for all political prisoners and \n     legalizing the internal opposition, they could get rid of the \n     U.S. Embargo.\n       The U.S. Embargo works. The few changes that have taken \n     place in Cuba are a result of economic, political and \n     diplomatic pressures. Those pressures should be intensified. \n     We support the Helms-Burton initiative. We call upon the \n     Executive not to veto it, if passed. It is a peaceful \n     measure, aimed only at preventing that foreign investors \n     continue buying from the Cuban government properties \n     confiscated from and not paid to, U.S. and other citizens. \n     Those investments only completed to extend the suffering of \n     the Cuban people.\n       Distinguished Senators, you are facing an ethical \n     alternative, where you choose whether you support or not this \n     Bill, know that you are choosing between the weak and the \n     powerful. The weak are the Cuban people, torn by so much pain \n     and suffering. The powerful are Fidel Castro's totalitarian \n     and anti-democratic government, that continues to make \n     decisions affecting our lives and compromising the future of \n     the whole people, without ever submitting to the will of \n     those people in the ballot box. By passing this Bill, you \n     will be taking a fair ethical decision in the name of Freedom \n     and Democracy, which you enjoy fully as their main advocates \n     in today's civilized world.\n       Finally, a word of thanks to the American people and their \n     Government, and for the support, the solidarity and \n     generosity that historically they have extended to the Cuban \n     people.\n       And now, from Cuba, signing this document on behalf of \n     their respective organizations:\n       Partido Solidaridad Democratica, Hector Palacio Ruiz, \n     President and Fernando Sanchez Lopez, Vice President, and \n     National Executive; on behalf of Partido Democrata 30 de \n     Noviembre Frank Pais, Osmel Lugo Gutierrez, Vice President; \n     on behalf of ALFIN, Asociacion de Lucha Frente a la \n     Injusticia Nacional, Beatriz Garcia Alvarez, President, \n     Fernando Alfaro Garcia, Vice President; on behalf of Liga \n     Civica Juvenil Martiana, Miguel Aldana Ruiz, President, Ania \n     Navarro Gonzalez, Vice President; on behalf of Partido Pro \n     Derechos Humanos en Cuba, Lazaro Gonzalez Valdes, President; \n     on behalf of APAL Independiente, Juan Jose Perez Izquierdo, \n     Vice President, and Vicente Escobar Rivero; on behalf of \n     Corriente Liberal Cubana, Juan Jose Lopez Diaz, President; on \n     behalf of Asociacion Ecologista y Pacifista de Cuba, Leonel \n     Morejon Almairo, President; on behalf of Movimiento \n\n[[Page S 15215]]\n     Democrata Cientifico, Juan Rafael Fernandez Peregrin, President; on \n     behalf of Comite Cubano de Opositores Pacificos \n     Independientes, Victoria Ruiz, President, and Lazaro Garcia \n     Cernuda; on behalf of Movimiento Maceista por la Dignidad, \n     Isidro Herrera Carrillo, President; on behalf of Frente \n     Femenino Humanitario, Gladys Linares, President; on behalf of \n     Consejo Medco Cubano Independiente, Jesus Marante Pozo, \n     President, and Dianeli Garcia Gonzalez; on behalf of Frente \n     Maximo Gomez from Pinar del Rio, Jose Angel Chente Herrera, \n     President, Juan Jose Perez Manso, and Julio Cesar Perez \n     Manso.\n       Also signing this document are a number of independent \n     activists: Norman Brito Hernandez Human Rights Activitist, \n     Rafael Solano, a Journalist and president of Havana Press \n     News Agency, Hector Paraza, Journalist, also from Havana \n     Press, Raul Rivero, a Poet and Journalist, President of Cuba \n     Press News Agency, Miguel Fernandez, a Journalist, Vice \n     President of Cuba Press News Agency, and Ana Luisa Lopez \n     Baeza, a Journalist, also from Cuba Press News Agency.\n       This document was produced in Havana City, on 10 of \n     October, 1995, and your speaker is Adolfo Fernandez Sainz, \n     from Democratic Solidarity Party.\n       Thank you very much.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [Source: Radio Marti, Havana, Sept. 21, 1995]\n\n   Comments by Miguel Angel Aldana, Executive of the Coalition for a \n          Democratic Cuba and Member of the Marti Civic League\n\n       At this time, we ask the U.S. Government and we ask \n     President Bill Clinton to support the Helms-Burton bill, \n     because it's the only way to free the Cuban people. It's the \n     only way that our human rights groups and the political \n     opposition are going to feel strong. If that bill is not \n     passed, the Fidel Castro dictatorship, which is crushing the \n     Cuban people, and which is committing injustices daily, is \n     going to get stronger. It's deceiving the U.S. Government, \n     the way it did with the boat people. It obligated the U.S. \n     Government to sit down at the negotiations table. They're \n     laughing at the American government, they're laughing at the \n     entire world, and they're doing away with the Cuban people.\n       We ask the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to \n     support those Senators, and we ask the American people to \n     support the Helms-Burton bill so that once and for all the \n     Cuban people will be freed from a dictatorship of more than \n     36 years that is leading and subjecting the people of Cuba to \n     injustice and abuses, and killing children, women and the \n     elderly from hunger.\n       When here the diplotiendas [stores for the elite with cash] \n     and the markets are full of food, the Cuban government is \n     alleging that there's an embargo, or blockade. The only \n     blockade here is the Fidel Castro dictatorship.\n       This bill has to be passed because the freedom that the \n     people of the U.S. enjoy has to be shared. This law is \n     necessary!\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\na message to senate majority leader bob dole, senate foreign relations \n  committee chairman jesse helms, and the entire united states senate \n                  from the democratic solidarity party\n\n       Cuba is the country with the highest rate of suicides, \n     political prisoners, exiled nationals, in the Americas, and \n     perhaps, in the whole world. That would be enough to oppose \n     Castro's government even if it were not a 36 year old \n     dictatorship that has plunged the Cuban people into poverty, \n     devided the Cuban family, and brought to the country an \n     ideological enemy of democracy and freedom alien to our \n     traditions and environment and on behalf of which the human \n     rights of the Cuba people are violated.\n       The Cuban government has not shown the necessary political \n     will to bring about changes within the country. We believe \n     that the Cuban government does understand any language other \n     than pressure and coercive measures. Even if the Cuban \n     government decided to effect a true economic reform leading \n     to a market economy, something it has not done and will not \n     do, we would still be in the hands of a dictatorship.\n       President Clinton recently announced a package of measures \n     adopted unilaterally by the U.S. government in relation to \n     Cuba. We consider it counterproductive to send the Havana \n     regime a mixed signal, giving them a certain hope that \n     without holding free, fair, and internationally supervised \n     elections, an amnesty for all political prisoner, and \n     legalizing the internal opposition, they could get rid of the \n     U.S. embargo.\n       The U.S. embargo works. The few changes that have taken \n     place in Cuba are a result of economic, political and \n     diplomatic pressures. Those pressures should be intensified. \n     We support the Helms-Burton initiative. We call upon the \n     Executive not to veto it if passed. It is a peaceful measure \n     aimed only at preventing that foreign investors continuing \n     buying properties confiscated from and not paid to U.S. and \n     other citizens. Those investments only contribute to \n     extending the suffering of the Cuban people.\n       Distinguished Senators, you are a facing an ethical \n     alternative. When you choose whether to support or not this \n     bill know you are choosing between the weak and the powerful. \n     The weak are the Cuban people, torn by so much pain and \n     suffering. The powerful are Fidel Castro's totalitarian and \n     anti-democratic government that continue to make decisions \n     effecting our lives and compromising the future of the whole \n     people without ever submitting to the will of those people in \n     the ballot box.\n       By passing this bill you will be making a fair ethical \n     decision in the name of freedom and democracy, which you \n     enjoy fully as the main advocates in today's main civilized \n     world.\n       Finally, a word of thanks for the American people and their \n     government, for their support, solidarity, and the \n     generousity that they have historically extended to the Cuban \n     people.\n       And finally, in this message from the Cuba Democratic \n     Solidarity Party president Hector Palacio Ruiz, vice-\n     president Osmel Lugo Guttirez, and the national Executive; by \n     the 30th November Democratic Party ``Frank Pais''; and on \n     behalf of Rafael Ibarra Roque who is in prison; the \n     Association for the National Struggle for Justice, Beatrice \n     Garcia Alvarez, president, Reinaldo Fargo Garcia, vice-\n     president; Marti Youth Civil League, Miguel Angel Aldana \n     Ruiz, president, Amnia Navarro Gonzalez, vice-president; the \n     Pro-Human Rights Party of Cuba, Lazaro Gonzalez Valdes, \n     president; Ampare Independiente, Juan Jose Perez Izquierdo, \n     vice-president, Vincente Escobar Trabiero; the Liberal Cuban \n     Current, Juan Jose Lopez Diaz, president; on behalf of \n     Association of Cuban Pacificists, Leonel Morejon Almagro, \n     president; on behalf of the Scientific Democratic Movement, \n     Juan Rafael Fernandez Pelegrin, president; on behalf of the \n     Cuban Committee Independent Pacifists in Opposition, Vicotrio \n     Ruiz, president, Lazaro Garcia; Maceo Movement for Dignity, \n     Isidro Carrera Carillo, president; on behalf of the Women's \n     Humanitarian Front, Gladys Linares, president; on behalf of \n     the Independent Cuban Medical Council, Jesus Marante Pozo, \n     president, Ana Beoneles Gonzalez, on behalf of the Maximo \n     Gomez Front from Pinar del Rio Province, Jose Vincente \n     Herrera, president, and Juan Jose Perez Manzo and Julio Cesar \n     Perez Manzo; and also a number of independent activists who \n     are also signing this document, Norma brito Hernandez, an \n     activist of human rights, Rafael Solano, a journalist who is \n     president of Havana Press News Agency, Hectro Peraza, \n     journalist, also from Havana Press, Raul Ribero, poet, \n     journalist and president of Cuba Press News Agency, Miguel \n     Fernandez, journalist, vice-president of Cuba Press, Ana \n     Luisa Lopez Baeza, journalist from Cuba Press.\n       This document is signed in Havana, October 10, 1995.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n  translation of interviews with cuban dissidents, september 24, 1995\n\n       New Jersey, United States, Sunday, September 24, 1995. The \n     Revolutionary Movement of the 30th of November this week held \n     interviews with several organizations in Cuba so as to know \n     their opinions with regard to the bill proposed by Senator \n     Jesse Helms and Congressman Dan Burton, a law that was \n     approved by the Congress this past Friday, 21 of September.\n       The first interview is with Osmel Lugo, Vice-president of \n     the Democratic Party, November 30 in Cuba. For those who \n     don't know, the President of this party, Mr. Rafael Ibarra is \n     in jail completing a 20 year sentence for his ideas contrary \n     to those of the Castro regime:\n       November 30 Democratic Party, special communique that \n     reflects the opinions of our organization.\n       In more than 36 years of the Castro regime never have human \n     rights been respected and the desire for development, \n     prosperity and liberty has been ignored for the Cuban people \n     now for more than three decades. In Cuba, when the U.S. \n     embargo wasn't even mentioned, and it was a time of need, \n     already more than 70% of imports were covered by the European \n     Communist markets. Unfortunately the Soviet Union sustained \n     and maintained the Cuban economy in exchange for a military \n     base called Cuba and not even then were we allowed to enjoy \n     our civil, political and human rights and we have never been \n     able to rid ourselves of the ration card that limits us to \n     what and when we can eat. The Cuban government has not shown \n     any interest in solving the serious problems affecting the \n     country even though government and non-government \n     organizations as well as other countries and governments have \n     made recommendations for this out of compassion for the tough \n     conditions the Cuban people are being put through. The Cuban \n     government has not only not shown signs of any interest of a \n     political process for change to a democratic and \n     representative government, but it remains in complete \n     immobility since it does not wish to lose the throne of \n     absolute power with which it has been able to govern the \n     country with an iron fist. Fidel Castro, as the most faithful \n     representative and highest ranking official of the Cuban \n     government has expressed and continues to express so that \n     there will be no misunderstandings his known phrase \n     ``Socialism or death.'' ``Socialism or death'' means or his \n     type of government or death with as much transparency as \n     macabre is the phase. The only solution Castro offers the \n     Cuban people is death or to live under his system of death \n     itself. And if several reforms have been taking place in the \n     economic field, reform measure which, may we add, could be \n     easily reversed, it has been simply to gain some time and \n     accommodate his needs of the moment more than to try and \n     solve the despairing social conditions. So we harbor no false \n     hopes that the lifting of the economic sanctions will change \n     the will of those who try to stay \n\n[[Page S 15216]]\n     in power or that they will put the dictatorial regime which allows them \n     to on the line. The end or lifting of the embargo would not \n     guarantee the respect of the civic, political and human \n     rights of the Cuban people or bring democracy to our country. \n     Rather, it would strengthen the totalitarian and dictatorial \n     regime that has destroyed Cuban society sinking it into \n     misery, indigence and mental slavery, facilitating it the \n     millions it needs to develop and perfect its repressive \n     apparatus the base and principle of its power. The lifting of \n     the embargo will not bring an amnesty for all the political \n     and conscience prisoners. It will not return the life of \n     hundreds of thousands that have died at the hands of the \n     regime or of those who have lost their lives trying to escape \n     through the Florida straits. Nor will it allow the recovery \n     of the remains of more than 42 people killed during the \n     homicide that took place in the sinking massacre of the ``13 \n     de Marzo'' tugboat for which the regime hasn't even allowed \n     flowers to be thrown in the sea. The embargo is not the cause \n     of Cuba's problems, it is actually the solution to these. \n     Intolerance is the only thing that should not, and cannot be \n     tolerated. The November 30 Democratic Party Frank Pais \n     ratifies its support for the bill for democracy in Cuba and \n     even asks for the globalization and internationalization of \n     sanctions against the Cuban government. We thank the U.S. \n     legislators that voted in favor of Helms-Burton and we \n     recognize their good will to contribute to the \n     democratization and liberty of the Cuban nation. At this same \n     time, we exhort the President of the United States, Bill \n     Clinton, to not veto this law if he truly wishes that Cuba be \n     among the democratic countries of the world where human \n     rights are respected and recognized.\n       Signed by the Democratic Party November 30. Dated in the \n     City of Havana on the 21st day of September, 1995.\n\n        Interview with Rafael Solano, president of Havana Press\n\n       Sergio Gatria from New Jersey. We want your opinion \n     regarding the debate this week in the House where the name of \n     Havana Press, your name, Jose Rivero's, who are journalists \n     who are being persecuted in Cuba, we want to know what your \n     opinion is with regard to these Congressmen who were \n     defending you.\n       Solano. Well, let me tell you that when I first received \n     the news I was very excited. Family members in Miami called \n     me that on the U.S. TV channels my name was appearing. In \n     other words, a series of personalities in this Congressional \n     session spoke about persecution and where it affects me \n     directly. As President of Havana Press I am very grateful to \n     these people, among who are Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Lincoln \n     Diaz-Balart, Robert Menendez, Robert Torricelli, Senator \n     Jesse Helms and Congressman Solomon from New York. That is an \n     incentive for all the independent press in Cuba, that people \n     within the U.S. government defend the independent press and \n     that encourage us to continue our task in this country that \n     censors the freedom of expression, it inspires us to continue \n     exercising independent journalism. I can sincerely tell you \n     that I am very grateful to these individuals and I believe \n     history will one day pick up these names that fight civically \n     so that we, the independent journalists, can continue \n     practicing our careers without the harassment from the \n     repressive organs of this government.\n       Gatria. Have you continued to be persecuted?\n       Solano. Yes. As everyone knows, last week I was arrested by \n     three officials of our country's State Security. I \n     personally, as director of Havana Press, am threatened with \n     10 years of jail for the crime of enemy propaganda. In other \n     words, in our country, he who expresses himself freely is \n     considered as a person who issues enemy propaganda. However, \n     the Constitution states that every Cuban citizen has the \n     right to express himself freely and change ideas, but in \n     practice, it is not allowed. Our position is that if we have \n     to go to jail for our cause, free press, the independent \n     press of which Jose Marti dreamt about, we are willing to \n     take that risk.\n       Gatria. Are you the only journalist that has been arrested \n     or have there been others?\n       Solano. Well Mr. Jose Rivero was also arrested in the past \n     few days. I was arrested on Thursday and he was arrested on \n     Friday; he also suffers from government harassment by the \n     State's Security Forces. I think the free press is an \n     instrument to make public the true Cuban reality and that is \n     what the government is afraid of, but, when we feel the \n     support of people like the ones I mentioned we are inspired \n     and we love our fight for a free press in Cuba even more.\n       Gatria. You also said that several journalists were being \n     attacked didn't you?\n       Solano. Well actually, I have next to me the Vice-President \n     of Havana Press who has actually been attacked because they \n     have launched a wave of attacks against independent \n     journalists, supposed delinquents have attacked independent \n     journalists and I would like you to speak to Julio Martinez \n     so that he can tell you what happened.\n       Gatria. So you were attacked?\n       Martinez. Yes, I was attacked by two unknown assailants the \n     morning of the 15th of September when I was headed home. They \n     immobilized me and took my jacket, shirt and tie and they \n     left me with pants and shoes.\n       Gatria. Do you think that was a normal mugging or have \n     there been other attacks against journalists?\n       Martinez. Solano was attacked by two unknowns after he \n     interviewed the ex-lieutenant Colonel Labrada. Rail Rivero \n     was also attacked a few days before and they stole his \n     briefcase. I was the last to be attacked.\n       Gatria. So it is a strange coincidence that there have been \n     so many muggings of Cuban journalists.\n       Martinez. They must simply be categorized as suspicious \n     muggings.\n       Gatria. Do you have anything else to add, Martinez?\n       Martinez. I want to congratulate those U.S. government \n     individuals who have come out in defense of the independent \n     journalists in Cuba. I especially want to thank Ileana Ros-\n     Lehtinen and the gentlemen Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Bob \n     Menendez who are Cuban.\n       Gatria. You know that Helms-Burton was approved in the \n     House . . .\n       Solano. Did it have more than the two thirds?\n       Gatria. Almost 300 votes . . . Has there been any reaction \n     from the Cuban people?\n       Solano. So it had a great majority. Well, I don't think the \n     Cuban people are very aware of what's happened, maybe the \n     Cuban press will have something today. You know that the \n     Cuban government had launched a huge campaign to stop Helms-\n     Burton, holding meetings in the streets, at work. We had a \n     favorable reaction to the approval of the bill and we gave \n     our reasons in Cuba's free press.\n\n   Interview with Elizardo San Pedro Marin, president of Democratic \n                            Solidarity Party\n\n       Gatria. I need you to state your name, the organization and \n     your opinion regarding Helms-Burton.\n       San Pedro Marin. We consider the approval of Helms-Burton \n     in the House is a very positive step that brings us closer to \n     a peaceful transition to democracy. The Cuban government has \n     felt the effects of the U.S. economic embargo after the fall \n     of the socialist bloc and it began to issue changes in the \n     economic sector, not in the political but in the economic to \n     try and retain its power. All this foreign investment and \n     looking for foreign investors shows that they have no means \n     within the country they have no solution to the problems we \n     face. And so the fight against Helms-Burton has become the \n     Cuban government's foreign relations priority and they have \n     been using all their time and manpower to fight against it. \n     There is still a lot of territory for the Helms-Burton bill \n     to cover but I believe the reasonable outcome will be \n     reached, that the bill will be approved. The Cuban government \n     doesn't understand any other kind of language except this \n     style, it is a government that is known for its intolerance. \n     So I think it is very positive that this bill was approved \n     because it is a commitment by the U.S. Congress to democracy \n     in Cuba. And even though we Cubans know that we are the ones \n     responsible for the changes within the island, we also need \n     the support from the U.S. government and this time we have \n     it.\n       Gatria. Do the other dissidents in Cuba have the same \n     criteria?\n       San Pedro Marin. There are all different kinds of opinions \n     among the dissidents. Of course there are dissidents who \n     think there are other alternatives to the situation, such as \n     the embargo being lifted, establishing a dialogue, that \n     Helms-Burton not be approved etc., but the Cuban government \n     has never stated that those changes will help to bring about \n     any kind of political change. For example, the Cuban \n     government has never stated that in exchange for something it \n     will release political prisoners, it does not recognize the \n     internal opposition, it doesn't speak about a free electoral \n     process, and it doesn't even speak about asking the people if \n     they want ``Socialism or Death'', or if they want pluralism \n     and democracy. in other words, there can be no concessions to \n     the Cuban government if the Cuban government has no intention \n     of solving any of its internal political problems.\n       Gatria. What is the opinion of the majority of the Cuban \n     people with whom you have spoken?\n       San Pedro Marin. The people don't know this bill. The \n     legislation has not been published by the Cuban press. The \n     people only know sections, details, partial or manipulated \n     information so the people really don't know. And even the \n     free press that reaches them, like Radio Marti, only \n     broadcasts sections of the bill so the people don't know. I'm \n     sure that there are people who don't understand it and don't \n     share this criteria but I think what the people need right \n     now is that this bill be approved and made law.\n\n                 Interview with Raul Rivero, Cuba Press\n\n       Gatria. Helms-Burton was passed in the House, would you \n     like to make a statement?\n       Rivero. Well, I signed a letter from the Democratic \n     Solidarity Part (Sampedro Marin) on a personal level, I'm not \n     a member of any political party but I signed it as a \n     journalist and as a Cuban. I support the bill, I believe in \n     it. It may seem strange and there has been a lot of \n     controversy that people could want more pressure on their \n     country, the problem is however, that there is no foreign \n     blockade, only an internal one that causes damage, that is \n     stuck on us by the government, that is the true blockade that \n     hurts the people. The true blockade as I said is an internal \n     one, issued by a group of people who wish to stay in power \n     and that is what has this country in ruins, not just in \n     material ruin, but a spiritual ruin.\n     \n[[Page S 15217]]\n\n\n                 Interview with Jose Rivero, Cuba Press\n\n       Gatria. Your names were mentioned and the persecution \n     suffered.\n       Rivero. Well, it's something that has been happening for \n     the past couple of months against the members of the free \n     press and they seem to have it in especially for Solano and \n     myself. Especially after the 13 of July, the anniversary of \n     the sinking of the ``13 de Marzo'' tugboat, since the 11th or \n     12th we've been visited by these people who harass us and try \n     to manipulate us and now around the 15th of this month when \n     we were arrested for a couple of hours. We know that this is \n     how it is going to be and it is nothing out of the ordinary \n     where dissidents are concerned.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2916, As Modified\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I come to the floor to make a motion in \nregard to the second-degree amendment which I have submitted to this \nbody. It is an amendment related to term limits. I believe that it is a \nsubstantial question and item on the agenda of the American people. All \nthe polls indicate overwhelmingly that the people favor term limits. \nForty States term limit their Governors; 20-some States have attempted \nto term limit the U.S. Congress.\n  The amendment before the U.S. Senate is a simple one. It says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the United States Senate \n     should pass a constitutional amendment limiting the number of \n     terms Members of Congress can serve.\n\n  Members of this body have debated this issue on this occasion and on \nprevious occasions. The pros and cons are well known. I do not believe \nwe will settle this issue with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, but I \ndo believe it is possible for us to identify those of us who are for \nterm limits and those of us who are against term limits.\n  In order to get this vote, I have conferred with the majority leader, \nand I have modified the amendment so as to make it consistent with his \nagreement with the rest of the freshman class on the Republican side \nand others that the amendment itself should be voted on next April.\n  Thus, this amendment merely says that it is the sense of the Senate \nthat we should pass a constitutional amendment limiting the number of \nterms that Members of Congress can serve. I want to express my \nappreciation to the majority leader for his cooperation in this \nrespect.\n  Last week, he assured me that he would do his best to assist me in \ngetting a vote on this matter at the earliest possible time this week, \nand here we are on the first day of our deliberations this week, and we \nwill have an opportunity to vote in this respect.\n  The procedure which I intend to invoke in order to have this vote is \na motion to table the amendment. Those who vote against tabling would \nbe voting in favor of term limits; those who vote in favor of tabling, \nwould be voting against term limits. But this will provide an \nopportunity for us to vote on this most important issue.\n  So, Mr. President, I now move to table the Ashcroft second-degree \namendment regarding the limitation of congressional terms, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, if I can take 1 minute or 2 minutes of \nleader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I do not have any objection to the vote. I \nam going to vote against tabling the resolution. But as I indicated \nwhen we were \n\n[[Page S 15218]]\nrequested by nearly every group who is supporting term limits, in \naddition to the Christian Coalition, I thought nearly every Member, \nevery Member of the freshman class and others, we did accommodate them \nby saying we would have the vote later. Some suggest next April, which \nwould give them time to do whatever they do in that time to encourage \nmore people to vote for term limits.\n  So I do not have any problems with the efforts of Senator Ashcroft. I \nwas prepared to bring it up 3 weeks ago, but I must say the same thing \nhappened with the flag amendment. We asked about it, and then all the \npeople who support the flag amendment said, ``Oh, we have to have more \ntime.'' All right, we will give you more time.\n  I am not certain when that amendment will be brought up, or if they \nwould like to do it later this year. I am not certain we will have \ntime. We had time last week and the week before. We had time for term \nlimits. I assume by next April we will have some additional time. I \ncannot set an exact date. All this resolution says is that we should \nvote sometime on term limits. I do not have any problem with that. So I \nhope the amendment will not be tabled.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters from the \nsupporters of term limits requesting that I reschedule the term limits \nvote for next year be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Christian Coalition,\n\n                                 Chesapeake, VA, October 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: The Cristian Coalition thanks you for \n     granting our request to reschedule a vote on a constitutional \n     amendment to provide for term limits until next year.\n       Postponement of the vote should increase our prospects for \n     success as the Senate will not be in the midst of \n     deliberations on reconciliation and appropriations bills, and \n     1996 will be an election year.\n       Thank you for your leadership and for your support for term \n     limits.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Brian Lopina,\n     Director, Governmental Affairs Office.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     Americans Back in Charge,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 12, 1995.\n\nTerm Limits Activists Applaud Senator Dole for Rescheduling Term Limits \n         Vote; Pledge To Mobilize Grassroots Support for Issue\n\n       Washington, DC.--Term limits activists today applauded \n     Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS) for agreeing to their \n     request to reschedule the Senate vote on term limits.\n       ``We applaud the willingness of Sen. Dole to reschedule the \n     first ever Senate floor vote on a term limits constitutional \n     amendment,'' said Cleta Mitchell, Director/General Counsel of \n     Americans Back in Charge in Washington, D.C. ``We requested \n     that Sen. Dole reschedule the vote on term limits until next \n     year. We believe it is in the best interests of the issue to \n     be able to focus public attention on term limits for the \n     weeks leading up to the Senate vote and that is not possible \n     at this time, with the congressional focus on the budget, \n     taxes and Medicare. It would not be fair to term limits for \n     the vote to occur now and we are pleased that Sen. Dole \n     agreed to our request that floor action be rescheduled.''\n       ``Term limits is an issue of fundamental importance and one \n     that the American people care about. Over 25 million votes \n     have been cast in favor of term limits in the past five years \n     in elections held in 22 states. Ultimately, the members of \n     the U.S. Senate will be called upon to make a decision as to \n     whether they intend to honor or ignore the obvious will of \n     the American people. We want to be certain that when that day \n     comes, the people have had a full and fair opportunity to \n     weigh in on the issue with their Senators, reminding the \n     Senate of the public support for term limits. We look forward \n     to working with our principal author, Sen. Thompson and the \n     other members of the Senate supporting term limits to build \n     the Senate between now and next spring when SJ Res 21 comes \n     to the Senate floor.''\n       Americans Back in Charge is the first national term limits \n     organization, which grew out of the 1st in the nation \n     Colorado state term limits effort in 1989-90.

Make no mistake, it is in the best \n     interest of the term limits movement that this Senate vote \n     come next April.''\n       Thompson pointed out that a vote now, in the midst of the \n     Senate debate over the budget and appropriations legislation, \n     would not receive the public or Senate attention it deserves.\n       Eight other Senate freshmen joint Thompson on a letter \n     delivered to Majority Leader Dole on October 4 requesting \n     that the vote be rescheduled in April. In addition, the Term \n     Limits Coalition--which includes Americans Back in Charge, \n     American Conservative Union, Christian Coalition, Council for \n     Government Reform, Seniors Coalition, Council for Citizens \n     Against Government Waste and National Taxpayers Union--\n     strongly urged in a separate letter that Dole delay the floor \n     debate and vote.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Bob Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: As the primary sponsors and supporters \n     of Senate Joint Resolution 21, the constitutional amendment \n     to limit congressional terms, we are joining forces to \n     request that the Senate postpone any scheduled vote on SJ Res \n     21 until April, 1996.\n       We have been meeting with and discussing the upcoming term \n     limits vote in the Senate with those individuals and \n     organizations who are most dedicated to passage by Congress \n     of the term limits constitutional amendment. Those who are \n     prepared to lead the effort to round up votes for SJ Res 21 \n     are in agreement that it makes little sense to bring the \n     issue to the Senate floor for a vote this fall when the \n     Senate is otherwise wholly absorbed with the crucial budget \n     issues.\n       Supporters of term limits have indicated to us that the \n     crush of other legislative business pending before the Senate \n     over the next two months will make it difficult, if not \n     impossible, for term limits to receive the kind of attention \n     from the Senate and the American people that it deserves.\n       We do not propose an indefinite postponement of the first \n     recorded vote on the term limits amendment. Rather, we would \n     specifically ask that the resolution be scheduled for a vote \n     in April, 1996. By making this change in the schedule, we \n     believe that it will enable the Senate leadership to work \n     with term limits supporters inside and outside the Senate to \n     achieve the maximum possible support for SJ Res 21.\n       Please let us know at your earliest possible convenience \n     your response to this letter so that those of us committed to \n     term limits can have the certain knowledge of exactly how and \n     when the Senate plans to proceed in considering this vitally \n     important issue. The American people are anxious for the \n     Senate to consider term limits when we can give it our full \n     attention. We believe that April, 1996 is the appropriate \n     time for a complete and fair Senate debate on term limits. We \n     urge your favorable consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n         James M. Inhofe, Spencer Abraham, Rick Santorum, Rod \n           Grams, Jon Kyl, Fred Thompson, Bill Frist, Craig \n           Thomas, and Mike DeWine.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               September 29, 1995.\n     Hon. Bob Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: The undersigned organizations have been \n     actively involved in the effort to pass the constitutional \n     amendment to limit the terms of members of Congress. We are \n     all deeply committed to term limits as a cornerstone of a \n     permanent restraint on the role of the federal government. We \n     believe that limiting the terms of members of Congress is an \n     important structural change that the American people support \n     overwhelmingly and we want to do all in our power to help \n     bring term limits to reality as part of our Constitution.\n       To that end, we are aware that you have promised to bring \n     the term limits constitutional amendment to the floor of the \n     U.S. Senate for a vote in the 104th Congress and for that we \n     are grateful. We believe it is significant that this Congress \n     will allow, for the first time in America's history, a \n     recorded vote on term limits in the House and the Senate. \n     While we appreciate your commitment to bring term limits to \n     the Senate floor this fall, we are asking that you postpone \n     consideration of the term limits amendment to April of next \n     year.\n       All of us are aware of the difficult and crowded \n     legislative calendar facing the United States Senate during \n     the weeks between now and the scheduled adjournment of the \n     first session of the 104th Congress. Term limits is an issue \n     that deserves a complete and open debate on the floor of the \n     United States Senate. We believe that the American people are \n     entitled to such a full and fair hearing on the issue of term \n     limits--and we believe that this fall is not a time when such \n     a debate can or will occur. Because of the budget, tax, \n     Medicare and other major fiscal issues facing the Senate, not \n     to mention the other issues remaining to be considered as \n     part of the \n\n[[Page S 15219]]\n     House Contract with America, we do not believe that term limits will be \n     able to be given its proper consideration by the Senate if \n     the vote is held this fall. We do not think there is adequate \n     time available to the members or the citizens to focus the \n     necessary national attention on term limits if it is wedged \n     among the issues now facing Congress.\n       It is further our belief that the most important \n     contribution you can make at this point in time toward \n     helping to maximize the Senate's support for term limits is \n     by granting to the supporters of term limits a specified time \n     on the Senate calendar for April, 1996 to schedule a vote on \n     term limits. If April is not acceptable, we would request \n     that you advise us now of another time certain in the spring \n     of next year when term limits will be rescheduled for a \n     Senate vote.\n       We believe that this is more appropriate timing that will \n     benefit the issue of term limits and the ability of the \n     American people to focus their attention--and that of their \n     Senators--on the importance of this vote.\n       We urgently request that you adopt this strategy and notify \n     us as soon as possible as to whether we can expect a Senate \n     vote in April of 1996, or exactly when such a vote would be \n     rescheduled. We look forward to the opportunity to work with \n     your leadership team to encourage passage of the \n     constitutional amendment for term limits next year.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n       Organizations Supporting Term Limits: Americans Back in \n     Charge, American Conservative Union, Christian Coalition, \n     Council for Government Reform, Seniors Coalition, and Council \n     for Citizens Against Government Waste.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote to table the Ashcroft amendment \nto H.R. 927, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act.\n  I have not yet decided how I will vote on an amendment to the \nConstitution proposing limits on the terms of office for Members of \nCongress when it comes before the Senate next year.\n  The Ashcroft amendment is not a constitutional amendment. It is a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution lacking the force of law. Its language \nis totally open-ended without restrictions and standards. Therefore, \nalthough I may support specific constitutional amendment language when \nit is offered, I cannot support and will vote to table the Ashcroft \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring your attention to \na single example of what I believe to be an all too common practice of \nour Government bullying small businesses with burdensome requirements.\n  My office recently received a letter from a small business in Georgia \ndescribing the mounds of reports required by the U.S. Bureau of the \nCensus. I believe this case serves as an excellent example of the kind \nof bully Government so many of us in the Senate have worked to control \nthrough regulation reform and paper work reduction. The most troubling \nmessage to me in this letter is that this small company does not \nperceive such Government burdens as atypical, just as a normal course \nof doing business in America.\n  How far are we going to stretch the limited resources of our small \nbusinesses? Let me list for you the reports this company, the Great \nAmerican Cookie Co., must submit to the Bureau of the Census or face \nFederal penalties: Report of Organization, Survey of Industrial \nResearch and Development, Survey of Business, Investment Plans Survey, \nCurrent Retail Sales and Inventory Report, Annual Trade Report, and \nAnnual Capital Expenditures Survey.\n  In addition, it also provides much of the same information to each of \nthe more than 40 States and in some cases municipalities in which it \noperates retail outlets. These State reports include summaries on \npayroll taxes, income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, worker's \ncompensation, property and liability insurance, annual reports and \nfranchise returns.\n  As you and my other colleagues know, we succeeded in getting a \nprovision included in the Paper Work Reduction Act to reduce the burden \nof firms who are forced to file quarterly reports by the Bureau of the \nCensus used to compile the ``Quarterly Financial Report for \nManufacturing, Mining, and Trade Corporations.'' While I am pleased \nthis is now law, I firmly believe we can do more to reduce the \nformidable burdens imposed by the Bureau of the Census, especially for \nsmall businesses.\n  By allowing this veritable gauntlet of requirements for doing \nbusiness in America to continue, I wonder at the kind of message we, \nthe Members of the U.S. Senate, are sending to small businesses.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the content of the letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              Great American Cookie Co., Inc.,\n\n                                  Atlanta, GA, September 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul Coverdell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coverdell: I am writing this letter to express \n     concern over reporting requirements of the Census Bureau upon \n     The Great American Cookie Company, Inc. (the Company). The \n     Company is currently responsible for the following reports: \n     Report of Organization, Survey of Industrial Research and \n     Development, Survey of Businesses, Investment Plans Survey, \n     Current Retail Sales and Inventory Report, Annual Trade \n     Report and Annual Capital Expenditures Survey. We understand \n     that, as a governmental agency, the information provided by \n     these reports is a valuable tool for monitoring certain types \n     of business activity. However, as a small business with \n     limited resources, these reporting requirements place an \n     undue burden on us. \n\n[[Page S 15220]]\n\n       The initial difficulty arises from the fact that we \n     currently have over 100 retail outlets located in over 40 \n     states. As a result, we are already providing a multitude of \n     information to each state (and in some instances, each \n     municipality). These reporting requirements include, but are \n     not limited to, payroll, income, property, sales and use \n     taxes, worker's compensation, property and liability \n     insurance, annual reports and franchise returns. Along with \n     these requirements come the inevitable compliance audits. \n     These reporting requirements, that are merely a cost of doing \n     business in each locality, considerably increase our \n     administrative costs.\n       Furthermore, over the past two years, our form of business \n     organization has changed. Late in 1993, our company became \n     subject to The Security and Exchange Commission's reporting \n     requirements as defined in The Securities Exchange Act of \n     1934. To satisfy these reporting requirements, we have had to \n     stretch our resources further.\n       As a company, we view our circumstances not as excuses, but \n     rather as evidence that governmental controls can sometimes \n     create more of a burden to certain businesses instead of a \n     benefit. Certainly, the letter of the law can require us to \n     continue to report the requested information or incur the \n     penalties. However, in keeping with the spirit of the law, we \n     respectfully submit this letter as a plea to be relieved of \n     our Census Bureau reporting requirements.\n       Thank you for your consideration in this matter.\n           Best regards,\n                                         W.

Mr. President, the skyrocketing Federal debt, now about \n$25 billion short of $5 trillion, has been fueled for a generation by \nbureaucratic hot air; it is sort of like the weather, everybody has \ntalked about it but almost nobody did much about it. That attitude \nbegan to change immediately after the elections in November 1994.\n  When the new 104th Congress convened this past January, the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives quickly approved a balanced budget amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution. On the Senate side, all but one of the 54 \nRepublican Senators supported the balanced budget amendment.\n  That was the good news. The bad news was that only 13 Democrat \nSenators supported it, and that killed the balanced budget amendment \nfor the time being. Since a two-thirds vote--67 Senators, if all \nSenators are present--is necessary to approve a constitutional \namendment, the proposed Senate amendment failed by one vote. There will \nbe another vote during the 104th Congress.\n  Here is today's bad debt boxscore:\n  As of the close of business Monday, October 16, the Federal debt--\ndown to the penny--stood at exactly $4,967,827,640,196.29 or $18,857.96 \nfor every man, woman, and child on a per capita basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15220-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15220-S15223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BIOTECHNOLOGY PROCESS PATENTS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this afternoon, the House gave final \napproval to S. 1111, a bill Senator Kennedy and I have authored to \nremove barriers to the patenting of biotechnology processes by \nestablishing a modified examination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark \nOffice [PTO] of those patent applications.\n  Passage of this legislation is a tremendous testament to the \nforesight and capabilities of our House colleague, Representative \nCarlos Moorhead, chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts \nand Intellectual Property. Chairman Moorhead drafted the original \nlegislation this session, H.R. 587, which was approved in committee on \nJune 7, 1995.\n  The bill now goes to the President for signature.\n  Mr. President, under the provisions of S. 1111, if a claimed \nbiotechnology process uses or produces a patentable composition of \nmatter, the process will be presumed nonobvious for the purpose of \nexamining the process. This modified examination will resolve delays \nand inconsistent determinations faced by biotechnology patentees under \npresent PTO practices, and thereby increase innovation and stimulate \nthe development of new products and processes.\n  For the edification of my colleagues, I want to take this historic \nopportunity to explain the purpose of the bill and the need for the \nlegislation.\n  Biotechnology: The Office of Technology Assessment defines \nbiotechnology as ``any technique that uses living organisms--or \nsubstances from those organisms--to make or modify products, to improve \nplants or animals, or to develop microorganisms for specific uses.''\n  Biotechnology, in the sense of genetic manipulation, has been \npracticed by man for many hundreds of years. It has been used \nsuccessfully by plant breeders in developing schemes for crossing \nplants to introduce and maintain desirable traits in various crops such \nas wheat or maize. Bakers and beverage producers have used yeast, a \nfungus, for leavening dough and for fermentation.\n  Today, the practice of biotechnology is far more powerful, with \npromising applications in diverse industries ranging from \npharmaceuticals, agriculture and nutrition to environmental cleanup, \nnew energy resources and law enforcement.\n  Some examples of widely known products made with the use of \nbiotechnology include insulin, human growth hormone, home pregnancy \ntests, tests for diagnosing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), vaccine \nagainst the Hepatitis B virus, and high-protein yielding corn.\n  The dramatic breakthroughs and future promises of biotechnology \nbecame possible in the 1950's when scientists James Watson and Francis \nCrick discovered the structure of DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid. \nIronically, neither scientist seemed aware that their discovery would \ngive birth to an entire new generation of technology. In a March 12, \n1953, letter to Max Delbruck, Watson wrote:\n\n       In the next day or so Crick and I shall send a note to \n     Nature proposing our structure (of DNA) as a possible model, \n     at the same time emphasizing its provisional nature and the \n     lack of proof in its favor. Even if wrong, I believe it to be \n     interesting since it provides a concrete example of a \n     structure composed of complementary chains. If, by chance, it \n     is right, then I suspect we may be making a slight dent into \n     the manner in which DNA can reproduce itself.\n\n  The discovery of DNA put more than a slight dent in our knowledge of \nbasic biology: it became the basis of a new, promising industry that \nhas led to significant breakthroughs in the ability to improve human \nlife.\n  DNA, known as the ultimate molecule of life, contains the codes that \ninstruct cells to grow, to differentiate into specialized structures, \nto duplicate, and to respond to environmental changes.\n  DNA guides the special functions of cells by directing the synthesis \nof proteins. A gene, which is comprised of a specific section of DNA, \ncontains the special instructions the cell needs to synthesize \nproteins. Proteins give living organisms their unique characteristics. \nSome proteins give the organism its structure; others mediate the many \nbiochemical reactions that occur within the body and are necessary for \norganisms to function.\n  The DNA code for certain genes is sometimes defective. The defect may \nhave been present at birth or later developed due to other factors such \nas infection, age, or exposure to ultraviolet light. When a defect \noccurs, the code for the synthesis of proteins is scrambled and causes \nthe cell to produce either a defective protein or no protein at all. If \nthe function of this defective protein is important, this can have \nserious consequences for the health of the organism. For human beings, \nthe deficiency in the protein may lead to tragic disabilities like \ncancer and arthritis, or even lead to death. For corn and other \nagricultural crops, the incorrect protein may lead to limited \nresistance to insects or extinguishment of the crop all together.\n  Once scientists determine which specific protein performs which \nfunction in an organism, they, with the aid of biotechnology, are able \nto effectively fight disease and other abnormalities. For example, when \nthe absence of a certain regulatory protein leads to cancer, it is \npossible to stop the growth of cancerous cells by replacing the \ndefective gene with a normal one that would produce the necessary \nprotein in the body.\n  It is also possible to reproduce the normal protein in another \norganism and then supply it in the human body. The technology enabling \nthis method is known as recombinant DNA technology. A well-known \nexample of such a method is the process used to produce insulin. \nInsulin is produced in mass quantities in microorganisms and then \n\n[[Page S 15221]]\ninjected into human beings to treat diabetes.\n  Proteins produced through recombinant DNA technology are used not \nonly to treat numerous diseases, such as cancer, allergies, blood \ndisorders, and infections, but also for more prosaic tasks, such as use \nin laundry detergents and food production. All of the tools that \ncurrently allow scientists to perform such marvels are the product of \ninnovative research utilizing biotechnology.\n  Given the complexities of developing such treatments, the underlying \nresearch is often expensive and takes many years before it yields \npractical results. The biotechnology industry estimates that the \naverage cost of discovery and bringing a single drug to market exceeds \n$230 million. It is also estimates that bringing a drug from initial \ndiscovery to final FDA approval takes an average of 12 years.\n  Certain incentives are necessary to encourage biotechnology \nresearchers to invest in the much needed, but often expensive, research \nendeavors. To date, the patent laws have been the source of such \nincentives. The biotechnology industry relies heavily on patent \nprotection in recouping the costs of bringing new drugs to the market. \nFurthermore, adequate patent protection is vital in persuading \ninvestors to provide the necessary capital to the industry.\n  The biotechnology industry has been one of the success stories in \nU.S. industry, creating new jobs and pioneering exciting breakthroughs \nthat improve our way of life. However, the biotechnology industry now \nfaces formidable challenges in continuing its ground-breaking research. \nJapan and Europe have invested heavily in biotech research and Japan \nhas targeted pharmaceutical development as an industry of vital \neconomic importance. In facing this competition, it is vital that the \nUnited States provide adequate and effective intellectual property \nprotection for the biotechnology industry.\n  General patent protection: A patent on an invention gives the patent \nholder the right to exclude others from making, using, or seling that \ninvention. Under 35 U.S.C., section 101, an inventor may obtain a \npatent on ``any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or \ncomposition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof . . \n.'' Once an invention is determined to be of the kind that may be \npatentable under section 101, it must also satisfy other requirements \nbefore a patent is granted on that particular invention. The two other \nmajor requirements are that the invention be ``novel'' and be \n``nonobvious.''\n  If a U.S. patent is granted on a particular product, the owner of the \npatent can prevent others from manufacturing, selling, or importing the \nproduct in the United States. However, because patents are national \nrights, the owner of the U.S. patent cannot prevent others from \nmanufacturing or selling the patented product in another country. In \norder to prevent others from exploiting his patented product in another \ncountry, the inventor must obtain a patent in that country.\n  A patent may be granted for a new method of using or a new method of \nmaking a product. Such patents are referred to as ``process patents.'' \nIt is not uncommon for an inventor to seek both product and process \npatent protection relating to the same invention. A process patent must \nmeet the same basic requirements for patentability as a product patent, \nthat is, that the claimed invention be new, useful, and nonobvious. The \nowner of a process patent may prevent the sale or manufacture of a \nproduct made using that process.\n  The courts have described the difference between a process patent and \na product patent as one relating to scope:\n\n       A product patent gives the patentee the right to restrict \n     the use and sale of the product regardless of how and by whom \n     it was manufactured. A process patentee's power extends only \n     to those products made by the patented process. A process \n     patent thus ``leaves the field open to ingenious men to \n     invent and to employ other processes. . . .'' A sale of a \n     product made by a patented process does not itself infringe \n     the patent; it is the unauthorized use of the process that \n     infringes the patent.\n\n  The Process Patent Amendments Act of 1988 provided additional \nprotection for process patent owners. Under this act, the process \npatent owner may not only prevent unauthorized domestic use of the \nprocess, but also the importation of foreign-manufactured products if a \nU.S. patented process was used in making the products. This amendment \nprovides protection to domestic U.S. process patent holders against \nforeign companies using the U.S. patented process overseas and \nimporting the resulting product into the United States without any \nrecourse by the process patent owner for infringement. Therefore, a \npatent on the final product, or at least a patent on the process for \nmaking that product, is necessary in order to effectively protect \ninnovators from the unfair competition of imported ``knock-offs'' of \ntheir creations.\n  Although a product patent is generally considered to provide better \nprotection for innovators than process patents, they are often not \navailable for products of biotechnology. Biotechnology products are \ndifficult to patent because they are usually the recombinant version of \na naturally occurring protein. In many cases, the naturally occurring \nversion of the protein has been identified and described in the \nliterature to some extent. Even if this protein has not been completely \ncharacterized, the patent application on the recombinant version of the \nprotein may be denied because, in the eyes of the PTO, it is not novel, \nor it is obvious in light of the previous disclosure. In patent law \nparlance, that product has already been discovered and does not warrant \na patent under the U.S. patent code.\n  A good example of this problem is human insulin. Human insulin was \ndiscovered in 1921 when scientists first extracted the protein from a \ndog's pancreas. In 1951, Frederick Sanger identified the chemical \nstructure of human insulin and won the Nobel Prize for this discovery. \nHe would not have been able to obtain a patent on insulin despite the \nfact that his discovery earned him the Nobel Prize. Then in 1979, David \nGoeddel synthesized human insulin using biotechnology methods, enabling \npatients to gain access to the product they needed to control their \ndiabetes. Even Goeddel would not have been able to receive a product \npatent on insulin.\n  The difficulties in obtaining patents on products of biotechnology, \ntherefore, make the availability of effective process patent protection \nvital in providing a reward for the achievements of biotechnology \npioneers. Moreover, adequate protection is necessary to encourage the \ncontinued investment in biotechnology research and development.\n  Biotechnology process patenting: The ability of the biotechnology \nindustry to obtain process patent protection has been undermined by the \nlack of clarity in the rules for the patentability of such process \npatents. Not only does the lack of adequate and effective process \npatent protection affect the industry's ability to fend off unfair \ncompetition of foreign-made products using U.S. patented starting \nproducts, but it also inhibits venture capital investment in \nbiotechnology research.\n  The uncertainty in the rules of process patent protection has been \nthe result of the Patent and Trademark Office's [PTO] inconsistent and \nerroneous application of In re Durden, and other related and \nconflicting decisions issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFederal Circuit [CAFC].\n  Although In re Durden did not involve a biotechnology invention, the \nprinciples espoused by the court in that case have had a significant \neffect on the patentability of biotechnology processes. In re Durden \ninvolved an appeal of the PTO's denial of a patent for a process to \nmake certain new chemical compounds. The process used was similar to \none already familiar to those in the industry, however, it used a novel \nand nonobvious starting material and produced a novel and nonobvious \nchemical product. As stated by the court, the issue in the case was \n``whether a chemical process, otherwise obvious, is patentable because \neither or both the specific starting material employed and the product \nobtained are novel and nonobvious.'' The court concluded that the \nprocess was not patentable. Given the particular facts of In re Durden, \nit held that a process using a new starting material to make a new \nproduct will not automatically be presumed nonobviousness for \npatentability purposes. It noted \n\n[[Page S 15222]]\nthat the patentability of each process claim must be evaluated on a \ncase-by-case basis.\n  Since the In re Durden decision, it has become increasingly difficult \nto obtain process patent protection in the United States for genetic \nengineering inventions. It is reported that the PTO frequently cites \nthis case in automatically rejecting applications for biotechnology \nprocesses.\n  The reasoning used in rejecting biotechnology process patent \napplications is as follows: The basic process of genetic engineering, \nrecombinant DNA technology, is known. It consists of inserting a DNA \nmolecule into a living cell so that the cellular machinery produces the \nspecific protein encoded by the inserted DNA molecule. Therefore, when \na new DNA molecule has been invented, it is assumed ``obvious'' that it \ncan be used in a recombinant DNA process to produce the protein it \nencodes. Since nonobviousness is a condition for patentability, the \nprocess for producing the protein is rejected by the PTO as obvious. \nUnder In re Durden, the process is rejected even if the starting \nmaterials used in the process in producing the final product are new \nand patentable.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit revisited the issue in \nthe subsequent case of In re Pleuddemann. As with In re Durden, this \ncase involved a challenge of the PTO's denial of a patent to a process. \nThe challenger had a patent on a starting material that he used in the \nprocess at issue to make a patentable final product. Except for the use \nof the patented starting material, the process for making the final \nproduct was already known in the industry. The court held that the \nprocess in this particular case was patentable. In its opinion, the \ncourt emphasized that In re Durden was not to be read as a ``per se'' \nrule against patenting old processes that use new starting materials or \nproduce new products.\n  The court distinguished In re Durden in this case on the ground that \nthe process at issue in In re Pleuddemann involved a process of \n``using'' rather than a process of ``making,'' which was the claimed \nprocess at issue in In re Durden. This distinction between the two \ntypes of processes was lost on many and has caused further confusion on \nthe status of the law on patenting processes. It is not clear why a \nmethod of ``using'' a starting material should be treated differently, \nfor purposes of determining nonobviousness, from a method of ``making'' \nthe end product.\n   Relying on In re Pleuddemann, some applicants have manipulated \nphrasing in crafting patent applications to explain processes in terms \nof ``using'' rather than ``making.'' However, the PTO continues to \nreject such claims citing In re Durden and arguing that such claims are \nreally a process of making claim in disguise\n  Although biotechnology innovators have difficulties obtaining patents \non products and processes of biotechnology, they can receive patents on \nnew starting materials they discover. However, unlike patents on \nproducts or the process by which those products are developed, U.S. \npatents on the starting materials fail to provide adequate protection \nfrom unfair foreign competition.\n  The U.S. patent on the starting materials--typically a new DNA \nmolecule, a genetically altered host cell or a vector--can prevent \nothers from using them in the United States in any way, including using \nthem to produce a final product. However, without process patent \nprotection, the patent owner of the starting materials cannot prevent \nanother from taking the patented materials to another country, use it \nto produce a product based on such material, and import the product \nback into this country for commercial sale.\n  Under the patent laws, there is no infringement of the patent on the \nstarting materials because there is no ``use'' of the materials in the \nUnited States. Without process patent protection, the inventor can not \nchallenge the unfair importation of the product and is forced to watch \nhelplessly as foreign copy-cats reap the harvest to which he, as a \npioneer, is entitled.\n  The uncertainty in the examination of biotechnology process patents \nunder current U.S. law has become a serious impediment to the \ndevelopment of new technologies in this industry. The confusion in the \ncase has led to inconsistent results by patent examiners. The \ninconsistent application of the case law, in turn, has led to severe \ndelays or denials of issuance of process patent protection to deserving \npatent applicants. The resolution of this problem will provide both \ncertainty for patent applications in this field and adequate protection \nagainst unfair foreign competition.\n  It is not clear if or when the CAFC will resolve the confusion in the \ncase law relating to process patents. Currently, there are two cases \npending in the CAFC relating to this issue. These two cases have been \npending before the CAFC for over 3 years, and there is no indication \nwhen the court might issue a decision on them. Even if the court issues \na decision on these cases, it is by no means certain that they will \nresolve the confusion caused by In re Durden and related cases. The \nPTO, in congressional hearings, testified that it does not believe it \ncan resolve the problem administratively because of the seemingly \nconflicting court opinions.\n  S. 1111 resolves the In re Durden problem in our patent law by \nproviding that a biotechnological process of making or using a product \nmay be considered nonobvious if the starting material or resulting \nproduct is patentable. This change will provide a degree of certainty \nto the protection of biotechnology inventions and will simplify the \nPTO's examination of biotechnology process patent applications. This \nbill will also allow U.S. researchers to enforce their patents claiming \na certain starting material against the unfair importation of products \nmade overseas using such material.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the Senate has gone on record in support \nof this change in the law many times, most recently in 1994 when we \napproved the Deconcini-Hatch legislation. I am proud that the Congress \nhas now given final approval to the bill, and I am hopeful the \nPresident will sign the measure as soon as it reaches his desk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of S. 1111 and a \nsection-by-section summary be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 1111\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Biotechnological Process Patents; Conditions For \n                Patentability; Nonobvious Subject Matter\n\n       Section 1 provides a mechanism for applicants to facilitate \n     the procurement of a patent for a biotechnological process \n     that makes or uses a novel and non-obvious biotechnology \n     product, overruling the decision in In re Durden, 763 F.2d \n     1406 (Fed. Cir. 1985). This section would amend section 103 \n     of title 35, United States Code, to ensure that a \n     biotechnological process would not be considered obvious, and \n     thus unpatentable, if it either makes or uses a composition \n     of matter that itself is novel and non-obvious.\n       The legislation has an impact on only one element of \n     patentability of biotechnological processes--the element of \n     non-obviousness. There is no guarantee of patentability even \n     if the process claim satisfies the non-obvious provisions of \n     the revised section 103. The process must still satisfy all \n     other requirements of patentability, including novelty and \n     utility among other requirements.\n       To qualify as non-obvious under this section, the claims to \n     the process and the composition of matter, to which the \n     process is linked, must be contained in either the same \n     application for patent or in separate applications having the \n     same effective filing date. Additionally, the composition of \n     matter and the process at the time it was invented, must be \n     owned by the same person or be subject to an obligation of \n     assignment to the same person.\n       Section 1 also allows an applicant to demonstrate the \n     independent patentability of a process under current law or \n     proceed under the non-obviousness rule established by this \n     section. Independent patentability may be demonstrated, for \n     example, by showing the non-obviousness of the process \n     through proof that the process demonstrates unpredictable \n     results.\n       Finally, this section provides five possible definitions of \n     the term ``biotechnological process.'' These definitions \n     limit the applicability of this section to biotechnological \n     process patents. The new definitions are broad enough to \n     include most genetic engineering technologies that are \n     currently being used by biotechnology researchers.\n       The first proffered definition explains a \n     ``biotechnological process'' as a process of inducing an \n     organism to express a characteristic not naturally associated \n     with it through the methods of genetic engineering or other \n     methods. Such a process may cause an organism to ``express an \n     exogenous nucleotide sequence.'' An example of such a method \n     is the process by which human insulin is produced in \n     commercial quantities. The DNA sequence for human insulin is \n     inserted into the bacteria E. coli so the bacteria begins \n     expressing, or producing, human insulin in its cellular \n     machinery.\n       This second definition of a ``biotechnological process'' \n     specifies that such a process could be altering an organism \n     to ``inhibit, eliminate, augment, or alter expression of an \n     endogenous nucleotide sequence.'' A popular example of a \n     product produced by such a process is the Flavr-Savr Tomato. \n     This process involves the alteration of tomatoes to eliminate \n     the inter-cellular production of an enzyme that causes the \n     tomato to rot. By eliminating the expression of this \n     ``rotting'' enzyme, the tomato is allowed to have a longer \n     shelf-life.\n       The third qualifying definition interprets \n     ``biotechnological process'' as altering an organism to \n     ``express a specific physiological characteristic not \n     naturally associated with said organism.'' The Hepatitis B \n     virus vaccine is produced utilizing such a process. The \n     ``antigen,'' or surface protein to which the human immune \n     system responds, for Hepatitis B is inserted into yeast to \n     yield commercial quantities of the protein. The expression of \n     the protein does not occur naturally in yeast but does so \n     because its genetic coding has been altered. The protein is \n     then removed from the yeast and injected into humans to \n     induce the body to safely and naturally produce an immune \n     reaction to fight the deadly virus, which causes liver damage \n     and cancer. The use of such a process to combat many human \n     and animal diseases, including AIDS.\n       The fourth qualifying definition comprises ``cell fusion \n     procedures.'' An example of such a process is the method used \n     for producing monoclonal antibodies, referred to by \n     scientists as ``hybridoma technology.'' This technology \n     involves fusing spleen cells that produce certain desired \n     antibodies to a specialized ``immortal'' cell--usually a \n     cancer cell--that no longer produces an antibody of its own. \n     The resulting fused cells, or ``hybridomas,'' grow \n     continuously and rapidly like a cancer cell, yet they produce \n     the desired antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are widely used \n     in targeting special cells to diagnose infections and cancer. \n     The possibility of their use in the direct treatment of \n     cancer and immune disorders is currently a major focus of \n     biomedical researchers.\n       Finally, the fifth definition of a qualifying \n     ``biotechnological process'' is described as any method of \n     using a final product that has been produced by a process \n     defined by any of the other four definitions provided or a \n     combination of the processes thereof.\n\n\n                   Section 2. Presumption Of Validity\n\n       This section provides that if a patent claim to a \n     composition of matter--either the starting material or the \n     final product--is held invalid because the Patent and \n     Trademark Office determines that it is non-obvious, the \n     patent process application that is dependent on that \n     composition of matter will no longer be entitled to rely on \n     that composition of matter for a presumption of non-\n     obviousness. In such a case, the inventor must show that such \n     a process is non-obvious without relying on this legislation.\n\n\n                       Section 3. Effective Date\n\n       The amendments made by this act are effective on the date \n     of enactment. The amendments will apply to all patents filed \n     on or after the date of enactment and all patent \n     applications, including applications for the reissuance of a \n     patent, pending on the date of enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15220-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:24 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate.\n\n       H.R. 2405.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise and \nextend the solid-organ procurement and transplantation programs, and \nthe bone marrow donor program, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n  the organ and bone marrow transplant program reauthorization act of \n                                  1995\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Kennedy, Senator \nFrist, and myself, I introduce legislation which will further improve \nthe quality and equity of solid organ and marrow transplantation.\n  We can all be proud of the solid foundation that private initiatives, \nsupported by Federal funding, have created. However, now that this \ninfrastructure is in place, I believe that it is time for Congress to \nreexamine the Federal role in the oversight and the financing of solid \norgan and bone marrow transplantation.\n  The partnership between the Government, the solid-organ transplant \ncommunity, and the public has worked well. However, the recent \nexperience with the heart transplant program in my own State of Kansas, \nor the public distrust voiced when Mickey Mantle received his liver \ntransplant, reminds us that improvements need to be made.\n  In 1994, more than 18,000 solid organ transplants were performed. \nYet, more than 41,000 other Americans still await an organ for \ntransplantation. This disparity between the supply and the demand for \norgans to transplant confirms that continued Federal oversight is \nnecessary to provide the public with a sense of fairness and trust. \nEven though Federal oversight is still required, we must consider \nalternatives to fund the vital functions of the organ transplant \nnetwork.\n  The legislation we are introducing today stresses equity for all \nbeneficiaries and proposes a balanced approach. Governmental oversight \nis maintained but clarified. The Organ Transplant Network remains \nresponsible for the development of transplant policies, and the program \nremains grounded in the expertise of the transplant community.\n  The importance of transplant candidates, patients, and their families \nas the real consumers of transplant services is reconfirmed, and this \nlegislation increases their voice in the process. In addition, the \nphase-in of a new ``data management fee'' will guarantee that future \ntransplant services will continue uninterrupted.\n  Mr. President, the shortage of organs for transplantation is a \nproblem which we, as a nation, have not yet solved. Recent medical \nstudies have shown a continued reluctance by the American public to \nconsent to organ donation when faced with the impending death of a \nfamily member. New and innovative approaches must be developed to \nincrease the public's acceptance of organ donation. This legislation \nauthorizes funding--obtained through a partnership among the \ngovernment, the Nation's transplant centers, and the organ procurement \norganizations--to address the continued shortage of organs for \ntransplantation. A single piece of legislation cannot be expected to \ncorrect the problem of insufficient organs for transplantation, but we \nbelieve that this proposal moves the transplant program in the right \ndirection.\n\n  Unrelated-donor bone marrow transplantation poses a different \nchallenge. The National Bone Marrow Donor Registry was developed to \nfacilitate and to maximize the number of bone marrow transplants for \npatients who do not have a matched relative. The success of this \nprogram to recruit potential marrow donors has been admirable, but as \nnoted in the recent past by the General Accounting Office, the number \nof resulting transplants has been quite modest.\n  Increasing the number of unrelated-donor bone marrow transplantations \nwill likely require more than just expanding the potential marrow donor \npool. Improvements in technology and scientific understanding of \ntransplantation will need to be made. Because of these biologic \nlimitations, I question continued Federal funding and the merits of a \ngovernment-funded national bone marrow registry.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, this legislation reauthorizes the National \nBone Marrow Donor Registry, it reconfirms the goal to increase \nunrelated-donor bone marrow transplants, and it provides advocacy \nservices for patients and donors. This legislation also requests the \nInstitute of Medicine to evaluate the future role of a government-\nfunded marrow transplant program as a means to maximize the number of \nunrelated-donor bone marrow transplants.\n  I recognize that the present Federal budget constraints and the \nproposed reevaluation of the Federal role in transplantation have \ncaused some concern. However, I believe this situation provides both \nthe transplant communities and the Congress with a unique opportunity. \nThis legislation is a carefully crafted plan for the future. It strives \nfor equity for all beneficiaries, an appropriate degree of Government \noversight, an evaluation of the future governmental role, an \nappropriate level of fiscal responsibility, and the development of a \nsystem to respond to the present and future transplantation needs.\n  As discussion of these issues develops, I would welcome any \nsuggestions my colleagues or others may have for improving this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1324\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nprovide an incentive for the reporting of inaccurate Medicare claims \nfor payment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     the medicare whistleblower act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today \nwith Senator Kyl that will significantly reduce fraud and abuse by \nproviders in the Medical Program. The Medicare Whistleblower Act of \n1995 will efficiently and effectively create an army of private \ninspectors general intent upon wiping out Medicare provider fraud.\n\n[[Page S 15233]]\n\n  At Medicare town meetings throughout Arizona, we have heard over and \nover from senior citizens that the Medicare Program is rampant with \nnegligent and fraudulent billings. They have told me, based on their \npersonal experiences, that their Medicare bills frequently include \nservices that they have not received, double billings for the same \nservice, or charges that are disproportionate to the value of services \nreceived. Often, they have no idea what Medicare is being billed for on \ntheir behalf, and they are not able to obtain explanations from \nproviders.\n  These perceptions of Medicare beneficiaries are confirmed by more \nsystematic analyses. The General Accounting Office has estimated that \nfraud and abuse in our Nation's health care system costs taxpayers as \nmuch as $100 billion each year. Medicare fraud alone costs about $17 \nbillion per year, which is 10 percent of the program's costs. A report \nby the Republican staff of the Senate Committee on Aging has documented \na broad array of fraudulent activities, including false claims for \nservices that were supposed to have been rendered after the \nbeneficiaries had died.\n  The Medicare Program has many problems. A fundamental problem, and \nthe source of many other problems, is that too few people are \nadequately concerned about its costs because the Government is paying \nmost of the bills. One constituent informed me of a situation in which \nhis provider double-billed for the same service and told him not to \nworry about it because ``Medicare is paying.'' This is an outrage and \nmust be stopped. When Medicare overpays, we all overpay, and costs to \nbeneficiaries and other taxpayers spiral.\n  The Medicare Whistleblower Act addresses this fundamental problem of \nthe Medicare Program. It gives beneficiaries an added incentive to \ncarefully scrutinize their bills and to actively pursue corrections \nwhen they believe that there has been inappropriate billing of \nMedicare. In particular, beneficiaries would be financially rewarded if \nthey uncover negligence or fraud to the benefit of us all. Although \nsuch provider fraud is not the entire problem, and there is other \nlegislation that I support which also addresses beneficiary fraud, \nstudies clearly indicate that provider fraud is most prevalent and the \ngreatest concern.\n  Under this bill, beneficiaries would have a right to receive in \nwriting from their providers, within 30 days of when their request is \nreceived, an itemized bill for Medicare services provided to them. The \nbeneficiary would then have 90 days to raise specific allegations of \ninappropriate billings to Medicare. The Medicare intermediaries and \ncarriers would then have to make one of the following determinations: \nThat the bill was: First, accurate; second, innocently inaccurate, for \nexample, misinterpretation; third, negligent; or fourth, fraudulent. \nAll overpayments resulting from inaccurate bills will be reimbursed to \nthe Medicare Program.\n\n  If the Secretary of HHS confirms that the billing was either \nnegligent or fraudulent, the beneficiary would receive a reward of 1 \npercent of the overpayment up to $10,000. Because these rewards would \nbe paid directly out of the overpayments, they would not increase costs \nto the Federal Government. In the case of fraud, the rewards would be \npaid directly by the fraudulent provider as a penalty, and would \ntherefore not even reduce the amount of the overpayment reimbursed to \nthe Federal Government. The Secretary would be required to establish \nappropriate procedures to ensure that the incentive system is not \nabused.\n  Some will argue that many seniors and other beneficiaries do not need \npersonal rewards for fighting fraud, and in any event, this is a matter \nof national duty. While I agree with this contention, I also recognize \nthat these individuals would not be able to identify and report fraud \nwithout having access to the itemized bills that this legislation \nprovides. Moreover, I see nothing wrong with giving beneficiaries an \nadded financial incentive. After all, we pay Federal employees for \nideas that save the taxpayers money, and we pay private citizens for \nidentifying fraud by defense contractors.\n  Mr. President, we must put an end to rampant Medicare fraud and \nabuse. This bill would contribute significantly to this goal. I believe \nthat there is no more effective approach to detecting and fighting \nfraud than giving individuals a personal financial interest in doing \nso. Just wait and see what will happen when we empower over 36 million \nMedicare beneficiaries to ensure that their program is no longer looted \nand abused. I request unanimous consent that this bill and letters of \nsupport from the Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare and \nthe Seniors Coalition be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1325\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the nearly six million \n     members and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve \n     Social Security and Medicare, I offer our endorsement of the \n     Medicare Whistleblower Act of 1995, legislation to strengthen \n     procedures for identifying fraud and waste in the Medicare \n     system.\n       A major effort to prevent fraud and abuse is essential and \n     appropriate--particularly at a time when Congress is \n     considering ways to reduce federal health care costs. It is \n     essential that we enlist the cooperation of the public, \n     beneficiaries, providers and carriers to curb fraud and waste \n     in the Medicare program and ensure that Medicare funds go \n     toward patient care. As you know, major and increasingly \n     complex patterns of fraud and abuse have infiltrated many \n     health sectors including ambulance and taxi services, \n     clinical laboratories, home health and durable medical \n     equipment providers.\n       Your legislation will strengthen the role of beneficiaries \n     in detecting and reporting fraud and waste. Of particular \n     importance are the provisions mandating that beneficiaries be \n     provided, upon request, copies of itemized bills submitted on \n     their behalf. Beneficiaries must have accurate information \n     about bills submitted on their behalf in order to \n     meaningfully participate in this program. It is also \n     important for the Secretary to establish standards to prevent \n     abuse or over-use of the reporting system.\n       Seniors thank you for your help in combating this growing \n     problem.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Martha A McSteen,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                        The Seniors Coalition,\n\n                                                 October 12, 1995.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the two million members \n     and supporters of The Seniors Coalition, I salute your \n     efforts to reduce the fraud and abuse which have plagued the \n     Medicare system. We also believe that seniors themselves are \n     excellent ``Inspectors General,'' and, when empowered to do \n     so will be a most effective whistleblower force.\n       The Seniors Coalition stands ready to work with you and \n     every other member of Congress in taking action to put an end \n     to rampant Medicare fraud and abuse.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jake Hansen,\n                    Vice President for Government Affairs.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1326. A bill respecting the relationship between workers' \ncompensation benefits and the benefits available under the Migrant and \nSeasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n the migrant and seasonal agricultural worker protection act amendment \n                              act of 1995\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that \nwould overturn a 1990 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Adams Fruit Co. \nversus Barrett and restore workers' compensation as the exclusive \nremedy for loss under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker \nProtection Act where a State workers' compensation law is applicable \nand coverage is provided.\n  This legislation embodies an agreement worked out by the National \nCouncil of Agricultural Employers and the Farmworkers Justice Fund and \nother farm worker advocacy groups. In the House this compromise will be \noffered as a substitute amendment to H.R. 1715, sponsored by \nCongressmen Goodling, Fazio and others.\n  By way of background, in 1985, 19 migrant farmworkers employed by the \nAdams Fruit Co. suffered injuries in an accident while they traveled to \nwork in an Adams Fruit van. The company was found liable and the \ninjured farmworkers were awarded damages to the fullest extent under \nFlorida's workers' compensation system. In addition, 10 of the workers \nfiled suit against Adams Fruit for motor safety violations under the \nMigrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act.\n  In the Adams Fruit decision, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the \ninjured farmworkers could bring an action for damages under the Migrant \nand Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act even though they were \ncovered under State workers' compensation for the same injuries. In so \nruling, the court disregarded one of the basic concepts of workers' \ncompensation, the assurance of a prompt remedy in exchange for limited \nliability on the part of the employer. As a result, agricultural \nemployers who pay the cost of workers' compensation for farmworkers are \nnot receiving the protection from lawsuits that all other employers \nproviding workers' compensation receive.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would reverse the effects of \nthe Adams Fruit decision and restore the exclusivity of workers' \ncompensation. Specifically, the bill:\n  Amends the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act to \nprovide that where workers' compensation coverage is provided under a \nState workers' compensation law for a migrant or seasonal agricultural \nworker, workers' compensation will be the farmworker's exclusive remedy \nand the employer's sole liability under the act for bodily injury or \ndeath;\n  Provides for increased statutory damages under the Migrant and \nSeasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act in cases where actual \ndamages are precluded because the worker's injury is covered under a \nState workers' compensation law and the court finds the defendant's \nactions meet certain criteria set forth in the legislation, such as the \ndefendant knowingly permitting a driver to drive farmworkers while \nunder the influence of alcohol;\n  Provides for tolling of the statute of limitations on actions brought \nunder the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act \nduring the period of time a claim under a State workers' compensation \nlaw is pending;\n  Requires disclosure of information regarding workers' compensation \ncoverage to migrant farmworkers and upon request to seasonal \nfarmworkers, \n\n[[Page S 15235]]\nhelping ensure that farmworkers have adequate information to file \ntimely claims for workers' compensation; and\n  Allows the Secretary of Labor to determine the appropriate level of \nliability insurance required by employers engaged in transporting \nfarmworkers, helping increase the ability of persons to obtain \ninsurance.\n  Mr. President, the appropriate relationship between workers' \ncompensation benefits and benefits available under the Migrant and \nSeasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act has been debated at great \nlength since the Adams Fruit decision. Many have tried to reconcile the \nlegitimate interests of both agricultural employers and farmworkers in \nthis issue. In the 102d Congress I sponsored legislation, and I worked \nvery hard, meeting with representatives of agriculture from around the \nNation, with representatives of farmworkers, with Congressman Fazio, \nwith Congressman Berman and others, in an effort to achieve consensus. \nI am pleased to say that there is now agreement. I hope the Senate will \nbe able to move quickly to approve this agreement and pass this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 1327. A bill to provide for the transfer of certain lands to the \nSalt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community and the city of Scottsdale, \nAZ, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\n\n         the saddleback mountain-arizona settlement act of 1995\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleague, Senator Kyl, in introducing legislation to approve an \nagreement to settle a longstanding dispute over 701 acres of unique and \nvaluable land within the city of Scottsdale, AZ, currently held by the \nResolution Trust Corporation [RTC]. The agreement, which was negotiated \nby representatives of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, \nthe city of Scottsdale, and the RTC, provides for the RTC to sell part \nof the property to the community and the remainder to the city.\n  The property is located in the eastern-most part of Scottsdale, abuts \n1.7 miles of the northern boundary of the community's reservation, and \nis undeveloped. Its most distinctive feature is Saddleback Mountain, a \nstriking landmark that rises abruptly from the desert floor to a height \nof some 900 feet. Due to its location, high conservation value and \nother special features, the property's use and disposition are of major \nimportance both to the community and the city.\n  A dispute arose after the RTC, in its capacity as receiver for the \nSun State Savings & Loan Association, acquired the Saddleback property \nin 1989 and subsequently noticed it for sale. The community submitted \nthe highest cash bid for the property, conditioned upon being allowed \nto develop the flat portion of the property. The city, concerned about \nthe direction that the development might follow, sued the RTC to \nacquire the property by eminent domain. The RTC then rejected all \nauction sale bids and determined to transfer the property to Scottsdale \nthrough the eminent domain litigation. The community thereupon sued the \ncity and the RTC, seeking damages.\n  Rather than pursue the litigation, the city, the community, and the \nRTC sought to resolve their dispute through negotiation. The result of \ntheir efforts is a settlement agreement that will allow all parties to \nrealize their respective goals for the Saddleback property. Under the \nagreement, the RTC will sell the property to Scottsdale and the \ncommunity for a total of $6.5 million. The city will pay $636,000 to \nacquire approximately 125 acres, located north and south of Shea \nBoulevard, for preservation and future road expansion. The community \nwill pay $5,864,000 to acquire 576 acres adjoining their reservation. \nThe two lawsuits, which are pending in U.S. District Court in Phoenix, \nwill be dismissed.\n  The agreement further provides that 365 acres of the property to be \nacquired by the community, including Saddleback Mountain, will be \nforever preserved in its natural State for use only as a public park \nand recreation area. Except for a limited number of sites that are of \nparticular historical and cultural significance to the community, the \npublic will have free access to this area. Together with the \npreservation property to be acquired by the city, it will be jointly \nmanaged by the city and the community. The remaining 211 acres to be \nacquired by the community will be subject to a detailed development \nagreement with the city, as well as the limitations and restrictions of \ncurrent community zoning.\n  Mr. President, the bill that Senator Kyl and I are introducing today \nhas two primary objectives. First, it will approve and ratify the \nsettlement agreement and ensure that its terms will be fully \nenforceable. Second, it provides that the property purchased by the \ncommunity will be held in trust by the United States and become part of \nits reservation. Enactment of this legislation is a necessary step for \nthe settlement's provisions to become effective.\n  Achievement of the Saddleback settlement agreement demonstrates once \nagain the value and benefit of seeking to settle disputes through \nnegotiation rather than litigation. The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian \nCommunity, its president and council, and the mayor and council of the \ncity of Scottsdale, along with their representatives and those of the \nResolution Trust Corporation who cooperated to make a settlement \npossible, deserve great credit for their leadership and hard work to \nresolve their differences amicably.\n  I believe the legislation to approve the Saddleback settlement \nagreement is noncontroversial and clearly in the public interest, and I \nnote with satisfaction that no expenditure of funds from the U.S. \nTreasury will be necessary for its implementation. Accordingly, I am \nhopeful that the Congress will consider and approve this legislation in \nan expeditious manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1327\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the commencement dates of certain temporary \nFederal judgeships; read the first time.\n\n\n           THE JUDICIAL IMPROVEMENT ACT AMENDMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I introduce a bill to amend the \ncommencement dates of certain temporary judgeships that were created \nunder section 203(c) of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, Public \nLaw 101-650, 104 Stat. 5101. The minor adjustment embodied in this bill \nshould improve the efficiency of the courts involved, and is not \nexpected to be controversial. I am pleased to have Senators Biden, \nGrassley, Heflin, Specter, Simon, DeWine, Feinstein, and Abraham as \noriginal cosponsors.\n  The Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 created the temporary \njudgeships by providing that a new district judge would be appointed to \neach of 13 specified districts, and by providing that the first vacancy \nin the office of a district judge in those districts occurring after \nDecember 1, 1995 would not be filled.\n  The districts are as follows: the northern district of Alabama, the \neastern district of California, the district of Hawaii, the central \ndistrict of Illinois, the southern district of Illinois, the district \nof Kansas, the western district of Michigan, the eastern district of \nMissouri, the district of Nebraska, the northern district of New York, \nthe northern district of Ohio, the eastern district of Pennsylvania, \nand the eastern district of Virginia.\n  In a given district, the new judgeship is temporary but the \nindividual judge appointed serves on a permanent basis in the same \nmanner as any other article III judge. The overlap in judgeships--\nbetween the appointment of a judge to a temporary judgeship and the \npoint at which a vacant permanent judgeship is left unfilled--is what \neffectively adds another judge to the district for a temporary period \nof time.\n  Due to delays in nomination and confirmation, however, many districts \nhave had only a relatively brief period of time in which to take \nadvantage of their temporary judgeship. In the district of Hawaii and \nthe southern district of Illinois, for example, new judges were not \nconfirmed until October 1994. Other districts have faced similar \ndelays. Those delays mean that many of the temporary judgeships will be \nunable to fulfill congressional intent to alleviate the backlog of \ncases in those districts. Many of the districts \n\n[[Page S 15237]]\nfaced a particularly heavy load of drug enforcement matters.\n  This bill changes the second part of the temporary judgeship calculus \nby providing that the first district judge vacancy occurring 5 years or \nmore after the confirmation date of the judge appointed to fill the \ntemporary judgeship would not be filled. In that way, each district \nwould benefit from an extra active judge for at least 5 years, \nregardless of how long the appointment process takes. This will help \nalleviate the extra burden faced in those districts. The only district \nexcluded from this treatment is the western district of Michigan. That \ndistrict requested to be excluded because its needs will be met under \nthe current scheme.\n  The Administrative Office of the United States Courts has requested \nthat the Senate pass this bill before December 1, 1995. After that \ndate, some vacant judgeships will be unable to be filled under current \nlaw. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I will do my part to \nexpedite this bill's passage.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOLE:\n  S. 1329. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \neducational assistance to veterans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n\n\n              the service persons readjustment act of 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Service \nPersons Readjustment Act of 1995. This legislation will provide our \nbrave service men and women with education benefits comparable to the \nbenefits previously earned by generations of veterans. This measure is \nlong overdue.\n  Fifty years ago, Congress and the American Legion worked diligently \nto pass the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, Better known as the \nGI bill of rights. That measure has been recognized as one of the \ngreatest pieces of legislation ever enacted. As a result of educating \nits veterans, the United States experienced the greatest economic boom \nin our Nation's history. The Nation transformed from an industrial \ngiant to a technological world leader. For the majority of veterans, \nincluding minorities and women, the dream of receiving a college \neducation became a reality.\n  When the original GI bill was introduced in Congress, many Members \nfeared that the cost of this program would bankrupt the country. \nColleges and universities nationwide argued that such a program would \nlower educational standards. President Roosevelt initially opposed the \nidea because of the projected cost. Now, as history demonstrates, the \ndollars invested in veterans' education have returned to the Government \n10 times. I ask my colleagues to demonstrate the same courage and \nresolve as the Members of Congress did in 1944, by making a financial \ninvestment in our Nation's future.\n  Unfortunately, the GI bill which once covered 100 percent of a \nveteran's education presently offsets educational costs by only 37 \npercent. Today, America's veterans are willing to work and invest more \nmoney than ever before for their educational benefits. Congress should \nprovide them with that opportunity. The current Montgomery GI bill does \nnot provide the flexibility to meet veterans needs. If a veteran wishes \nto attend a 1 year vocational school or a 4 year university, the \nprogram remains the same. The veteran who chooses a 1 year school will \nreceive a disproportionately smaller benefit package.\n\n  Under my proposed legislation, benefits can be shaped to meet the \neducational or training goals of veterans by allowing them to choose \nthe length of their benefit package.\n  An improved GI bill will create economic equality among many \nAmericans. Because individuals from the lower and middle classes \ncomprise the majority of the military, the bill will allow the less \nfortunate to earn their educations rather than depending on social \nhandouts. With the percentage of women and minorities in the military \ngrowing steadily, improved benefits will also help level the playing \nfield.\n  Presently, the GI bill is both a recruiting incentive and an \neducational opportunity. Current program values are simply inadequate \nto meet a veterans educational needs. Plenty of veterans sign up for \nthe program. Few actually ever receive benefits. Sadly, once ready to \nstart school, veterans quickly realize that their benefits pale in \ncomparison to their financial obligations. America's veterans, \nthoroughly understand responsibility and sacrifice. However, veterans \nshould not be forced to bear these burdens when other Government \neducational programs provide greater benefits to nonveterans with \nconsiderably less commitment.\n  The American Legion has repeatedly asked Congress to increase \neducation benefits for our brave men and women who have served \nhonorably. The legislation I am introducing will allow service members \nto invest more money. It will teach young men and women the value of \nworking hard and saving money to reach one's goals and dreams. \nEducational assistance for veterans consistently proves to be a winning \nconcept. Trained and educated individuals make more money, spend more \nmoney, and pay more taxes. Many of my colleagues are present today \nbecause of the GI bill. Their benefits were far more generous than \ntoday's educational package. I hope those Senators will support this \nmeasure. This new program, like the original GI bill, is a wise \ninvestment in America's future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1329\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The economy of Cuba has experienced a decline of \n     approximately 60 percent in the last 5 years as a result of--\n       (A) the reduction in subsidies from the former Soviet \n     Union;\n       (B) 36 years of Communist tyranny and economic \n     mismanagement by the Castro government;\n       (C) the precipitous decline in trade between Cuba and the \n     countries of the former Soviet bloc; and\n       (D) the policy of the Russian Government and the countries \n     of the former Soviet bloc to conduct economic relations with \n     Cuba predominantly on commercial terms.\n       (2) At the same time, the welfare and health of the Cuban \n     people have substantially deteriorated as a result of Cuba's \n     economic decline and the refusal of the Castro regime to \n     permit free and fair democratic elections in Cuba or to adopt \n     any economic or political reforms that would lead to \n     democracy, a market economy, or an economic recovery.\n       (3) The repression of the Cuban people, including a ban on \n     free and fair democratic elections and the continuing \n     violation of fundamental human rights, has isolated the Cuban \n     regime as the only nondemocratic government in the Western \n     Hemisphere.\n       (4) As long as no such economic or political reforms are \n     adopted by the Cuban government, the economic condition of \n     the country and the welfare of the Cuban people will not \n     improve in any significant way.\n       (5) Fidel Castro has defined democratic pluralism as \n     ``pluralistic garbage'' and has made clear that he has no \n     intention of permitting free and fair democratic elections in \n     Cuba or otherwise tolerating the democratization of Cuban \n     society.\n       (6) The Castro government, in an attempt to retain absolute \n     political power, continues to utilize, as it has from its \n     inception, torture in various forms (including psychiatric \n     abuse), execution, exile, confiscation, political \n     imprisonment, and other forms of terror and repression as \n     most recently demonstrated by the massacre of more than 40 \n     Cuban men, women, and children attempting to flee Cuba.\n       (7) The Castro government holds hostage in Cuba innocent \n     Cubans whose relatives have escaped the country.\n       (8) The Castro government has threatened international \n     peace and security by engaging in acts of armed subversion \n     and terrorism, such as the training and supplying of groups \n     dedicated to international violence.\n       (9) Over the past 36 years, the Cuban government has posed \n     a national security threat to the United States.\n       (10) The completion and any operation of a nuclear-powered \n     facility in Cuba, for energy generation or otherwise, poses \n     an unacceptable threat to the national security of the United \n     States.\n       (11) The unleashing on United States shores of thousands of \n     Cuban refugees fleeing Cuban oppression will be considered an \n     act of aggression.\n       (12) The Government of Cuba engages in illegal \n     international narcotics trade and harbors fugitives from \n     justice in the United States.\n       (13) The totalitarian nature of the Castro regime has \n     deprived the Cuban people of any peaceful means to improve \n     their condition and has led thousands of Cuban citizens to \n     risk or lose their lives in dangerous attempts to escape from \n     Cuba to freedom.\n       (14) Attempts to escape from Cuba and courageous acts of \n     defiance of the Castro regime by Cuban pro-democracy and \n     human rights groups have ensured the international \n     community's continued awareness of, and concern for, the \n     plight of Cuba.\n       (15) The Cuban people deserve to be assisted in a decisive \n     manner in order to end the tyranny that has oppressed them \n     for 36 years.\n       (16) Radio Marti and Television Marti have been effective \n     vehicles for providing the people of Cuba with news and \n     information and have helped to bolster the morale of the \n     Cubans living under tyranny.\n       (17) The consistent policy of the United States towards \n     Cuba since the beginning of the Castro regime, carried out by \n     both Democratic and Republican administrations, has sought to \n     keep faith with the people of Cuba, and has been effective in \n     isolating the totalitarian Castro regime.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to assist the Cuban people in regaining their freedom \n     and prosperity, as well as in joining the community of \n     democratic countries that are flourishing in the Western \n     Hemisphere;\n       (2) to strengthen international sanctions against the \n     Castro government;\n       (3) to provide for the continued national security of the \n     United States in the face of continuing threats from the \n     Castro government of terrorism, theft of property from United \n     States nationals, and the political manipulation of the \n     desire of Cubans to escape that results in mass migration to \n     the United States;\n       (4) to encourage the holding of free and fair democratic \n     elections in Cuba, conducted under the supervision of \n     internationally recognized observers;\n       (5) to provide for a policy framework for United States \n     support to the Cuban people in response to the formation of a \n     transition government or a democratically elected government \n     in Cuba; and\n       (6) to protect American nationals against confiscatory \n     takings and the wrongful trafficking in property confiscated \n     by the Castro regime.\n\n     SEC. 4.

STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the acts of the Castro government, including its \n     massive, systematic, and extraordinary violations of human \n     rights, are a threat to international peace;\n       (2) the President should advocate, and should instruct the \n     United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations \n     to propose and seek within the Security Council a \n     mandatory international embargo against the totalitarian \n     government of Cuba pursuant to similar to consultations \n     conducted by United States representatives with respect to \n     Haiti;\n       (3) any resumption of efforts by any independent state of \n     the former Soviet Union to make operational the nuclear \n     facility at Cienfuegos, Cuba, and the continuation of \n     intelligence activities from Cuba targeted at the United \n     States and its citizens will have a detrimental impact on \n     United States assistance to such state; and\n       (4) in view of the threat to the national security posed by \n     the operation of any nuclear facility, and the Castro \n     government's continuing blackmail to unleash another wave of \n     Cuban refugees fleeing from Castro's oppression, most of whom \n     find their way to United States shores further depleting \n     limited humanitarian and other resources of the United \n     States, the President should do all in his power to make it \n     clear to the Cuban government that--\n       (A) the completion and operation of any nuclear power \n     facility, or\n       (B) any further political manipulation of the desire of \n     Cubans to escape that results in mass migration to the United \n     States,\n     will be considered an act of aggression which will be met \n     with an appropriate response in order to maintain the \n     security of the national borders of the United States and the \n     health and safety of the American people.\n\n     SEC. 102.

as \nfollows:\n\n  TITLE III--PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS OF UNITED STATES NATIONALS \n           AGAINST CONFISCATORY TAKINGS BY THE CASTRO REGIME\n\n     SEC. 301. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Individuals enjoy a fundamental right to own and enjoy \n     property which is enshrined in the United States \n     Constitution.\n       (2) The wrongful confiscation or taking of property \n     belonging to United States nationals by the Cuban government, \n     and the subsequent exploitation of this property at the \n     expense of the rightful owner, undermines the comity of \n     nations, the free flow of commerce, and economic development.\n       (3) Since Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba in 1959--\n       (A) he has trampled on the fundamental rights of the Cuban \n     people, and\n       (B) through his personal despotism, he has confiscated the \n     property of--\n       (i) millions of his own citizens,\n       (ii) thousands of United States nationals, and\n       (iii) thousands more Cubans who claimed asylum in the \n     United States as refugees because of persecution and later \n     became naturalized citizens of the United States.\n       (4) It is in the interest of the Cuban people that the \n     government of Cuba respect equally the property rights of \n     Cuban and foreign nationals.\n       (5) The Cuban government is offering foreign investors the \n     opportunity to purchase an equity interest in, manage, or \n     enter into joint ventures with property and assets some of \n     which were confiscated from United States nationals.\n       (6) This ``trafficking'' in confiscated property provides \n     badly needed financial benefit, including hard currency, oil \n     and productive investment and expertise, to the current \n     government of Cuba and thus undermines the foreign policy of \n     the United States--\n       (A) to bring democratic institutions to Cuba through the \n     pressure of a general economic embargo at a time when the \n     Castro regime has proven to be vulnerable to international \n     economic pressure, and\n       (B) to protect the claims of United States nationals who \n     had property wrongfully confiscated by the Cuban government.\n       (7) The U.S. State Department has notified other \n     governments that the transfer of properties confiscated by \n     the Cuban government to third parties ``would complicate any \n     attempt to return them to their original owners''.\n       (8) The international judicial system, as currently \n     structured, lacks fully effective remedies for the wrongful \n     confiscation of property and for unjust enrichment from the \n     use of wrongfully confiscated property by governments and \n     private entities at the expense of the rightful owners of the \n     property.\n       (9) International law recognizes that a nation has the \n     ability to provide for rules of law with respect to ``conduct \n     outside its territory that has or is intended to have \n     substantial effect within its territory''.\n       (10) The United States Government has an obligation to its \n     citizens to provide protection against wrongful confiscations \n     by foreign nations and their citizens, including the \n     provision of private remedies.\n       (11) To deter trafficking in wrongfully confiscated \n     property, United States nationals who were the victims of \n     these confiscations should be endowed with a judicial remedy \n     in the courts of the United States that would deny \n     traffickers any profits from economically exploiting Castro's \n     wrongful seizures.\n\n     SEC. 302. LIABILITY FOR TRAFFICKING IN CONFISCATED PROPERTY \n                   CLAIMED BY UNITED STATES NATIONALS.\n\n       (a) Civil Remedy.--(1) Liability of Trafficking.--(A) \n     Except as otherwise provided in this section, any person or \n     entity, including any agency or instrumentality of a foreign \n     state in the conduct of a commercial activity, that after the \n     end of the 6-month period beginning on the date of enactment \n     of this Act traffics in property which was confiscated by the \n     Government of Cuba on or after January 1, 1959, shall be \n     liable to the United States national who owns the claim to \n     such property for money damages in an amount equal to the sum \n     of--\n       (i) the amount which is the greater of--\n       (I) the amount, if any, certified to the claimant by the \n     Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under the International \n     Claims Settlement Act of 1949, plus interest;\n       (II) the amount determined under section 303(a)(2), plus \n     interest; or\n       (III) the fair market value of that property, calculated as \n     being the then current value of the property, or the value of \n     the property when confiscated plus interest, whichever is \n     greater; and\n\n[[Page S 15256]]\n\n       (ii) reasonable court costs and attorneys' fees.\n       (B) Interest under subparagraph (A)(I) shall be at the rate \n     set forth in section 1961 of title 28, United States Code, \n     computed by the court from the date of confiscation of the \n     property involved to the date on which the action is brought \n     under this subsection.\n       (2) Presumption in Favor of the Certified Claims.--There \n     shall be a presumption that the amount for which a person or \n     entity, including any agency or instrumentality of a foreign \n     state in the conduct of a commercial activity, is liable \n     under clause (i) of paragraph (1)(A) is the amount that is \n     certified under subclause (I) of that clause. The presumption \n     shall be rebuttable by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     amount described in subclause (II) or (III) of that clause is \n     the appropriate amount of liability under that clause.\n       (3) Requirement for Prior Notice and Increased Liability \n     for Subsequent Additional Notice.--(A) Following the \n     conclusion of 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act but at least 30 days prior to instituting suit hereunder, \n     notice of intention to institute a suit pursuant to this \n     section must be served on each intended party or, in the case \n     of ongoing intention to add any party to ongoing litigation \n     hereunder, to each such additional party.\n       (B) Except as provided in this section, any person or \n     entity, including any agency or instrumentality of a foreign \n     state in the conduct of a commercial activity, that traffics \n     in confiscated property after having received--\n       (i) a subsequent additional notice of a claim to ownership \n     of the property by the United States national who owns the \n     claim to the confiscated property, and\n       (ii) notice of the

other claims shall be entitled to payment in full of its \n     claim from the assets in such pool prior to any payment from \n     the assets in such pool with respect to any claim not \n     certified by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission.\n       (f) Deposit of Excess Payments by Cuba Under Claim \n     Agreement.--Any amounts paid by Cuba under any agreement \n     entered into between the United States and Cuba settling \n     certified claims under title V of the International Claims \n     Settlement Act of 1949 that are in excess of the payments \n     made on such

section to bring an action for money damages with \n     respect to property confiscated by the Government of Cuba \n     before the date of enactment of this Act shall cease upon \n     transmittal to the Congress of a determination of the \n     President under section 203(c).\n       (2) The termination of rights under paragraph (1) shall not \n     affect suits commenced before the date of

been enacted.\n\n     SEC. 303.

Mr. President, there are defining moments in \nhistory, as there are in all our lives. World War II was one of those \ntimes. History stood still while men and women from nations around the \nworld struggled mightily to determine which direction the future would \ntake.\n  Fifty years ago, when that war ended, America embarked on a journey \ntoward freedom--not suppression; toward peace--not war; and toward \nprogress for all peoples--not ignorance, fear and darkness.\n  While we still are far from reaching the end of that journey, we know \nnow, as we did then, that our path would have been quite different had \nnot so many American men and women offered their country years of \npersonal sacrifice. More than 400,000 Americans gave their lives, and \ntheir simple, dignified graves here and around the world mark their \nheritage far better than words.\n  Among that number more than 6,000 Tennesseans died on foreign \nbattlefields during that great conflict. Yet today 150,000 Tennessee \nmen and women who served their country so well 50 years ago still are \nliving.\n  On October 11, 1995, the United States Congress held a rare joint \nSenate-House meeting in the chamber of the House of Representatives to \nhonor our World War II veterans, and those who served on the home \nfront. I was pleased to be able to invite a Tennessee war veteran to \nattend this ceremony, and was honored to welcome Brig. Gen. Enoch \nStephenson of Columbia, TN.\n  A combat pilot during the war, Stephenson flew 66 combat missions in \na P-51 Mustang for the 8th Air Force, including missions over Berlin, \nPoland, and Czechoslovakia.\n  Stephenson, then a lieutenant based in Great Britain, normally ``flew \nescort for heavy bombers--B-24s and B-17s--on their daylight raids,'' \nas he recounted. ``* * * As the Army started working its way across \nEurope, we continued to escort the bombers. But after they had \ncompleted their bomb run and were headed back to England, we'd leave \nthem and go look for targets of opportunity.''\n  After the war Stephenson returned to Tennessee and took a position \nwith the Third National Bank in Nashville. He also served in the \nTennessee National Guard until he retired 24 years later. He is \ncurrently chairman of the World War II Memorial Trust--an organization \nfocused on creating a World War II memorial on the Tennessee \nBicentennial walk planned for Nashville.\n  During his career Stephenson received the Legion of Merit, the \nDistinguished Flying Cross with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Air Medal with \nsix Oak Leaf Clusters and the European Battlefield Ribbon with four \nBattle Stars.\n  But Stephenson represented more than one man when he traveled to \nWashington for the special ceremony and recognition. Sitting with him \nin that congressional Chamber were all of Tennessee's World War II \nveterans, living and dead.\n  With him was Sgt. Charles H. Coolidge of Signal Mountain who served \nin the 36th Infantry Division in France. On October 24, 1944, \nCoolidge's company was under heavy enemy tank and machine gun fire \ndelivered at close range. Coolidge picked up a bazooka and moved to \nwithin 25 yards of the tanks. When the bazooka failed to function he \nthrew it aside, crawled even closer and armed only with hand grenades \ninflicted heavy casualties on the advancing enemy.\n  With him was Sgt. Vernon McGarity of Memphis who served in the 99th \nInfantry Division. On December 16, 1944, near Krinkelt, Belgium, \nMcGarity was wounded in an artillery barrage. After being treated at an \naid station, he refused evacuation and returned to the men of his \nsquad. Then, in the thick of battle and under heavy fire, he separately \nrescued two wounded American soldiers, immobilized the lead tank of the \nenemy with a rocket launcher, and ran through concerted enemy fire to \nrecover ammunition critical to his unit's ability to continue the \nfight. When his squad was pinned down by a German machine gun, McGarity \nleft cover, charged the machine gun, and single-handedly killed or \nwounded all the enemy gunners.\n  Also with Stephenson in that stately congressional Chamber was 1st \nLt. Hugh B. Mott of Nashville who served in the 9th Armored Engineer \nBattalion in Germany. On March 7, 1945, Mott arrived with his unit at \nRemagen Bridge which crossed the Rhine River. Although the bridge was \nprotected by enemy demolition charges and intense sniper, machine gun \nand 20 mm fire, Mott ran along the entire length of the bridge cutting \nthe wires leading to the demolitions. By doing this he prevented the \nimmediate destruction of the bridge and enabled U.S. forces to \nestablish a bridge head on the east bank of the Rhine River.\n  Following the war Mott joined the Tennessee National Guard, from \nwhich he retired as a major general. He served in the State \nLegislature, and for several years was the chief of police in \nNashville.\n  Mott was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, among other honors. \n\n\n[[Page S 15259]]\nBoth Coolidge and McGarity were recipients of the Nation's highest \nbattlefield award, the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  It is sometimes hard to believe that a half-century has passed since \nheros like Enoch Stephenson, Charles Coolidge, Vernon McGarity, Hugh \nMott--and so many others--left their homes and families to travel into \nhell.\n  Time, however, will never diminish their sacrifices and service to \nour Nation. For, quite simply, their legacy is nothing less than the \nfreedom we enjoy today. And that is the most important legacy anyone \ncan leave.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15258-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nIN HONOR OF SISTER HENRIETTA HEBERT, SISTER WINIFRED LEDOUX, AND SISTER \n           STEPHEN LELEUX, SISTERS OF THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I recognize three Sisters of \nthe Most Holy Sacrament who have dedicated their lives to making the \nlives of others more rewarding both spiritually and through education.\n  Sister Henrietta Hebert, Sister Winifred LeDoux, and Sister Stephen \nLeleux have ministered primarily as educators to young women and men in \nmy hometown of Crowley, in Acadia Parish where Crowley is located, and \nin south Louisiana.\n  On October 14, these Sisters celebrated with family and friends a \nmass of thanksgiving in Crowley. They celebrated and gave thanks with \ndeep spiritual humility for one reason, that they have been able to \nserve others for so many years.\n  Sister Henrietta and Sister Winifred celebrated their Diamond \nJubilee. Sister Stephen celebrated her Golden Jubilee.\n  As young women, these Sisters vowed solemnly to live a life of \nservice to others. For many years they have fulfilled those vows \nfaithfully as educators, both academic and spiritual. Today, they \ncontinue to serve through their deeply spiritual lives, through their \nprayers, through their example.\n  Their selflessness and humility stem from the deep faith which their \nfamilies nurtured in them. That deep faith enabled them, as young \nwomen, to make personal and prayerful choices to serve others as \nSisters of the Most Holy Sacrament.\n  Their dedicated service has blessed and benefited so many south \nLouisiana students through the academic subjects they taught and the \nspiritual values they instilled. In turn, the community has been \nblessed and has benefited as well.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that through their roles as dedicated \nSisters, they actually have lead the community as well as served it. \nTheir commitment, their values, and their spirituality have been models \nof leadership and service, especially for the many young women and men \nthey have educated.\n  Though they have been community leaders, in their profound humility \nthey would see themselves as only as servants. Though they have given \nso much to the community, in their profound humility they would never \nseek or expect anything except to continue their service.\n  Being from Crowley, I am one of those who was so fortunate to have \nbeen taught by Sister Henrietta. On this occasion I express gratitude \nwith all those who have learned from her, from Sister Winifred and from \nSister Stephen for all that they have taught and instilled in us.\n  For Sister Henrietta, Sister Winifred, and Sister Stephen my personal \nprayers, therefore, are for many more years of peace and joy in their \nservice to others as Sisters of the Most Holy Sacrament. Our Nation and \nour State are truly better off for their service to so many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15259-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WORLD POPULATION AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, next week, October 22, 1995, \nthrough October 28, 1995, has been declared as World Population \nAwareness Week. Over a decade ago, the United Nations estimated that by \nthe end of this century there would be 65 countries unable to either \ngrow sufficient food to enable their inhabitants to meet minimum \nnutrition levels or purchase beyond their borders sufficient food to \nreach these standards.\n  Recently, the World Food Program reported that there are already 88 \nlow-income, food-deficit countries. With a full 4 years remaining in \nthis century, the dire prediction made back in the mid-1980's already \nhas exceeded by 23 countries.\n  Although a complete solution to the world hunger problem involves \naction on many, many fronts, I believe that part of the solution is to \nreduce global population growth. I do this with special pride over my \nown family's historic role in raising public awareness of population \nissues and their effect on the world's human condition and stability.\n  Last year the International Conference on Population and Development \nwas held in Cairo to create a strategy for voluntarily reducing world \npopulation. The implementation of that strategy is the theme of World \nPopulation Awareness Week. I am proud to join Gov. Gaston Caperton of \nWest Virginia and my fellow West Virginians in observing this week as a \ntime to express the importance of addressing population trends. I ask \nthat the text of the West Virginia Proclamation be printed in the \nRecord designating October 22-28 as World Population Week.\n  The text follows:\n\n                  Proclamation by Gov. Gaston Caperton\n\n       Whereas, the developing world is plagued by alarmingly high \n     rates of maternal and infant mortality, environmental \n     degradation, malnutrition and unemployment; and,\n       Whereas, without a reduction of population growth rates, \n     the world's population will be subject to unprecedented \n     economic and social hardship, hunger and political strife; \n     and,\n       Whereas, world population is currently 5.7 billion and \n     increasing by nearly 100 million per year, with virtually all \n     of the growth added to the poorest countries and regions--\n     those that can least afford to accommodate their current \n     populations, much less massive infusions of human numbers; \n     and,\n       Whereas, the annual increment to world population is \n     projected to exceed 86 million through the year 2015, with \n     three billion people--the equivalent of the entire world \n     population as recently as 1960--reaching their reproductive \n     years within the next generation; and,\n       Whereas, the environmental and economic impacts of this \n     level of growth will almost certainly prevent inhabitants of \n     poorer countries from improving their quality of life, and, \n     at the same time, have deleterious repercussions for the \n     standard of living in more affluent regions; and,\n       Whereas, environmental and economic problems caused by \n     overpopulation will affect all nations of the world, \n     including the United States;\n       Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved that I, Gaston Caperton, \n     Governor of the State of West Virginia, do hereby proclaim \n     October 22, 1995 through October 28, 1995 as: ``World \n     Population Awareness Week'' in West Virginia and encourage \n     all citizens to understand the importance of educating \n     ourselves in order to help curb these trends and help \n     eliminate poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, social \n     disintegration and gender discrimination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15259-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15259-S15260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WORLD POPULATION AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, every year the United States sends \nbillions of dollars overseas for foreign aid and military operations \ntrying to bring peace and prosperity to troubled regions around the \nworld. Our help often comes too late and seldom alleviates the root of \nthe dilemma.\n  Overcrowding and rapid population growth exacerbates many causes of \nconflict around the world, like ethnic tensions, economic disparity, \nand struggle over scarce resources. The population of our planet has \nballooned rapidly from 2 billion in 1935 to almost 6 billion today, and \nwill reach 8 billion by 2025. Ninety percent of this growth will occur \nin the most troubled regions of the Third World, increasing their \nalready difficult tasks of peace and economic development.\n  Stable population growth could help these regions achieve their goals \nby improving economic conditions, lessening the stress on scarce \nresources, raising the quality of life, and facilitating economic \ndevelopment. Increasing the awareness of population growth focuses the \nefforts of our Government, and governments around the world, on finding \nsolutions to this problem.\n  To focus attention on population expansion, the State of Wisconsin \nhas declared October 22-28 World Population Awareness Week. I hope \nWisconsin's effort to increase sensitivity on this issue will be joined \nby other State and local governments. World Population Awareness Week \nis the first step toward stable population growth and a \n\n[[Page S 15260]]\nbetter and more peaceful life for everyone on the planet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/17/senate-section/article/S15259-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BILL READ FOR THE FIRST TIME--S. 1328\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
