Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of H.R. 3756, the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. I \nunderstand there are two pending amendments, and I hope we may dispose \nof those amendments in short order and continue to make progress on the \nbill.\n  It is my intention to complete action on the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill this evening. That will certainly take \ncooperation--it always does--across the aisles. We need to help the \nmanagers by coming on over and offering amendments. Amendments are, in \nfact, needed so that we can be able to complete action at a reasonable \nhour tonight so we can then go tomorrow to the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n  If we do not get the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill \ncompleted this evening, then I am going to have to weigh exactly what \nwe do with regard to the Chemical Weapons Convention. We made a \ncommitment to do that. I intend to do that, but in order to do that, we \nare going to have to get this bill done. We are going to have to have \nsome cooperation with that.\n  In accordance with the consent agreement reached on June 28, I do \nanticipate beginning the consideration of Executive Calendar No. 12, \nwhich is the Chemical Weapons Convention. We hope to be able to \ncomplete that in 1 day, instead of going all day tomorrow and going \nover until Friday. Again, with cooperation of the Members, we would \nlike to see if we can complete that tomorrow, because we do have a \nJewish holiday on Friday. We will not have any votes after 12 o'clock \nfor sure, but if we could complete work on the CWC by tomorrow night, \nthen Members will have more time to get to their homes to celebrate \nthis special date for our Jewish Members.\n  We will probably have a 1-hour closed session at the end of the \ndebate on the Chemical Weapons Convention, because it appears that some \nof the information Senators really need to have will not be \ndeclassified. If it is not declassified by noon tomorrow, we will give \nMembers, I believe 4 hours notice is required under the rules. We will \nconvene in the Old Senate Chamber, and then we will go to votes right \nafter that.\n  Again, I urge all Senators to come to the floor if they have \namendments. The smart thing to do would be to not offer a lot more \namendments. Let's just go ahead and pass the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill and be done with it. Would that be all right with \nthe chairman?\n  Mr. SHELBY. That will be fine.\n  Mr. LOTT. So go to third reading as soon as you can.\n  Mr. SHELBY. In 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/11/senate-section/article/S10245-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10245-S10279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TREASURY, POSTAL SERVICE, AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5223\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe that the amendment which I \noffered yesterday is the pending business before the Senate. Is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The pending question \nis the Dorgan amendment No. 5223.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is kind of an upside-down world out \nthere. You look at the news from day to day. A few weeks ago we all \nlistened to the news and discovered that, if you were roughly 7 feet \ntall and had basketball skills, you could sign a contract for $100 \nmillion. One 7-foot-2-inch athlete signed a contract for $115 million \nto play basketball for 7 years. That would employ, by the way, about \n4,000 elementary school teachers for a year, that $115 million; but in \nour economy it is one very good basketball player. Sounds a little \nconfusing to me that that represents the value system, but that is the \nsystem.\n  This morning in the paper there is an article that says credit card \ncompanies are going to end the free ride. They are going to start \ncharging a fee for those who pay off their credit card bills. Isn't \nthat interesting? They are going to charge a fee for those who pay \ntheir credit card bills off in full every month. Why? Because if you \nare paying off your credit card bill and settling your balance, they \nare not making money off you. So the result is they will charge a fee \nfor that. Sound kind of like a screwball idea? It does to me.\n  Or how about this screwball idea. Have a provision in America's Tax \nCode that says to a corporation, we will give you a special little \ndeal. We know that you are here in America. We know that you built a \nplant here. You hired a bunch of workers. You have made a product here \nfor 30 years. You make profits here. But we will give you a special \nlittle deal. If you will simply shut your American plant down, fire all \nthose workers, get rid of all that in America, and move the whole \nsystem to a foreign tax haven, open a new factory overseas, hire new \nforeign workers, make exactly the same product you were making in \nAmerica, and then ship the product from that foreign tax haven country \ninto America and make your profit that way, we will give you a deal. We \nwill give you a tax break if you will do that. Close your American \nplant, produce overseas instead, and we will give you a tax break. \nSound like a screwball idea? It is current tax law.\n  I have an amendment that is pending before the Senate that will lose \ntoday. We voted on this before, 52-47. I lost a year ago. We are going \nto vote again today, and no doubt I will lose again today. Why? Because \nanyone standing in this Chamber feels comfortable going home telling \ntheir folks who sent them here that it was ``my priority to decide to \nkeep a tax provision that says let's reward people who move American \njobs overseas''? No. That is not why. There is not one person who can \nfind one good reason to have this in current tax law. Not one.\n  I do not stand here asking for 10 reasons why this ought to be \nrepealed. I would like to find one sober American who can explain to me \none reason why this ought to be kept in American tax law. At the very \nleast our tax law ought to be export-neutral with respect to jobs.\n  Mr. KERREY. I wonder if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator and I, I guess a month ago, discussed a long \narticle that was in the New York Times, in the business section of the \nNew York Times, describing a U.S. corporation, actually a multinational \ncorporation, described by the operator, with $9 billion for the revenue \ntotal as reported in the paper, and $2 billion for net income as \nreported by the paper. And the tax rate was down to 3 or 4 percent.\n  One particular transaction that was under examination was shipping \nall the income to the Dutch Antilles so they would not have to pay any \ncapital gains tax. When the CEO of the company, the owner of the \ncompany, was asked the question, ``Well, don't you feel bad about not \npaying any taxes in the United States of America?'' his answer was, \n``That's what multinational corporations are for.''\n  Is that the sort of thing that the Senator believes that the U.S. \ntaxpayers, basically the taxpayers of the United States are \nsubsidizing, because they are paying the taxes? If somebody does not \npay tax--if I forgive you all of your taxes and say, ``Senator Dorgan, \nyou don't have to pay any taxes at all, somebody else is going to pick \nup the tax for it, somebody else is going to be subsidizing your \nreduction in tax''--in this case, what you are describing is a \nsituation where not only am I subsidizing the fact that you are not \npaying any taxes, not only am I paying more and you are paying less, \nbut I am paying more and you are paying less and you are moving \noperations abroad.\n  Mr. DORGAN. What I have not mentioned in discussion, because it is \nslightly different but probably an even more important discussion, is \nthat 73 percent of foreign corporations doing business in America pay \nzero in Federal income taxes to this country--not a little, or not \nmuch, they pay zero. Mr. President, 73 percent of foreign corporations \ndoing business in America--and those names everyone would understand \nand recognize instantly; they are the names on the products people are \nbuying in this country--they do hundreds of billions of dollars of \nbusiness in this country every year, and 73 percent of them pay zero in \ntaxes to our country.\n\n  A slightly different issue but in the same general family of tax \nproblems, in addition to the strainer through which all of this flows \nand through which these corporations can come in, earn billions of \ndollars and pay zero taxes in our country, in addition to that, we \nactually have a provision in this Tax Code that says, by the way, if \nyou are an American company and you are having to compete against a \nforeign corporation coming into our country--what is the solution? Move \nyour jobs, leave our country, produce in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, \nMalaysia, Singapore, produce elsewhere. Hire foreign workers. Not only \ncan you get a tax break, you can get lower wages over there. You can \nhire somebody for 14 cents an hour, a quarter an hour, 50 cents an \nhour, $1 an hour. You do not have to worry about pumping effluents into \nthe air, dumping chemicals into the water. You can hire kids and work \nthem 14 hours a day. Move your jobs and go overseas, our Tax Code says \nto companies, and then ship the product back here and compete with \nsomeone who stayed here.\n  I represent a State not unlike the Senator from Nebraska. North \nDakota is slightly smaller in population. I toured a little \nmanufacturing facility recently with 55 workers. They are wonderful \nworkers who love their jobs. It is a great little company, struggling \nand not making a lot of money, but making it in a small community in\n\n[[Page S10247]]\n\nNorth Dakota. They do not have the opportunity to decide, ``I think we \nwill move our production, we will move our manufacturing to \nSingapore.'' They do not have that opportunity. They do not have that \nluxury. They are just working every day, doing the best they can, \ntrying to make a profit.\n  Assume that some other company makes the same products that compete \nwith this little company. One of them was an arrowhead on arrows used \nin archery that are sold in stores around this country, little steel \narrowheads for hunting and target practice. Assume another company \nmakes that same product to compete with this little North Dakota \ncompany and they decide, ``I think we will make them overseas.'' Our \nTax Code says, ``Well, good for you, good decision.'' In fact, we will \nreward you for making that decision. Any money you make, any income you \nmake, as long as you do not repatriate it, keep it over there, invest \nit over there, you never have to pay American income taxes. Our Tax \nCode says, ``Yes, jump on the bandwagon. Move jobs overseas.''\n  The fact is, our manufacturing job base is diminished. It used to be \n24 percent in 1979. Now it is down close to a 15 percent manufacturing \njob base.\n  The Senator from South Carolina said yesterday, and I agree with him, \nno country will long remain a strong world economic power unless it \nretains a strong manufacturing base. The Senator from South Carolina \nwent far afield yesterday talking about a wide range of trade issues. \nThere is nothing wrong with that because that is also part of the \nglobal discussion. But this is a very simple, modest amendment. We are \nnot talking rocket science here. I am not talking about global \nstrategies, the global economy, or international trade. I am talking \nabout a simple proposition: Should this country, under any condition, \ndecide that in its Tax Code it should subsidize moving U.S. jobs \noverseas? If this Congress cannot stand up and take the first small \nbaby step in deciding that we should no longer subsidize moving jobs \noverseas, then Lord help a legislative body that cannot make that \nfundamental, small decision on behalf of a country.\n\n  The Senator from South Carolina, in discussing trade yesterday, \ntalked about protectionist, and ``protectionist'' has a very specific \nmeeting for a lot of people debating the global economy. Should anyone \nin this Chamber, at least when it comes to this issue, this simple \nlittle tax provision that now rewards those who move American jobs \noverseas, should anyone in this Chamber deny they are interested in \nprotecting America's jobs, deny their interest in standing up for this \ncountry's manufacturing base? No, I am not suggesting putting up \nbarriers, but I am suggesting deciding we will put an end to an \ninsidious, perverse tax provision that rewards those who do the wrong \nthings moving American jobs overseas.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KERREY. The opponents are not up here to engage in a discussion.\n  One of the arguments I have heard against the Senator's amendment is \nthat it is effectively a tariff. I wonder if the Senator could pretend \nI am an opponent of the amendment and talk to the American people a bit \nabout this issue of whether or not the change in Tax Code that you are \nproposing would result in a tariff?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is an absolutely absurd contention. It makes no \nsense at all for someone to say, ``Well, this is a tariff.'' This has \nnothing to do with tariffs, nothing to do with international trade.\n  I would love to offer, incidentally, some amendments on trade, but I \nshall not. This has to do, simply, with a tax subsidy that now tilts \nthe playing field and says to a company, ``If you move those jobs from \nAkron, from Toledo, from Bismarck, from Lincoln, to some tax-haven \ncompany, we will reward you.'' How much is the reward? Well, I come \nfrom a town, as I said yesterday, of 300 people, a high school class of \nnine, a wonderful community in southwestern North Dakota. The reward \nhere is not giant in the context of our Federal budget. It is $2.2 \nbillion in 7 years.\n  Now, that may not sound like much to people here who would chair a \nBudget Committee, for example. Go to my hometown and talk about $2.2 \nbillion that the Federal Government asks other Americans to pay \neffectively as a subsidy to companies who would move their jobs \noverseas, and then see what kind of reaction you get from people who \nthink with a bit of common sense.\n  Now, how does this perversity occur in the Tax Code? This is called \ndeferral, a fairly common concept in tax law. It has been there a long \nwhile. There also are many antideferral provisions in the Tax Code. In \nfact, the Senate voted a couple of decades ago to eliminate all \ndeferral altogether. Deferral means a U.S. company does business \noverseas, makes profits and, therefore, does not have to pay tax on \ntheir profits because they can defer it indefinitely--in fact, until \nand unless they bring the money back to the United States.\n  The Senate at one point voted to eliminate all deferral. The House of \nRepresentatives, when I served in the House, voted to eliminate a \nnarrow portion of deferral, which is exactly what I am proposing we do. \nEliminate deferral when a company moves their jobs to tax havens \noverseas, produces a product with those jobs and ships the products \nback into our country to compete against other companies whose jobs and \nproduction are here.\n\n  Again, this is not rocket science. I am not proposing something that \nis hard to understand. I expect in the next couple of hours I will \nlose. I expect those who are now concerned about this and who do not \nwant to debate it apparently on the floor of the Senate are \nstrategizing how they will offer something that prevents an up-or-down \nvote on this. They will either offer to table it, or they will offer \nsome other device, and they will try to ricochet the vote because the \nlast thing in the world they want to do is deal with this.\n  We have organizations in this town formed and financed by the largest \ncorporations in America and the world whose job it is to protect this \ntax subsidy--2.2 billion dollars' worth. So you have all kinds of \nlobbyists across this town who have done an enormous amount of work \nhere in the Senate to make sure that this will not pass. That is the \nway the system works.\n  However, in my judgment, it is not much of a system that allows us to \never make an excuse for a Tax Code that on behalf of the American \npeople says our interest is served by paying those who diminish \nAmerica's economic strength, who move America's economic production \nabroad.\n  Let me make a couple of other brief points. I do not propose to \nobject if a U.S. corporation decides that it is going to compete in \nJapan or Korea or Europe, and in order to do that, because Japan is \nlocating its production facilities in Thailand or Indonesia, the U.S. \ncorporation says, ``Well, I will open up a plant in Indonesia to \nproduce products to be sold in Korea.'' I would prefer they not do \nthat. I prefer they put those jobs in North Dakota, as a matter of \nfact, or in Colorado. But if they decide they have to have offshore \nproduction to compete with others with offshore production, fine, I am \nnot interrupting that. My amendment says, however, if you are going to \ncreate offshore production facilities to create products to ship back \ninto America to compete against American firms, then you are going to \nobey the same tax laws. You can't defer anything. If you make a profit, \nyou pay taxes on the profit. You made the profit by making a product \nand selling it in the American marketplace. So you pay the same tax \nthat the American producer pays, who stayed here and produced here. \nThat is all my amendment says. It is very narrow.\n\n  Now, the second point I want to make is this: Some say--and they will \nsay it with gusto, if only they will come out and debate this \namendment--and I fully understand why they don't want to debate this \namendment--but they would say, ``You don't understand; we are dealing \nwith a global economy. You don't have the foggiest understanding of \nwhat on Earth is going on in this world. If you did, you would not \noffer this nonsense and you would not talk the way you do about the \ntrade deficit.''\n  Well, the global economy has changed. Our economy in the United \nStates has changed our economic circumstances. That is certainly true. \nWe for 75 years fought in this country about some fundamental issues--\nminimum wage, safe workplaces, pollution,\n\n[[Page S10248]]\n\nenvironmental standards, issues with respect to child labor--and we \ncame to some conclusions on all of them. Then some economic \nenterprises--the largest in the world, in fact--found a way to pole \nvault over all of those issues and say: You don't understand. Those \nfights did not mean anything. We can hire kids--oh, not in America, but \nwe can hire kids and we can go to other countries and hire 14-year-\nolds, and we can work them 14 hours a day and pay them 14 cents an \nhour, and they can make whatever they make, and we can ship that back \nto the United States, and we can sell it in supermarkets and in the \ndiscount stores. We can do that in the name of profit because it is \npart of the global economy.\n  Well, that might be the way they have described the global economy, \nbut it is not fair competition. Free trade ought to mean fair trade. \nThis is not fair competition. Those who describe the global economy as \nworking in that way are describing a system that is now being discussed \nin the Philadelphia Inquirer. I think they are doing 10 or so segments \nthat are wonderful segments on this entire issue. The one in Monday's \nnewspaper deals with exporting jobs again. It describes a couple--Lynn \nand Ed Tevis--who worked for a company for 20 years and were discarded \nlike a wrench that was used up. Human capital now is like a wrench or a \nhammer or a pair of pliers. When they are done with it, they throw it \naway. They are told: We are sorry. You worked for us 20 years. This job \nis now in Singapore, or this job is now in Bangladesh. Your job with us \nis over.\n  That is what is happening in this country.\n  My suggestion is not that we decide that we are not part of the \nglobal economy. We are. My suggestion is that we decide, as a country, \nwhat the rules are for access to our marketplace. Is there a rule about \naccessing America's marketplace with labor from 14-year-olds who are \npaid 14 cents an hour? Is there or isn't there? If there is, let's \nstart enforcing it. Should there be a rule that at least the American \ntaxpayers should be assured that the Tax Code is not subsidizing the \nmovement overseas of American jobs? Should there be that assurance made \nto the American taxpayer? The only way we will give them that assurance \nis to step up now and vote.\n\n  The desk I sit at in the U.S. Senate was a desk that was occupied at \none point by a man named La Follette from Wisconsin, Senator La \nFollette. For those that don't know the tradition of the Senate, the \ntradition has always been to carve your name inside the desk drawer of \nthe Senate desk. It has been a longstanding tradition in the Senate. If \nyou pull out the desk drawer, the bottom drawer--the only drawer in the \ndesk--you will find a list of names of Senators who sat in that desk.\n  I was told a story by Senator Byrd, who is the preeminent historian \nof the U.S. Senate, about Senator La Follette. He was once speaking \nfrom this desk many, many decades ago, I believe he said, in a \nfilibuster. He ordered down for a turkey sandwich and a glass of \neggnog. Senator Byrd, as he told the story, said that the eggnog was \ndelivered at this desk to Senator La Follette, and he was trying to \ntake a sip of eggnog as he was speaking. He took a mouth full of this \neggnog and spit it out and hollered, ``It's poison, it's poison.'' Some \ndays later, back then, they got the analysis of the eggnog and \ndiscovered, indeed, there had been poison put in that poor Senator's \neggnog. So I have not had an urge to filibuster from this desk since \nthe recitation of that wonderful story about another occupant of this \ndesk, Senator La Follette. I did not ever hear the conclusion of that \nstory, whether they found out who laced the eggnog. But I am not \nordering eggnog today, and I am not intending to filibuster. I do \nexpect that there are a whole lot of folks in this town--hired by \nenterprises that will benefit from this $2.2 billion--who think this is \nreal poison. Oh, they think this is awful. God forbid that we should \npass something like this amendment. What an awful thing to do. Senator \nDorgan just doesn't understand.\n  Well, the point is, I do understand. What we are doing is \nfundamentally wrong. What we are doing weakens this country. What we \nare doing in our Tax Code says to multinational corporations that you \ncan make a choice about where to put your jobs, and you can put them \nelsewhere, move them out of America, because jobs are not the issue. \nWell, jobs are the issue. Good jobs that pay well and provide real \nsecurity for American workers are the issue. American workers are not \ntools. They are part of a group of people who help make these companies \nthe great companies they are.\n  I am going to finish with one short story. Just after Christmas this \npast year, I was on an airplane, Northwest Airlines, traveling from \nNorth Dakota back to Washington, DC. I read a story in the Minneapolis \nStar Tribune that brought tears to my eyes. It was a story about a \nbusinessman and his wife. I believe his name was Mr. Nagle. He was a \nfellow who started a company in the early 1980's and was incredibly \nsuccessful, made an enormous amount of money. It was a very simple \nidea. The company's name is Rollerblade, which many Americans will \nrecognize. He began, as I recall, in a circumstance where hockey \nplayers wanted something to practice skating on when it wasn't \nwintertime up in our part of the country, Minnesota and North Dakota. \nSo there was invented something that was the early version of what we \nnow know as ``Rollerblades.'' The Rollerblade company, I believe, was \nprobably the pioneering company. This fellow ran the company and he \nturned this tiny little company into something extraordinary. It grew \nand blossomed and prospered and made enormous profits. What a wonderful \nsuccess story for this fellow and his workers and his corporation. Then \nhe sold Rollerblade Corp. He and his wife moved to Florida. I was on \nthe plane that morning after the Christmas season, and I read the story \nabout what this fellow had done. Just before Christmas, this company, \nthat had some nearly 300 employees in the company out in the \nmanufacturing plants making rollerblades and in the production, \ncontrol, finance, and various places, these employees began to receive \nChristmas greetings from this fellow and his wife, who used to own \ntheir company but who had sold it a couple of months previous. As these \nemployees opened up their Christmas greetings at home, they discovered \na Christmas card and a check from this man and his wife.\n  The check equaled a certain amount of money multiplied times the \nmonths that each of those employees had worked for that company. Some \nchecks were as much as $20,000 to the people out on the manufacturing \nline.\n  But there is more. This fellow not only sent them a check, but he \ntold them that he had prepaid the taxes on the checks. So this was \ntheirs. The taxes were paid, and he was sending this money to them \nbecause he ran a very successful company, sold it, made an enormous \namount of money. And he said, ``I know that part of the reason, a major \nreason, this company succeeded was because you people worked for it. \nYou people that made those rollerblades, those skates out on the \nmanufacturing line, made this company what it was. I made a lot of \nmoney as a result, and I want to share some of that with you now that I \nhave left this company.''\n  Out of the blue, a check for $20,000 with the tax prepaid. I got back \nto Washington, DC, after I read that story. I called him down in \nFlorida. I said, ``You know, at a time when so many in American \nbusiness believe that workers have no value, they are just wrenches and \ntools and things that you either hire or throw away at will, it is so \nnice to see someone who once again believes that part of what made that \ncompany successful were the men and women who worked for that \ncompany.''\n  It was such a wonderful story. That ought not to be the exception. \nOne would hope that would be the rule in our country. But this man is \nsuch an exceptional man. Everyone else does it differently. Everyone \nelse now says people do not matter; they are expendable; get rid of \nthem. For the jobs in Kansas City, ``If you can put more money in \nBangladesh, move it to Bangladesh. It does not matter.''\n  Here is a picture of two people. And I have lots and lots of pictures \nthat I will not show today. Lynn and Ed Tevis moved 1,200 miles for a \ncompany they had worked 12 to 14 years for already. They downsized and \nmoved 1,200 miles. Two years later they downsized again,\n\n[[Page S10249]]\n\nand said, ``You are done. It is all over; nothing more.'' It is just \nhuman capital that is expendable.\n  My point is this: I do not believe the U.S. Senate can make decisions \nabout jobs for international businesses and for U.S. corporations. But \nI believe that this Senate can make decisions about whether our Tax \nCode rewards those people who do the wrong things about jobs. I do \nbelieve our Tax Code could stand on the side of American businesses who \nstay here and have jobs here and compete here. When we find that our \nTax Code says to others, ``Go away, ship your products back, and we \nwill give you a competitive advantage over the people who stayed \nhere,'' I believe that our Tax Code can be changed to decide that is \nunfair, and that we will not allow that to happen anymore.\n  I offered this yesterday. The Senator from South Carolina spoke. I \nassume that we will have someone come and procedurally offer a motion \nto try to avoid the debate on this. I would love to have the debate. I \nwould love to find one person who will give me one reason that we ought \nto reward anyone with tax breaks that move jobs overseas; just one. I \nam not asking for a dozen. I am not asking for the impossible. One \nperson give me one reason; just come, stand, and give me one reason. \nThe last time we had someone come and say, ``Well, we will hold \nhearings on this. This is not the place. This is not the time. This is \nnot the way.'' They will come today again. They will say, ``This is not \nthe place. This is not the time. This is not the way to hold \nhearings.''\n  I have heard all of that before. Just give me one reason that this \ncountry ought to have a Tax Code that says we encourage moving American \njobs abroad. If anyone can do that, alert me that you are coming so we \ncan spend a little time visiting about it, and I would love to have the \nAmerican people hear the other side of this debate.\n  I have spoken twice now at some length. The American people have not \nhad the advantage of having someone else come, and stand up and say, \n``Count me in. My name is X, Y, and Z, and I believe we ought to have \nin our Tax Code an incentive to move jobs overseas.'' Is there anyone \nwho will do that? Anyone?\n  Well, I doubt it. But it is now in current law, and we must take it \nout at some point. A lot of folks don't want it taken out. Those are \nthe folks who will benefit by the $2.2 billion. That is the way the \npolitical system works. But if we keep prodding, agitating, one of \nthese days we are going to get this Congress to do the right thing.\n  I tried to break the cement in the driveway one day, and it reminded \nme that it is a lot like legislating. If you take a 16-pound mallet and \ntry to break cement in a driveway, you wind up hitting the driveway as \nhard as you can with this giant mallet, and nothing happens. You hit it \nagain, and nothing happens. You hit it again, and nothing happens. \nAbout the 15th time you hit this big slab of cement, the whole darned \nthing collapses.\n  That is the way legislative activity is as well. You don't always get \nit the first time. You don't always see a discernible result. But one \nof these days we will change this provision in the tax law. It is not \nthe biggest issue in the world. But it is something that ought to be \nchanged, and something this Congress ought to remedy. This will not be \nthe end of the debate.\n  But I appreciate the indulgence of the Presiding Officer, and I \nappreciate also the patience of the Senator from South Carolina.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me try to answer why there will not \nbe one come and join the debate. It is easily understood. It is the \nresult, of course, of our affirmative action policy after World War II \nof trying to rebuild the industrialized nations. It spread capitalism \nin Europe, and out into the Pacific rim. And our affirmative action \npolicy called for various things to induce American investment \noverseas. We put in, as you can find in the early morning news now on \nthe front of the business page, the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation, subject to assault because it is no longer needed. It was \nneeded at that time. Industry had to be ensured against expropriation \nand the loss of their investment overseas.\n  So we passed the Overseas Private Investment Corporation [OPIC]. Then \nwe found that we could subsidize, give inducements by way of actual \nsubsidy for export overseas, with the Export-Import Bank. And we put in \nvarious tax deferrals.\n  The reason the distinguished Senator from North Dakota in our \namendment is not going to win, as he says, today as you can only look \nat the Republican screen at Channel 2. And it says new taxes. Once it \nis labeled as new taxes, that crowd will run in the other direction \nbecause we live in this symbolic poster world of true-false, up-down, \n``I am for the families, and against taxes; I am for jobs, and against \ncrime.'' And that is all you get out of them--is symbolic nonsense. So \nthey will not really get to the guts of the issue.\n\n  It is not a new tax. It just says those who are paying taxes for \nproduction here should be on an equal footing and not penalized with \nAmerican investment and corporations overseas for producing overseas. \nWe are trying to cut out that deferral.\n  As a result of our affirmative action policy and spreading capitalism \nafter World War II--I am not debunking it, or regretting it. It has \nworked. The Marshall plan is one of the great success stories of all \nhistory by way of people taxing themselves. They think. They didn't \nhave pollsters running around loose in the late 1940's to get these \nchildren to come to the U.S. Senate--true-false. Just look at the \npolls. I will go back home, and, ``I am against taxes.'' In fact, only \n17 percent of the people in one poll taken at that time, Gallop, said \nat that particular time--that only 17 percent favored the Marshall \nplan. But we had division as they all talked to. Everybody wants to use \nthe buzzwords, and they come on with their little 20-second sound bite, \nand said, ``we have the vision.'' There is not any vision in any of \nthis stuff going on about gay marriages and everything else. They are \nnot national problems whatever. When you get to a real national \nproblem, as it is about the economic security--and I emphasize \n``economic security''--you can find the Senators want it.\n  I would amend the idea of just jobs because jobs appeals to the \npolls. You are for jobs, or against jobs. And it makes it just a little \npolitical nuance of a campaign. The truth is the security of the United \nStates of America is an issue here with respect to this particular \namendment. The passage of the amendment is not going to ensure the \nsecurity. It is going to begin as a wake-up call, and a trend backward.\n  I have described that the success of the United States, the strengths \nthat we have as a nation, the security that we have as a nation, rests, \nas it were, on the three-legged stool: The one leg, the values of a \nnation. That leg is strong, and unchallenged. We sacrificed to feed the \nhungry in Somalia.\n  We sacrificed to build democracy in Haiti. We sacrificed to build \npeace in Bosnia. Everyone the world around as we travel knows the great \ncontributions and sacrifices made by American taxpayers for its values.\n  The second leg is that, Mr. President, of course, of our military \nstrength. That is unquestioned.\n  But that third leg, that economic leg, without which we cannot foster \nvalues or protect ourselves militarily--and I emphasize in World War II \nwe won on account of Rosie the Riveter; our industrial might \noverwhelmed Hitler; there is not any question about that--has become \nsomewhat fractured and enfeebled, if you might, as a result of the \naffirmative action.\n  Now, what was the affirmative action? As I said, not only the \nsubsidies, the insurance, the deferrals, but get out of here, just \nscatter, let us get industry, get American investment abroad and spread \ncapitalism. As I say, it has not only been successful but it has become \nunfairly competitive.\n  When I say unfairly competitive, I mean that the other competitors in \nthe Pacific rim do not practice free trade. Oh, they use the rhetoric \nof free trade, but I can tell you here and now, try to get into some of \nthe markets. Our textile industry tried to get into Korea. They have \ngot to get a vote of the Korean textile folks before they can come into \nKorea. Try to get into Japan. Oh, they talk a little here about \nMotorola is doing a little bit; Intel will come in a little bit. But \nreally in trying to open\n\n[[Page S10250]]\n\nup the markets, we have had a dismal record over some 50 years trying \nto get into the country that we saved that does not practice free \ntrade. Come on. Everybody knows that.\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. What happens is that now we are confronted--and that is \nwhy you do not find them in the Chamber--with the opposition. You might \ncall them the enemy here, the fifth column in this economic war. Let us \nstart and list the soldiers in that particular opposition or enemy, \nthat fifth column.\n  The soldiers in that fifth column begin, of course, with the State \nDepartment. The State Department had an affirmative action of \nsacrificing the industrial might for friends. Fortunately, Secretary \nChristopher has changed that. Secretary Brown changed that to some \nextent. And we are beginning to change that. But that is the way it \nstarted. That was the best of diplomacy: ``Oh, don't worry; we are fat, \nrich and happy back in America.'' We have seen it over the 30 years I \nhave served in the Senate.\n  We started with these corporations that we induced overseas as \nnationals that became multinationals. They found out that they could \nproduce more economically, make a profit for their stockholders, and as \na natural development the nationals became multinationals.\n  And the banks--Chase Manhattan, First Citicorp, all the big banks as \nof 1973--I remember back in the 1970's we found out that our large \nAmerican banks were making the majority of their profits outside of the \nUnited States, so they were not really American banks. They were \nmultinationals or had their, let us say, loyalty and nationalism, \nprofitwise at least, outside of the United States, certainly not in the \nUnited States of America.\n  So you have the State Department; you have the multinationals; you \nhave the banks, and then, of course, with that money they developed the \nconsultants and academia. All the consultants are not paid by those who \nare coming along talking about jobs and the economic security. You go \nto any of these conferences, these particular institutes all over this \ncity are just rampant with these consultants who are talking, ``Free \ntrade, free trade, free trade,'' shouting, ``Smoot-Hawley, Smoot-\nHawley. We are going to end the world and go into a global \ndepression.''\n\n  And otherwise academia. I do not have that booklet with me. There was \na very sharp economist, Miss Jacobsen, who put out the booklet here \nsome 10 years ago showing how academia had been taken over by the \nforeign entities and the multinationals. You go up east to the Ivy \nLeague and find out their investments up there to bring about the \nthought and get a free ride into dumping their goods back here in the \nUnited States and they will not allow us into their markets.\n  So you have academia; you have consultants; you have the \nmultinationals; you have the multinational banks and, of course, the \nState Department. Then when we debated back when I first came here--I \nwill never forget it--and we passed the textile bill--it did not get \npast the House but we passed one here in the late 1960's, early \n1970's--at that particular time we found out the real opposition that \ngears up the votes in this Chamber. And that is the retailers. In order \nto bring it to the attention of our colleagues, we went down into the \nstores here in Washington, DC, and we got a shirt that was manufactured \nin Taiwan--well, a ladies blouse, I remember correctly, one made in \nTaiwan for $32 and the one made in New Jersey was also $32. We found a \ncatching glove made in Korea at $42 and one made in Michigan at $42.\n  We went down the list. We piled the desk up to show that the \nretailers were not by way of global competition reducing the price. \nThey were making a bigger profit. So the retailers are really geared up \nand they call their stores around and everything else of that kind and \nthey intimate to us as politicians, U.S. Senators, and they come in and \nzoom in on us and we have to be for ``free trade, free trade. Let's \ndon't Smoot-Hawley, start a worldwide depression.''\n  So you have then the retailers. Then, of course, you have the \nWashington lawyers, and none other than now the Reform Party Vice-\nPresidential nominee, Dr. Pat Choate. In his book ``The Agents of \nInfluence,'' he took one country, the country of Japan, and listed out \nhow they had over 100 Washington firms, lawyers, consultants, paid over \n$113 million to represent the people of Japan here in the Capitol, \nwhere the 100 Senators, the 435 congressmen, the cumulative salaries of \nthe 535 is $73.1 million. By way of pay, the people of Japan are better \nrepresented here in Washington, DC, than the people of the United \nStates of America. You have a powerful force.\n  Chair the Commerce Committee, which I have for years and am now the \nranking member, and get these trade measures and others to come up, and \nthey zoom in immediately with the Washington lawyers, and I mean \npowerful ones, Mr. President. They are no more powerful than the \nSpecial Trade Representative. Heavens above. We saw my good friend, Bob \nStrauss, we saw my good friend Bill Brock, all representing the \nforeigners after they had been the Special Trade Representative. It was \nlike Colin Powell going over to represent Saddam. And what did we have \nto do? Put a rider in the bill of the Special Trade Representative; \nthey could not do that after 5 years. It caught Mickey Kantor--he was \nthe first one--now Secretary Kantor, the Secretary of Commerce, when he \nwas Special Ambassador Kantor, but we had to finally put it in there to \nstop that. But we had the best of the best trained, the best of the \nbest friends and influence, ambassadorial rank, coming around, and \nafter you are talking ``free trade, free trade, Smoot-Hawley.''\n  I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BROWN. I notice the Senator is the No. 2 sponsor on the bill. \nPerhaps he might respond to a few questions that I have with regard to \nit?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. BROWN. I notice, reading through the amendment, it gives a \nspecial exemption for oil. Everybody is subject to this special tax \nexcept the oil companies. Why was the decision made? What is the \nreasoning for giving the special treatment to oil?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The principal author could respond more accurately, but \nI am convinced we did that to try to get votes. I hope agriculture----\n  Mr. BROWN. That is without precedent.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes. Agriculture, that crowd there, I will never forget \nwhen I went out campaigning in the Presidential race, ``Dutch'' \nReagan's special station in Des Moines, IA, you get on there at 5 \no'clock for questions. They said no Democrat would appear. So, you \nknow, if it was for free--I did not have any money--I got on there, and \nthey said, ``Senator, you come from a textile State and you want all \nthis protectionism and subsidies and everything else. How do you expect \nto get a vote out here in agricultural Iowa?''\n  I said, wait a minute, let me correct the record. No. 1, I happen to \nbe for subsidies. I happen to be for the quotas and the protectionism \nfor agricultural quotas. We have wonderful farm folks, growing \nsoybeans, wheat, corn, everything else in South Carolina. But let me \nget the record clear. We do not ask for a subsidy for textiles. We do \nnot ask for Export-Import Bank financing. We do not ask for tax \ndeferrals. When I get to that Nebraska corn, when I get to Colorado and \nthese agricultural States, that is the crowd that runs around \nhollering, ``Free trade, free trade, keep subsidizing me, keep \nfinancing me, keep deferring me.'' Because why? Our friend Wayne Andrus \nhas all the news on Sunday. He has ``Meet the Press,'' he has ``This \nWeek With David Brinkley,'' he has even the public television and \neverything else. All he talks is, ``exports, exports, exports,'' and we \ncome in here like monkeys on a string hollering, ``exports, exports, \nexports.'' I mean, we have a regular drumbeat.\n  I would ask the Senator from North Dakota who drafted our amendment, \nI am sure oil is a matter of national security, and we put in special \nprovisions, as we well know, for oil.\n  Mr. BROWN. The other question I had--there were several others, as I \nwent through it. I notice the distinguished Senator from North Dakota \nsaid, ``We encourage moving jobs abroad, and we ought to take that \nlanguage out of the code.''\n  I have looked through the amendment. I do not find ``striking'' \nlanguage, other than striking the end of the period and adding \nadditional language. Is there a section of the code\n\n[[Page S10251]]\n\nwhere we ``encourage moving jobs abroad?''\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The tax deferral itself, obviously. Oh, yes, that \nencourages it.\n  Mr. BROWN. What section is that?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The cost and everything. IBM moved all their research \noverseas. We are losing not only our jobs in manufacturing, we are \nlosing our research centers and everything else of that kind.\n  Mr. BROWN. The Senator talked about repealing something out of the \nlaw, yet there is nothing repealed in the amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Modifying the deferral itself.\n  Mr. BROWN. The deferral?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Tax, income made from production overseas. There is a \ntax deferral for that, and this does away, partially, with that by the \namount of products shipped back in and jobs lost. That is the way the \namendment is worded.\n  Mr. BROWN. If I can put this in my own words, and maybe the Senator \nwill correct me, we are not saying there is a section in the code that \ndoes that, we are saying it is simply not covered in the code?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We are referring to the tax deferral section.\n  Mr. BROWN. I do not find any repeal of that tax deferral section in \nhere.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It is a modification of it.\n  Mr. BROWN. I wonder if there are other countries that have provisions \nlike this. This, in effect, is that it taxes profits on activity \noutside of the United States, I take it?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. BROWN. Are there other countries that do a similar thing?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Do they do it? They make sure that they do not make a \nprofit. You ought to come and see how they highball the cost of the \nparts that they ship through the Port of Charleston, SC, and send up \nto, let us say, Nissan-Tennessee to make automobiles up there. They get \na high cost for the part so Nissan-Tennessee is not even making a \nprofit in Tennessee.\n  We have tried to correct that one. Oh, they have every gimmick in the \nbook. When you get with these tax lawyers, they know how to get around \nanything and everything.\n  Incidentally, I have an article here about Nissan, and Nissan is \nmoving to Mexico. We will get into that on NAFTA. We love to get these \nforeign investments, but they are just passthroughs now. An expansion \nof BMW that had come to Spartanburg, SC, is going into Mexico. They \nwill follow the market, which is fine. It is a matter of taking care of \nyour stockholders and profits and that kind of thing. Business is \nbusiness.\n  But we have to understand that the business of the U.S. Senate is to \nlook at the overall economy, and when we have these deficits in the \nbalance of trade, over $1.5 trillion in the past 12 years, come, we \nhave to do something about it.\n  You will get some who come here, like my distinguished friend from \nNew York, he will get up, ``Why, America has always been a great nation \non account of commerce. We are a trading nation. Are we going back on \nour history?''\n  We were a trading nation of a plus balance of trade, not a minus. Not \na minus. What does the record show, heavens above? That thing goes up, \nup, and away. I think it was in 1992 we finally got it under $100 \nbillion, only to a $96.1 billion deficit; in 1993, it was $132.6 \nbillion; 1994, a $166.1 billion deficit in the balance of trade--more \nimports than exports. Not what my friend, Wayne Andrus from Archer-\nDaniels-Midland--``exports, exports, exports.'' We have to look at the \noverall picture.\n  In 1995, $174 billion? We are going up, up, and away. We are losing \nour shirt and enjoying it. We, as Senators, are telling the American \npeople, ``We are fat, rich, and happy. Don't worry about your economy. \nAll you have to do is worry about gay marriages. The States are taking \ncare of it.''\n  We come up on the silliest thing. Instead of balancing the budget, we \nwill give you a constitutional amendment so we can run on it. Come on.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. The Senator referred to the phenomenon. I think it is the \ngame played sometimes with automobile manufacturers, where they take \ntheir profit overseas and overprice the automobile as it comes in here \nso they do not show any profit in the United States.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. They overprice the parts and assemble them here. That \nis what they are doing.\n  Mr. BROWN. So, by manipulating the prices, they are avoiding \nrecognizing profit in this country and thus avoid paying taxes in this \ncountry?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Oh, yes, that is right.\n  Mr. BROWN. Doesn't our tax law now give us the tools to go after them \nwhen they play those games with prices?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I think our tax law does. But there are some----\n  Mr. BROWN. It simply does not get done.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. In the Treasury Department, it just does not get done. \nYou and I know we need, for example, hundreds more Customs agents. They \nhave told us down at Treasury there are billions of transshipments. We \njust got China, and there is a case right now of over $5 billion. It is \nreally a sad case.\n  In the textile debate, I said, ``Wait a minute, I will withdraw this \ntextile bill entirely if we just enforce the law.'' So you are right. \nIf we enforced our tax laws, if we enforced our trade laws, our customs \nlaw, our import duties, we would do a lot to solve this.\n  If I were king for a day, I would start by abolishing the \nInternational Trade Commission. Every time they find injury, a \nviolation of our trade laws, dumping, over at the International Trade \nAdministration, in Commerce, then they have to buck it over to the \nInternational Trade Commission, and that crowd constantly bubbles, \n``free trade, free trade, free trade,'' and finds against us.\n  So, the business folks in America say, ``Why even bring the case? It \ntakes you 3 or 4 years. You go through all that gauntlet with \nWashington lawyers and costs, and when you finally get it, you are not \ngoing to win anyway''? So they say, ``We will just move our production \noverseas.'' That is the good reason for the production moving overseas \nand the loss of jobs here.\n  But, Mr. President, let me sum up that particular matter of the fifth \ncolumn, so we will understand it. I would no longer include our State \nDepartment, but I could certainly start off with our multinationals, \nour multinational banks, the consultants, academia, the retailers, the \nWashington lawyers, and, of course, the Special Trade Representatives, \nall representing them and heading up these particular entities. When \nyou get all of those coming in giving you a false history--free trade, \nfree trade, Smoot-Hawley, Smoot-Hawley--that is the reason for this \nparticular bill.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from North Dakota, I think, used the \nexpression ``go far afield.'' That is my intent, to bring \nunderstanding. Unless we can get a grasp of our history and how we \nbuilt this strong America and what is really the opposition, the fifth \ncolumn that confronts us, we are not going to get a competitive \neconomic society. We are going to just service the economy and take in \nwash and serve hamburgers to each other. We will have no manufacturing \ncapabilities. When war comes, we will have no military production. We \nwill have to depend, like Japan, on the gulf war, and that is why you \npanic. They say, ``No, we are going to cut it off to the United States \nand say no to her and she won't be able to do these things of \nprotecting freedom the world around.''\n  So it is not far afield. This is to break open the door. This \nparticular amendment is a wake-up call, and it is not a spurious one \nwhatsoever. It is current.\n  I refer, Mr. President, to the article, once again, of our \ndistinguished friend, William Grieder, former editor at the Washington \nPost and now the editor of Rolling Stone.\n  I ask unanimous consent the ``Ex-Im Files,'' an article dated August \n5, 1996, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            The Ex-Im Files\n\n\n  how the taxpayer-funded export-import bank helps ship jobs overseas\n\n                          (By William Greider)\n\n       Washington, DC.--As the Nation's salesman in chief, Bill \n     Clinton looks like a smashing success. When Clinton came to \n     office, his long-term strategy for restoring\n\n[[Page S10252]]\n\n     American prosperity had many facets, but the core of the plan \n     could be summarized in one word: exports. The U.S. economy \n     would boom or stagnate, it was assumed, depending on how \n     American goods fared in global markets. So the president \n     mobilized the government in pursuit of sales.\n       Flying squads of Cabinet officers, sometimes accompanied by \n     corporate CEOs, were dispatched to forage for buyers in \n     foreign capitals from Beijing to Jakarta. The Commerce \n     Department targeted 10 nations--India, Mexico and Brazil \n     among them--as the ``big emerging markets.'' Trade \n     negotiators hammered on Japan and China to buy more American \n     stuff. And two new agreements were completed--GATT and \n     NAFTA--to reduce foreign tariffs.\n       U.S. industrial exports have soared in the Clinton years, \n     from $396 billion during the recessionary trough of 1992 to \n     around $520 billion last year. And as this administration has \n     said time and again, more exports means more jobs--usually \n     good jobs with higher wages. In his fierce commitment to \n     trade, Clinton is not much different from Ronald Reagan, who \n     (notwithstanding his laissez faire pretensions) also played \n     hardball on trade deals and, in some cases, intervened with \n     more effective results. George Bush, too, bargained on behalf \n     of corporate interests and played globe-trotting salesman. \n     Promoting exports and foreign investment is not a new idea; \n     it has enjoyed a bipartisan political consensus for decades.\n       What does seem to be new in American politics are the \n     thickening doubts among citizens and a rising chorus of \n     critics, informed and uninformed, who question Washington's \n     assumptions about exports. The conventional strategy, the \n     critics argue, may help the multinational companies turn \n     profits, but does it really serve American workers and the \n     broad public interest? The new realities of globalized \n     production play havoc with the old logic of exports-equal-\n     jobs. Sometimes it is the jobs that are exported, too.\n       This contradiction, usually covered up with platitudes and \n     doublespeak in political debate, becomes powerfully clear \n     when you look closely at the dealings of an obscure federal \n     agency located just across Lafayette Park from the White \n     House: the U.S. Export-Import Bank with only 440 civil \n     servants and a budget of less than $1 billion--small change \n     as Washington bureaucracies go.\n       Yet America's most important multinational corporations \n     devote solicitous attention to the Ex-Im Bank. Their \n     lobbyists shepherd its appropriation through Congress every \n     year and defend the agency against occasional attacks. Why? \n     The Ex-Im Bank provides U.S. corporations with hundreds of \n     millions of dollars each year in financial grease that \n     smooths their trade deals in the new global economy.\n       This year, Ex-Im will pump our $744 million in taxpayer \n     subsidies to America's export producers, financing the below-\n     market loans and loan guarantees that help U.S. companies \n     sell aircraft, telecommunications equipment, electric power \n     turbines and other products--sometimes even entire \n     factories--to foreign markets. Since the biggest subsidies \n     always go to the largest corporations, skeptics in Congress \n     sometimes refer to Ex-Im as the Bank of Boeing. It might as \n     well be called the Bank of General Electric--or AT, IBM, \n     Caterpillar or other leading producers. Ex-Im's senior \n     officers call these firms ``the customers.''\n       But the banker-bureaucrats at Ex-Im see their main mission \n     as fostering American employment. ``Our motto is, Jobs \n     through exports,'' says James C. Cruse, vice president for \n     policy planning, ``Exports are not the end in itself, so we \n     don't care about the company and the company profits.'' That \n     was indeed the purpose when the bank was chartered as a \n     federal agency back in 1945 and the reason it has always \n     enjoyed broad support, including that of organized labor.\n       At this moment, the tiny agency is under intense pressure \n     from influential U.S. multinationals to change the rules of \n     the game. Specifically, the companies want taxpayer money to \n     subsidize the sale of products that aren't actually \n     manufactured in America. They want subsidies for products \n     that are not really U.S. exports, since companies ship them \n     from their factories abroad to buyers in other foreign \n     countries. If the rules aren't changed, the exporters warn, \n     they will lose major deals in the fierce global competition \n     and may be compelled to move still more of their production \n     offshore.\n       ``Global competitiveness, multinational sourcing and the \n     deindustrialization of the U.S.'' wrote Cruse in a policy \n     memo for the bank, ``were the three most common factors that \n     exporters cited as reasons to revise Ex-Im Bank's foreign \n     content policy. . . . U.S. companies need multisourcing to be \n     able to compete with foreign companies. Foreign buyers are \n     becoming more sophisticated and they are expressing certain \n     preferences for a particular item to be sourced foreign . . . \n     [and] U.S. suppliers may not always exist for a particular \n     good.''\n       In plainer language, foreign is usually cheaper--often \n     because the wages are much lower--and sometimes better. As \n     U.S. producers have begun to buy more hardware and machinery \n     overseas, the capacity to make the same components in the \n     United States has diminished or even disappeared. What the \n     companies want in Cruse's bureaucratic parlance, is ``broadly \n     based support for foreign-sourced components.''\n       As the complaints from American firms swelled in the last \n     few years, Ex-Im officials agreed to convene the Foreign \n     Content Policy Review Group to explore how the U.S. financing \n     rules might be relaxed. The review group's members include 11 \n     major exporters (General Electric, AT, Boeing, Caterpillar, \n     Raytheon, McDonnell Douglas and others) plus several labor \n     representatives from the AFL-CIO and the machinists' and \n     textile-workers' unions.\n       The Ex-Im Bank must decide who wins and who loses--a \n     fundamental argument over what is in the national interest, \n     give globalized business. The review group discussions are \n     couched in polite police talk, but they speak directly to the \n     economic anxieties of Americans. If young workers worried \n     about their livelihood could hear what these powerful \n     American companies are saying in private, there would be many \n     more sleepless nights in manufacturing towns across this \n     Nation. The information below is taken from confidential Ex-\n     Im Bank members that were recently leaked to me. What these \n     executives have to say is not reassuring, but it's at least a \n     more accurate vision of the future than anything you are \n     likely to hear from this year's political candidates.\n       A decade ago the rule was simple: Ex-Im would not \n     underwrite any trade package that was not 100 percent U.S.-\n     made. Then and now Ex-Im scrutinizes the content of very \n     large export projects, item by item. to establish the \n     national origin of subcomponents. Any subcomponents produced \n     offshore must be shipped back to American factories to be \n     incorporated into the final assembly. If Caterpillar sells 10 \n     earthmoving machines to Indonesia all 10 of them have to come \n     out of a U.S. factory to get a U.S. subsidy, even if the \n     axles or engines were made abroad.\n       By the late 1980s, however, as major manufacturers pursued \n     globalization strategies that moved more of their production \n     offshore. Ex-Im, with labor approval opened the door. In 1987 \n     it agreed to finance deals with 15 percent foreign inside \n     content. Partial financing would also be provided for export \n     deals that involved at least 50 percent U.S. content.\n       Now the multinationals are back at the table again, \n     demanding still more latitude. The bank's rules, they \n     complain, have created a bureaucratic snarl that threatens \n     U.S. sales. These regulations are oblivious to the \n     complexities of modern trade which multinationals routinely \n     ``export'' and ``import'' huge volumes of goods internally--\n     that is among their own fur-flung subsidiaries or foreign \n     joint ventures.\n       The flavor of the company complaints is revealed in Ex-Im \n     Bank minutes of the review group's first meeting last year, \n     where various company managers sounded off about the new \n     global realities. David Wallbaum, from Caterpillar, urged the \n     bank to be ``more flexible in supporting foreign content,'' \n     according to the minutes, General Electric's Selig S. Merber \n     said GE needs ``access [to] worldwide pricing.'' Merber \n     proposed that instead of insisting on American content item \n     by item, Ex-Im look only at the U.S. aggregate.\n       Lisa DeSoto of Fluor Daniel, one of America's largest \n     construction engineering firms, suggested in a follow-up memo \n     that Ex-Im subsidize ``procurement from the NAFTA \n     countries,'' Mexico and Canada as if the goods were from the \n     U.S.\n       But it was Angel Torres, a representative for AT, who \n     spoke more bluntly than the others. AT's foreign content \n     has grown in the last 10 years because the U.S. is becoming a \n     ``service-oriented society,'' Torres said, according to the \n     minutes. ``AT's priority,'' he declared, ``is to increase \n     the allowable percentage of foreign content.''\n       When I rang up these corporate managers and some others to \n     ask them to elaborate on their views, all of them ducked my \n     questions. The one exception was David L. Thornton, a manager \n     from Boeing, whose newest jetliner, the 777, actually \n     involves 30 percent foreign content in the manufacturing \n     process (mostly from Japan). It still qualifies for full Ex-\n     Im financing. Thornton explained, because Boeing's original \n     investment in research and development also counts in the \n     sales price. ``Our general view of 75 percent is we can live \n     with it for the time being,'' Thornton said, ``but over time \n     it probably won't be adequate.''\n       The labor-union representatives, not surprisingly, choked \n     at the ominous implications of such comments--especially the \n     matter-of-fact references to America's de-industrialization. \n     Corporate leaders and politicians, after all, have been \n     celebrating the ``comeback'' of American manufacturing in the \n     1990s. Exports are booming, and U.S. competitiveness has \n     supposedly been restored, thanks to the corporate \n     restructurings and downsizings. Stock prices are rising, and \n     shareholders are happy again.\n       The private corporate view is not so cheery for the \n     employees. A memo from one multinational corporation (its \n     identity whited-out by Ex-Im bureaucrats) made it sound like \n     the demise of American manufacturing is already inevitable. \n     ``We believe the current policy does not reflect the de-\n     industrialization of the U.S. economy and the rise of the \n     Western European and Asian capabilities to produce high-tech \n     quality equipment . . .'' the memo states. ``Location is no \n     longer important in the competitive equation, and where the \n     suppliers of components will be [is] wherever the competitive \n     advantage lies.''\n       The more that labor heard from the companies, the more \n     hostile it became to any revision. ``We have been presented \n     with no credible evidence that current bank policies have \n     cost companies sales, thereby reducing\n\n[[Page S10253]]\n\n     U.S. employment,'' the labor representatives fired back in a \n     jointly signed letter in April. ``While we understand that \n     global corporations might prefer fewer restrictions--even the \n     provision of financing regardless of the effect on jobs in \n     the United States--that desire simply ignores the very \n     purpose of extending taxpayer-based credit.''\n       If Ex-Im agrees to finance more foreign content, the labor \n     reps asked, won't that simply encourage the multinationals to \n     move still more U.S. jobs overseas, thus accelerating \n     deindustrialization? When I put this question to Ex-Im \n     officials and corporate spokesmen, their answer was a limp \n     assurance that this isn't what the bank or the companies have \n     in mind.\n       But can anyone trust these assurances? The massive \n     corporate layoffs have sown general suspicions of the \n     companies' national loyalties, and the ``outsourcing'' of \n     high-wage jobs has already boiled up as a strike issue in \n     major labor-management confrontations. The United Auto \n     Workers shut down General Motors earlier this year over that \n     question. The UAW lost a long, bitter strike at Caterpillar \n     when it demanded wage cutbacks, threatening to relocate \n     production if the union didn't yield. The International \n     Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers closed down \n     Boeing's assembly lines for two months last fall, demanding a \n     stronger guarantee of job security as Boeing globalizes more \n     of its supplier base.\n       ``Ex-Im financing is corporate welfare with a fig leaf of \n     U.S. jobs, and now they want to take away the fig leaf,'' \n     says Mark A. Anderson, director of the AFL's task force on \n     trade. ``They want to be able to ship stuff from Indonesia to \n     China and use U.S. financing, I said to them, `You're nuts. \n     If you go ahead with this, you're going to be eaten alive in \n     Congress.'''\n       George J. Kourpiss, president of the machinists' union \n     whose members make aircraft at Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, \n     and jet engines at GE and Pratt & Whitney, put it more \n     starkly: ``The American people aren't financing that bank to \n     take work away from us. If the foreign content gets bigger, \n     then we're using the bank to destroy ourselves.''\n\n\n                             exports--Jobs\n\n       According to the government's dubious rule of thumb, each \n     $1 billion in new exports generates 16,000 jobs. By that \n     measure, Bill Clinton's traveling salesmen brought home 2 \n     million good jobs. So why is there not greater celebration? \n     The first, most-obvious explanation is imports. Foreign \n     imports soared, too, albeit at a slower rate of growth, and \n     so America's trade deficit with other nationals actually \n     doubled in size under Clinton, despite his aggressive \n     corporate strategy. Thus a critic might apply the \n     government's own equation to Clinton's trade deficit and \n     argue that there was actually a net loss of 11 million good \n     jobs.\n       Bickering over the trade arithmetic, however, does not get \n     to the heart of what's happening and what really bothers \n     people: the specter of continued downsizing among the \n     nation's leading industrial firms. In fact, globalization has \n     created a disturbing anomaly. U.S. exports multiply robustly, \n     yet meanwhile the largest multinationals that do most of the \n     exporting are shrinking dramatically as employers. It's \n     important to note that about half of U.S. manufacturing \n     exports comes from only 100 companies, and 80 percent from \n     some 250 firms, according to Ex-Im's executive vice \n     president, Allan I. Mendelowitz. The top 15 exporters--names \n     like GM, GE, Boeing, IBM--account for nearly one quarter of \n     all U.S. manufactured exports. Yet these same firms are \n     shedding American employers in alarming dimensions. The 15 \n     largest export producers with few exceptions have steadily \n     reduced their U.S. work forces during the past 10 years--some \n     of them quite drastically--even though their export sales \n     nearly doubled.\n       GE is a prime example because the company is widely \n     emulated in business circles for its tough-minded corporate \n     strategies. In 1985, GE employed 243,000 Americans and 10 \n     years later, only 150,000. GE became stronger, then Executive \n     Vice President Frank P. Doyle said. But, he conceded. We did \n     a lot of violence to the expectations of the American work \n     force.\n       So, too, did GM, the top U.S. exporter in dollar volume \n     (though the auto companies are not big users of Ex-Im \n     financing). GM has shrunk in U.S. work force from 559,000 to \n     314,000. IBM shed more than half of its U.S. workers during \n     the past decade (about 132,000 people). By 1995, Big Blue had \n     become a truly global firm--with more employees abroad than \n     at home (116,000 to 111,000). Even Intel, a thriving \n     semiconductor maker, shrank U.S. employment last year from \n     22,000 to 17,000. Motorola has grown, but its work force is \n     now only 56 percent American.\n       The top exporters that increased their U.S. employment \n     didn't begin to offset the losses. The bottom line tells the \n     story. The government's great substitute for America's major \n     multinational corporations has not been reciprocated, at \n     least not for American workers. The contradiction is not \n     quite as stark as the statistics make it appear, because the \n     job shrinkage is more complicated than simply shipping jobs \n     offshore. Some companies eliminated masses of employees both \n     at home and abroad. Others, like Boeing, reduced payrolls \n     primarily because global demand weakened in their sectors. \n     Some jobs were wiped out by labor-saving technologies and \n     reorganizations. But virtually all of these companies \n     offloaded major elements of production to lower-cost \n     independent suppliers, both in the U.S. and overseas. If the \n     jobs did not disappear, the wages were downsized.\n       This dislocation poses an important question, which \n     American politicians have not addressed. Does the success of \n     America's multinationals translate into general prosperity \n     for the country or merely for the companies and their \n     shareholders? The question is a killer for politicians--\n     liberals and conservatives alike--because it challenges three \n     generations of conventional wisdom. That's why most Democrats \n     or Republicans never ask it.\n       When these facts are mentioned, the exporters retreat to a \n     few trusty justifications. First there is the ``half a loaf'' \n     argument. Yes, it is unfortunately true that companies must \n     disperse an increasing share of the production jobs abroad, \n     either to reduce costs or to appease the foreign customers. \n     But if this were not done, there might be no export sales at \n     all and, thus, no jobs for Americans. Next, there is the \n     ``me, too'' argument. All of the other advanced industrial \n     nations have export banks that provide financing subsidies to \n     their multinationals. The export banks in Europe do allow \n     greater foreign content than the U.S.--but only if the goods \n     originate from an allied nation in the European community. \n     France supports German goods and vice versa, just as Michigan \n     supports California. The U.S. Ex-Im Bank, as Mendelowitz has \n     pointed out, actually provides greater risk protection and \n     generally charges lower premiums.\n       Japan's Ex-Im bank is indeed more flexible than America's, \n     but Japan's industrial system also operates on a very \n     different principle; major Japanese corporations take \n     responsibility for their employees. That understanding \n     creates a mutual trust that allows both the government and \n     the firms to pursue more sophisticated globalization \n     strategies. Japanese jobs are regularly eliminated when \n     Japan's manufacturing is relocated offshore in Asia or in \n     Europe (and sometimes in the U.S.), but the companies find \n     new jobs for displaced employees and only rarely, \n     reluctantly, lay off anyone.\n       ``The situation that our companies see,'' Ex-Im's Cruse \n     explains, ``is that Japan is willing to finance as much as 50 \n     percent foreign content, and [the companies] say to us, \n     `You're not competitive.' But an important difference is that \n     the Japanese government doesn't have to worry about the \n     workers because the Japanese companies worry about them. . . \n     . If GE subcontracts work to Indonesia, it tends to lay off a \n     line of workers back in the U.S.''\n\n\n                            bait and switch\n\n       In April 1994, AT announced a $150 trillion joint venture \n     with China's Qingdao Telecommunications to build two new \n     factories, in the Shandong province and in the city of \n     Chengdu, in the Sichuan province, that will manufacture the \n     high-capacity 5ESS switch, the heart of AT's advanced \n     telephone systems. AT's chairman, Robert Allen, said that \n     it will more than double its Chinese work force over the next \n     two or three years.\n       Five months later, in September, the Ex-Im Bank in \n     Washington approved the first of $87.6 million in loan \n     guarantees to underwrite AT's export sales to China--\n     switching equipment that will modernize the phone systems in \n     Qingdao and several other cities. AT won the contract in \n     head-to-head competition with Canada's Northern Telecom, \n     Germany's Siemens and France's Alcatel Alsthom. The Clinton \n     administration celebrated another big win for the home team.\n       But who actually won in this deal? A Telecom Publishing \n     Group article provided a different version of what AT's \n     victory meant for the United States. ``While some equipment \n     for AT's network projects in China will be built in this \n     country,'' the article reported, ``the Chinese are demanding \n     that eventually the bulk of the equipment in their system be \n     built in their country, the carrier [AT] said.''\n       An AT public-affairs vice president, Christopher Padilla, \n     denies this, but then Padilla also denies that AT is \n     prodding the Ex-Im Bank to relax its foreign-content rules. \n     Further, he assures me that despite their proximity, there \n     was no explicit quid pro quo and no connection between the \n     two transactions, the taxpayer-financed export sales and \n     AT's agreement to build new factories in China.\n       ``It's a reality of the marketplace,'' Padilla says. ``If \n     we tried to pursue a strategy of just making everything in \n     Oklahoma City''--where the 5ESS switch is now manufactured--\n     ``we wouldn't have any market share at all.''\n       The White House also led cheers for Boeing because Boeing \n     was also stomping its competitors in the Chinese market. In \n     1994 alone, Boeing sold 21 737s and seven 757s to various \n     Chinese airlines and obtained nearly $1 billion in Ex-Im \n     loans to finance the deals. When President Clinton hailed the \n     news, he did not mention that Boeing had agreed to consign \n     selected elements of its production work to Chinese \n     factories. The state-owned aircraft company at Xian, for \n     instance began making tail sections for the 737, work that is \n     normally done at Boeing's plant in Wichita, Kan. The first \n     order for Xian was for 100 sets, but that was just the \n     beginning. In March 1996, a China news agency boasted that \n     Boeing had agreed to buy 1,500 tail sections from Chinese \n     factories, both for the 737 and the 757. The deal was \n     described as ``the biggest contract in the history of China's \n     aviation industry.''\n\n[[Page S10254]]\n\n       Unlike AT and some others, Boeing is relatively \n     straightforward about acknowledging that it's trading away \n     jobs and technology for foreign sales. China intends to build \n     its own world-class aircraft industry, and Boeing helps by \n     giving China a piece of the action, relocating high-wage \n     production jobs from America to low-wage China, as well as \n     relocating some elements of the advanced technology that made \n     Boeing the world leader in commercial aircraft. Boeing has \n     told its suppliers to do the same. Northrop Grumman, in \n     Texas, is sharing production of 757 tail sections with \n     Chengdu Aircraft, in China.\n       ``What we've done with China,'' says Lawrence W. Clarkson, \n     Boeing's vice president for international development, \n     ``we've done for the same reason we did it with Japan--to \n     gain market access.'' The two transactions--the export sales \n     and job transfers--are legally separate but typically \n     negotiated in tandem, Clarkson explains. China always insists \n     upon a written acknowledgement of the job commitment in the \n     export sales contract--the same sale to China submitted to \n     the Ex-Im Bank for its financial assistance.\n       Until recently, the Ex-Im Bank's operative policy on this \n     issue could be described as ``don't ask, don't tell'': The \n     bank officials didn't ask the companies if they were off-\n     loading jobs, and the companies didn't tell them. When I \n     asked various Ex-Im managers if they knew about AT's new \n     switch factories in China before they approved AT's export \n     financing their answer was no. What about companies like \n     Boeing doing similar deals?\n       ``Yes, we're aware of that,'' Cruse says. It's not that the \n     companies tell us, but it's not hard to read the \n     newspapers.''\n       After prodding from labor officials, the bank last year \n     began requiring exports to reveal whether they dispersed U.S. \n     jobs or technology in connection with the Ex-Im-financed \n     sales. But the federal agency still approves these deals \n     without weighing the potential impact on future employment. \n     In fact, Ex-Im still pretends that the export sales and \n     corporate decisions to relocate jobs are unrelated \n     transactions, though every company knows otherwise.\n       The practice of swapping jobs for sales is widespread in \n     global trade--deals are negotiated in secrecy because such \n     practices ostensibly violate trade rules. But everyone knows \n     the game, and most everyone plays it. If Boeing doesn't swap \n     jobs for Chinese sales, then its European competitor Airbus \n     will. If AT doesn't move its switch manufacturing to China, \n     then Siemens or Alcatel will (in fact, Alcatel already has). \n     The cliche at Boeing is ``60 percent of something is better \n     than 100 percent of nothing.''\n       The trouble is that nothing may be what many American \n     workers wind up with anyway--especially if China eventually \n     becomes a world-class aircraft producers itself. Officials at \n     the Communications Workers of America, which represents AT \n     workers, recall that Ma Bell once made all its home \n     telephones in the U.S. and now makes none here.\n       Is the same migration under way now for the high-tech \n     switches? The AT spokesman insists not. Anyway, he adds the \n     assurance that the most valuable input in these switches is \n     the software, not the hardware from the factories, and the \n     design work is still American. This may reassure the techies, \n     but it's not much comfort to those who work on the assembly \n     lines. Besides, AT plans to open a branch of Bell \n     Laboratories in China.\n       The dilemma facing American multinationals is quite real, \n     but the question remains: Why should American taxpayers \n     subsidize export deals contingent on increased foreign \n     production, or even offloading portions of the American \n     industrial base? Americans are told repeatedly that they \n     cannot exercise any influence over these global firms, but \n     that claim is mistaken. The Ex-Im Bank is an important choke \n     point in the bottom line of these multinationals. Americans \n     should demand that the subsidies be turned off, at least for \n     the largest companies, until the multinationals are willing \n     to provide concrete commitments to their work forces.\n       The gut issue is not about economics but about national \n     loyalty and mutual trust. ``Every meeting we have in the \n     union, we open it with the pledge of allegiance,'' machinists \n     union president George Kouepias muses, ``Maybe the companies \n     should start doing that at their board meetings.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Just referring to the article, if you please, Mr. \nPresident, and everyone ought to read this article, it says:\n\n       Globalization has created a disturbing anomaly. While U.S. \n     exports grow robustly, the corporations that do most of the \n     exporting are the busiest downsizers.\n\n  When they fire everybody, it is a polite word, that is just \ndownsizing so they are becoming more competitive. They are just, by \ngosh, getting rid of the United States worker and employing the \noffshore worker.\n  But I quote this particular sentence:\n\n       GE is a prime example because the company is widely \n     emulated in business circles for its tough-minded corporate \n     strategies. In 1985, GE employed 243,000 Americans and 10 \n     years later, only 150,000. GE became stronger, then executive \n     Vice President Frank P. Doyle said. But he conceded. We did a \n     lot of violence to the expectations of the American work \n     force.\n\n  Get that sentence, the vice president of GE, when they cut down to \n150,000 jobs, so-called downsizing, fired them. I used to have five \nGE's. I had one at Irmo. I have one still at Greenville which is doing \nwell. I have one which was brought into Florence. It made cellular \nradios and now MRI's. It has taken the business away from competitors. \nBut the one I had in Charleston has gone to Brazil. We are losing good \nplants down there, and here is why: ``We did a lot of violence to the \nexpectations of the American work force.''\n  Mr. President, I ask that our colleagues refer to the Philadelphia \nInquirer of Monday, September 9, Tuesday, September 10, and again \ntoday: Endangered Label ``Made in the United States.''\n  It is a wonderful article of how we are losing our industrial \nbackbone, how small businesses lose out to foreign competition.\n  I was asked at the Chicago convention, Mr. President, ``Senator, you \nDemocrats, why don't you all do something for small business?''\n  I said, ``Oh, no, that small business crowd is organized by the \nNational Federation of Independent Business.'' I have won recognition \nand awards from that group, but, generally speaking, they are not for \nthe small business on this particular score, they are talking about \nfree trade, free trade as retailers to make a bigger profit.\n  I thank the wonderful Philadelphia Inquirer. This is the headline: \n``Small businesses lose out to foreign competition.'' I want the NFIB \nto read these series of articles.\n  Mr. President, referring just to one part, let's start off with the \nfirst paragraph:\n\n       In early 1980's when stainless steel knives, forks and \n     spoons suddenly surged into the United States from Japan, \n     South Korea and Taiwan in response to lowered tariffs and \n     cutthroat foreign prices, the domestic industry found itself \n     in trouble.\n       American producers, contending it was unfair competition, \n     appealed to the United States trade commission to impose \n     higher tariffs on imported flatware. The trade commission is \n     an independent Government agency whose main job is to monitor \n     the impact of the imports on the U.S. industries.\n       If the ITC agrees with the complaint, the presidentially \n     appointed commissioners may recommend that duties be imposed. \n     Even so, there is no assurance that the duties will actually \n     be assessed and, in most cases, they are not. The final \n     decision rests with the White House which historically has \n     refused to impose additional duties.\n       After 5 months of study, the commission ruled on May 1, \n     1984, that stainless flatware was ``not being imported into \n     the United States in such increased quantities as to be a \n     substantial cause of serious injury or the threat thereof to \n     the domestic industry.''\n       On the contrary, the ITC held that the ``economic data on \n     the performance of this industry failed to demonstrate the \n     required degree of serious injury mandated by the statute. \n     Rather, the industry is doing reasonably well.''\n       According to ITC findings, nine companies produced flatware \n     in the United States in 1982. Today--\n\n  Now listen, Mr. President--\n\n       Today, most of them are either out of business or \n     purchasing flatware from foreign services. Except for two \n     small plants, Oneida, Ltd., in Oneida, New York, there is \n     virtually no stainless steel flatware production in the \n     United States.\n\n  I could go down the list of commodities after commodities after \ncommodities, and you can see, Mr. President, where these companies are \njust moving the strength--it is not just jobs--it is moving the \nstrength of the United States. When they get to national defense, \neverybody comes out here on the defense authorization bill and votes \noverwhelmingly on a defense appropriations bill. But right to the \npoint, they forget their history and how we got here and how we were \nable to maintain and sustain the strength of the greatest superpower.\n\n  Mr. President, we are the last remaining superpower. Look at them run \nall around. The atom bomb, the nuclear bomb cannot be used--should not \nbe used. We do not have the manpower that the People's Republic of \nChina has and others have that are coming along now and are going to \nbuild up their military strength. And they do not care anymore about \nthe 6th Fleet coming in to protect them.\n  The name of the game is the economic warfare, and the great \nsuperpower--and if you read Eamonn Fingleton's book--``Blindside'' is \nthe title of that book--you will find that within 4 short years, the \nlargest economic power in this world will be the\n\n[[Page S10255]]\n\ncountry of Japan. Already they are a larger manufacturer. Here is a \nlittle place not bigger than California, with 125 million compared to \nour 260 million, and vast resources, with oil and all the natural \nwealth that we have here, all the talent, all the research and \neverything else, and they produce more in Japan today, manufacturing, \nthan the United States of America. Economically, their GNP, their \nproductivity, will be greater than that of the United States. Their per \ncapita income, right now they are richer than we are. We cannot get \ninto their markets. We still, as a result of the fifth column, keep \nsaying ``free trade, free trade, Smoot-Hawley, Smoot-Hawley.'' We are \nlosing our shirts. We are losing our shirts.\n  By the year 2015, the People's Republic of China will come along. \nThey are producing economically. I just visited there in April, and I \nthink they are going capitalistic. I think it will succeed. I hope. And \nwe have our fingers crossed it will succeed.\n  What do we need to do? We need to really start enforcing our laws on \nthe books. Get rid of the International Trade Commission. You can see \nthe political cabal that comes in any time they appoint a member. They \nhave to swear on the altar of free trade, almighty allegiance, and \neverything else before they go over there. That is a big part of the \nfifth column. We have to quit financing.\n  We have to actually someday repeal that GATT, World Trade \nOrganization. We lost our sovereignty. In the Kodak case, we found out, \nMr. President, we found out that we lost our sovereignty because the \nJapanese said, ``Go to the WTO,'' instead of really enforcing what we \nsaid on the floor of the Senate. They said, ``Oh, no, we're not going \nto do away with section 301.'' The Japanese have said, ``You have \nalready done away with it when you signed up.''\n  You get these emerging nations and you see how they vote. Back in \nApril we had these particular human rights violations in the People's \nRepublic of China. We brought it up at the United Nations. The United \nNations voted to have a hearing on it. Our friends at the People's \nRepublic went down into Africa; they picked up the emerging nations' \nvotes, and they said human rights was a nonissue. They have not even \nhad a hearing. That is politically how that U.N. crowd works. When are \nwe going to wake up in this land of ours and not understand the fifth \ncolumn working against the American industrial worker?\n  So we need more customs agents. And, yes, Mr. President, we need the \nDorgan-Hollings measure to cut out these subsidies of tax deferrals for \nthose who are induced with incentives to go abroad and make more money. \nWe need to change our tax laws, a value added tax.\n  If I manufacturer this desk in the State of South Carolina, I have to \npay the income tax, the corporate tax, the sales tax involved, and \neverything else, all the taxes, and I ship it to Paris, France. If I \nmanufactured this desk in Paris, France, they put on a value added tax \nof 15 percent, but when it leaves the port of Le Havre to come here to \nWashington, they deduct the 15 percent. That is a 15 percent \ndisadvantage to a manufacturer in the United States of America, and we \nneed the money.\n  The Budget Committee, eight of us, bipartisan, in 1987, voted to get \non top of this monster with a value added tax allocated to the deficit \nand the debt. But these pollster-politicians running around, ``I'm \nagainst taxes, I'm against taxes, I'm against taxes; I'm going to give \nyou a 15 percent tax cut,'' when we are broke in the Government. \nGrowth, growth, growth--there is no education in the second kick of a \nmule.\n  How do you think this got up to a $5.23 trillion debt? We never got \nto $1 trillion until Ronald Reagan came to town with Kemp-Roth. And he \ndebunked it. Senator Bob Dole debunked it. Howard Baker called it a \n``riverboat gamble.'' George Walker Herbert Bush, President Bush, \ncalled it ``voodoo.'' But now we have a party running for national \noffice on voodoo. When are we going to learn and sober up?\n  The Dorgan-Hollings amendment is a wakeup call here to the reality of \nthe greatness of this Nation. Historically, we had this in the very \nearliest days. David Ricardo in ``The Doctrine of Comparative \nAdvantage.'' They came to Alexander Hamilton and James Madison and \nJefferson, because they all joined in with Hamilton. The Brits said, \nwhen we won our freedom in this little fledging nation, they said, \n``Look, you trade with what you produce best, and we'll trade back with \nwhat we produce best''-- ``The Doctrine of Comparative Advantage,'' \neconomics 101, David Ricardo.\n  Alexander Hamilton wrote a little booklet, ``Reports on \nManufacturers.'' It is over at the Library of Congress. Do not read the \nentire booklet, but in one word he told the Brits, ``Bug off.'' He \nsaid, ``We are not going to remain your colony and just ship our \nagricultural products, our iron, our timber, our coal. We are going to \nbe a Nation-State, and we are going to manufacture, we are going to \nmanufacture and produce our own products.''\n  When they talk of tariffs, the second bill--the first bill had to do \nwith the seal--the second bill that passed this great Congress that we \nstand in, on July 4, 1789, I say to the Senator from Nebraska, the \nsecond bill that we ever passed was a tariff bill of 50 percent on 60 \narticles going right on down the list. We built the greatness, the \neconomic strength, this economic giant, the United States of America, \nwith protectionism.\n  We did it with Lincoln when we built the steel mills for the \ntranscontinental railroad. We came to Nebraska under Roosevelt and \nsaid, for agriculture, we are going to put in price supports and \nprotectionism, protective quotas that I support under Roosevelt to \nrebuild from the darkness of the Depression. With Eisenhower, oil \nimport quotas, we have used protectionism. So do not come here and give \nme ``Smoot-Hawley protectionism. Are you for free trade?'' And \neverybody running around like children, hollering, ``There's no free \nlunch. There's no free trade.'' I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, under the amendment of my friend from \nNorth Dakota, U.S. corporations or individual investors that own 10 \npercent or more of the stock of a U.S.-controlled foreign corporation \nwould be taxed currently on the foreign corporation's profits when it \nsells goods back into the United States. Under present law, such \nprofits are not taxed by the United States at the time earned. Instead, \ntaxation is deferred until the foreign corporation's earnings are \nrepatriated, that is, returned to its U.S. shareholders in the form of \ndividends or gains on the sale of their stock. In many cases, the sole \nU.S. shareholder of a foreign corporation is the parent corporation. In \nother cases, several U.S. corporations or investors own the foreign \ncorporation.\n  The premise underlying this proposal is that plants are being moved \nabroad for tax reasons. While this is a fair topic for examination, I \ndo not believe this has been established with any certainty, and before \nthe current rules are changed it must be. Investment abroad that is not \ntax driven is good for the United States. It promotes exports and \nenhances the competitiveness of our companies.\n  The evidence suggests that the decision to locate production abroad \nprimarily depends not on tax considerations, but instead on practical \nbusiness considerations, such as proximity to raw materials, access to \ndistribution channels, lower wage rates, prospects for growth, \nregulatory climate and other nontax factors. Taxes are certainly taken \ninto account, but they are not the predominant factor, since the bulk \nof U.S. direct investment in foreign countries is in countries with \neffective business tax rates in excess of, or comparable to, the United \nStates.\n  Over 70 percent of assets held by United States-owned foreign \nmanufacturers are held in high-tax jurisdictions, such as Canada, the \nUnited Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, and Australia. \nIn contrast, the two low-tax jurisdictions most often cited as having \nrunaway plants--Ireland and Singapore--have only 4.2 percent of the \ntotal assets held by United States-owned foreign manufacturers. \nFurthermore, excluding Canada, only 7.2 percent of total sales by \nUnited States-owned foreign manufacturers were to the United States \nmarket in 1990, with over 60 percent to local markets and the remainder \nto other foreign countries. Finally, according to the Departments of \nTreasury and Commerce, less than 15 percent\n\n[[Page S10256]]\n\nof total imports from U.S. affiliates came from low-tax countries. \nThus, the weight of the evidence indicates that, at most, taxes appear \nto affect investment decisions only where the investor is relatively \nindifferent between two locations.\n  Would this amendment be effective in keeping production in the U.S.? \nIt is hard to imagine that it would alter many decisions to locate \nplants abroad. Those producing goods abroad for the U.S. market would \ncontinue to do so for practical reasons, and simply face higher taxes. \nFor example, the proposal would apply to a U.S.-owned company that \ngrows bananas abroad and imports them into the United States, even \nthough there are virtually no producers of bananas in the United \nStates. As a result, the bill would have a negative impact on many \nbusinesses that would not be economically viable in the United States, \nor for which locating production in the United States would be \nimpractical. At the same time, the vast majority of U.S. businesses \nwith foreign subsidiaries would not be greatly affected by the proposal \nbecause their foreign operations do not produce for the U.S. market. \nOver 90 percent of all sales by United States-owned foreign \nmanufacturers located outside of Canada are to foreign markets.\n\n  From the standpoint of competitiveness, other countries typically do \nnot require their taxpayers to pay tax currently on the earnings from \noperations conducted abroad by a foreign subsidiary. U.S.-owned \nbusinesses must compete against foreign-owned businesses that are \nlocated in low-tax jurisdictions and are not taxed currently by their \nhome countries. It is unlikely that many of our major trading partners \nwould respond to enactment of this amendment by imposing current \ntaxation on their companies.\n  Administrability of the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota is \nalso a concern. Under the legislation, U.S. shareholders would be taxed \ncurrently not only on the profits from imports into the United States, \nbut on the foreign corporation's income from sales to third parties \nthat import the goods into the United States, if it was reasonable to \nexpect that such property would be imported into the United States, or \nused as a component in other property which would be imported into the \nUnited States.\n  Staff at the Treasury Department and the Joint Committee on Taxation \nhave raised questions about the administrative feasibility of enforcing \nthe provision in the case of foreign corporations selling outside the \nUnited States to a third party importer. It would be very difficult for \nthe IRS to identify those sales to third parties triggering taxation \nbecause the products are destined for the U.S. market, particularly \ngiven that many taxpayers could be expected to restructure their U.S. \nsales via third parties in an attempt to avoid the provision. Further, \nthe recordkeeping required of taxpayers could be onerous.\n  Finally, this proposal conflicts with the intent of the Multilateral \nAgreement on Investment of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development [OECD]. Since 1991, the United States has been working \ntoward a legally binding comprehensive investment agreement in the \nOECD. In May 1995, the OECD Council finally agreed to negotiate a \nMultilateral Agreement on Investment. The objective of the United \nStates in those talks is to reach agreement that will set high \nstandards for liberalizing investment rules and increasing investment \nprotection. The idea is to make foreign investing safer for U.S. \ncompanies because U.S. investment overseas promotes exports and \nenhances the competitiveness of our companies. Foreign subsidiaries of \nU.S. companies are the primary customers for U.S. exports--over one-\nfourth of U.S. exports go to them each year. Those exports account for \nmore than 2 million of the 8 million U.S. jobs supported by U.S. \nexports. The proposal before us goes in exactly the opposite direction \nof our efforts in the OECD.\n  I am committed to doing everything possible to ensure that the U.S. \neconomy remains strong, that decent jobs are available to those that \nseek them, and that American workers dislocated by the increasingly \nglobal economy are assisted in finding new opportunities. However, I \nbelieve the opening of production facilities abroad is often good news, \nnot bad, and that this amendment would not accomplish its stated \npurpose.\n  I hope we will not act improvidently on this important matter, and I \ntherefore urge that this amendment not be adopted.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment \nfrom the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, this is another one of those amendments that sounds so \neasy, so simple, and so straightforward, that it seems that every \nmember of this body should be immediately jumping up on his or her feet \nand agreeing with what the distinguished Senator from North Dakota is \nsaying. I only wish our world were as simple and the problems so easy \nto solve as the proponents of this amendment would have us believe.\n  However, today's world is not very simple, especially when we are \ndiscussing the world of international business and the tax law. \nUnfortunately, the assumptions upon which this amendment are based are \njust plain wrong and the result will be to punish companies for looking \nout for the best interests of their employees and stockholders.\n  First, let me make it clear, Mr. President, that I have no doubt that \nthe Senator from North Dakota and his supporters are very sincere in \ntheir beliefs about this issue, and that the amendment is well \nintentioned. However, based on the real world that we live in, the \namendment is both unnecessary and will prove to be counterproductive.\n  As I understand the amendment, it is based on S. 1597, which the \nSenator from North Dakota introduced this past March. This bill would \ndeny what my friend from North Dakota calls unwarranted tax breaks to \nU.S. companies that set up manufacturing operations in a foreign \ncountry and export goods from those operations back into the United \nStates.\n  In the floor statement that accompanied the introduction of S. 1597, \nthe Senator from North Dakota implies that a large number of American \ncompanies are abandoning U.S. soil and removing their operations, lock, \nstock, and barrel, to other locations on the globe where they can find \ncheaper labor and lower taxes. As a result, goes the argument, American \njobs are being lost in the process. And, according to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, to add insult to injury, our tax code is rewarding such \nbehavior with special tax breaks.\n  S. 1597, and the amendment before us, is designed to end what he \ncalls unwarranted tax breaks and punish those supposedly unscrupulous \ncompanies that are allegedly taking unfair advantage of the rules to \ngain profit for themselves at the expense of American workers.\n  Well, Mr. President, at first blush, who wouldn't be in favor of \ncracking down on such awful practices and unfair tax breaks?\n  The only problem is that the scenario set out by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota does not reflect what is going on in the real world. It is \nan oversimplistic solution to a misidentified problem.\n  In the world as oversimplified by the proponents of this amendment, \nU.S. companies are abandoning loyal American workers to save a few \ndollars an hour with cheap overseas labor in tax haven countries. In \nthe real world, Mr. President, this is simply not the case. At least \ntwo-thirds of the investment and sales of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. \ncompanies are in countries where the average labor cost is higher than \nin the United States. Moreover, the average tax rate paid by U.S. \nmultinational companies is lower in the United States than it is \noutside the United States. More than 75 percent of all imports to the \nUnited States from U.S.-owned foreign subsidiaries is from developed \nnations, where taxes typically are either higher than or similar to the \nU.S. rate.\n  While it is true that some U.S. companies have set up manufacturing \noperations in other countries with lower labor costs, they have \ngenerally done so in order to stay competitive with other companies in \nthe same industry that have cheaper labor costs.\n  We live in a global economy, Mr. President. Many products, especially \nthose in the high technology industries, can be as easily assembled in \nMalaysia as in California. When U.S. companies have taken their low-\nskill assembly operations overseas, they have done so as a matter of \nsurvival. In\n\n[[Page S10257]]\n\nother words, any jobs lost to Americans by a move of an assembly plant \noverseas would most likely have been lost anyway--and probably then \nsome.\n  Companies that go out of business because they are no longer \ncompetitive pay no wages and create no new jobs and pay no taxes. \nCompanies that can successfully compete in the world marketplace most \noften expand employment, add security to U.S. workers, and contribute \nto the U.S. tax base.\n  In the world as oversimplified by the proponents of this amendment, \nU.S. companies are moving their manufacturing operations to other \ncountries, only to export the majority of the product back to the \nUnited States. In the real world, Mr. President, again, this is simply \nnot the case. In 1993, 66 percent of the sales of U.S. foreign \nsubsidiaries were made to customers in the foreign country, 23 percent \nwere made to customers in other foreign countries, and only 11 percent \nwere exported back to the United States.\n  These data show that one of major real-world answers as to why U.S. \ncompanies set up manufacturing operations overseas is to be closer to \ntheir customers. Many customers demand a local presence of their \nsupplier. Moreover, as a practical matter, local conditions often \ndictate that the U.S. company manufacture locally in order to be able \nto take advantage of the business opportunity in that country. For \nexample, how could U.S. software manufacturers sell their products \nabroad without local operations to customize and service the software? \nWe have seen the same thing happen in the United States, where foreign \nautomobile manufacturers have moved their operations here in order to \nbe closer to their markets.\n\n  Contrary to what the Senator from North Dakota is asserting, there \nare often a number of benefits to the domestic job market when a U.S.-\nbased multinational company sets up a subsidiary in a foreign country. \nThe 1991 Economic Report of the President notes that ``. . . U.S. \ndirect investment abroad stimulates U.S. companies to be more \ncompetitive internationally, which can generate U.S. exports and jobs. \nEqually important, U.S. direct investment abroad allows U.S. firms to \nallocate their resources more efficiently, thus creating healthier \ndomestic operations, which, in turn, tend to create jobs.''\n  I would also note, Mr. President, that the overseas business \noperations of U.S.-based multinational companies contributed a record \nnet surplus of $130 billion in 1990 to our balance of payments. This \nnumber has very likely gone even higher in the years since 1990. In \naddition, these U.S.-based multinational companies have been \nresponsible for significant employment in the United States. Much of \nthis employment is generated by the foreign operations of these \ncorporations. For example, in most cases, the research and development \nwork that leads to the assembly operations overseas is performed right \nhere in the United States. Let's look again at the software industry, \nwhich is very important to my home state of Utah. Additional sales in \nforeign countries, generated by subsidiaries of U.S. software \ncompanies, lead to increased employment in the United States to support \nthose sales and to continue the research necessary to improve those \nproducts.\n  Now, Mr. President, let's discuss just exactly what this amendment \nwould do. At the heart of the so-called tax break that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is trying to partially eliminate is the long-standing tax \nprinciple that says a taxpayer doesn't have to pay tax on income until \nthat income is received. One example of this concept that individuals \nrun into every day is the fact that we do not have to pay taxes on \nunrealized capital gains on property until we sell that property. For \ninstance, if a taxpayer holds 100 shares of stock that he or she bought \n20 years ago at $10 per share, and that stock is now worth $100 per \nshare, our tax code does not tax that individual until he or she \nactually sells the stock and realizes the gain.\n  We have a similar principle in place that applies when a U.S. company \nsets up a subsidiary in another country. Under the tax law, with some \nexceptions, the U.S. company does not have to pay tax on the earnings \nof the foreign subsidiary until the money is actually returned to the \nU.S. parent. This principle is commonly known as deferral because the \ntax is deferred until the earnings are repatriated to the United \nStates, much the same as the tax is deferred to an individual on a \ncapital gain until the sale is accomplished and the gain is realized.\n  What the amendment before us would do is to end deferral to the \nextent that income is earned on goods shipped back into the United \nStates. What, one might ask, is wrong with this? Wouldn't this be \neffective in preventing U.S. companies from uprooting their domestic \nmanufacturing operations and moving them overseas?\n  Mr. President, I submit that there are several major problems with \nthis proposal and that it would not be effective. Indeed, I believe \nthis proposal would be counterproductive and result in fewer U.S. jobs. \nThe amendment goes way beyond the problem being described and applies \nwhere there is no indication of alleged abuse. For one thing, there is \nno provision in the amendment to limit the loss of deferral to those \nsituations where actual U.S. employment has been displaced. Indeed, the \namendment doesn't even require that there be a showing of increased \nforeign investment or reduced U.S. employment. Thus, any U.S. company \nwith existing foreign operations could be penalized, even if no U.S. \nplants closed and even if the U.S. employment actually increased.\n  In addition, this amendment would add a great deal of complexity to \nan already mind-numbingly complicated part of the Internal Revenue \nCode. The determination of ``imported property income'' as required by \nthe amendment would require a whole new set of assumptions and \nrecordkeeping, all of which adds to the huge compliance burden already \nfaced by all taxpayers. Moreover, the Internal Revenue Service would \nhave to add more trained personnel to audit this provision, and this at \na time when Congress and the American people are demanding cuts in IRS \nfunding. The provisions in the amendment calling for a new foreign tax \ncredit basket would also add more complexity and unfairness from \npossible double taxation. The administrative expenses of complying with \nthese provisions could easily outweigh the amount of revenue collected \nfrom this amendment.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this provision is not likely to achieve its \ngoal of retaining U.S. jobs. Many countries with wages lower than those \nin the United States also have high corporate income tax rates. Loss of \ndeferral in these countries would not result in any extra U.S. tax \nliability because the U.S. tax would be offset with the foreign tax \ncredit for income taxes paid in the foreign country. Additionally, \nbecause this amendment does not affect the major reason that U.S. \ncompanies establish foreign subsidiaries, which as I mentioned is to be \ncloser to its customers, this change would only punish companies that \ntry to better compete in a world market. These firms will still take \nwhatever action is necessary to compete globally. But, if the U.S. \nbegins to punish them for being responsive to world competition and for \ntaking advantage of international business opportunities, the result \nmight be that some companies could move all operations out of the \nUnited States to reduce the onerous results of this amendment. At the \nvery least, the increased cost of complying with these unnecessary \nprovisions would leave less money available for companies to expand and \ncreate more U.S. employment.\n  In the real world, Mr. President, multinational companies are making \nbusiness decisions based on a number of economic factors, only one of \nwhich is the tax consideration. This amendment tries to simplify a \ncomplex world and solve a problem without realizing the real causes of \nthe problem. As a result, the solution doesn't fit and it simply will \nnot work.\n  As a final note, Mr. President, it is important to note that this \namendment does not belong on this bill. As my colleague from North \nDakota well knows, this is a tax provision that can only be considered, \nunder the U.S. Constitution, on a revenue measure originating from the \nHouse of Representatives. The underlying appropriations bill is not \nsuch a measure. Therefore, if the Senate were to make the mistake of \npassing this measure, the House would undoubtedly exercise its \nprerogative and send this bill back to the\n\n[[Page S10258]]\n\nSenate under the so-called ``blue slip\" procedure. This, of course, \nwould only delay in getting an important appropriations bill passed.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this perhaps well-intentioned but \nseriously misguided amendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment is bad policy from top to \nbottom. If enacted, it would hurt U.S. companies and destroy jobs. It \nis, I am afraid, motivated more by political considerations than \nanything else.\n  Under generally accepted tax principles in the United States and \naround the world, income is taxed when it is realized by a taxpayer. \nWhen income is earned but not received until some future date--say, for \nexample, income in a pension plan or an individual retirement account--\nthen taxation is normally deferred.\n  Eliminating or even limiting deferrals would put American companies \nat a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace. This amendment \ndoes not--as it purports to do--eliminate a privilege; rather, it \nimposes a penalty, and a severe one at that. It will not increase \nrevenues for the U.S. Treasury. It will, however, hurt American \ncompanies that are trying both to run their day-to-day operations and \nto compete with foreign businesses.\n  What does this amendment do? It assumes that allowing U.S. \nmultinationals to defer taxes on the income of their foreign \nsubsidiaries is a tax break. That is a false assumption, because \ndeferring only means that taxes are not due until the time that income \nhas actually been received, or in the case of multinationals, \nrepatriated back to the U.S. parent company. This amendment not only \ntaxes income before it is realized, it carries with it the potential to \ntax income that is never realized at all.\n  Since none of our trading partners subject their companies to such a \nburden, our companies would suffer. No other country in the world \ndenies deferral on active business income as extensively as the United \nStates, now, with respect to passive income, for example. According to \na 1990 white paper submitted by the International Competition \nSubcommittee of the American Bar Association Section of Taxation to \ncongressional tax writing committees, France, Germany, Japan, The \nNetherlands, and others, do not tax domestic parent companies on any \nearnings of their foreign marketing subsidiaries until such earnings \nare repatriated. The earnings are deferred without additional tax \npenalties.\n  No one can doubt the importance of the global economy to American \njobs and American economic strength. If we are to provide good jobs for \nour citizens, it is important that we stay competitive. Already, \ncurrent tax rules create a disadvantage for U.S. businesses that \noperate overseas and compete in foreign markets. Recent data \ndemonstrate that U.S. multinationals are already taxed more heavily on \ntheir foreign income than on their domestic income. The current U.S. \nTax Code has a strong bias against U.S. multinationals. Its sourcing \nrules and strict limitations on foreign tax credits expose the foreign \ninvestments of U.S. companies to double taxation. It also gives less \nfavorable treatment to foreign affiliates by making them ineligible for \nthe R tax credit or accelerated depreciation, and denies them the \nability to include losses in the U.S. parent's consolidated income tax \nreturn. Current law does not, as the sponsors of this amendment assume, \nreward U.S. corporations with offshore operations.\n\n  Clearly, imposing more taxes on American companies weakens U.S. \ninternational competitiveness, hurts American companies and American \njobs, and gives our foreign competitors a greater advantage--just the \nopposite of what the amendment's sponsors say they want.\n  Not only will this amendment increase direct taxes on U.S. companies, \nit will also increase regulatory costs associated with compliance and \nenforcement. The proposal will add enormous complexity to the already \nonerous and complicated U.S. Tax Code in the area of international \ntaxes. The changes will be difficult for businesses to comply with and \nvirtually impossible for the IRS to administer and enforce. For \nexample, a U.S. multinational may manufacture a component--say, a \ncomputer chip --that eventually finds its way into a finished product \nthat is ultimately imported into the United States by a foreign \ncompany, without the U.S. multinational's knowledge or consent. The \nIRS, in this case, would have to trace potentially long chains of \nunrelated parties that may alter a product or incorporate it into \nanother product in order to enforce the requirements of this proposal. \nSimilarly, businesses would have to employ complicated and tedious \nprocedures to determine if their products could potentially ever be \nimported back into the United States. That, Mr. President, is just one \nreason that proposals like this need careful study by the Finance \nCommittee, not an instant debate on the floor.\n  This amendment means more taxes, more regulations, and more power to \nthe IRS--powers which, I can assure my colleague, the country hardly \nneeds.\n  Today, U.S. companies face intense competition in both domestic and \ninternational markets. Nothing can be worse for our companies \nstruggling to compete in the global economy than to burden them with \nmore government regulations and taxes.\n  There are several mistaken premises in this amendment, and I would \nlike briefly to address some of them.\n\n  First of all, the amendment's underlying premise is that when \nAmerican companies open factories, plants and offices overseas, they \nreduce American jobs. That's simply not true. U.S. firms establish \noperations abroad primarily in order to penetrate foreign markets and \ntake advantage of foreign business opportunities. In many cases, U.S. \nmanufacturers cannot sell to foreign customers unless they have local \nplants in those foreign countries. For example, under the Canadian auto \npact, United States companies must manufacture in Canada to export into \nthe Canadian market. Without United States operations in Canada, the \nUnited States would lose the current $44 billion of sales in Canada. \nWere that to happen, the consequences to America would be serious \nindeed--not only in terms of economic damage, but in terms of lost jobs \n--American jobs--as well.\n  Another misperception is that American companies move their \noperations overseas so that they can procure cheap labor. Again, not \nso. Most multinational companies' foreign investments are in other \nindustrialized countries where labor costs are often higher than in the \nUnited States. In 1993, two-thirds of the assets and sales of United \nStates-controlled foreign corporations were in seven countries: the \nUnited Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, and \nSwitzerland. The average annual compensation paid by these corporations \nin 1993 was $49,005, 15 percent higher than the average $42,606 \ncompensation paid in the United States. U.S. firms do not go abroad for \ncheap labor, they go abroad because their business demands it. For \nexample, industries that rely on natural resources must develop them in \nthe geographic locations in which those resources are found.\n  This amendment also assumes that overseas operations cost U.S. jobs. \nWrong again. American operations overseas produce American exports. \nExports support and create American jobs. Consider this: The Department \nof Commerce has calculated that every $1 billion dollars in \nmanufactured exports creates--directly--14, 313 manufacturing jobs in \nthe United States Clearly, U.S. companies that have operations overseas \nare a benefit to, not a detraction from, American jobs and the American \neconomy.\n  The amendment incorrectly assumes that U.S. companies invest offshore \nto export back to the U.S. market. But a look at the facts shows the \nreverse. In 1993, 66 percent of U.S. multinational sales were within \nthe foreign company of incorporation, 23 percent of sales went to other \nforeign locations, and only 11 percent represented exports to the \nUnited States. If anything, multinationals are boosting the U.S. trade\n\n[[Page S10259]]\n\nbalance. According to 1993 Commerce Department data, U.S. \nmultinationals decrease the trade deficit by $11.5 billion per year.\n\n  I must say that it's too bad the sponsors suspect the worst motives \nin our American companies, rather than supporting them as they look for \nnew opportunities to boost the American economy and create new jobs in \nthe United States.\n  While few would disagree with the stated goals of this amendment--\npreventing U.S. job loss and encouraging U.S. competitiveness--it is \nclear that in practice this amendment would have exactly the opposite \neffect. Let's call a spade a spade. This is not a proposal to stimulate \nemployment or to strengthen America's position in the international \narena. It is a protectionist, antitrade measure that attempts to \nexploit the fears and insecurities that Americans feel today due to the \nreal degree of economic uncertainty. But the American economy is not \nbeing hurt by U.S. trade or by U.S. businesses expanding their presence \noverseas. Rather, trade and overseas investment strengthen and expand \nour economy.\n  When American businesses go overseas, it is a sign of American \neconomic strength and expanding opportunities. It means that American \ncompanies are competitive throughout the world. We should be happy to \nsee our companies doing so well, instead of fearing international \ngrowth. We are the world's economic superpower, and should be \nencouraging international development and promoting trade, not \ndiscouraging it as this amendment does.\n  The entire argument of the Senator from South Carolina can be summed \nup by one of his own lines: ``This country is going out of business.''\n  If you believe that statement, then support this amendment and every \nother protectionist idea that comes down the pike. But if you believe, \nas I do, that we are the most successful and competitive economy in the \nworld and with the most free and fair competition, vote with me and \ntable this amendment.\n  And one other point in reflection of the Senator from South Carolina: \nBoeing believes that the Chinese commercial aircraft market over the \nnext 20 years will reach $185 billion. Obviously, it will go to those \nsuppliers who will allow some of the work to be done in China. As Larry \nClarkson, Boeing's top official for international development says: \n``If we hadn't moved work to China, we wouldn't have gotten orders.''\n  I think he knows more about Boeing's business than the Senator from \nSouth Carolina--and Boeing is now hiring--in the United States.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the people of the Republic of China \ncharacterize me as the ``Senator from Boeing.'' I realize that the \nFrench airbus was competing with us, and we are proud of Boeing and we \nare proud of its products. I am a competitor and I want to see the \nUnited States win at all costs.\n  However, when we debated our textile bills and I passed one vetoed by \nPresident Carter, two vetoed by President Reagan, one vetoed by \nPresident Bush, get them to pass it, keep knocking on the door, I kept \nwatching our colleagues from the State of Washington who opposed us \nwith the free trade, and how wonderful to have trade overseas, which \nnobody denies. Everybody believes in trade. Instead of abolishing the \nCommerce Department, I am standing on this side of the aisle trying to \ndefend commerce and to defend the department and trying to defend \ntrade. But what you have to do is emphasize this flow of imports into \nthe United States and find out why.\n  Let me read from this article one little paragraph about Boeing. In \nthe article, ``The Ex-Im Files,'' by William Grieder. It was previously \nprinted in the Record:\n\n       The White House also led cheers for Boeing because Boeing \n     was also stomping its competitors in the Chinese market. In \n     1994 alone, Boeing sold 21 737s and seven 757s to various \n     Chinese airlines and obtained nearly $1 billion in Ex-Im \n     loans to finance the deals. When President Clinton hailed the \n     news, he did not mention that Boeing had agreed to consign \n     selected elements of its production work to Chinese \n     factories. The state-owned aircraft company at Xian, for \n     instance began making tail sections for the 737, work that is \n     normally done at Boeing's plant in Wichita, KS. The first \n     order for Xian was for 100 sets, but that was just the \n     beginning. In March 1996, a China news agency boasted that \n     Boeing had agreed to buy 1,500 tail sections from Chinese \n     factories, both for the 737 and the 757. The deal was \n     described as ``the biggest contract in the history of China's \n     aviation industry.''\n  Now, Mr. President, one, that is in violation of the Export-Import \nBank law. So it is not partisan guilt or liability or misunderstanding. \nThe President of the United States, hailing it under the Export-Import \nBank, is for production in the United States, not to finance production \nin China. You ask what to do, how to wake them up. ``Free trade, free \ntrade. It is wonderful for trade and you don't lose jobs and it is good \nfor the economy.'' Here are the facts. As I warned 25 years ago, or \nalmost 30 years ago, in that debate, I said, wait until it hits you.\n  Last year, to Mexico we lost 10,000 textile jobs. We said in the \nNAFTA debate that we were going to lose them. Now we know from NAFTA, \nwe have gone from a plus balance of $5 billion exports, exports, \nexports--how about the imports?--to a deficit of $15 billion. And those \nwho oppose us will admit we have lost at least 300,000 jobs.\n  Point: Boeing is having it happen to them. If you are going to lose \nyour textiles, you are going to lose your flatware, you are going to \nlose your steel industry, your manufacturers and industrial strength. \nYou are going to lose one thing we are preeminent in, airplane \nmanufacturing, and finance it in violation of the Export-Import Bank. \nThen if we haven't done anything else, I say to the Senator from North \nDakota, we have at least awakened them, given them a wakeup call for \nwhat is going on, because it's going to happen in Washington and in \nWichita, KS, where they make the wonderful planes we are so proud of. \nBut they are going to be losing the jobs. Airbus is taking over. I \nopposed the Ex-Im contract with Japan. Wait until the Japanese and \nChinese start manufacturing aircraft. Then I want to see this crowd \nhere. We will come in coveralls when we can't afford decent clothing, \nhollering ``free trade, free trade, free trade.''\n  This country is going out of business. We need to wake up. These are \nthe kinds of things to debate. Let's take that Dorgan-Hollings \namendment and vote it up, and don't say this is an amendment against \ntrade. This is just an amendment to put the foreign manufacturer on the \nsame basis as American manufacturers for American corporations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will not further delay this, with the exception of \nmaking two points. I was off the floor. My understanding is that a \ncouple of points were made in opposition to this legislation that I \nwant to respond to. One is that this would prevent an American company \nfrom establishing offshore production with which to compete against a \nforeign company that is producing offshore and selling in some foreign \ncountry. This bill doesn't affect that at all. If you are opposed to \nthis bill for that reason, smile; this bill doesn't affect that. This \nbill only affects U.S. producers who move offshore to produce for the \npurpose of sending the production back into our country. That is the \nonly purpose.\n  Second, this would be enormously complex, we are told. A wonderful \narticle was written by Lee Sheppard recently. She says something about \nthat. She wrote:\n       Complexity never seems to bother corporate tax managers \n     when it flows in their favor, such as in transfer pricing or \n     the design of nonqualified deferred compensation plans. \n     Surely no one wants to add materially to the complexity of \n     America's already complex foreign tax provisions, though no \n     one is seriously suggesting simplifying them in business's \n     favor. The Dorgan bill proposes a destination-based tax \n     liability; other provisions, like the foreign sales \n     corporation provisions, grant destination-based benefits.\n\n  My point is that those who stand up and use the corporate arguments \nbeing offered around town in ample quantities are using arguments that \nlargely don't apply to this. So, as I said previously, if you believe \nour Tax Code ought to be neutral on the question of whether you export \nAmerican jobs, just to make it neutral, then vote for this amendment. \nIf you believe we should continue doing what we are doing, subsidizing \nthe export of jobs, then vote against the amendment, and then let's\n\n[[Page S10260]]\n\nhave a further discussion at some later point. I hope Members of the \nSenate will decide to support this.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this tax amendment is not appropriate at \nthis time.\n  This appropriations bill is not a revenue bill. If this amendment \npasses, this appropriations bill will be potentially subject to a blue \nslip by the House. A blue slip would in effect kill this bill and the \nSenate would have to start anew.\n  Therefore, a tax amendment at this time would unnecessarily \njeopardize the appropriations process. Amending an appropriations bill \nis not the proper way to make fundamental changes to international tax \npolicy.\n  The international area is a very complex section of the Tax Code. No \none is happy when certain companies move abroad and manufacture \nproducts that are sold back to the United States.\n  At the same time, it is important to understand that American \ncompanies are players in the global economy and that expansion abroad \nmeans more jobs back home. In fact, by 1990, manufactured exports of \nAmerican companies with operations overseas created over 5 million jobs \nin the United States.\n  If we are to continue to provide good jobs for our citizens, it is \nimportant that we stay competitive in this emerging global economy by \nexpanding our presence abroad.\n  American companies with overseas investments have been waging a hard \nfight, but a successful one to keep exports flowing from the United \nStates.\n  American companies operating overseas also help the balance of trade \nfor the United States.\n  According to the Department of Commerce, in 1993, American companies \noperating overseas helped reduce our trade deficit by $11.5 billion.\n  A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that \nmanufacturing by foreign affiliates of American companies increases \nexports from the American parent company located in the United States.\n  This amendment attacks the tax rule known as deferral and would \nmaterially increase the cost to many American companies engaged in \nbusiness overseas.\n  This increase in costs will make it more difficult for American \ncompanies to compete with foreign manufacturers that are not subject to \nthese additional costs.\n  This amendment is based on the assumption that if companies don't \nbuild plants abroad, they will automatically build plants in the United \nStates. In fact, many companies would probably just decide not to \nexpand at all.\n  If additional production facilities are not added, American companies \nwould lose economies of scale that help them compete in the global \nmarketplace.\n  These economies are particularly crucial in the commodities business \nwhere price really matters.\n  American companies would also be hurt in their efforts to expand in \nforeign markets.\n  Our companies are motivated to invest abroad in order to penetrate \nmarkets otherwise commercially inaccessible to American firms and then \nexpand that market share.\n  The absence of American companies abroad would limit our ability to \nsell to foreign customers.\n  There is a positive relationship between investment abroad and \ndomestic expansion.\n  Leading American corporations operating in both the United States and \nabroad have expanded their employment and sales in the United States, \ntheir investments in the United States, and their exports from the \nUnited States at substantially faster rates than industry generally. \nDuring the 1980's, American exporting companies had a better record on \nemployment than the typical large American manufacturing firm.\n  The contention that American manufacturing companies are harming our \neconomy by shifting jobs abroad and importing cheaper products into the \nUnited States simply does not bear up under scrutiny.\n  Rather, the exact opposite is true. Investment abroad by American \nexporting companies provides the platform for growth in exports and \ncreates jobs in the United States.\n  Overall, this amendment would hurt our economy. It would decrease the \nactivities of domestic exporters and decrease jobs in the United \nStates.\n  This misguided amendment would give foreign-owned companies a huge \ncompetitive advantage and help them provide economic and job benefits \nfor their home countries at the expense of the United States.\n  We do not need to adopt legislation that hurts companies who go \nabroad for the legitimate purpose of becoming competitive in the \ninternational market.\n  Overall, this area is one of extreme complexity and of greatest \nimportance to our economy and the creation of jobs in America.\n  The major international tax policy changes which would result from \nthis amendment are within the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. It would be inappropriate and dangerous for such significant \nchanges to the Tax Code to be made piecemeal on the Senate floor.\n  As I have stated in the past, the Finance Committee will be holding \nhearings to look at the international area and the kind of issues that \nare raised by this amendment.\n  For these reasons, I must respectfully oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee is opposed to the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota. \nIn his statement, he raises several important points that I want to \nshare with you right now. The most important is that this amendment, \nthe Dorgan amendment, if accepted, would potentially subject the entire \nbill, including funding for drug enforcement, law enforcement, to a \nblue slip. This would effectively kill the entire bill and, with it, \nfunding for critical priorities such as the drug czar, drug \nenforcement, Customs, border guards, ATF, Secret Service, White House, \nIRS, civil service pensions, and so forth.\n  The Senator from North Dakota raises an important issue, and it ought \nto be debated and considered by the appropriate committee at the \nappropriate time. I don't believe this is the right time. It is \nmisplaced here and it threatens to jeopardize our entire bill today. I \nnote that the House, for the record, has blue-slipped less blatant \nattempts to raise revenues and change tax policy. Some of you will \nrecall that 2 years ago the Senate adopted an amendment with regard to \ntaxes on diesel fuel. It passed overwhelmingly here in this body, and \nit had strong support in the House at that time, including from the \nthen-chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Yet, because of the \nconstitutional issue, he chose to utilize the blue-slip procedure over \nthere and the Treasury bill was sent back to the Senate. In effect, had \nthe Senate not adopted separate legislation striking that provision, \nthe House would have had to begin the process of drafting and moving \nthe necessary appropriations bill all over again.\n  I don't believe that is what we want to happen here. I don't believe \nwe can afford such a procedure. Our Nation's law enforcement people, \nMr. President, cannot afford such a procedure. Our Nation's drug policy \nand funding for that policy cannot afford such a procedure. This \ncountry's civil servants, who rely on this bill every year to fund \ntheir pensions and disabilities, cannot afford such a procedure here. I \ncannot stress enough this afternoon the important funding in this bill \n--and most of you are aware of this--which this amendment would \njeopardize.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have cosponsored and voted for this \namendment in the past, but the fact this is a tax issue put on an \nappropriation bill has caused me some concern. The Senator from \nAlabama, the chairman, is quite right. In this instance, as a \nconsequence of the revenue issue, we risk having this whole thing sent \nback over to us. Otherwise, I would be supporting the Senator from \nNorth Dakota without any reservations. I urge colleagues to consider \nthe procedural issue here and, when Senator Shelby of Alabama so moves, \nkeep this concern in mind.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, to reassert this amendment raises \nconstitutional questions with regard to raising revenue, which we are \nall familiar with. For these reasons I move to table the amendment, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S10261]]\n\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Alabama to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from North Dakota. On this question, the yeas and nays were \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] is \nabsent because of illness in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 58, nays 41, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 282 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--58\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Frahm\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n\n                                NAYS--41\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Pell\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Smith\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Pryor\n       \n  The motion to lay on the table amendment No. 5223 was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask unanimous concept to add Senators Snowe and \nPressler as cosponsors to Amendment 5232 regarding IRS reorganization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5206\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment No. 5206, \nthe Wyden amendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the Wyden amendment contains direct \nspending and revenue legislation which would increase the deficit by \n$85 million for the period 2002 through 2006.\n  At this point, I raise a point of order, pursuant to section 202 of \nHouse Concurrent Resolution 67, the concurrent resolution of the budget \nfor the fiscal year 1996. I raise the budget point of order.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I move to waive the point of order and ask for the yeas \nand nays on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on my \namendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is debatable.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama is raising a point \nof order on a revenue issue that simply does not apply to this \namendment. I believe the Senator from Alabama is talking about a \nCongressional Budget Office report that was done on the House \nlegislation on this matter, and I would just like to inform my \ncolleagues that this amendment contains a change from the House \nlegislation, a change that was added at the direct request of a number \nof managed care organizations, that deals with this question of \nrevenue.\n  If I could briefly engage the Senator from Alabama on this matter? \nThe Senator from Alabama, I know, is trying to juggle a number of \nmatters, but I would like to ask the Senator from Alabama, does he have \na Congressional Budget Office report at this time that specifically \ncites this revenue projection on my amendment which is pending before \nthe Senate?\n  Mr. SHELBY. If the Senator from Oregon will yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SHELBY. We have an oral statement from the Budget Committee staff \nthat this violates the concurrent resolution and will cost $85 million. \nThey scored it that way.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama told me that he \ndoes not have an official report from the Congressional Budget Office \nwith respect to revenue on it. The Senator has said that the majority \nstaff projects that it will cost $85 million.\n  Mr. SHELBY. If the Senator from Oregon will yield for a correction?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SHELBY. The CBO, not the majority staff, is where this number \ncomes from, $85 million that is a violation of the rule. Not the \nmajority staff but the Congressional Budget Office itself.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If the chairman of the subcommittee would provide me a \ncopy of that, I would very much like to see that. Because the fact is, \nand let us go to the discussion of this matter, this has nothing to do \nwith the Federal budget. What I am seeking to do is to make sure that \nmanaged care plans, the fastest growing part of American health care \ntoday, are not allowed to impose gag rules that impede patients from \ngetting all the information that they need with respect to medical \nservices and medical treatments.\n  I come, Mr. President, from a part of the country that has pioneered \nmanaged care. The Portland metropolitan area that I represented, first \nin the House and now as a Senator, has the highest concentration of \nmanaged care in our country. We have seen good managed care, and there \nis plenty of it in Oregon.\n  Unfortunately, there are managed care plans that have cut corners and \nthat have kept a patient from a full range of those who provide \nnecessary services. There are plans in the country where there have \nbeen oral communications where a plan says to a particular provider: \n``We're watching the number of referrals that you are making out of the \nnetwork. We don't want you to refer to that particular specialist.''\n  This is going on in our country. It is not right, and that is what \nthis issue is all about. This is not a budget issue, I say to my \ncolleagues. This is a matter of right and wrong. This is a matter of \nwhether you are going to stand up for consumers, stand on the side of \npatients, or whether you are going to see those gag rules that keep \npatients from getting the information that they need and deserve.\n  Mr. President, the preamble of the Hippocratic oath, which guides so \nmuch of American health care, is a statement to physicians: ``First, do \nno harm.''\n  The message of these gag restrictions, these gag clauses that we are \nseeing in managed care plans all across the country is not ``First, do \nno harm.'' Their message is, ``First, support the bottom line.'' That \nis the issue that we are debating. That is not good health care. That \nis certainly not good managed care.\n  Several months ago, the Washington Post cited a startling example \ninvolving the Mid-Atlantic Medical Services health plan, a large \nWashington metro area provider. This plan wrote a letter to network \npractitioners informing them that ``effective immediately, all \nreferrals from (the plan) to specialists may be for only one visit.'' \nAnd in bold type, the letter stated: ``We are terminating the contracts \nof physicians and affiliates who fail to meet the performance patterns \nfor their speciality.''\n  That is the kind of gag rule, that is the kind of constraint that is \nbeing imposed on patients in the American health care system today by \nsome managed care plans. Certainly, not all the managed care plans, and \nit is certainly not representative of what we are seeing in Oregon, but \nit is happening across the country. We have even seen it in a State \nlike mine that has good managed care, and this is a bad deal for \npatients all around.\n  First, patients end up not getting the kind of health care that they \nneed.\n  Second, the plan may restrict the provider, the physician, from \ninforming\n\n[[Page S10262]]\n\nthe patient about referral restrictions so that the patient doesn't \neven know that they are being medically shortchanged via the plan's \npolicy.\n  So what you have, stemming from the gag clauses, is a situation where \nour patients are in the dark in the fastest growing sector of American \nhealth care. These gag clauses keep the patients from even knowing, \nfrom even being in a position to understand that they are being \nmedically shortchanged via a plan's policy.\n  Let me mention a couple of providers who have brought this to my \nattention in Oregon.\n  One orthopedic surgeon faced a situation where his managed care plan \ndemanded he diagnose problems in patients apart from the ones for which \nthey were referred. He, in effect, was told he had to keep his mouth \nshut and instead re-refer those folks back to their primary care \nphysician.\n\n  This physician wrote me: ``This is extremely disappointing to \npatients, as you might imagine. This requires more visits on their part \nto their primary care physician and then back to me, which is extremely \ninefficient.''\n  Another physician, a family practitioner in a rural part of the \nState, wrote that antigag legislation was needed because ``when a \nphysician recommends medical treatment for a patient and a plan denies \ncoverage for that treatment, patients and physicians need an effective \nmechanism to challenge the plan.''\n  So what we find is that these kinds of communications, communication \nbetween a plan and a provider, such as an oral communication, are \ngetting in the way of the doctor-patient relationship, and that is why \nconsumer groups and provider groups all across this country are up in \narms and have weighed in on behalf of this particular amendment.\n  There are some protections. A handful of States do offer some \nprotections for the patient, but they vary widely from State to State. \nSo that is why I bring this matter to the Senate's attention.\n  Senator Kennedy joins me in this effort to set a national standard \nfor what has become a national problem, but I would like to emphasize \nhow bipartisan this effort is. Senators need to understand that if they \nvote against my amendment, they are essentially voting against the \namendment that Senator Helms has also filed. It is a little bit \ndifferent. It has not been formally addressed in the Senate, but it is \nessentially what Senator Helms has sought.\n  In the House, Dr. Greg Ganske, a Republican, a physician, has done \nyeoman work on this matter, with Congressman Ed Markey of \nMassachusetts, a Democrat. They have held voluminous hearings in the \nHouse where this has been a problem documented on the record.\n  The Commerce Committee dealt with this issue--I would like all my \ncolleagues to know this, as we move to a vote on this matter--the House \nCommerce Committee dealt with this on a unanimous basis, on a \nbipartisan unanimous basis, and I simply want my colleagues to know \nthat while Senator Kennedy joins me formally in this effort, Senator \nHelms has filed what amounts to almost an identical amendment to what I \noffer today.\n  Dr. Ganske and Ed Markey, on a bipartisan basis in the House, have \nengineered committee approval of it, so this is not a partisan issue \nthat comes before the Senate today.\n  This amendment is rifle-shot legislation prohibiting only gag \nprovisions in contracts or in a pattern of oral communications between \nplans and practitioners which would limit discussion of a patient's \nphysical or mental condition or treatment options.\n  I want to emphasize that health plans would still be able to protect \nand enforce provisions involving all other aspects of their \nrelationships with practitioners, including confidentiality and \nproprietary business information. The reason that is important, Mr. \nPresident, is obviously it is not in the interest of the American \npeople or this body to have the U.S. Senate fishing about in the \nproprietary records of health plans.\n  What this is all about is making sure that patients get information \nabout health services, about their physical or mental condition, about \ntreatment options. They deserve the right to information about health \nservices and not face these gag clauses that keep them from getting the \ninformation that they deserve.\n\n  I want my colleagues to know that I have worked hard with leaders in \nthe managed care community, as well as practitioners and consumer \nadvocates in crafting this legislation. The amendment specifies that \nState laws which meet or exceed the Federal standard set out here would \nnot be preempted by Federal law.\n  The bill has been endorsed by a wide variety of provider groups, \nphysician groups, as well as by consumer organizations. The \nendorsements for this particular amendment include the Association of \nAmerican Physicians and Surgeons, the American Association of Retired \nPersons, the Center for Patient Advocacy, Citizen Action, the Consumers \nUnion, the American College of Emergency Physicians, and a number of \nother organizations.\n  Here is what the Association of American Physicians had to say with \nrespect to this amendment. They said:\n\n       Restrictions on communication with our patients not only \n     undermine quality of care, but are a blatant violation of the \n     Hippocratic oath. Prohibition of gag rules is a crucial step \n     toward protecting patients.\n\n  The Center for Patient Advocacy said:\n\n       It has become common for insurers to incorporate clauses or \n     policies into providers' contracts that restrict their \n     ability to communicate with their patients. Such gag clauses \n     seriously threaten the quality of care for American patients.\n\n  So what we have, Mr. President, and colleagues, is essentially a \npattern across the country with these gag rules that turns the \nHippocratic oath on its head. A Hippocratic oath that tells physicians, \n``First, do no harm,'' has become all too often, ``First, think about \nthe bottom line.''\n  So I am very hopeful that on a bipartisan basis the Senate will pass, \nhopefully without opposition, my amendment. As I say, a vote against my \namendment is essentially a vote against what Senator Helms has filed in \nthis body. It is a vote against what Dr. Ganske has sought to do in the \nHouse. And most importantly, it is a vote against patients and \nconsumers all across the country.\n  If you vote against this amendment today, which will undoubtedly be \nthe only chance the Senate gets to go on record on it in this session, \nthen you are sending a message to managed care plans across the country \nthat if you want to stiff the patients, if you want to stiff those who \nare vulnerable and those who need health care in America, it is all \nright. You can keep from them information about their physical and \nmental options and alternatives. You can keep information from them \nabout treatment and kinds of services. I cannot believe that is what \nthe U.S. Senate would want to do.\n  I think what the U.S. Senate would want to do is what Senator Helms \nhas sought to do, what Dr. Ganske has sought to do, what Congressman \nMarkey and Senator Kennedy and I have sought to do, and that is to \nstand up for the rights of the patients.\n  So I am hopeful that this will be supported widely by Senators today. \nWe should not let these gag rules between plans and an individual \nphysician get in the way of the sacred doctor-patient relationship. \nThese plans are the fastest growing part of American health care today. \nAnd we ought to go on record as being on the side of patients, as being \non the side of the vast majority of doctors and providers in this \ncountry who want their patients to know all their treatment options, \nall the services that are available to them. I hope that Senators on a \nbipartisan basis will support this effort.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I want to commend Senator \nWyden for providing leadership in this very, very important area of \nhealth policy. I welcome the opportunity to join with him on an issue \nthat really affects, in a very significant and important way, the \nquality of health care that is being practiced in this country. I \ncommend him and others who have been involved with this legislation.\n  I would like to address the Senate just very briefly on this issue \nand also make a comment about the procedural situation that we find \nourselves in at the present time.\n  As Senator Wyden has pointed out, one of the most dramatic changes in\n\n[[Page S10263]]\n\nthe health care system in recent years has been the growth of managed \ncare programs. In many ways, this is a positive development. Managed \ncare offers the opportunity to extend the best medical practices to all \nmedical practice, to emphasize health maintenance and to provide more \ncoordinated care. Numerous studies have found that managed care \ncompares favorably with the fee-for-service medicine on a variety of \ndifferent quality measures.\n  Many HMO's have made vigorous efforts to improve the quality of care, \nto gather and use systematic data to improve clinical decisionmaking \nand assure an appropriate mix of primary and specialty care. But the \nsame financial incentives that can lead HMO's and other managed care \nproviders to practice more cost-effective medicine also can lead to \nundertreatment or inappropriate restrictions on specialty care, \nexpensive treatments, and new treatments.\n  In recent months, the spate of critical articles in the press has \nsuggested that too many managed care plans place the bottom line ahead \nof their patients' well-being--and are pressuring physicians in their \nnetworks to do the same. So these abuses include failure to inform the \npatients of particular treatment options; excessive barriers to reduce \nreferrals to specialists for evaluation and treatment; unwillingness to \norder appropriate diagnostic tests; and reluctance to pay for \npotentially life-saving treatment. In some cases, these failures have \nhad tragic consequences.\n  In the long run, the most effective means of assuring quality in \nmanaged care is for the industry itself to make sure that quality is \nalways a top priority. I am encouraged by the industry's recent \ndevelopment of a philosophy of care that sets out ethical principles \nfor its members, by the growing trend toward accreditation, and by \nincreasingly widespread use of standardized quality assessment \nmeasures. But I also believe that basic Federal regulations to assure \nthat every plan meets at least minimum standards is necessary.\n  So, with this amendment, the Senate has a chance to go firmly on \nrecord against a truly flagrant practice--the use of gag rules to keep \nphysicians from informing patients of all their treatment options in \nmaking their best professional recommendations.\n  Gag rules take a number of forms. This amendment targets the most \nabusive and most inappropriate type of gag rule: gag rules that forbid \nphysicians to discuss all treatment options with the patient and make \nthe best possible professional recommendation, even if that \nrecommendation is for a non-covered service or could be construed to \ndisparage the plan for not covering it.\n  Our amendment forbids plans from prohibiting or restricting any \nmedical communication with a patient with respect to the patient's \nphysical or mental condition or treatment options. This is a basic rule \nwhich everyone endorses in theory but which has been violated in \npractice. The standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of \nHealth Care Organizations requires that ``Physicians cannot be \nrestricted from sharing treatment options with their patients, whether \nor not the options are covered by the plan.''\n  Dr. John Ludden of the Harvard Community Health Plan, testifying for \nthe American Association of Health Plans, has said: ``The AAHP firmly \nbelieves that there should be open communications between health \nprofessionals and their patients about health status, medical \nconditions, and treatment options.''\n  Legislation similar to this amendment passed the House Commerce \nCommittee on a unanimous bipartisan vote. President Clinton has \nstrongly endorsed the proposal.\n  The congressional session is drawing to a close. Today the Senate has \nthe opportunity to act to protect patients across the country from \nthese abusive gag rules, and I urge the Senate to approve the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I just want to make a very brief comment about this \npoint of order. Mr. President, this making of a point of order is an \nabuse of the budget system. Basically, what we are talking about, for \nthose that are trying to hide behind the point of order, is that the \ncosts that are affected come from the most egregious abuses in the \nhealth care system by systems which are shortchanging and endangering \nthe health of the American people.\n  You cannot hide behind this procedural vote on this issue, Mr. \nPresident. You just cannot hide. This is not about involving additional \nburdens or costs to the Federal Government. What you are basically \ntalking about is providing protections to the sleaziest operators in \nthis country that are endangering the health of the American people, \nand every consumer will know it.\n  Make no mistake about it. Make no mistake about it. We are talking \nabout trying to get the best health care. That means that the best \ninformation that the best doctors in this country can provide ought to \nbe provided to patients. Patients deserve to have that information.\n  We are seeing an abuse of the budgetary system by raising the point \nof order on this particular measure. Make no mistake about it, every \nconsumer is going to know what this is about. This is not about \nprocedure; this is about substance. This is about substance. You can \nhave a technical point of order, but it is about substance, about \nquality of health.\n\n  We only have the opportunity to offer it on this particular measure. \nI commend Senator Wyden for providing the initiative. We all ought to \nbe very clear about what is involved in a technical point of order. It \nis an abuse of the budget system in every sense of the word. It \ninvolves the most important issue regarding health and that is the \nquality of health for American consumers.\n  The idea that the Senate, after we have had unanimous and bipartisan \nsupport over in the House of Representatives, is going to try and hide \nunder a technical amendment, will be a shameful day here in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I say, first, this is not an effort to \nhide behind a technical point of order. I care just as much as the \nSenator from Massachusetts or the Senator from Oregon about the quality \nof health care. We all do in this Chamber. There is a process, \nunfortunately--or fortunately--under which we operate around. That \nprocess requires us to do some things to assure that issues are \nconsidered with some thoroughness, and I believe that is appropriate.\n  I agree in many ways, in all ways, actually, on the principle to \nwhich the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Massachusetts are \nspeaking. Patients should have access to complete and accurate \ninformation regarding their health care. None of us here in this \nChamber disagree with that concept, or with the concept that doctors \nshould be allowed to share that information with their patients. \nPatients' communications with their doctor should be protected. I think \nwe would all feel this is a prime concern. It is a vital part of the \nhealth care process.\n  I have a great deal of sympathy for the motivations behind the \namendment that is offered by Senators Wyden and Kennedy. However, I \nbelieve it would simply be irresponsible to approve it in the absence \nof any review or discussion of its provisions at any level in the U.S. \nSenate. The legislation upon which the amendment is based was \nintroduced barely a month ago on July 31 and no committee hearings have \nbeen held.\n  I have visited with Senator Wyden because, as chairman of the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee, I have wanted to hold hearings on this \nlegislation since we came back from the August recess. It has not been \npossible to find a time that we were able to put a hearing together. \nThat does not mean that it is not going to happen, and certainly it \nshould be a priority of the next Congress. However, just as so often \nhappens here when we begin to run out of time, we want to add \neverything that we can to the appropriations bills that are moving.\n  In this instance, as has been pointed out, a similar proposal was \napproved by the Commerce Committee in the House of Representatives. It \nis a bipartisan measure. There is nothing partisan about this. It \npassed unanimously in committee. It has not been considered by the full \nHouse of Representatives. I believe that, when we are looking at \naspects of a very important and yet complex piece of legislation, we do \nhave to go through the procedures and processes that are part of our \noperation here, whether we want to or not.\n  It certainly is not unprecedented to have extraneous amendments \noffered at the last minute. However, the Senate's being asked to decide \na highly\n\n[[Page S10264]]\n\ncomplex issue without the benefit of any review at all is, I suggest, \nMr. President, a mistake. It is a mistake. Our procedures may delay \nconsideration of legislation we support, but it protects us from \nlegislation that we do not support as well. We need to be able to \nunderstand what a piece of legislation is all about. For example, we \nare not sure what CBO's scoring of this amendment is. It might not be \nimportant, but it is a requirement we have scoring around here. We have \nthat requirement so we can better understand the budgetary consequences \nof our actions, and--generally--we are required to provide offsets for \nspending increases.\n  As I mentioned earlier and as Senator Wyden pointed out, the House \nCommerce Committee has considered this issue and has held extensive \nhearings. I have visited with Congressman Ganske myself, and I have \nhigh regard for the dedication that he has given to this issue and for \nthe time that he has spent with it. His being a doctor, I have high \nregard for his understanding of the issue. I have great interest in his \nwork and feel that he is to be commended for moving forward the \ndiscussion to the point that it has progressed.\n  However, I point out that even the authors of the amendment before \nthe Senate acknowledge that the work of the House committee is not the \nfinal word, as several provisions of the amendment depart from the \nlanguage approved by the House committee. The reason that we have \ncommittees in the Senate and the reason that each one of us spends, or \nshould spend, so many hours in committee work is to lend some degree of \nthought and expertise to public policy issues.\n  It can be very frustrating when legislation does not move forward at \nthe pace we would like to see. Nevertheless, the committee system is \none of the processes, and perhaps breaks, that we have here, Mr. \nPresident. That system enables us to turn out, one would hope, a \nfinished product where we understand what the language means and which \navoids the unintended consequences of the initial language proposed.\n  In the course of this work, I think we find that very little is as \nsimple as it may seem at first glance. We also find our initial \nsolutions can spawn problems just as serious as those we set out to \naddress. Such solutions are inevitably refined and improved as \nadditional information is gathered.\n  In an area as complex and dynamic as managed care, we need to give \nserious thought and deliberation before launching the Federal \nGovernment into the middle of private contractual arrangements. The \namendment is intended to address an important issue regarding quality \nhealth care, and it is an important issue. But good intentions are not \nsufficient; we need to understand the consequences of the language we \nuse and the actions we take.\n  In fact, President Clinton himself has acknowledged the need for a \ncloser examination of managed care issues with his recent announcement \nof his plans to establish the National Commission on Health Care \nQuality.\n  As I stated when I began speaking, I am not arguing that this issue \nshould be ignored. In fact, I think it is a very important issue for us \nto look at and one of the next important steps in any of our health \ncare debates. It is a legitimate concern.\n  It is for this reason I intend to propose an amendment calling for \naction in this area early next year after there has been an opportunity \nto review the full ramifications of the solution proposed by the \nSenator from Oregon. A vote ``no'' on this motion, Mr. President, does \nnot mean that we do not care. A vote ``no'' is not hiding behind some \nprocedural arrangement. A vote ``no'' is simply saying we have a \nprocess that we should make work as intended in order to give us the \nbest end result on an issue that we all care deeply about and that I \nbelieve should be of prime concern.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think this is a fundamental issue and \nthat we ought to address it now.\n  Mr. President, I come from a long medical tradition on my mother's \nside of the family. My grandfather and virtually all of his relatives \nwere doctors. My grandfather was a pioneer surgeon in North Dakota and \nwas the chief of staff of our local hospital. In many ways, I grew up \nin a medical family.\n  The notion that we would have a gag rule on doctors and what they can \ntell their patients is anathema to those who are medical professionals. \nIt is not limited to medical professionals. I think it is anathema to \nany American. The notion that a doctor, by contract, is precluded from \nsharing certain information with a patient about that patient's illness \nis unconscionable--unconscionable.\n  What kind of system do we have when a doctor can be precluded from \ntelling a patient about treatment options, about referral options in \nAmerica?\n  Mr. President, I met yesterday with medical professionals from my \nState. I do not use the English language lightly. I said that I believe \nthese gag rules are immoral, and I do believe it is immoral, Mr. \nPresident, to say to a doctor, ``You are restricted and limited in what \nyou can say about what you know about a patient's options.'' You know, \nit sounds to me like another country and another time. Maybe that would \ngo over in the Soviet Union. Maybe that would have gone over in Germany \nin the thirties. This is America in the nineties. No doctor should be \nprecluded from discussing with a patient the treatment options of that \npatient. That is outrageous.\n  Mr. President, we may not be able to solve this matter completely in \nthe days that remain in this session, but we can start, and we should \nstart, and we have the opportunity in this amendment. This amendment \nhas been carefully crafted. The House has gone over it, the medical \ncommunity has gone over it, some of the best minds of the U.S. Senate \nhave gone over it, and they have crafted an amendment that is a rifle \nshot. It says very clearly what cannot be gagged, what communications \nought to be able to freely flow between a patient and the person who is \nresponsible for that patient's care.\n  Mr. President, we ought to pass this amendment. We ought to pass this \namendment. I can't think of a single good reason why this amendment \nought to be stopped. I can just say that I have discussed this with \npeople in my home State on my most recent trip home. They are just \nmystified how, in America, you can have a circumstance in which a \ndoctor is precluded and prevented from talking to their patients about \ntreatment options that are available to them. Well, that is just beyond \ndescription in terms of the morality of the circumstance.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Wyden for coming forward \nwith this amendment at this time. I would commend anybody on the other \nside of the aisle--and I would do it publicly--if they came forward \nwith this amendment, because I feel that strongly about it. This is \nsomething we ought to pass. It ought to be bipartisan. There ought not \nto be a whiff of partisanship about it. I thank my colleague from \nOregon, Senator Wyden, for doing, I think, a superb job in bringing \nthis amendment to the attention of the body. This ought to pass 100-0. \nI don't care about points of order and all the rest. I don't know \nwhether people are hiding behind it or not. Frankly, I just think it is \ninappropriate in this circumstance to be talking about a point of order \nwith respect to an amendment that is so totally and fully justified.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleague, Senator Wyden, for authoring \nthis amendment and bringing it to our attention. I hope this amendment \npasses 100-0 on the floor of the U.S. Senate. That would send a very \ngood message across this country about what is acceptable and what is \nnot acceptable.\n  I will just add this final point. If this is the direction that we \nare going to go in with health care in America, there is going to be an \nenormous reaction in this country. I predict that today. If this is the \ndirection we are going to go in, in which patients are denied \ninformation about their coverage options, then we have big trouble in \nthis country. We can address it right here today and pass this \namendment, and we should.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will speak to this in a second.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the consideration \nof the committee amendment on page 80 regarding abortion funding there \nbe 1 hour of debate prior to a motion to table, to be equally divided \nbetween\n\n[[Page S10265]]\n\nSenators Nickles and Boxer, and that no other action occur prior to the \nmotion to table. This has been cleared with Senator Kerrey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, CBO has told staff from both sides of the \naisle, Republicans and Democrats, that the scoring of this amendment is \nthe same as the scoring of the Ganske bill in the House, and they will \nbe providing a written confirmation on this scoring to both of our \nstaffs immediately. It could be imminent. We will present it and insert \nit into the Record as soon as we get it from CBO. It is going to be the \nsame thing. CBO says to us that it is going to cost $85 million and it \nviolates the Budget Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just respond very briefly to two \npoints. One is about the consideration of this amendment. I say to my \nfriend and colleague from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, with all respect, \nwe did not have any hearings on the mental health provision that we \njust passed here 82 to 15, the Domenici-Wellstone amendment. We didn't \nhave any hearings in our committee on that particular issue. We did not \nhave any on the Lodine patent extension, which was added by some of our \nmajority Members to the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. That would have been \nsomething we should have had a good deal of hearings on. We did not \nhave any on the Mediguide amendment that was added in the agricultural \nappropriations bill. Hearings would have been useful. Those affect \nconsumer information as well. So the fact of the matter is, on this \nissue, it has been reviewed in detail in hearings in the House of \nRepresentatives. It is a simple concept, and there is absolutely \nadequate justification.\n  Finally, Mr. President, on the budget item--and we all have the \nbudget items here--it is my understanding that, for 1997, 1998, 1999, \n2000, and 2001, the items which are listed in the budget, that may be \nthe potential cost, can be assumed within the range of differences and \nestimates within the Budget Committee. What it is not is in the year \n2002. Do you know what that figure is that we are going to risk denying \nAmerican consumers and patients information that is vital to their \nhealth? It is $15 million. It is $15 million. Do you know how the \nBudget Committee gets that? They say, well, when patients actually find \nout that there is a better treatment for their illness, what they are \ngoing to do is get the better treatment for their illness, which means \nthat they may very well get less wages because if they increase the \ncost of their health insurance, they are going to get less wages. That \nis the estimate. That is going to be the result--$15 million in the \nyear 2002.\n  We are being asked now to allow the gag rule on doctors in this \ncountry to continue. This is a result of the pressure of the insurance \ncompany, and you are trying to tell us that this is a budget item, that \nthis is a matter of budget process and procedure, in order to maintain \nthe integrity of the Federal budget? It is an excuse, and it is an \nabuse of the budget process. It is the worst kind of abuse, because by \ndenying this kind of information to patients, what we are doing is \nusing the budget process as a way to provide an out for the sleaziest \noperators and at the same time, endangering the health of the American \npeople. That is absolutely wrong. It was never intended in any debate \nor discussion of the Budget rules. This is a matter of substance.\n  I look forward to supporting the Wyden amendment and, again, I \ncommend him for his leadership in bringing this extremely important \nmeasure to the Senate floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first, I express my thanks to Senator \nKennedy. He has done yeoman work on so many health issues over the \nyears. He has just been so helpful to me as a new Member of the Senate. \nI thank him for all of his help and that of his staff in preparing this \namendment.\n  I think it is clear, Mr. President, that this amendment is not some \nsort of exotic animal that has just wandered onto the floor of the U.S. \nSenate to be considered, as if the Members have no awareness of what \nthis issue is all about.\n  This issue has been the subject of extensive hearings in the House of \nRepresentatives. This issue has been all over the news media across the \ncountry. Suffice it to say that virtually every Member of this body has \nheard from constituents and from providers at home about this \nparticular issue. I know that virtually every time I am home--I come \nfrom a part of the country which has some of the very best managed care \nin the Nation--that I hear from patients and consumers about this \nparticular issue.\n  It really comes down to a question of whether we are going to keep \nfaith with the Hippocratic oath of doing no harm to patients, making \nsure they have information about the various treatments and services \nthat are essential to them, or to turn that Hippocratic oath on its \nhead and in effect say the first obligations are to the bottom line.\n  This amendment is rifle-shot legislation. It prohibits only gag \nprovisions in contracts that relate to patient care. It goes only to \nthe question of whether or not patients are going to be able to get \nfull and complete information about their physical and mental condition \nand about the treatment options that are available to them. It is not \ngoing to interfere with proprietary matters. It is not going to allow \nfishing expeditions into proprietary business information that ought to \nbe the property of the health maintenance organizations. It goes just \nto the question of whether patients have a right to know.\n  Some may say now is not the time; that maybe next session it can be \ntaken up. I would ask that one not substitute this kind of discussion \nof maybe tomorrow or maybe next year for what is simple justice and \ncommon sense for medical patients in the fastest growing sector of \nAmerican health care. This has not been a partisan issue. Dr. Ganske, a \nRepublican, a physician on the House side, has done superb work along \nwith Congressman Markey, a Democrat.\n  I have noted that Senator Helms has filed an amendment which is very \nsimilar to the one that I will be seeking a vote on in a few moments. \nBut there is a question, it seems to me, of consumer justice, of the \npatient's right to know, and we should not ask those patients to wait \nany longer given the documented record of abuses and problems.\n  We know that our health care system involving billions and billions \nof dollars is now being driven by managed care. One plan after another \nin the U.S. Senate has looked to managed care as the centerpiece of \nAmerican health care as we look into the next century.\n  My view is--I come from a part of the country where there are many \ngood managed care plans--that managed care will play a big role, a \nsignificant role in delivering quality care in a cost-effective way to \nthe patients and consumers of our country. But let us not let a small \nnumber of plans--plans that have been cutting corners and have been \nfound to be cutting corners from hearings that have been held in the \nCapitol--in effect continue those consumer abuses that take a toll on \npatients across this country.\n  This is not a vote about an arcane kind of issue with respect to the \nbudget. This is a question of justice for patients, of the patient's \nright to know, and of patients needing information about the various \ntreatment options available to them.\n  I hope my colleagues will in the spirit that this has been addressed \nin the House pass this with a bipartisan and significant vote. That is \nthe way it was tackled in the House Commerce Committee. I hope we will \nsend a message today to the vast majority of patients, doctors, and \nothers who offer good medical care that we are on your side, that we \nare going to isolate those gag rules, that we are going to say that is \nnot what we want American health care to look like in the 21st century, \nand that we would vote today to ban these insidious, unconscionable gag \nrules that restrict the right of medical patients in our country to \nknow about essential services.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have already been ordered, \nthe Chair notes.\n\n[[Page S10266]]\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly in order to \nmention to the Senator from Oregon that he has talked a couple of times \nabout the language of the Senator from North Carolina, Senator Helms. I \njust visited with Senator Helms to ask him what he thought of the \nprovision before us. He pointed out that his language is much more \nnarrowly drawn. It applies only to the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan and includes some specific criteria. He has some \ndifficulty believing that we should expand it further without \nunderstanding more of the ramifications.\n  I, like everyone else, have great sympathy for what Senator Wyden has \nbeen wanting to accomplish, and what Congressman Ganske wants to do in \nthe House. I just have to say, however, it may not be as easily done as \nwe would like to believe that it could be. That is all the more reason, \nI think, that we ought to at least have a hearing in the Senate and \ntake the legislation through the committee.\n  As I said, and as Senator Kennedy pointed out, we have considered \nsome major legislation which has not gone through the full committee \nprocess. But, in general, those have been instances in which we have \nhad some fairly extensive debate.\n  This proposal came to us without advance warning and without benefit \nof prior discussion in the committee or in the Senate. We are simply \nnot prepared to look at language regarding contractual arrangements in \nthe private sector and make wise decisions about it overnight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we have debated this for quite awhile \ntoday, and also, as some of you recall, fairly extensively last night.\n  Mr. President, this is not a Treasury appropriations issue that is \nbefore us. This debate has addressed the issue, and adopted an \namendment. The amendment would cause the committee to find $85 million \nin the conference to stay within our allocation. We would have to take \nfunds from the accounts that I spoke about earlier. The bill funds law \nenforcement, the IRS, and other basic Government functions, such as the \nSecret Service, and GSA. This bill does not come close to the \nPresident's budget request. The administration would like more money in \nthis bill for law enforcement and others, not less.\n  This amendment would further reduce those programs, if it were \nadopted, $85 million. The Senator's amendment may be a worthy one, and \nprobably is a worthy one, but the committee has an obligation, I \nbelieve, to fund the basic Government functions before the committee \nthat we have jurisdiction over, and the Wyden amendment undermines the \ncommittee's ability to do so.\n  I hope that the Senate will not waive the Budget Act.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Senator from Indiana asked me if he \ncould speak. We are moving to a vote. He has a clarification question. \nI was seeking the floor to give him an opportunity to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for \nyielding for the purposes of a question.\n  I would like to ask the sponsor of the amendment, Senator Wyden from \nOregon, a question and see if I can get a clarification. I have just \nbeen advised that the amendment that he has offered preempts current \nState law; our current law. Is that correct?\n  Mr. WYDEN. No, that is not correct. In fact, we specifically protect \nthe rights of States to go further.\n  Mr. COATS. What if States decide to go a little more narrow?\n  Mr. WYDEN. This is in fact a national standard. Yes, we do say--\nbecause managed care plans, many of them, operate in more than one \nState, we have said, you bet, we have a national problem. It is a \nnational standard. But there are a small number of States that have \ndealt with this in a thoughtful kind of way. We specifically protect \nthose States.\n  Mr. COATS. That is my dilemma because Indiana has, in my opinion, \ndealt with it in a thoughtful way. In some instances, the statute that \nwe have is broader than the amendment offered by the Senator from \nOregon and therefore I would think would be acceptable. But in other \ninstances it is narrower. In other words, it is crafted to how Indiana \nbest sees the need to provide information to consumers to protect them.\n  So that I assume then the answer is that that portion of the Indiana \nconsumer protection and consumer information statute, which does not \nconform to the amendment, is preempted.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Well, the parts that protect the patient and protect \nIndiana physicians, those parts are in fact protected under my \namendment. But if there are parts of the Indiana statute that do not \nadequately protect Indiana physicians and do not adequately protect \nIndiana consumers, yes, there would be a Federal standard.\n  Mr. COATS. If the Senator will yield further, that was not directly \nmy question. Indiana has made a determination through its legislature, \nthrough its Governor, through consultation with consumer groups, \npatient groups, provider groups, about the best means of providing \ninformation and protecting consumers. And so my question is, does the \nSenator's amendment preempt those decisions on the part of Indiana \ncitizens and the Indiana legislature that do not happen to conform, \nthat would be construed by the Senator as being more narrow? In other \nwords, they might not meet all of the Senator's criteria but they \ncertainly meet the criteria that the people in our State believe \nappropriate to provide protection to patients.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If the Senator will let me respond, as the Senator knows--\nand both of us are veterans of the House Commerce Committee--not very \nmuch goes through the House Commerce Committee unanimously. Dr. Ganske \nis not known as a poster child for the anti-States rights movement. \nThis is a bill that has been worked on so as to be sensitive to the \nrights of States. What it does essentially is bring the same kind of \nconsumer protections at the Federal level that we do in a number of \nMedicare areas. The Senator and I worked, for example, in the House on \nMedicare risk contracts and the like. This does say that on certain \nmatters up to what amounts to a floor of consumer protection there \nought to be a national standard. And that is how we deal with it here. \nThat is how Dr. Ganske dealt with it in the House.\n  Mr. COATS. I think I have the Senator's answer. The Senator's \namendment does preempt those portions of Indiana law that do not \nconform with his definition of a floor or minimum standard. I believe \nour State has taken adequate steps to provide protections and \ninformation for consumers and therefore I will have to oppose the \namendment. The Senator answered my question. I do not need to know the \nhistory of what happened in the committee or whether Mr. Ganske is \nright or wrong. I am just looking out for my State of Indiana which \nmade a determination of what is best for our consumers, and we are \nvery happy in Indiana. I cannot support an amendment that preempts what \nwe have done.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. If the Senator will let me respond once more, I cannot \nimagine that Indiana State law allows these plans to gag Indiana \ndoctors. I have not reviewed the Indiana law, but I just cannot believe \nthat Indiana law does permit these kinds of gag rules. That is all we \ndo in this legislation. If the Senator is looking for a way to vote \nagainst what physician groups and patients all across this country have \nbeen calling for, so be it. I know the Senator has done a lot of good \nwork in health care. But I cannot believe that Indiana law is coming \nout in favor of these kinds of gag provisions. All we are seeking to do \nin this legislation is prevent them as well.\n  Mr. COATS. That is my last word here. I know that the Senator is very \nfamiliar with what the State of Oregon has done. The constituents of \nOregon have elected him because they feel he knows what is going on in \nthat State. It does not sound to me as if the Senator from Oregon knows \nwhat the State of Indiana has done. They elected this Senator because \nthey know I know\n\n[[Page S10267]]\n\nwhat is going on in that State. So I think it is presumptuous for the \nSenator from Oregon to say what Indiana has done is incorrect when he \ndoes not even know what it is.\n  All I am saying is I want to protect Indiana's right to make a \ndetermination of what is in the best interests of their citizens, and \nthe Senator has answered my question. He preempts that part of our law \nwhich does not conform to what he thinks is right, but obviously it has \nto reflect what we in Indiana think is right. So I thank the Senator \nfor his responses.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield to me for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, we have an hour of deliberation following \nthis vote on an abortion amendment and Members on both sides that are \nanxious for that vote to occur have asked me to expedite it in order to \nbe able to do other things. And so I think we have debated this. I will \nbe pleased to allow it to go on if I have something additionally \nconstructive, but I think people pretty well have this thing laid down.\n  Mr. President, I have not made a statement on this. I hope that \nMembers actually will vote to waive in this case. We are trying to move \nin the direction of managed care, particularly those of us who are \ntrying to work both sides of the aisle and get some agreement on \nproviding incentives in Medicare to control costs, to increase choice, \nand allow people to purchase into managed care. The CBO does not \ncalculate any savings that occur as a consequence of people liking \nmanaged care as a result of knowing that they are going to get all the \ninformation to purchase it and reduce taxpayer exposure as a \nconsequence. All they do is calculate some marginal increase in costs \nthat might occur as a result of more expensive treatments being done. \nThey offer no savings as a result of people saying we now like managed \ncare better because of what occurs.\n  This is eventually going to become law. Later on, we are going to \npass an amendment with a big vote that gives Federal employees the same \nright. They are going to have the same right that the Senator from \nOregon is now asking for all other people, especially for Medicare \npatients that are out there who are trying to ascertain whether or not \nthey want to purchase into a managed care environment. So I think \nespecially for budget reasons, CBO, with all due respect, has not \ncalculated the increased savings that will occur as a consequence of \nseniors in particular saying we now have more confidence in managed \ncare as a result of getting all the information.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to the motion \nto waive the Budget Act. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] is \nabsent because of illness in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The point of order is \nsustained.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n     Amendment No. 5235 To Committee Amendment On Page 16, Line 16\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding communications \n                 between physicians and their patients)\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment to the \ncommittee amendment and ask that it be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5235 to committee amendment on page 16, \n     line 16.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the committee amendment, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   . PROTECTION OF PATIENT COMMUNICATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the health care market is dynamic, and the rapid \n     changes seen in recent years can be expected to continue;\n       (2) the transformation of the health care market has \n     promoted the development of innovative new treatments and \n     more efficient delivery systems, but has also raised new and \n     complex health policy challenges, touching on issues such as \n     access, affordability, cost containment, and quality;\n       (3) appropriately addressing these challenges and the \n     trade-offs they involve will require thoughtful and \n     deliberate consideration by lawmakers, providers, consumers, \n     and third-party payers; and\n       (4) the Patient Communications Protection Act of 1996 (S. \n     2005, 104th Congress) was first introduced in the Senate on \n     July 31, 1996, and has not been subject to hearings or other \n     review by the Senate or any of its committees.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the \n     Senate, taking into account any relevant findings of the \n     National Commission on Health Care Quality and other public \n     and private entities with expertise in quality health care \n     service delivery, should act expeditiously in the first \n     session of the 105th Congress to schedule hearings and \n     executive session consideration of legislation designed to \n     ensure that patients be given access to all relevant \n     information concerning their health care so as to permit such \n     patients, in consultation with their physicians, to make \n     appropriate decisions regarding their health care, and that \n     the Senate should promptly consider that legislation.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, this amendment is very brief, if I may \njust explain it. It expresses the sense of the Senate regarding \ncommunications between physicians and their patients. It addresses the \nsame issue that we have just been debating. I think we have had a good \nand extensive debate. My concern with the amendment on which we just \nvoted was that its provisions had not been fully considered and had not \nbeen the subject of any hearings in the Senate. We needed to approach \nthe issue, I thought, in a more cautious way--even though there was \nstrong support for the concept behind that amendment.\n  My amendment is just saying that:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Committee on Labor \n     and Human Resources of the Senate, taking into account any \n     relevant findings of the National Commission on Health Care \n     Quality and other public and private entities with expertise \n     and quality health care service delivery, should act \n     expeditiously in the first session of the 105th Congress to \n     schedule hearings and executive session consideration of \n     legislation designed to ensure that patients be given access \n     to all relevant information concerning their health care so \n     as to permit such patients, in consultation with their \n     physicians, to make appropriate decisions regarding their \n     health care, and that the Senate should promptly consider \n     that legislation.\n\n  This amendment is consistent with the intent of the legislation \noffered by the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Massachusetts, \nbut puts the\n\n[[Page S10268]]\n\nSenate on record as supporting the use of the standard and proper \nprocedures that I think are needed to give this issue the full and \ncareful consideration it deserves.\n  Since we have had, I think, a full debate, I ask for the yeas and \nnays and for the immediate consideration of this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have not seen the sense of the Senate, \noffered by Senator Kassebaum, but I would like to discuss this further \nwith her. I also might say that as a new Member of the Senate, she has \nbeen especially helpful to me. We have worked on a variety of things, \nFood and Drug Administration issues and the like. I want her to \nunderstand that it has not been particularly pleasant to spend the \nafternoon taking different positions with somebody I admire. I want her \nto understand that.\n  Again, I have not seen a copy of the sense of the Senate offered by \nthe chair of the committee. She seeks to offer a study of this issue \ninvolving gag rules on medical patients; is that correct?\n  We have my amendment which passed 51 to 48, but did not get 60 votes, \non a proposal that keeps these health maintenance plans from imposing \ngag rules that keep their patients from getting a full range of \ninformation about medical services and treatments and their health care \noptions.\n  My amendment does not deal with the abortion issue. Perhaps some may \nhave thought it did. It simply deals with all of those physical and \nmental health services and the treatment options that patients need to \nmake decisions.\n  The Senate passed my amendment 51 to 48. Of course, it needed 60 \nvotes. I gather now that the Chair of the committee seeks a study of \nthis particular issue. I yield to her to find out whether this, in \nfact, is a study, or is this legislation with some teeth in it that \nactually does ban these gag rules, these insidious, offensive, \nanticonsumer gag rules that keep patients from knowing about their \nrights?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, no, this is not another study. It is a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution. So it does not have statutory authority \nas the language of the Senator from Oregon would have had.\n  However, it does not call for another study. It simply says that the \nSenate should take into account any relevant findings of the National \nCommission on Health Care Quality which President Clinton has said he \nwould appoint and other public and private entities with expertise in \nthis issue and in the quality of health care service delivery. We would \nconsider the views of those entities at a hearing before the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee, the committee of jurisdiction over this \nlegislation.\n  I do not think another study is important so much as gaining \nunderstanding through a hearing about what facts are known and what \npoints of view would be expressed from different aspects of the health \ncare service delivery industry, and then acting expeditiously.\n  So I assume the bill of the Senator from Oregon would be the vehicle \nin the next Congress. Hopefully, the bill would be introduced right at \nthe beginning of the Congress, so that there would be time to look at \nit. I think that the interest in this issue is indicative of the fact \nthere is going to be a great deal of interest in legislation regarding \nthis subject.\n  So I am not calling for a study. My amendment says we should act \nexpeditiously, but we should review all of the pertinent information \nthat is available.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, I hope that it is understood \nthat while I think that the Chair of the committee means well and is \nsincere in this effort, I think that the sense of the Senate that she \noffers today is very risky business.\n  This is September of 1996. The Senator from Kansas essentially is \nsaying September, October, November, December, January, February, as \nthe next Senate gets into business, that sometime 6 to 8 months from \nnow we can talk again about the rights of patients in the fastest \ngrowing sector of American health care. I think this is risky business.\n  It is one thing to study an issue when it is abstract, when it may \nnot have direct and immediate consequences, but what the Senator from \nKansas is saying is that when you have patients being hurt today, being \nsubjected to risk today when they do not have access to all the \ninformation about the physical and mental health services that may be \navailable to them when they need that information to make decisions \nabout their treatment, the Senator from Kansas is saying they cannot \nhave it. I know that the Senator from Kansas does not intend it that \nway--putting patients at risk.\n  It means that today in Oregon and in Kansas and all across the \ncountry where there are gag rules that keep patients from knowing of \ntheir rights, they will not be able to have that information. It is not \navailable to them. The U.S. Senate is saying, instead of voting for \nlegislation or allowing me to get 60 votes on my amendment, what we \nwill do is not give those patients the rights they need, not make sure \nthat they can know of all the physical and mental health services that \nthey deserve, and instead tell them that sometime next year, sometime \nin the future, we will go on.\n  I think it is a mistake. It puts patients at risk. This Member of the \nU.S. Senate is not willing to play that kind of Russian roulette with \nthe well-being of patients in the fastest growing sector of American \nhealth care.\n\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I suggest that we have been in the \n104th Congress for 2 years. This legislation was introduced in the \nHouse some time ago. It would have been useful to us here in the U.S. \nSenate if this legislation had been before us prior to July 31. We \nwould then have had time to hold committee hearings, which I think \nwould have enabled us to make some corrections or additions or changes \nand to understand better the consequences of all the steps toward the \ngoals we do support. I think it is not fair to say all of a sudden \nthat, because a bill introduced right before the August recess has not \nyet been considered, that means it is something we do not care about. \nThere was time in which the process could have moved forward, had the \nbill been introduced earlier.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, there is no question in my \nmind about the sincerity and good will of the Senator from Kansas. She, \nalong with Senator Kennedy, have done, I think, an especially valuable \nservice this session with the insurance involving portability. For the \nfirst time in America, because of the work of the Senator from Kansas, \nwe are going to make sure that workers are not going to be locked into \ntheir jobs. They are going to have a chance to enjoy the American dream \nbecause of their hard work. No one questions the sincerity and the \ndesire of the Senator from Kansas to tackle these very real and very \nhuman kinds of problems that affect so many of our families.\n  I feel very strongly--and looking at the sense of the Senate, it \ncalls for consulting public and private entities with expertise and \nquality health care service delivery. The fact is that the House, in \nhearings that were public, shown on C-SPAN and the like, did exactly \nthat. They had extensive discussions with the very people that this \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution suggests we talk with.\n  It would be one thing if there had been no discussions with these \ndistinguished people in the private sector. Those discussions have \ntaken place. They have been held. That is why Dr. Ganske, a Republican, \nand Congressman Markey, a Democrat, came together and got a unanimous \nvote to go forward and protect the rights of health care patients in \nthe fastest growing part of American health care.\n  We have done, it seems to me, the essence of this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, No. 1.\n  No. 2, I think it puts patients at risk because it allows gag rules \nto go forward unimpeded in the months after this Congress adjourns.\n  I hope my colleagues and the Senate understand just how pernicious \nthese\n\n[[Page S10269]]\n\ngag rules are. What these gag rules are all about is that a plan may \nsay to a physician, ``You are making too many referrals outside the \nnetwork, outside the health maintenance plan.'' The plan may say, ``I \ndo not want to have a referral to an ophthalmologist or a cardiologist \nor another specialist.'' These are very anticonsumer provisions that \nare becoming a part of American health care. They have been documented. \nThey are a matter of public record. I just think it is very risky \nbusiness to say that instead of protecting the rights of the patients, \ninstead of protecting the rights of the consumer, what we will do is \nstudy it a bit and talk to some of the same people that we already \ntalked to, rather than protecting those rights of the patients.\n\n  So this Senator believes that we should not have another study, \nshould not have yet another analysis. If I could just briefly engage \nthe chair of the committee, Senator Kassebaum, who I know is having \nsome discussions on several matters. But I wanted to see if it might be \npossible to have the distinguished chair of the committee lay aside her \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution at this time, and perhaps we can have \nsome more discussion toward seeing if, on a bipartisan basis, we can \ncome up with some piece of legislation that has some teeth in it before \nwe conclude with this bill, and that we recognize that a majority of \nSenators voted to put some real teeth into this issue. It wasn't 60; it \nwas 51. But a majority of Senators said that they didn't think these \ngag clauses were in the interest of American patients. They said this \nwas anticonsumer. I would like to see--like we have done with FDA and \nother matters--whether the distinguished chair of the committee and I \ncould work a bit further on this between now and the end of the day and \nperhaps come back to the Senate with a bipartisan proposal that really \nwould provide a measure of relief to patients at this time.\n  Now, to do that, the Senator from Kansas would have to lay aside her \nsense-of-the-Senate proposal. I just ask if she would be willing to do \nthat at this point, and during the interim, I ask that she and I and \nSenator Kennedy and our respective staffs, on a bipartisan basis, see \nif we can come up with a bipartisan proposal that would really have \nteeth in it and protect the rights of the patients.\n  I yield to the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I have no objection to setting aside \nthe underlying committee amendment, if that is the wish of the Senator. \nI thought, actually, we could voice vote the sense of the Senate. There \nare many other amendments that will require lengthy debate. If we want \nto set aside the entire amendment, that is fine. I am happy to do so, \nso the debate can proceed on other amendments.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If I might say further, I was asking the chair of the \ncommittee to lay aside, for the moment, her sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution so that, hopefully, the next time this comes up in the \nSenate--hopefully, later today--we would have a bipartisan proposal \nthat would have some real teeth in it that would protect the rights of \npatients. Is that acceptable to the chair of the committee?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, no. As I stated, I am happy to lay \naside the underlying amendment. Otherwise, my sense of the Senate is \nopen to being amended. I feel that would not be a good position in \nwhich to be placed at this point. I am happy to do so and proceed with \nother amendments to the bill and see what we can work out. That is the \nposition I take.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reluctantly, I will have to oppose the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. I want to take a few more minutes to tell the Senate why I \nam going to oppose the sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  You pass the sense-of-the-Senate resolution and you are playing \nRussian roulette with consumers in our health care system. We have \npatients and consumers who are being denied the information they need \nwith respect to medical services for their physical and mental problems \nand the treatment options that are available to them. You pass this \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution and what you say to those patients, in \nthe fastest growing sector of American health care, is, ``We are not on \nyour side. We don't want you to have any rights now. We are not going \nto do anything about these pernicious, offensive gag rules that exist \ntoday. Instead, what we will do is go out and talk to a whole bunch of \nthe same people that the U.S. Congress has already talked to.''\n  I think that is unfortunate. I think it is risky business. I think \nthat when you have patients who are in jeopardy--and make no mistake \nabout it, that is what happens when you have these gag rules. These \npatients are in jeopardy. They are not being told what they need to \nknow as it relates to essential health services and the information \nthey need.\n  I will tell you, I am just absolutely baffled at how the U.S. Senate \ncan say, at a time when patients hunger for information about health \ncare services, at a time when they want to get it on the Internet, at a \ntime when they can go to special programs offered by health care \nproviders, just to know about new treatments and options, I can't \nunderstand how the U.S. Senate would then say that we are going to \nstiff those patients, we are not going to give them the information \nthey need, we are not going to tell them what they need to know to make \nthe essential decisions about the treatment and the services that they \nthink are best for them.\n  So I think that this sense-of-the-Senate resolution puts patients at \nrisk. It means that we are not going to get any help for patients who \nneed it now, who can't wait 6, 8, 10 months, or whenever it might be \nuntil the Senate might take this up again. It is not completely clear \nto me what the timetable of this might possibly be. But I think that \nthis sense-of-the-Senate resolution puts patients at risk. I think it \njeopardizes the well-being of vulnerable people. I think it is the \nantithesis of sensible health care policy, which ought to be built on \nthe patient's right to know--the right to know everything, not just \nthose things that might be in a planned financial interest. I just \ncan't believe that this Senate wants to wrap up the discussion of this \ntopic by telling patients that we are going to be on the side of the \ngag rules, we are going to be on the side of those who want to keep you \nfrom having information. But that is what this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution does.\n  Unfortunately, it says we won't protect patients now. We are not \ngoing to stand up for them when they face these gag rules that limit \ntheir right to know. I want it understood that this Senator is going to \noppose this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, because it puts patients at \nrisk. It sends the message--and perhaps some may desire to do this--\nthat the U.S. Senate is doing something to help patients when, in fact, \nit is not. The earlier amendment, the amendment that banned these gag \nclauses, helped patients. It helped them now, because it made sure that \nthey could have access to all the information they need to make \ninformed and thoughtful choices.\n  I can tell my colleagues that I come from a part of the country that \nhas managed care, that has had managed care perhaps longer than any \nother. We pioneered it. We have good managed care. We still have some \nof these abuses. But I can assure you that your communities and your \nStates have a whole lot more of these problems than we do.\n  I think it is going to be very, very hard to go home and explain to \npatients, explain to doctors--because doctors have endorsed this effort \nto eliminate the gag rules--how it is in the public interest. I cannot \npossibly believe that you can stand up at a community meeting of \nphysicians, patients, or citizens and say we are not going to give you \nthe information you need about medical services and medical \ntreatments. But instead of giving you the information that you need we \nare going to have a gag rule, and you can't find out about your rights.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield to me for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will, and I want to yield to Senator Kerrey who has been \nhelping me for the better part of 24 hours.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be very brief. I wonder if the Senator knows that \nbefore he happily came to this body we made an incredible contribution \nto the whole country when we passed a Sense of the Senate on this \nsubject. That happened to be a Boxer amendment that was endorsed by \nSenator Kennedy\n\n[[Page S10270]]\n\nwhich put the Senate on record as saying that patients have a right to \nknow the treatment options that are available to them. It was very \nstraight forward. Unfortunately, what happened as a result of some of \nthe games that are played around here is that Sense of the Senate was \ndropped from the conference after everybody voted for it.\n  I think the time has come to do what the Senator from Oregon has \nsuggested, and I think the fact that the Senator from Oregon got 51 \nvotes shows that the Senate is ready to move forward on his amendment \nand not study this to death. Because frankly, if you study this to \ndeath people are going to die. We heard stories in California where \npeople did not know their treatment options, and tragedies flowed from \nthat.\n  I want to underscore what the Senator is saying. I say to my friend \nfrom Oregon that I am glad that he is being tough on this. I think \nthere are a lot of people around here that want to vote for meaningless \nthings so they can go home and say, ``Yes, I didn't vote for the Wyden \namendment but I voted for the sense of the Senate.'' And I think what \nthe Senator is doing by being, I would say, very strong although very \nrespectful and very aware of the way he has presented. He is saying \nthat the time for these meaningless studies has come and gone, and we \nneed to get to the business of saving lives.\n  I wanted to thank the Senator. I again repeat my question: Was the \nSenator aware that we did go on record several months ago on this \nissue?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I very much appreciate the Senator from California making \nme aware of this. I was not. It just seems to me, as the Senator has \nindicated, that it is time to act. Before I came to the Congress and \nserved in the House where we served together, I was head of a senior \ncitizens group, a great panel. I had not run for public office before. \nI had never been involved in public office. When we started that senior \ncitizens group we said we are going to focus on the good ideas that \nhelp people. We do not care whether they are Democrat. We do not care \nwhether they are Republican. We are just going to focus on the ideas \nthat help people. I think that is what Dr. Ganske did when he took this \nup in the House, a Republican physician, who said that what we need to \ndo is help people. We certainly are not helping people by having these \ngag rules that keep people from knowing about their rights much.\n  So the House, as we have discussed, and in the committee on a \nunanimous basis, said we are going to stand up for the patients, we are \ngoing to stand up for the providers, the vast majority of doctors who \nare honest and ethical, and want to tell their patients about their \nrights. And it made great bipartisan progress.\n  That is what I want to do here. I know the Senator from Nebraska has \nbeen trying to help me for the better part of 24 hours. I want to yield \nto him.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I wanted to ask the Senator from Oregon if \nhe would be willing to allow the underlying amendment to be set aside \nso we can proceed to the next item of business under the unanimous \nconsent agreement and come back to the amendment. We have an hour \nagreement for the next amendment, and we can come back to it.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator from Nebraska has been very helpful. I \nappreciate it. That is acceptable to me.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Parliamentary inquiry. We set aside the committee \namendment, and then the Kassebaum amendment which is the second degree, \nthen we go under the UC to the pending committee amendment, as I \nunderstand it. Is it the committee amendment, and then the Kassebaum \namendment in the second degree. Is that correct?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SHELBY. If we set aside the committee amendment and the Kassebaum \nsecond degree, at the end of the hour of debate, which we have already \ngotten a UC on, we would automatically come back to the committee \namendment and the Kassebaum amendment. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Once the next committee \namendment is disposed of, then we would return to the underlying \ncommittee amendment which also has the Kassebaum amendment on it.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the committee \namendment and the second-degree amendment to it, the Kassebaum \namendment, so we can go forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\nExcepted Committee Amendment Beginning on Page 80, Line 20 Through Page \n                               81, Line 4\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the next committee \namendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 80, strike line 20 through page 81, line \n     4.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wonder if we could hear what the unanimous consent \nexactly was.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous-consent agreement would be to \nset aside the underlying committee amendment, which is the second \ncommittee amendment which also contains the Kassebaum second-degree \namendment. We would then go to the third committee amendment. With that \namendment, 30 minutes are under the control of the Senator from \nCalifornia, and 30 minutes under the control of the Senator from \nOklahoma at which time the motion to table would be in order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think it would be appropriate for the \nopposing side, the side that wishes to strike the committee language, \nto go first. Clearly the Senator from California and the Senator from \nNebraska are very pleased with the action of the committee and support \nthe committee. I think it is most appropriate for those wishing to \nstrike the committee language to proceed at this time. Then we can \nrespond.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me first say that this very same issue \nwas debated by this body last year in our consideration of the \nTreasury-Postal Service appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, at that time this body voted 50 to 44 to accept the \nvery language that the amendment before us asked us to strike. So this \nSenate has already voted in this same context to restrict Federal funds \nfor abortion, specifically to restrict the use of Federal funds for \nabortion coverage of the Federal health care plans to cases of rape, \nincest, or the life of the mother.\n  Mr. President, I wanted that noted out front so that we all realize \nthat we are not covering any new ground. This is something that should \nnot take, frankly, very much of the Senate's time.\n  Mr. President, the issue of abortion is an important matter of \nconscience to millions of Americans. We tried to promote our views in \nthe democratic arena. We seek to embody these views in our Nation's \nlaws. As someone who is pro-life I worked, obviously, to promote the \nvalue of and protect the innocent human life. But, Mr. President, the \ndiscussion of this amendment is much more narrow. The discussion of \nthis amendment does not need to reach that moral level of debate. The \nkey question in regard to this amendment that we have to answer simply \nis this: Should taxpayers pay for these abortions?\n  Again, I emphasize the Senate spoke last year by a vote of 50 to 44 \nand said no.\n  I believe that we should not ask the taxpayers to promote a policy of \nabortion on demand. This amendment that I am going to move to table \nafter we conclude our debate would strike the House language on this \nsubject and would change current law. Our position, my position is to \nretain current law, to retain what the Senate did last year by a vote \nof 50 to 44, and to retain the current House language. I believe we \nshould retain this language that permits Federal employee health plans \nto cover abortion only in the cases of rape, incest, and threats to the \nlife of the mother. In essence, this is a Hyde amendment-type debate.\n  The vast majority of Americans, 69 percent, in a 1992 ABC-Washington \nPost poll said they opposed taxpayer\n\n[[Page S10271]]\n\nfunding for abortions for low-income individuals.\n  If that many people oppose subsidizing abortions for poor people, I \nthink there would be even more opposition to subsidizing abortions for \nhigher income Government workers. The reality is that in every single \npoll I have ever seen done, the vast majority of Americans, whatever \ntheir position on the issue of abortion, say no taxpayers funding.\n  We should make no mistake about it. This is a taxpayers subsidy. In \n1995, the Federal Government paid an average of 74 percent of the cost \nof a Federal employee's health premium. That is taxpayer money. I \nsuggest it is wrong. I think we should leave the taxpayers out of the \nwhole debate and out of the whole issue. Therefore, I believe we should \nsupport the House language, that we should support current law, and \nthat would mean tabling this amendment.\n  In summary, then, this matter has been debated time and time again on \nthis floor. The issue is a narrow one, a very narrow one, and it is \nsimply this: Should taxpayers' dollars, all taxpayers in this country, \nbe taken by the Federal Government and used to subsidize and fund \nabortions? Current law says no. Current law limits abortion \navailability in Federal employee health care plans to cases of rape, \nincest, and to save the life of the mother. That is current law. That \nis what the Senate voted for last year. That is the House position, as \nwell.\n  I might add that when we went through this debate last year, \nultimately the House acquiesced in the Senate's three exceptions. These \nwere our exceptions from the Senate. They acquiesced, and that is where \nwe are today. My motion to table would simply restore current law.\n  At this point, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  The issue as presented by my friend and colleague from Ohio is quite \ndifferent, in my view, from the way he put it forward to the American \npeople. To me, the question is clear: Should women Federal employees or \ntheir dependents be treated the same as other women in the work force \nor should they be singled out, punished, have their rights taken away \nfrom them and be treated differently?\n  We get into a lot of debate in the Senate on very important issues. \nNone could be more important than this, regardless of the way you view \nthe issue on abortion. And we know in the Republican platform, the \nplatform committee adopted a platform which would criminalize abortion, \nurging adoption of a constitutional amendment which would deny women \nthe right to choose even in matters of rape or incest, and we know that \nmany here who speak out on this issue and that is really their whole \ndesire.\n  The fact is, abortion is legal in this great land.\n  My friend and colleague says we are trying to stop abortion on \ndemand. There is no such thing as abortion on demand in this country. \nThere is a Supreme Court case called Roe versus Wade. Yes, a woman has \nthe right to make this personal, private decision without a U.S. \nSenator telling her what to do in the first 3 months of her pregnancy. \nShe has the right to make that decision with her doctor and her God \nwithout the Senator from Ohio or another State who holds an opposite \nview essentially saying, no, we do not think that is right.\n\n  She can make that choice under Roe versus Wade. After that, the State \nhas an interest, and rules apply to that abortion. So there is no such \nthing as abortion on demand.\n  The bottom line is, this is a tough, personal, private matter, and I \nreally think it is about time we trusted women to make that choice. Why \nshould we say that a woman who happens to work for the Federal \nGovernment or her dependents should not have this right?\n  My friend says we disposed of this matter on a vote before. Yes, we \ndid. As a matter of fact, in 1993, in this Senate, before my friend got \nhere, we restored the rights of women in the Federal Government to be \ntreated equally. I really do not think women are asking for much here \nother than to have equal treatment, to be respected for the choices \nthat they make, and, unfortunately, what this amendment will do by \ndisagreeing with the committee of the Senate is to tell a woman who \nhappens to work for her Government, she cannot use her own insurance to \nexercise a perfectly legal right.\n  My friends in the Senate, I have to say, if there was an amendment to \nstop a man who happens to work in the Federal Government from getting a \nperfectly legal medical procedure, one that might protect his health, \nthere would be an uproar around here. They would say, how could you do \nthat to the men of this country? Why not treat the men who work for the \nFederal Government the same way we treat men who work in the private \nsector?\n  The answer, in this particular case, with this particular amendment, \nis you cannot win your point with the American people. You do not have \nthe votes in this country to put Government in the middle of this \npersonal, private decision. And so what do you do? Every chance you \nget, I say to my colleagues on the other side of this issue, you chip \naway and you chip away and you chip away at the right of women to \nchoose.\n  If you are a woman today, what this Congress has done in its \nextremism, I say, is to tell a woman who is willing to die for her \ncountry by serving in the military that she cannot go to a hospital, a \nmilitary hospital, and have a safe and legal abortion which could \npotentially save her life--that right has been taken away. This \nCongress has been chipping away at a woman's right to choose.\n  I am so proud of this committee which took a stand against the \nextremism of the House of Representatives and restored the rights of \nwomen who are Federal employees to use their own insurance for which \nthey pay a percentage, to exercise a perfectly legal right.\n  Mr. President, I should like to reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Let me just briefly respond. This is not an issue of equal treatment. \nThis is not an issue of that at all. It does not tell anyone what to \ndo. I think we need to keep our eye on the ball and discuss not the \nwhole issue of abortion here today. I think it is important we discuss \nwhat is in front of us. What is in front of us is a very narrow issue, \nand that simply is, are we going to use Federal tax dollars to \nsubsidize, pay for abortions?\n  The vast majority of the American people say, no, we see absolutely \nno reason to do this. On an issue as contentious as this is and where \nthere are good people on both sides of the battle, why in the world we \nwould say, this Congress would say we are going to take Federal tax \ndollars to subsidize abortions makes absolutely no sense.\n  Let me at this point yield to my colleague from Indiana 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Less than that, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio essentially made the \npoints I was going to make in response to the Senator from California, \nwho I think has mischaracterized the issue before us. The issue before \nus has nothing to do with a woman's right to have an abortion. It has \nnothing to do with an amendment that, in her words, denies the choice \nof women, takes away a woman's right to choose. It is not an amendment \nto stop anyone from getting a perfectly legal procedure accomplished. \nSo I think it is important for our colleagues to understand what the \namendment does and what it does not do.\n  This is not a debate on whether or not a woman has a right to an \nabortion. I have suggested for a number of years, ever since I have \nbeen in the Senate, that we ought to have that debate. We have had that \ndebate on occasion. But this is not the debate we are having today. The \ndebate we are having today is on the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Ohio, which simply restores to the Senate bill the language that \nwas incorporated in the\n\n[[Page S10272]]\n\nHouse, that says, except in the cases where the life of the mother is \nin jeopardy or in cases of rape or incest, the taxpayer will not be \nasked to fund abortions chosen by a woman under the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits plan.\n  There are a number of perfectly legal procedures, medical procedures, \nthat are not covered by the health insurance plan. Not every health \ninsurance plan covers every procedure. I do not know what percent of \nprivate insurance policies cover the cost of abortion, but that is not \nan issue either. The question is whether or not the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits plan, which every Federal employee participates in, \nwill cover abortion. There are, as I said, a number of procedures that \nare not covered. That is a matter of determination by the organization \nthat provides the insurance. We have the ability to select from a \nnumber of different insurance plans. But the issue is whether or not \nthe taxpayer will be asked to pay for it.\n  This is not just another medical procedure. This is a procedure that \nis extraordinarily controversial, where American opinion is divided, \nwhere taxpayers, for religious reasons, moral conscience reasons, and \nother reasons feel they should not have to use their tax dollars to pay \nfor something they believe fundamentally violates their religious \nbeliefs, their moral convictions.\n  This is a debate we have had now for 20 years, and pretty \nconsistently over the last 20 years, with a couple of exceptions, the \nCongress, whether it has been a Democrat-controlled Congress or a \nRepublican-controlled Congress, has pretty consistently supported the \nproposition that taxpayers should not be coerced into paying for a \nprocedure which many of them feel violates some of their most deeply \nheld beliefs. That has been, as I said, supported by both Democrats and \nRepublicans. Democrats controlled the House throughout the decade of \nthe 1980's and the early 1990's, and the Hyde amendment, which is \nessentially what the Senator from Ohio was offering, was supported by \nboth parties. It has been supported here in the U.S. Senate. It says \nthat, except in those instances of rape, incest, and protecting the \nlife of the mother, we will not ask the taxpayer to pay for it.\n  Since the Federal Government subsidizes our insurance costs--up to \nabout 74 percent, I think is the latest figure--clearly, the cost of an \nabortion would be subsidized and paid for, at least three-fourths of it \nwould be subsidized and paid for, by the Federal taxpayer. That is why \nthe amendment is being offered.\n  So I think it is important we focus on the amendment that is here. We \ncan reserve time--I am sure both sides would be willing to accommodate \nit at some point--to discuss the larger issue of abortion: the meaning \nof life, when life begins, what restrictions if any should be placed on \nabortions, the whole idea of Roe versus Wade, the Supreme Court \ndecision. Those are all issues that are legitimate issues but have \nnothing to do with this amendment.\n  So let us make sure that we focus on what the amendment seeks to do \nand what the amendment does not seek to do. I have more I can say in \nthis regard, but I think in the interests of time here, since my 5 \nminutes is up, I will cease at this point and then we will talk about \nit, but let us keep the discussion focused on what the amendment is all \nabout.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will take 1 minute and then I will yield 5 minutes to \none of the leaders on this issue, Senator Mikulski. Let me just respond \nbriefly.\n  To hear Senators say this has nothing to do with a woman's right to \nchoose, makes me think sometime that we are in never-never land around \nhere. Of course it has something to do with a woman's right to choose. \nYou are telling more than a million women, more than 1 million women, \nwho happen to work for the Federal Government or rely on the FEHBP for \nhealth insurance that they should be treated differently when it comes \nto their right to choose. They work hard. They ought to be trusted. So, \nit is all fine to stand here and say it is being mischaracterized, it \nhas nothing to do with the right to choose, but if you are a Federal \nemployee and, let us say, you earn $20,000 a year and you pay for a \npercentage of your health insurance and you cannot get an abortion with \nthat health insurance, even if your doctor says you might be paralyzed \nfor life--because there is no exception for that--I assure you we are \ntalking reality. We are not talking something that does not really \nexist. This is a real threat to a woman's right to choose if she is a \nFederal employee.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator yield on that point for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I cannot yield on my time, but if you use your time I \nwill be glad to, because I do not have enough time.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield my colleague 1 minute.\n  Mr. COATS. I understand. We will use our time. I would like to ask a \nquestion.\n  The Senator from California said we are denying women who work for \nthe Federal Government the same rights that all other women have.\n  Are you saying that every insurance policy in America has coverage \nfor abortion and therefore every other woman in America has the right \nto have an abortion paid for under her insurance policy? Or, are there \ndifferent policies, some that offer it, some that do not offer it?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The vast majority of plans do offer abortion, and in the \nprivate sector most women have the opportunity to find a plan that \nwould, in fact, cover that if they so chose. Whereas in this particular \namendment we are saying no one, no one who works for the Federal \nGovernment, through the Federal Employees Health Benefits plan, can get \nsuch a policy. We are restricting the freedom of the women who work for \nthe Federal Government.\n  Mr. COATS. We checked with Planned Parenthood and asked them that \nquestion. They disagreed with what you just said. They said there is no \nway, they do not have specific information about the availability of \nabortion coverage, how many insurance policies cover it, how many do \nnot.\n  The point is, it is not an accurate statement to say we are denying \nwomen who work for the Federal Government the opportunity that all \nwomen have. That is not an accurate statement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Maybe my friend would appreciate we know that 78 million \nwomen----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. On my time, if I might respond, we know for sure that 78 \nmillion women in the private sector do affirmatively have this choice. \nSo we have 78 million women that we know of who have this choice but \nthe 1.2 million women who work for the Federal Government or are \ndependents of Federal employees do not have the choice and cannot have \nthe choice if the Senators on that side of the aisle prevail.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to our leader on this committee, \nalong with Senator Kerrey, Senator Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the \ncommittee amendment and in opposition to the Nickles amendment.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a member of \nthe Subcommittee on Treasury and Postal Services, we made very clear in \nthe committee the dominant view in the committee is that we wanted the \nwomen of the United States of America to be able to have abortions \nwhere medically appropriate in their health insurance legislation. This \nbill was reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee, and it would \nenable Federal employees whose health insurance is provided under the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits plan to receive coverage for abortion \nservices, subject to all the traditional laws of the land.\n  The Nickles amendment would reinstate the language from the House \nbill which prohibits coverage for abortion except in the case of life \nendangerment, rape, or incest. It would continue a ban which has \nprevented Federal employees from receiving the health care service \nwhich is widely, if not totally, available for private sector \nemployees.\n  We think limiting it to life of the mother, rape, or incest is \nmedically\n\n[[Page S10273]]\n\ndangerous. We believe the decision should be made by the mother, with \nthe consulting physician, using whatever is her religious conviction to \nbe able to proceed with something that is deemed by the physician as \nmedically appropriate. We leave that decision to be made not on the \nfloor of the Congress but in a doctor's office.\n  The 104th Congress has been a tough one to support a woman's right to \nchoose in that most private of matters not to have a child. Bill after \nbill after bill after bill, we have faced votes on women's reproductive \nrights.\n  In the 104th Congress, between the House and the Senate, this \nCongress has voted 51 times on this issue. The 104th Congress has been \nunprecedented in its assault also on Federal employees--their pay, \ntheir benefits and their livelihoods. What we have with this amendment \nis a vote on abortion and also on the basic benefit package for Federal \nemployees.\n  I represent over 280,000 Federal employees in the State of Maryland, \nthe Social Security Administration that makes sure the checks go out on \ntime, the National Institutes of Health that right now are doing \nresearch to ensure the saving of lives.\n  We want the very people who are able to do research on fertility and \nreproduction to be able to have access to what is medically necessary \nin terms of the relationship of abortion.\n  Federal employees have faced assault after assault in these last 2 \nyears. They face tremendous employment insecurity, downsizing, and so \non. I view this amendment as yet another assault on these public \nservants. It goes directly after the benefits of Federal employees.\n  Health insurance is part of the compensation package to which they \nare entitled. The cost of insurance coverage is shared by the Federal \nGovernment and by the employee. I know that the proponents of \ncontinuing the ban on abortion coverage for Federal employees say they \nare only trying to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion, but that is \nnot what this debate is about. This is about prohibiting the \ncompensation package of Federal employees from being used for a legal \nand sometimes vital medical service. Health insurance is part of the \nFederal employee's pay. The decisions related to health care should be \nmade between the patient and the physician.\n  If we were to extend the logic of those who favor the ban, we might \nnext prohibit Federal employees from using their own paychecks to pay \nfor an abortion. No one is seriously suggesting that Federal employees \nought not to have the right to do what they want with their own money. \nWe should not be also placing unfair restrictions on the type of health \ninsurance that Federal employees can purchase under their own Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits plan.\n  Over 1.2 million women of reproductive age depend on the FEHB for \ntheir medical care. We know that access to reproductive health services \nis essential to women's health. We know that restrictions that make it \nmore difficult for women to obtain early abortions where medically \nappropriate increase the likelihood that women will put their health at \nrisk by being forced to continue a high-risk pregnancy. If we continue \nto ban the abortion services and leave only these very narrow \nexemptions, these 1.2 million women of reproductive health age who \ndepend on FEHB will not have access to abortion even when their health \nis seriously threatened. We are going to be replacing the informed \njudgment of medical practitioners with that of politicians.\n  Let me conclude by reiterating that decisions on abortion should be \nmade by the woman in close consultation with her physician. Only a \nwoman and her physician can weigh her unique circumstances and make the \ndecision as to what is medically necessary and medically appropriate. \nIt is wrong for Congress to try to issue a blanket prohibition.\n\n  I will vote ``no'' on Nickles and up on the committee amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Very briefly, let me say, again, this is not a debate about abortion. \nThis is not a debate to determine what a person can do or cannot do. \nThat is not what is at issue here. What is at issue here is what will \nbe covered. What is at issue is whether or not Federal tax dollars \ntaken from all Americans, many of whom find this procedure to be \nabhorrent, whether or not we will involuntarily take their money to pay \nfor abortions.\n  Congress has voted time and time again not to do that. The vast \nmajority of the American people in every public opinion poll anyone has \nseen indicate they do not want that done. It is a very, very narrow \nissue.\n  Let me read the current law. Our position is the current law simply \nshould be sustained:\n\n       No funds appropriated by this act shall be available to pay \n     for an abortion or administrative expenses in connection with \n     any health plan under the Federal Employees Health Benefits \n     program which provides any benefits or coverage for \n     abortions. The provision of this section shall not apply \n     where the life of the mother will be in danger if the fetus \n     were carried to term, or the pregnancy is the result of an \n     act of rape or incest.\n\n  Mr. President, let me yield to my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question? I will be happy to \ndo it on my time.\n  Mr. DeWINE. On your time, fine.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My colleague keeps reiterating, as do my other colleagues \non the other side, that this is about Federal funds and people oppose \nspending Federal funds.\n  Would my friend support an amendment that said that women Federal \nemployees who do, in fact, exercise their right to choose and use their \ninsurance could be reimbursed for the portion of the premium which they \npaid themselves which, in this case, is about 28 percent? Would my \ncolleague work with me on such an approach so at least they can get \nreimbursed for the portion of their share of the premium?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I am not sure how that will function, how that will work \nor how to mechanically get that done. The bottom line is, in fact, you \ncan buy riders, you can, in fact, buy separate policies.\n  All we are saying is, when the latest study shows 74 percent of the \npremiums are paid by other taxpayers, it is a legitimate issue.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say thank you to my friend and take back my time. I \nthink this points out for all the American people to see that this is \nnot about Federal funds, because I just made a very reasonable proposal \nthat since women pay approximately 28 percent of their premiums out of \ntheir own pocket, why not allow them to get this coverage and reimburse \nthem for 28 percent of the cost of the procedure? My friend says he \ndoesn't know how it would work. We figure out a lot tougher things \naround here.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my friend----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio had not relinquished the \nfloor. He responded to a question from the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am sorry. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield to my colleague from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to address the question just \nasked by the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. I say to the Senator from California, who asked would we \nbe willing to accept an amendment which would allow reimbursement for \nan abortion for that portion of the premium which is paid for by the \nFederal employee, again, I think the Senator misses the point here.\n  From one standpoint, she is saying these women have no other place to \ngo, they can't get an abortion. One-fourth the premium is $62, if it is \na $250 abortion. I have been told that is the going rate for an \nabortion. So are you telling me that an employee of the Federal \nGovernment who has a job, a full-time job, who is working for the \nFederal Government is unable to come up with $62 in order to pay for an \nabortion?\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I respond on my friend's time? I will be brief.\n  Mr. COATS. I would like you to respond on my time, but you did not \nlet me respond on your time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will tell you what I will do for my friend, I will \nrespond on my time.\n\n[[Page S10274]]\n\n  Mr. COATS. That is what you asked me to do. That is appropriate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator is right. I should respond to him on my own \ntime. He is perfectly correct.\n  I say to my friend from Indiana, he says I miss the point. I say, \nthose on the other side of the aisle, who are trying to deny Federal \nemployees their equal rights, miss the point. If your argument is that \ntaxpayers do not want their funds used, I am giving you a way out of \nthis, in fairness. If my friend thinks $62 is not a lot of money, let \nme point out to him a fact. Twenty-five percent of the Federal \nemployees earn less than $25,000, and 18,000 Federal employees are at \nor below the Federal poverty level.\n  I say to my friend, $62 is a lot of money for those people. But let \nus face the fact, you do not even want to go that far and allow them to \nget that reimbursement. My question, I think, really smoked out the \ntrue attitude on the other side of the aisle. This is not about Federal \ntaxpayers' dollars; this is about chipping away at a woman's right to \nchoose. It is very clear. You know, at the convention in San Diego, we \nsaw what the goal is. This is chipping away wherever you can.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank the \nSenator from California.\n  In spite of the fact that the majority of the American people embrace \nthe freedom of reproductive choice, the efforts to use Government \nintervention as a bar to the right to choose continues. Every year that \nI have been in the Congress, and 9 years before that, we have had to \nconsider whether or not female Federal employees should be able to \nchoose a health plan that includes abortion as part of its reproductive \nhealth services.\n  We have not been considering whether or not these women have the \nright to abortion. The Supreme Court affirmed they do over 20 years \nago. This issue, the one we are considering, is whether or not we \nshould prevent their insurance from covering the procedure.\n  In reality, we are considering whether or not we should put barriers \nin the way of our own employees exercising their constitutionally \nprotected rights. I do not--and this is a matter of public record--I do \nnot personally favor abortion. My own religious beliefs hold life dear, \nand I would prefer that every potential child have a chance to be born.\n  I do, however, believe fundamentally in the right of every woman to \nmake her own private decision concerning her pregnancy. I cannot fathom \ntelling my employees, or any employee in the Federal Government, that \nthey cannot fully exercise their constitutionally protected right to \nchoose because Congress was playing politics with their health \ninsurance plans.\n  We are debating whether or not Congress will, for yet another year, \ndeny Federal employees a benefit available to most women who work in \nthe private sector. It is common practice in the health insurance \nindustry for private health care plans to cover complete reproductive \nservices, including pregnancy, childbirth, and abortion. This is \nbecause most women want the right to choose. It is also because it is \nbetter medicine, as Senator Mikulski pointed out in her statement.\n  In addition, this motion would restrict access to earned benefits. I \nthink this is a very important point. Federal employees pay a portion \nof the cost of their health care benefits. A Federal employee chooses a \nFederal health benefits package and then pays a monthly fee to their \nchosen health care plan. Employees are free to choose from some 342 \nplans, 178 of which would not cover abortion even if they could. The \nemployee chooses a plan and then pays for part of it.\n\n  The balance of the premium is an earned benefit, which is \ncompensation. It is part of their pay, their compensation. Let me \nrepeat for those who may not understand this point. It is not a gift \nfrom the Federal Government to its employees. It is earned by those \nemployees, including women employees.\n  Approximately 9 million Federal employees, their dependents, and \nFederal retirees depend on Federal benefits for their health insurance. \nThis includes 1.2 million women of reproductive age who rely on the \nFederal Employee Health Benefits program. The restrictions that this \namendment would renew would prevent 1.2 million women from receiving \nthe full reproductive health services that their doctors might want to \nprovide for them.\n  Since 1983, Mr. President, Congress has changed the rules in this \narea not once, not twice, but four times. We have literally been \nplaying political ping pong with women's reproductive health. I urge my \ncolleagues to just put this issue to rest and allow women full access \nto health benefits and full access to the constitutionally protected \nright to choose.\n  Most women who choose to have an abortion do not use their insurance \ncoverage to pay for it. Most women want to keep the matter private. But \neven if most women do not use the benefits, there is a matter of \nprinciple that the benefits should not be denied to them. We should \nremove the intrusion of politics from earned Federal employee benefits \nand from the private health decisions of our employees. This Congress \nshould not continue to play politics with women's lives and women's \nhealth.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I would say, as I mentioned in another \ndebate, for those who urge smaller Government, I would point out that \nhere is another instance in which those who tell us that the issue and \nthe objective is smaller Government, only say so when it does not \nrelate to people's personal liberty and their private lives. This is \nyet another intrusion in the private lives and private liberties of \nwomen, in terms of the exercise of their Federally constitutionally \nprotected rights. I suggest that this amendment ought to be denied. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Oklahoma 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, let me compliment my colleague \nfrom Ohio and also my colleague from Indiana for their statements. Let \nme kind of try to put this in perspective. Senator DeWine raised a \nconcern about a committee amendment. At some point he will have a \nmotion to strike the committee amendment or to table the committee \namendment.\n  What is he doing? What does this mean? Well, last year the House and \nthe Senate agreed to language that said we are not going to use Federal \ntaxpayers' money to include abortion as a fringe benefit in health care \nplans except in cases of rape and incest and to protect the life of the \nmother.\n  One of my colleagues mentioned, well, we should be consistent. That \nwas the policy of the Federal Government, frankly, from 1984 to 1993, \nuntil Bill Clinton became President. He changed it. That lasted in 1994 \nand 1995. We changed it last year. We had a vote. We actually had a \nkind of unusual session. We had a Saturday session. We had three votes \non it and basically ended up with the policy that the Senator from Ohio \nis trying to maintain.\n  What is that policy? That policy is the same thing that was in the \nHouse language, that being that Federal taxpayers' moneys will not be \nused to provide abortions for Federal employees unless necessary to \nprotect the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest. That was \nlast year's policy. That is what the House is trying to maintain. That \nis what the Senator from Ohio and Indiana and myself are trying to \nmaintain, to continue last year's policy.\n  The committee had an amendment to strike the House language. That \nwould open it up and that would allow Federal employees to receive \ntaxpayer subsidies to pay for abortion. We did not agree with that last \nyear. We did not agree with it for 10 years, 1984 through 1993. Bill \nClinton wanted to change it. We changed that back last year. We are \ntrying to maintain last year's policy. We had two or three votes on it, \nas I mentioned, in an unusual Saturday session.\n\n  I remember my colleague from Ohio stayed here. He had a very \nimportant family meeting in Ohio, and he stayed here to vote on this \nbecause he felt that it was important. I will never forget that, \nbecause we literally are talking about, do we want abortion to be a\n\n[[Page S10275]]\n\nfringe benefit in health care plans? Some people say, well, you are \nattacking a woman's right to choose. We are saying, no, it should not \nbe a standard fringe benefit.\n  Abortion is not another standard health procedure. It happens to be \ntaking the life of an innocent, unborn child. Do we really want the \nFederal Government to subsidize that? A lot of people think, well, \nmaybe that should be a woman's right, but we should not be subsidizing \nit. If this amendment does not pass, we are going to be subsidizing it. \nTaxpayers pay for about three-fourths of it.\n  So when I think of that and I think of what kind of protections we \ngive to unborn endangered species, thousands of endangered species--we \nhave significant protections. As a matter of fact, if you destroy their \nunborn, you can be subjected to prison, you can be subjected to $50,000 \nfines--but not for unborn children. We are not even trying to elevate \nunborn children to the protected status of endangered species; but we \nare trying to say: Taxpayers, you should not have to subsidize the \ndestruction of innocent, unborn human beings.\n  That is what the DeWine amendment or the DeWine resolution is, to \nstrike the committee language. I believe the Senator from Ohio is \nexactly right. Abortion should not be a fringe benefit. It should not \nbe included as a standard option. If Federal employees want to purchase \nit, they certainly can. The cost is minimal. It is $250 or $300.\n  We should not include it as a standard fringe benefit and say, look, \nif the Federal Government does it, why should not all health care plans \nin America? Not all health care plans do. A lot of health care plans do \nnot. We should not have an item in our standard health care package for \nFederal employees that actually results in the destruction of an \ninnocent human being.\n  I compliment my colleague from Ohio. I hope our colleagues will \nsupport that and remember how they voted last year when we had an \nextraordinary Saturday session and we adopted the present policy. The \npresent policy being, again, that for Federal employees, we will not \ninclude abortion as a standard fringe benefit unless it is necessary to \nsave the life of the mother or in cases of rape and incest.\n  I thank my colleague. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, might I say that the more I listen to this \ndebate the more I compliment my friends, the Senator from Nebraska, \nSenator Kerrey, and the Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, who \nargued this eloquently in the committee--to treat Federal employees the \nsame way, the way more than 75 million American women are treated in \nthe private work force.\n  We hear from the Senators from Oklahoma, Ohio and Indiana saying this \nhas nothing to do with the right to choose, yet we hear a speech about \ndestroying an innocent life. Let me say this is very much about the \nright to choose and the right of a woman to make a private personal \ndecision with her own physician, to be able to use her insurance that \nshe pays for, and yet when I offer to my friends to talk about a way to \nat least reimburse her for the portion that she pays out of her own \npocket, he says no, there are excuses and reasons why we could not do \nthat.\n  This is, frankly, an attack and assault on a woman's right to choose. \nIt is aimed at Federal employees. My friends would love to aim it at \nevery woman in America. They cannot do it. They do not have the votes \nto do it. So they chip away.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to speak in \nfavor of the committee amendment. What this committee amendment would \ndo is allow the Federal employees health program to resume coverage for \nabortion services. Unfortunately, and I believe it was unfortunate, \nlast year, Congress voted to prohibit the Federal employees health \nprogram from covering abortions for our female employees and our female \ndependents.\n  If this committee amendment were not adopted--in other words, if it \nwere rejected --we will be responsible for continuing a lower standard \nof health insurance for our female employees than they could get if \nthey worked in the private sector. In the private sector you can get \nthis. What this says is you cannot offer this service.\n  Now, there is nothing that says these programs have to include \ncoverage for abortion services. Not at all. Indeed, before that \namendment last year was passed, out of the 345 health plans that are \nall put under the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, 345 of \nthem--about half; 178--offered some form of abortion coverage. In other \nwords, a woman could choose this if she wanted; if she wanted a plan \nthat did not cover it, fine, she could choose that. But it seems to me \nterribly unfair for us to say, no, no, none of those programs can offer \nthis benefit to women who might want to have it. Indeed, if they are in \nthe private sector, they could get it.\n  Now, some say this is a gift of the Federal Government to these \nwomen. No, it is a benefit. It is a benefit that comes with the health \npackage that our Federal Government offers. It is like saying that a \nwoman could not use her private funds, her earnings, her salary, her \nwages from the Federal Government to obtain an abortion. Nobody is \nsuggesting that, because the Constitution says the woman has a right to \ngo out and buy this procedure--it is a legal procedure, a medical \nprocedure--and the right is held up by the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I think what is being attempted here is a very, very, \nunfair move against employees of the Federal Government.\n  Last, here is a notice that came out last year after this prohibition \nwas passed in the Congress.\n\n       Dear Blue-Cross and Blue-Shield benefit plan member:\n       On November 19, 1995, public law [so and so] was enacted \n     which limits the Federal Employees Health Benefit plans \n     coverage of legal abortions.\n\n  And then it says to the whole of the plan that they no longer can \ncover that. You are out of luck. If you are in the private sector, as I \nsaid, you can get this, but you cannot get it any longer if you are a \nFederal employee. There are 345 plans and none of them can be permitted \nto offer it. I think it is very, very unfortunate, Mr. President.\n  I hope the attempt to defeat the amendment is not successful.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the motion \nby the Senator from Ohio, and in support of full access to reproductive \nhealth care, including abortion services, for civil servants.\n  Last year, as my colleagues know, this Congress denied women who are \ncivil servants from participating in health insurance plans which cover \nabortion services. This overturned previous policy, which allowed these \nwomen--like millions of women employed in the private sector--access to \ncomplete reproductive health care.\n  Mr. President, major health insurers such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield \nprovide this coverage for women in private sector jobs across the \ncountry. It is approved of by a majority of the American public. By \ndenying the same options for Federal employees, we set a different \nstandard for millions of women. Nine million Americans are covered by \nthe Federal Health Benefits Program, and none of them should be denied \naccess to complete reproductive health care services. It sends the \nmessage that public servants do not have the same rights as private \nsector workers, and that is wrong.\n  Civil servants are no different that any other American. They are \nregular people: secretaries, engineers, maintenance workers, and \ncaseworkers. Why should they be treated any differently than other \nworkers? They pay for their premiums and deductibles like everyone \nelse, and they should be allowed the same options as other women in \nthis country. Civil servants are being asked to do tougher and tougher \njobs with the downsizing of our Federal government--and are stepping up \nto the task. They should not be required to make further sacrifices \nsimply because they are an easy target for those in Congress who would \noutlaw abortions all together.\n  Mr. President, we have all heard the stories of women who were forced \ninto very difficult situations as soon as this policy was enacted this \nyear. We heard\n\n[[Page S10276]]\n\nabout Susan Alexander who wanted to have the child she was carrying, \nbut found out gross fetal deformities made her child's development \n``incompatible'' with life, and threatened her life as well. Her \ndoctors all recommended terminating her pregnancy for medical reasons. \nUnfortunately, she and her husband were shocked to find that her \ninsurance policy no longer covered what turned out to be a very \ncomplicated and expensive procedure, performed to protect her life.\n\n  Mr. President, we know there are other women out there like Susan \nAlexander who have been directly affected by the decision made in this \nbody last year. We know that to continue this policy will have a \nserious and tangible impact on women's health. Therefore, it is \nirresponsible to continue to deny women access to a full range of \nhealth care services because Congress has turned the health care \nchoices of women into a political football.\n  Make no mistake about it, we are once again confronted with an \nattempt to deny women the rights they now hold. Women have the legal \nright of choice in this country, and the majority in this country \nsupport that right. This policy is micro-management of the worst kind, \nand it is wrong. The U.S. Congress should not be making reproductive \nhealth choices for Federal workers. Nor should it discriminate against \nFederal workers who choose to have an abortion.\n  By denying civil servants health coverage for abortion services, \nCongress does just that. It continues to force Federal employees and \ntheir families to purchase separate insurance to cover reproductive \nhealth services. It continues to add financial considerations to a very \ntime-sensitive, personal decision. And, above all, it reinforces the \nmessage to civil servants that the same rules do not apply to them. \nTheir health is subject to the political winds of Congress.\n  Mr. President, this is not reasonable to expect of people who are \ndedicated to serving the public good. I commend Senator Boxer for her \nvigilance and dedication on behalf of women everywhere, and thank her \nfor her leadership in protecting the rights of civil servants. Once \nagain, I urge my colleagues to reject this motion.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to support the committee \namendment which would strike House provisions prohibiting the Federal \nEmployee Health Benefits Program from providing coverage for abortion \nservices.\n  The vast majority of private health plans provide coverage for \nabortion services. The House bill is telling Federal employees that, \nbecause of who their employer is, they shouldn't have the ability to \nchoose a health plan which covers this legal medical procedure.\n  An employee who opposes abortions can choose a health care plan which \ndoes not cover the service, which I understand was almost half of all \nFEHBP plans prior to last year's prohibition. I don't believe, however, \nthat it is appropriate for us to preclude employees who want this \ncoverage from choosing it.\n  For this reason, I urge my colleagues to support the committee \namendment and vote against tabling this proposal.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this effort \nto reinstate the ban on abortions in Federal employee health benefits \nplans. It is yet another ripple in a steady stream of attacks on \nwomen's reproductive rights and health.\n  This debate is painfully familiar. One year ago, the Senator from \nOklahoma, Senator Nickles, offered an amendment, which--regrettably--\npassed this body and changed the status-quo of health care for Federal \nemployees and their dependents in America. It represented a giant step \nbackward for the rights and health of women who are covered by the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Plan [FEHBP]. It prohibited the FEHBP \nfrom covering abortions--except when the woman's life is in danger or \nin cases of rape or incest.\n  As the result of these restrictions, Federal employees and their \ndependents enrolled in FEHBP's who need abortions must pay for them out \nof their own pocket, except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the \nlife of the mother. This may result in significant hardship to a woman \nand her family, especially because many Federal employees have incomes \nat or below the poverty level, which is $12,980 for a family of three.\n  In fact, 25 percent of all Federal employees earn less than $25,000--\nwith nearly 18,000 Federal employees having incomes below or just \nslightly above the Federal poverty level. And while the average cost of \nan early abortion performed in a clinic is $250, the cost rises to \n$1,760 if performed on an outpatient basis in a hospital.\n  This means that some Federal employees may be forced to decide \nbetween paying for an abortion and buying food for their children or \npaying rent. Others may be forced to carry their unintended pregnancies \nto term. It is shameful that our Federal employees have such terrible \noptions.\n  Denying abortion coverage to Federal employees may also endanger a \nwoman's health. Restrictions that delay an abortion make it more likely \nthat a woman will continue a potentially health-threatening pregnancy \nto term, or undergo abortion procedures later in a pregnancy when they \nare far more risky to a woman's health.\n  Just because we have the power of the purse in Congress does not mean \nwe should have the power to penalize women in public service by denying \nthem their reproductive freedoms or threatening their health.\n  There are currently 1.2 million women of reproductive age who rely on \ntheir Federal health plan for their medical care--and that's 1.2 \nmillion American women who would be summarily stripped of their \nconstitutionally guaranteed right to choose because they or a family \nmember work for the Federal Government.\n  Federal employees should have no fewer rights than any other American \nworker who earns a health care benefit as part of their compensation \npackage.\n  Some argue that the Federal Government has a right to dictate which \nmedical services will be covered under the FEHBP. They argue that \nFederal tax dollars should not pay for abortions.\n  That's what some would like this debate to be about--taxpayer funding \nfor abortion. But that's simply not the case. In fact, that argument is \na red herring.\n  Taxpayers would not fund abortions covered by Federal health plans. \nFar from it. The Federal Government, like millions of private employers \nacross the country, contributes a portion of its employee's insurance \npremiums, and the employee pays the rest. Thus, FEHBP coverage is not \npocket money for Federal employees. It is not an allowance or a Federal \nhandout. It is direct compensation earned by Federal employees. And I \nwould like to note that CBO has determined that coverage of abortions--\na legal medical procedure--does not add to the cost of the premium.\n  This anti-choice restriction on Federal employees health benefits \narbitrarily and unjustifiably reduces their total compensation package. \nThe fact is, any service not covered by their health insurance which \nthey must pay for out-of-pocket amounts to a pay cut in their hard-\nearned wages. It is not for Congress to determine how those hard-earned \nwages should or should not be spent. Wages and benefits belong to the \nemployees.\n  According to the Office of Personnel Management, which oversees the \nFEHBP, between 1993 and 1995, 178 of the 345 FEHB plans provided \nabortion coverage. Of the ``Big Five'' health plans offered to Federal \nemployees, four of the five offered abortion coverage. This range of \noptions allows employees who object to abortions to choose any one of \nthe hundreds of Federal health plans that would not cover the \nprocedure.\n  Today, 78 million women in America have abortion coverage in the \nprivate sector. Two-thirds of private fee-for-service plans provide the \nfull range of reproductive health services, including abortions. And 70 \npercent of health maintenance organizations [HMO's] provide abortion \ncoverage.\n  Finally, a majority of people in America believe that abortion should \nbe safe, legal and rare. These Americans do not distinguish between \nwomen who work in the private sector and women who work for the Federal \nGovernment.\n  A person's ability to exercise a constitutional right should not be \ndetermined by an employer--even when the\n\n[[Page S10277]]\n\nemployer is the Federal Government. What we can and must do today is \nensure that we do not maintain the existing two-tiered system of rights \nfor our citizens--one for women who work for or are insured by the \nFederal Government, and another for those women who work in the private \nsector. We must not allow such discrimination to continue. And we must \nstop sending a signal to our Federal employees and their female \ndependents that we do not value their health or their reproductive \nrights. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to oppose this motion \nto table the committee amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today once again the radical right has come \nto this Senate floor to impose their will against the wishes of a vast \nmajority of Americans. They have come forth again to add an amendment \nto the Treasury, Postal Service, and general Government appropriations \nbill that would limit reproductive health services for 1.2 million \nfemale Federal employees.\n  The Treasury-postal bill provides the funding for the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program [FEHBP], our network of insurance \nplans that cover approximately 9 million Federal employees and their \ndependents. Today, there are approximately 1.2 million women of \nreproductive age who rely on the FEHBP for their medical care.\n  Mr. President, in the United States we have a Constitution that \nguarantees an extensive list of freedoms upon which the Government \ncannot infringe. Perhaps the sponsors of this amendment do not \nunderstand the issue at hand. The Supreme Court ruled in Roe versus \nWade that abortions are constitutional. It is completely legal for a \nwoman who wants to have an abortion to obtain the services of a doctor \nwho is willing to provide an abortion. Congress should not have the \nability to decree to a woman that she cannot obtain an insurance policy \nthat covers abortion, which is a fully legal procedure. This is not the \nrole of Congress. We have no right to impose ourselves and our sense of \nmorality in this way upon the women who work for the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Failing to make abortion illegal, antichoice Members of Congress are \ntrying to make this right more difficult to exercise. Singling out \nabortion for exclusion from health care plans that cover other \nreproductive health care is harmful to women's health and discriminates \nagainst women in public service.\n  In 1993 and 1994, Congress voted to permit Federal employees, like \nworkers in the private sector, to choose a health care plan that \ncovered a full range of reproductive health services, including \nabortion. It is my belief that health insurance is part of an \nemployees' earned compensation. As is common in private industry, costs \nfor insurance coverage for Federal employees are shared by the employer \nand the employee. This is similar to the private sector where \napproximately two-thirds of private fee-for-service plans and 70 \npercent of health maintenance organizations provide abortion coverage.\n  Despite these facts, last year Congress stripped Federal employees of \nthis right. This year, some Members are again attempting to restrict \nwomen's access to reproductive health services. Mr. President, this is \nnot right. It is a troublesome manifestation of the Congress' well-\nknown plantation mentality.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is unjustly restrictive and \ndiscriminatory. Passage of this amendment assigns an inferior status to \nwomen working in the Federal Government. It is time to stop these \nattempts to chip away at a woman's legal right to choose. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, would the Chair advise Members how much \ntime remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 8 minutes and 18 \nseconds under his control, and Senator Boxer has 4 minutes under her \ncontrol.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we are concluding this debate and we will \nshortly be voting on my motion to table the amendment.\n  Again, I think it is important that we keep our eye focused on the \nball. We can come down here in the well of the Senate and discuss for \nhours the issue of abortion. That is not what this debate really is \nabout. What this debate is about is a very narrow issue, a very narrow \nquestion, which is simply this: Should this body go against the will of \nthe American people? The vast majority of the American people, even \nthose who really have mixed feelings on the abortion issue, the vast \nmajority of the American people say, no, I do not want my tax dollars \nbeing used for abortion. That is what this is because 74 percent of the \npremium of the Federal employee is paid for by taxpayers; roughly \nthree-fourths of the premium is paid for by taxpayers.\n  This is a horribly contentious issue, an issue that divides families. \nIt is an issue that friends do not want to talk about. It is an issue, \nquite frankly, that the Federal taxpayers have said time and time again \nthat they do not want to be involved in, they do not want to fund.\n  We are not debating a woman's right to choose today. We are not \ndebating that. We are not debating what a person can do. We are simply \ndebating whether taxpayers are going to pay for this very, very, \ncontroversial procedure. That is what we really are talking about.\n  I yield to my colleague from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, just to summarize so Members know exactly \nwhat it is we are voting on. This is not, despite what has been said, \nthis is not an issue over whether or not a woman has the right to \nchoose to have an abortion. We do not change any constitutional \nrulings. We do not change anything in that regard.\n  This is simply an issue as to whether the taxpayer will be forced to \npay for an abortion of a Federal employee's demand for an abortion. Mr. \nPresident, 70 percent or more of the citizens of the United States, \nwhether they are pro-life, pro-choice, or neutral on the question, have \nconsistently stated in polls and surveys that, regardless of their \nposition, more than 70 percent have said no in an issue that is this \ncontroversial, which violates the conscience and religious beliefs of \nmany people, or that is simply a taxpayer issue. We do not believe the \ntaxpayer should be forced to pay for the abortion of someone else.\n  This goes one step further because it limits it to just Federal \nemployees. The Senator from Ohio wants to retain the policy that has \neffectively been in practice, totally, almost consistently for more \nthan 20 years, consistently supported by both Democrats and \nRepublicans, whether Democrats have been in control of the Congress or \nwhether Republicans have been in control of the Congress.\n\n  So I hope my colleagues will vote to maintain the current law--the \ncurrent law being that we will not force taxpayers to pay for the \nabortions of Federal employees. And we do allow exceptions to that \nrule: If the life of the mother is in jeopardy or in cases of rape or \nincest.\n  I think that is a reasonable policy, and it has been consistently \nsupported. I hope we retain that law.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have 4 minutes left, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And the other side has how much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 4 minutes 23 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield the remainder of the time to Senator Kerrey, \nwho has really worked hard in the committee to do the right thing, to \ngive Federal employees equal treatment with the 75 million other women \nthat have that choice in the private sector.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first of all, all Members have made up \ntheir minds on this issue. So it is not a question of trying to \npersuade anybody one way or the other. It is trying to say to the \nAmerican people, those of us who intend to vote for allowing Federal \nemployee health programs--as in this bill, their insurance money--to be \nused to pay for reproductive services, including legal abortions.\n  I have a great deal of respect for the Senator from Ohio, the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S10278]]\n\nIndiana, the occupant of the chair, and others who hold a different \nview. But when they come and say this is about using taxpayer money to \npay for abortions, really, the only way you can prevent taxpayer money \nfrom being used for abortions by Federal employees would be to actually \ncome in and prohibit their salaries to be used in any way at all for \nabortion, because their salaries are paid for with taxpayer money.\n  If my salary is paid for with taxpayer money, if I am already \nprovided a subsidy in my salary, what good does it do to say that they \ncan't have health insurance programs do it? We have two-thirds of the \nhealth insurance programs in the United States and 70 percent of the \nHMO's in the United States already providing reproductive services, as \nwell as legal abortions.\n  You are not really preventing taxpayer money from being used, not at \nall. If their salary is used to pay for abortion, that is taxpayer \nmoney. What you are doing is--you think that is what you are \naccomplishing, but you are not. What you are doing, in fact, is \nchanging the rules and saying to women who are Federal employees that \nyou are going to be treated differently than 70 percent of the other \nemployees that are out in the work force.\n  There are 9 million Federal employees, approximately 1.2 million \nwomen of reproductive age, who rely on the Federal Employee Health \nBenefits program for medical coverage. Until November 19, 1995, Federal \nemployees--like workers in the private sector--were permitted to choose \na health care plan that covered a full range of reproductive health \nbenefit services. So I say to citizens out there, who say, ``gee, I \nthink we ought to restrict use of the Federal Employee Health Benefits \nProgram for something that I don't want to pay for,'' that is not what \nyou get done. All you are saying is they can't use health care \nbenefits; you are not saying they can't use salary, which is taxpayer \nmoney as well.\n\n  In 1993 and 1994, Congress voted to permit Federal employees to \nchoose the health care plan that covered abortion. And from 1983 until \nthat time, Congress prohibited the Federal Employee Health Benefits \nProgram from covering abortion services, except in cases where the \nwoman's life was in danger.\n  Mr. President, one of the problems here--especially for lower income \nFederal employees, of whom we have a considerable number--is if you \nexamine what the American Medical Association has said in this case. \nThey have indicated, and they say it with evidence to back up the \nclaim, that restrictions such as this--that deter and delay women from \nmaking a legal choice--make it more likely that women will continue a \npotential health-threatening pregnancy to term or undergo abortion \nprocedures that would endanger their health. That is what the medical \ncommunity has said that has examined this.\n  So I hope the citizens that are listening to this argument will \nunderstand that this is really not about using taxpayer money. You \nwould have to restrict the use of salaries in order to accomplish that \nobjective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. All time \nof Senator Boxer has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield myself the balance of that time. In just a \nmoment--4 minutes, roughly--I will make a motion to table this \namendment. Let me, again, walk the Members through the procedure of \nexactly where we are.\n  The DeWine-Nickles motion to table will result in the following. This \nis what it means. First, that the status quo will remain. The law--as \npreviously passed by this Congress, by this Senate, by the House, and \nsigned into law by President Clinton--will remain the same. This vote, \na vote to table, is consistent with what the Senate did a little over a \nyear ago, by a vote of 50 to 44.\n  Again, Mr. President, we need to focus on the narrow issue before us. \nIt is so easy for us--because we all have strong feelings about the \nissue--to get engaged in a debate about a woman's right to choose, pro-\nlife issues, and even engaged in a debate about all kinds of different \nthings connected with the abortion issue. That's not what we are here \ntoday to debate.\n  We are here to debate a very narrow question: Should current law \nprevail, which restricts from Federal coverage, health insurance \ncoverage of Federal employees, one procedure--the abortion procedure--\nand allows it only in the case of rape, incest, or to save the life of \nthe mother? That is the issue. The issue is fundamentally, with all due \nrespect to my colleague from Nebraska, whether or not taxpayers are \ngoing to subsidize this at the rate of 74 percent. That is really what \nthe issue is all about.\n  The vast majority of the American people, time and time and time \nagain, have said ``no.'' The country is very divided on the abortion \nissue, but it is overwhelmingly against using Federal tax dollars for \nabortions.\n  Again, the motion to table will simply preserve the status quo, will \nreaffirm what the Senate did a year ago. Frankly, it is consistent with \nwhat the law was from 1984 to 1993. It was only changed when President \nClinton took office, for 2 years, and that law then was changed. So \nreally going back to 1984, until the current time, this motion to table \nis consistent with what the law has been during that period of time, \nwith the exception of 2 years.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, this morning we learned that Iraq fired a \nsurface-to-air missile at American F-16's patrolling the no-fly zone \nover what has now become an imaginary Kurdish safe haven in northern \nIraq. This latest challenge to the safety of American pilots and to the \ncredibility of American security guarantees in the Persian Gulf region \ncomes on the heels of Saddam Hussein's rejection of United States \nwarnings not to repair his air defense systems damaged by our cruise \nmissile strikes in southern Iraq.\n  The necessity of further United States military action against Iraq \nis now obvious. And by his actions, Saddam Hussein has made the \nstrongest argument for a disproportionate U.S. response of considerably \ngreater military significance than our military action last week.\n  Furthermore, Saddam's aggressive challenges to the United States, and \nhis success in reasserting his control in northern Iraq as his troops \nand the troops of his new Kurdish allies, the KDP, completed their \nconquest of the region on Monday, reveal the critical importance of \ncurbing the Clinton administration's tendencies to rhetorical \ninconsistency in defining its objectives, disingenuous explanations of \nits policy choices, and exaggerated claims of success.\n  Our strikes last week were in response to Iraq's conquest, in \nalliance with the KDP, of the Kurdish city of Irbil. But by striking \ntargets in the south, the administration chose not a disproportionate \nresponse to Iraqi aggression, but a minimal response that was \ndisconnected from the offense it was ostensibly intended to punish. As \none administration official put it: ``* * * We know that we did the \nright thing in terms of stopping Saddam Hussein in whatever thoughts he \nmight about moving south and in letting him know that when he abuses \nhis people or threatens the region, that we will be there. * * * we \nreally whacked him.''\n  Evident in that statement are the three harmful administration \ntendencies cited above. Our stated purpose to stop Saddam's abuse of \nhis people was quickly overridden by, in the words of another \nadministration official, the judgment that ``we should not be involved \nin the civil war in the north.'' And while administration officials at \nfirst suggested that our strikes in southern Iraq would affect Iraq's \naction in the north, they now emphasize that the strikes were intended \nonly to serve our strategic interest in restricting Saddam's ability to \nthreaten his neighbors from the south.\n  It is clear now that the erosion of coalition unity, evident in \nTurkey and Saudi Arabia's refusal to allow United States warplanes to \nundertake offensive operations from bases in those countries, had a far \nmore important influence on our choice of targets and the level of \nforce used than administration officials have admitted.\n  Most importantly, the President's claims that our strikes were \nsuccessful in achieving their objectives are belied by the events of \nthis week. By what measurement can we assert that Saddam has been \npersuaded to treat his people humanely; that he has been compelled to \nabide by U.N. resolutions and the terms of the cease-fire agreement; \nthat the containment of Iraq has been further advanced; and that the \nUnited States and our allies are strategically better off since we \nfired 44 cruise missiles at Iraqi air defense systems in the south?\n  Since those strikes, Saddam's Kurdish allies have achieved a complete \nvictory in the north, and Saddam has regained control of an area from \nwhich he has been excluded for several years. Kurdish refugees are \nagain flooding across the border. Saddam, in utter contempt for U.S. \nwarnings, has begun repairing the radar sites we struck last week. He, \nat least temporarily, split the Desert Storm coalition. And in \nviolation of the cease-fire agreement and U.N. Security Council \nresolutions, he has fired missiles at U.S. planes patrolling an \ninternationally established no-fly zone. As successes go, this one \nleaves much to be desired.\n  Clearly, Iraq's attempted downing of American planes requires a \nmilitary response from us. I have little doubt that the President will \norder a response. Given that Iraq's action represents a challenge not \njust to the United States, but to the international coalition \nresponsible for enforcing the no-fly zone, I would expect that we will \nhave greater cooperation from our allies than we experienced last week. \nThus our ability to take the disproportionate, truly punishing action \nwhich is clearly called for under the circumstances should not be \nlimited by the consequences of our failure to maintain coalition unity.\n  Decisions about the dimensions of our response are, of course, the \nPresident's to make. I pray that he will choose wisely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/11/senate-section/article/S10279-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10279-S10280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. EXON. Although there are many important things the U.S. Senate is \nin the process of doing right now, I want to pause for just a moment, \nif I might, to bring to my colleagues attention that yesterday, history \nwas made at the U.N. General Assembly. After nearly 3 years of intense \nnegotiations at the 61. Nation Conference on Disarmament, the world \ncommunity reached an agreement on a treaty to ban nuclear weapons \ntesting. This Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, strongly supported by all \nfive declared nuclear states, was overwhelmingly adopted by the U.N. \nGeneral Assembly on a vote of 158 to 3 with 5 abstentions, clearing the \nway for world's nations--actual and potential nuclear states alike--to \nsign the agreement later this month.\n  After over 40 years of nuclear weapons testing and more than 2,000 \ndetonations, this valuable tool in stemming nuclear weapons \nproliferation is finally within reach. In order for the treaty to enter \ninto force, each of the world's 44 nations identified as possessing \nnuclear weapons or the research capability necessary to develop them \nmust sign the comprehensive test ban agreement. As my colleagues are \naware, India has led a high-profile campaign to prevent this from \nhappening and frustrate the will of the world community to close the \nnuclear weapons Pandora's box. This temporary setback should not \ndiminish, however, the significance of yesterday's truly historic vote. \nI am confident that India will see the wisdom of halting the spread of \nnuclear weapons and sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty before too \nlong. In the meantime, mankind can celebrate the fact that for the \nfirst time in history, the world's superpowers have agreed to end the \ntesting of nuclear weapons forever.\n\n  Many of our allies played critical roles over the past 3 years in \nmaking passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty a reality. But I \nwish to take this opportunity to praise President Bill Clinton for his \nleadership on the issue of the Test Ban Treaty and nuclear weapons \nproliferation. The United States has been a world leader in halting the \nspread of nuclear weapons technology during the tenure of the Clinton \nadministration. The earlier extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty and now the completion of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty are \nimportant milestones in the history of arms control, and the President \ndeserves a great deal of credit in making it happen.\n  In addition to lauding President Clinton's dedication to this \nimportant aspect of our national security, I wish to praise the efforts \nof Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency head John Holum, and U.S. negotiator to the conference on \ndisarmament Stephen Ledogar.\n  I wish also to single out the tireless dedication of Senator Mark \nHatfield to the cause of a verifiable Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. As \nmy colleagues know, Senator Hatfield will be leaving the U.S. Senate at \nthe conclusion\n\n[[Page S10280]]\n\nof this session, ending 30 years of distinguished service to his \ncountry. I can think of no more fitting way to highlight the last few \nmonths of his career than yesterday's treaty approval. Four years ago, \nI joined him and former majority leader George Mitchell in authoring a \nlaw phasing out American nuclear weapons testing and jump-starting \ninternational negotiations designed to achieve a permanent test ban. It \nis, therefore, with a great deal of pride that I herald the action of \nthe General Assembly and look forward to the treaty signing ceremony \nlater this month. I remind the Senate, with Senator Mitchell gone and \nSenator Hatfield and myself leaving come January, the continued \nleadership in this area falls to Senator Levin and others to take up \nthe challenge.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senate and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who seeks \nrecognition?\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside just for the consideration of an amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5240\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished managers of the \nbill, and I thank my two colleagues who, for various reasons, at this \npoint in time have an interest in the floor procedure and have \npermitted me, as a matter of Senatorial courtesy, to proceed with the \nfollowing amendment which I send to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5240. On page 53, beginning on line 23, \n     strike ``and in compliance with the reprogramming \n     guidelines of the appropriate Committee of the House and \n     Senate.''\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to commend the \nAppropriations Committee, subcommittee Chairman Shelby and Senator \nKerrey for their efforts in including funding for security requirements \nin both the new construction and repair and alterations categories for \nthe Federal buildings program of the General Services Administration in \nthe fiscal year 1997 Treasury, postal appropriations bill.\n  The current security environment is uncertain and variable. \nUnforeseen circumstances, and events can radically change the \nrequirements for security expenditures in real time and at a moment's \nnotice as witnessed by recent tragic events in our Nation.\n  Current language in the Senate appropriations bill requires \ncompliance with formal reprogramming processes in order to use funds \nfor security purposes. While this requirement is an appropriate check \non security expenditures, and I commend my colleagues for their swift \naction in this area in the past, I remain concerned that during a \ncongressional recess, a delay in the implementation of reprogramming \nmeasures for security could impede actions necessary for the immediate \nprotection of our Federal work force.\n  My amendment would allow GSA to use any funds previously appropriated \nfor repairs and alterations and building operations and rental space to \nmeet minimum standards for security upon notification of the \nAppropriations Committee of the House and Senate that such a \ndetermination had been made.\n  I would also request that should my amendment be agreed to, \nclarifying report language be added stating the following:\n\n       The Committee has included requested funding for security \n     as a line item in both New Construction and Repairs and \n     Alterations in addition to amounts requested in Basic \n     Repairs. A provision authorizing the use of other repair \n     funds has also been included to ensure that the GSA can \n     respond quickly to safety and security requirements as they \n     are identified. Safety and security concerns are to be \n     addressed as a top priority in using capital funds provided \n     in the bill.\n\n  As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure, with oversight responsibility over the General Services \nAdministration, I have been pleased with GSA's actions to date in \nmeeting an enhanced level of security at GSA controlled buildings and \nfacilities. I would like to commend the Appropriations Committee for \nactions taken following the Oklahoma City bombing in the fiscal year \n1995 legislation, continuing reprogramming efforts approved by both the \nauthorizers and appropriators in fiscal year 1996, and now in the \nTreasury, postal appropriations bill that we have before us for fiscal \nyear 1997.\n  I think that all of my colleagues would agree that in light of the \nnew threatening environment we are under, resulting from incidents of \ndomestic terrorism like the Oklahoma City bombing, providing a safe and \nsecure environment for our Federal work forces and visitors to our \nFederal buildings should be the highest priority.\n  That is the intention of this amendment. I am pleased to learn from \nthe distinguished manager, the Senator from Nebraska, it appears it is \nacceptable. And Senator Shelby has, likewise, indicated that.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, both Senator Shelby and I have looked at \nthis amendment. We agree it is a good amendment. We appreciate the \nSenator from Virginia bringing it to our attention, and we are willing \nto accept it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5240) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \ncommittee amendment, and the Kassebaum amendment thereto, be laid aside \nin status quo. In explanation of that unanimous consent request, \nSenator Kassebaum is, I believe, in a meeting having to do with the FDA \nreform. There has been a lot of discussion back and forth about how to \nhandle these two amendments. The Senator from Oregon is here and is \ncontinuing to pursue his desire in this effort. He has been willing to \nhave these set aside for now so we can take up other issues, and \namendments can perhaps be agreed to, and perhaps other amendments can \nbe debated and voted on, if necessary. We will continue to work to see \nhow we can resolve that. I make that unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to \nobject, I just want it understood that I have spent the last couple of \nhours trying to work, in a bipartisan way, to address this, to address \nthe budgetary concerns. I want the majority leader, Senator Lott, to \nunderstand that I have no interest in prolonging this. I do want to \nprotect the rights of these vulnerable patients and get that done \ntoday. But I have no desire to prolong this.\n  Mr. President, we are going to continue, as the majority leader \nrequested,\n\n[[Page S10281]]\n\nto work to try to fashion something that is acceptable. We thought we \nhad something a minute ago, but, apparently, we have some more work to \ndo.\n  With that, I withdraw my reservation. I appreciate the majority \nleader trying to help us by setting that aside.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, was that request agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thought the Senator from Alabama was rising \nto speak on the request.\n  Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That has been done.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5224\n\n(Purpose: To limit the use of funds to provide for Federal agencies to \n furnish commercially available property or services to other Federal \n                               agencies)\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5224.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VI add the following:\n       Sec. 646. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), none of \n     the funds appropriated by this or any other Act may be used \n     by the Office of Management and Budget, or any other agency, \n     to publish, promulgate, or enforce any policy, regulation, or \n     circular, or any rule or authority in any other form, that \n     would permit any Federal agency to provide a commercially \n     available property or service to any other department or \n     agency of government unless the policy, regulation, circular, \n     or other rule or authority meets the requirements prescribed \n     under subsection (b).\n       (b)(1) Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall prescribe regulations applicable \n     to any policy regulation, circular, or other rule or \n     authority referred to in subsection (a).\n       (2) The requirements prescribed under paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) A requirement for a comparison between the cost of \n     providing the property or service concerned through the \n     agency concerned and the cost of providing such property or \n     service through the private sector.\n       (B) A requirement for cost and performance benchmarks \n     relating to the property or service provided relative to \n     comparable services provided by other government agencies and \n     contractors in order to permit effective oversight of the \n     cost and provision of such property or service by the agency \n     concerned or the Office of Management and Budget.\n\n                    Amendment No. 5224, As Modified\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I send a modification of the amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 5224), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the end of title VI add the following:\n       Sec. 646. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), none of \n     the funds appropriated by this or any other Act may be used \n     by the Office of Management and Budget, or any other agency, \n     to publish, promulgate, or enforce any policy, regulation, or \n     circular, or any rule or authority in any other form, that \n     would permit any Federal agency to provide a commercially \n     available property or service to any other department or \n     agency of government unless the policy, regulation, circular, \n     or other rule or authority meets the requirements prescribed \n     under subsection (b).\n       (b)(1) Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall prescribe regulations applicable \n     to any policy regulation, circular, or other rule or \n     authority referred to in subsection (a).\n       (2) The requirements prescribed under paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) A requirement for a comparison between the cost of \n     providing the property or service concerned through the \n     agency concerned and the cost of providing such property or \n     service through the private sector.\n       (B) A requirement for cost and performance benchmarks \n     relating to the property or service provided relative to \n     comparable services provided by other government agencies and \n     contractors in order to permit effective oversight of the \n     cost and provision of such property or service by the agency \n     concerned or the Office of Management and Budget.\n       (C) The regulation would not apply to contingency \n     operations associated with a national emergency.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to explain the amendment, if I may, \nand then ask that we have a vote on it. It has to do with the Federal \nGovernment's policy of more than 40 years that the Government should \nnot compete with the private sector in areas in which the private \nsector can legitimately function. In fact, the Government should rely \non the private sector to supply commercially available goods and \nservices.\n  However, this policy is too often ignored. For example, the Defense \nScience Board calculates that out of 850,000 full-time positions needed \nto provide commercial services for the military, 640,000 are held by \nFederal employees rather than private sector personnel.\n  I want to go back and talk about commercial services, however, \nbecause the modification that I sent to the desk exempts emergencies \nand exempts factors that are not routinely commercial completely from \nthe bill. There is a new administration policy that prompts this \nparticular amendment.\n  OMB has come out with a policy that grandfathers existing \nInterservice Support Agreements from cost-comparison requirements. In \nother words, it says if you have had this kind of Interservice Support \nAgreement, it is not even necessary to inquire as to what the cost \nwould be if, indeed, there would be savings in the private sector.\n  The Interservice Support Agreements permit one Federal agency to \nprovide goods or services to another agency. This new policy gives \nagencies until October 1, 1997, to go out and recruit business from \nother agencies, without performing any cost analysis.\n  The administration implicitly argues that this entrepreneurial \napproach to Government will save the taxpayers money--and they don't \neven know what the cost comparisons are. Some examples of existing \nISSAs are: Aerial photography, mapping services, laboratory services, \nprinting services. Other specific examples are: A U.S. Geological \nSurvey was hired by the Bureau of Reclamation to participate in the \nHigh Plains Groundwater Recharge Program. The project took twice as \nlong and cost three times as much as the private sector standard.\n  In Jacksonville, FL, the Navy Public Works Division recently \ncompleted a state-of-the-art environmental lab to provide routine \nhazardous waste characterization. These services are already available \nfrom the private sector, and the Navy intends to offer these services \nnow to other Government agencies.\n  Mr. President, this is not the concept that most of us have for \nGovernment. It is common sense, I think, that activities that are \nintegral to Government, activities for emergencies, for defense, \nactivities such as plane wrecks and all these things, those things, of \ncourse, are excluded under the bill. But when we are talking about \nroutine services that can be provided commercially in the private \nsector, then they should be.\n  There are a few examples of direct Government competition with the \nprivate sector. So there is a new policy that encourages the Federal \nGovernment to compete with the private sector. I think that is \nphilosophically wrong. Certainly, it hurts small business. There isn't \neven competition for projects --no public solicitation--the private \nsector never knows if there is a need that they could fulfill.\n  We did this, by the way, in the Wyoming legislature when I was there. \nWe had a bill that said that in those areas where the function can be \ncommercially carried out, there ought not to be competition by the \nGovernment, that there ought to be at least an analysis of the cost, \nand a fair analysis, so these things can be done, to the extent that it \nis possible, to save the taxpayers money and do it in the private \nsector. Numerous studies have shown that outsourcing can save the \nGovernment $9 billion to $10 billion annually.\n\n  Further, it seems to me that this process of having extra commercial \nactivities carried on by Government agencies circumvents the \nappropriations process. If an agency is able to do the work for another \nagency, it is likely to have more resources and employees than it \nreally needs to fulfill its primary mission. It may be wasting \ntaxpayers' resources and may need to be cut back. If an agency \nappropriations is cut and it recruits business, it is circumventing the \nappropriations\n\n[[Page S10282]]\n\nprocess. The amendment that we have simply indicates that none of the \ndollars in this particular appropriations can be used unless, and the \nrule says:\n\n       A requirement for a comparison between the cost of \n     providing the property or service concerned through the \n     agency concerned and the cost of providing such property or \n     service through the private sector.\n\n  It is very simple. It simply says that you have to take a look at \nletting the private sector do this and get the cost of that before one \nagency provides it to the Government sector for another agency.\n  I emphasize that we have been doing it for 40 years. This is a new \nOMB policy. It is a rule for the supplemental handbook. By the way, as \nto the handbook itself, I think we are going to hear--and we have heard \nfrom one agency, the Defense Department specifically--``Well, we will \nbe curtailed on a number of these essential support emergency \nactivities.''\n  Let me give you the modification first of all. It makes it clear that \nthe amendment does not apply to national security. Furthermore, this \nOMB rule has an exemption. Nothing in this amendment would change \nadvanced planning for contingencies; therefore, contingencies or \nemergencies, such as the Value Jet crash in the Everglades. There are \ntwo protections from that kind of thing. One is the rule itself, and \nthe other as the amendment to this bill.\n  So it just seems to me that if you believe in the idea that the \nGovernment ought to be contained to those things that are uniquely \nGovernment activities and that beyond that we ought to go to the \nprivate sector, we have a broader bill that we have had for some time. \nWe intended to have hearings on it. The hearings have been postponed \ntwice--once at the request of the minority. So we have been prepared to \nhave hearings on the broader bill. This one simply deals with the \nnewest OMB supplemental handbook proposition. It says that you have to \ncontinue to do what you have been doing; and that is consider the cost \nof doing it in the private sector.\n  It is hard for me to imagine that anyone can object to the difficulty \nof doing things that can be done in the private sector, and doing them \nin the private sector if they are going to save us money. The idea that \nyou can't do it in an emergency is not a valid one. It is not valid \nbecause of the handbook exemption. It is not valid because of the \nmodification that we have put on the bill. This kind of thing, of \ncourse, simply expands Government.\n  I mentioned that we introduced S. 1724, the Freedom From Government \nCompetition Act. It causes the Government to go outside. It causes OMB \nto study those things that are inherently governmental functions.\n  Senator Stevens plans to hold a hearing on this bill in September. \nThe Small Business Committee in the House has already held several \nhearings. But this is a smaller issue. While I am delighted that \nSenator Stevens will be holding hearings on the broader bill, there is \nreally no reason for small businesses to be caught under this Clinton \nadministration ISSA policy, the Interservice Support Agreement policy. \nThe amendment is very simple. It merely reaffirms existing law. It \nwould prohibit the appropriation of funds of one agency to provide \ncommercially available goods and services for another agency unless the \ncost comparison is done and more oversight is conducted on the \nagreement to provide more information about what we are doing. The \namendment will create private-sector jobs, which is what we talk about \nall the time on both sides of the aisle. It will help small businesses. \nIt will save taxpayer dollars and make Government smaller and more \nefficient.\n\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is we want Government to cost less. \nThis is a way to do that.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is a \ncommonsense amendment, a good-government amendment, and a pro taxpayer \nreform amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I would like to call up amendment No. 5237 \nand offer it as a second-degree amendment to the pending committee \namendment, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, this is a simple and straightforward \namendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend. Is there \nobjection?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I object, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor. Is \nthere objection to the unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes. There is objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GLENN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor. The \nobjection is heard. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I must oppose the amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Wyoming, Senator Thomas. The amendment would require \ncost comparisons and cost and performance benchmarks before any Federal \nagency can provide any other Federal agency with property or services.\n  I am a very strong supporter of increasing the efficiency of \nGovernment. Much of my effort over the last few years has been devoted \nto exactly that--passing the Chief Financial Officer Act, expanding \ninspectors general, and with the new procurement legislation we passed \nthat was the work of not only the White House in the last \nadministration but this administration and our Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, as well as people in the Pentagon. So we have a track record \nof working in these areas of increasing the efficiency of Government \nand along with it of having a greater reliance on the private sector \nwhich we have provided in some of the new procurement legislation for \nproviding goods and services to the Government.\n  In spite of that, I have difficulty supporting this amendment. Its \nimpact, I do not think, has been completely reviewed and I think it is \nunnecessary and perhaps too broad. Let me go into some of that in a \nlittle more detail.\n  First, I must oppose the amendment because a floor amendment on an \nappropriations bill does not provide an adequate opportunity in which \nto consider this far-reaching proposal, and it is, indeed, a far-\nreaching proposal. The Governmental Affairs Committee, as I think the \nproponent has already mentioned, actually has a hearing scheduled for \nnext week, September 19, on Senator Thomas' related bill, S. 1724. I \nknow we have had several hearings put off, and I understand that, and I \nunderstand the frustrations of people when they do not get appropriate \nhearings in committee to go ahead and opt for direct floor action. But \nconsideration in committee will consider that legislation that also \naddresses Government and private sector issues. Consideration by the \ncommittee with substantive jurisdiction is needed before this proposal \nshould be considered on the Senate floor. To bring the amendment to the \nfloor when the sponsor has a hearing in only 1 week before the \nappropriate committee I do not feel is the best way to proceed, the \nbest informed way to proceed on this issue.\n  Second, it is my feeling, having been into some of these things over \nthe last several years, the amendment is unnecessary. The economy act \nat section 1535 of title XXXI of the United States Code already \nrequires that an agency head determine that goods or services cannot be \nprovided as conveniently or cheaply by a commercial enterprise before \ngoing to another agency for those goods or services. The cost and \nperformance requirement of the present amendment would on their face \nhave basically the same result as the economy act.\n  The relation of the amendment to the current law is exactly the sort \nof\n\n[[Page S10283]]\n\nissue that should be discussed at a committee hearing. I think we also \nneed to examine the relation of the OMB regulations required by the \namendment to OMB's circular A-76 that currently governs agency cost \ncomparisons with private sector goods and services. To accept an \namendment in the Chamber that on its face largely duplicates existing \nlaw and regulation is not the best way to proceed.\n  This overlap also concerns me with regard to the franchise fund \npilots created by the Government Management Reform Act, GMRA, of 1994, \nwhich is Public Law 103-356. That act was a bipartisan effort of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, and it passed unanimously in the \nSenate. The GMRA, the Government Management Reform Act, franchise fund \npilots open up competition between agency service providers and the \nprivate sector for common administrative services. This program uses \nbasic market force principles to search for better, quicker, and \ncheaper services. OMB is currently overseeing this program, and we \nshould not enact new legislation that would affect it until we hear \nfrom OMB as to how this competition project is working.\n  My third objection to the amendment is that it is too broad. For \nexample, in its original version it had no exemption for national \nsecurity emergencies or danger to public health or safety.\n  Let me say right there that we had a letter from the Under Secretary \nof the Navy, John Hamre, who is working in these areas of better \nefficiency over in the Defense Department, and he felt it really gave a \nlot of trouble in this particular area.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Under Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                Washington DC, September 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and \n         General Government, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I have just learned of an amendment that \n     Senator Thomas is proposing to offer on the Appropriations \n     Bill for the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government. \n     The amendment would require that before one federal agency \n     can provide a service to another agency a cost comparison for \n     providing the service would have to be made between the \n     private sector and the government agency.\n       I recognize that the motivations behind this amendment are \n     very worthwhile. We should use the private sector as much as \n     possible for providing services; however, the unintended \n     consequences of this amendment would be devastating to many \n     of the cross agency operations that are now being conducted.\n       In its current form, this amendment could cost lives and \n     delay essential support that has to occur immediately in time \n     of emergency. Had this amendment been in place in the past, \n     the Department of Defense (DOD) could not have transported \n     equipment and material immediately for such catastrophes as \n     Hurricane Andrew, the Oklahoma City bombing, the search for \n     survivors and aircraft parts following the explosion of TWA \n     800, and numerous earthquake, fire and flood demands that are \n     placed on the Department. These are extensive inter-agency \n     arrangements for DOD support in times of emergency that are \n     totally undermined by this amendment.\n       I strongly urge you to defer action on the amendment being \n     offered by Senator Thomas until you have had an opportunity \n     to hold a hearing on the implications of the amendment. This \n     proposal while well intended, has far reaching consequences \n     which must be studied and understood.\n\n                                                    John J. Hamre.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. I understand though that this will be modified to \naccommodate that problem. I have not seen the modification yet \nspecifically, but I understand that Senator Thomas has modified his \namendment to address concerns raised by the Department of Defense \nconcerning national emergencies and that was one of the problems. I \nunderstand the amendment will provide an exemption for national \nsecurity contingencies. Maybe that will solve the problem, maybe it \nwill not, but that is a concern about the amendment, and I think the \nscope of it is still unclear.\n  If enacted into law in its original version, the amendment would \nappear to prohibit, for instance, some other things, and I do not know \nwhether these are covered under contingencies or not. It would appear \nto prohibit the CIA from contracting with NSA or DIA, the National \nSecurity Agency or the Defense Intelligence Agency, for classified \ngoods or services--for example, a spy satellite or equipment--without \nperforming cost comparisons and benchmarks. While OMB might try to \nprovide for such exemptions in the regulations required by the \namendment, the amendment, as I understood it, provides no limitations \non its comprehensive scope.\n  I am also concerned about the amendment's references to ``enforcing \nany policy or any authority in any other form.'' I put that in quotes, \nconcerned about the amendment's reference to ``enforcing any policy or \nany authority in any other form.''\n  I am not certain what this might include. It could be interpreted to \ncover the budget. It would seem even to cover apportionment of funds. \nAfter all, when OMB apportions funds, it conveys an authority to outlay \nfunds. How would this impact on interagency activities? I am not sure. \nMaybe it would be good. Maybe it would be bad. But these terms do \nconcern me. I do not believe we should enact into law such an \noverarching requirement, a very major piece of legislation, without \ncareful consideration of its scope and necessary exemptions.\n  The broad language of the amendment might also cover FFRDC's. Many \ntimes agencies contract with another agency such as DOE for goods or \nservices to be provided by FFRDC, and this arrangement would seem to be \ncovered by the amendment. I do not believe the Senate has sufficiently \nconsidered this proposal in order to subject the National Labs, the \nCenter for Naval Analysis, and other FFRDC's with the blanket \nrequirements of this amendment, and they would be affected by it. They \ncould not help but be affected by it.\n  Finally, I am concerned that there could be other situations that \nthis amendment would needlessly burden with reporting and study \nrequirements. There could be instances in which an agency contracts for \ngoods or services that another agency procures from other sources, even \nthe private sector. There are also revolving funds and many interagency \nreimbursable activities that would appear to be covered by the \namendment. And to subject all such activities to the terms of this \namendment, without certainty about the impact, concerns me very much.\n\n  Again, the sponsors of the amendment may hope that OMB will provide \nthe right exemptions for the right cases. But the text of the amendment \nis very, very comprehensive. Again, this is just another reason why I \nthink we should not enact into law legislative language of such broad \nscope--not today, anyway.\n  Next week, OMB's Deputy Director for Management, John Koskinen, will \ntestify before the Governmental Affairs Committee on various OMB and \nother agency initiatives to increase agency reliance on the private \nsector. That is one of the subjects of the hearing, and to create \nincentives for agencies to search for more economical ways to procure \ngoods and services. That hearing will be very informative as to this \ndebate. It should include this amendment, and that is where I think we \nshould consider this amendment, not here on the appropriations \nlegislation.\n  So I think I do not see any problem with recommending to my \ncolleagues, with something of this broad a scope--and this is not an \ninsignificant amendment, this is a major step in whatever direction it \nwould be leading and is very, very far-reaching--I think, to wait 1 \nweek until the head of OMB can give his testimony and give his opinion \non this and indicate to us how this would operate at the executive \nbranch level. It seems to me, that is not a delay that is intolerable.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I \nthink it is very far-reaching. It is not an innocuous little amendment; \nit is one that is very far-reaching, and after we know the scope of it \nbetter, it might be something I could well support. But I would like to \nhave Mr. Koskinen's testimony on it and have it before the committee so \nwe could explore, in a little bit more detail, the ramifications of \nthis or the implications of it before we vote on it in an \nappropriations bill acting on the floor today.\n  Mr. President, for all those reasons, I oppose the legislation and \nhope my colleagues support that position. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S10284]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SANTORUM). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nfrom Ohio. Let me see if I cannot respond to some of them.\n  First of all, they talk about a hearing. We have delayed hearings \ntwice now. We have asked for hearings, had them set up, they have been \ndelayed--once at Senator Glenn's request. I think it is time we move \nforward with this proposition.\n  It is a narrow amendment. It is not a broad amendment. It is not a \nwide-reaching amendment. As a matter of fact, it deals only with \ncircular No. A-76 and the language there where OMB has said, effective \nOctober 1997, ``The cost comparison requirements of this supplemental \nhandbook will not apply to existing or renewed ISSA or consolidation of \ncommercial services.''\n  This is not the broad bill that we have asked for a hearing on. It is \nnot nearly as broad as I think it ought to be to effect this idea that \nwe ought to be doing these things in the private sector. This notion \nthat somehow we are going to get more efficiency out of doing it out of \nGovernment is one, I think, we have gotten long past. So we will be \ndoing that, and we will be going further. This one only has to do with \nthe changes that have been made by OMB.\n\n  The idea, of course, that it will affect the letter that the Senator \nread from the Department of Defense probably is not applicable in the \nfirst place. However, we have, in order to make sure that is not the \ncase, amended and changed--modified the amendment with the language \nthat ``the regulations would not apply to contingency operations \nassociated with a national emergency.'' Clearly, I think that does \nthat.\n  I want to interject here to ask unanimous consent that Senator \nStevens, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and \nSenator Frahm be added as cosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. The idea that is far-sweeping and far-ranging is that \nthis has been in place for all these years until now. OMB simply \nchanged it. It puts it back where it was, before OMB changed this. So \nthe idea that it is an unknown is simply not true. It is simply not the \ncase. It simply says to OMB, you cannot enforce these new rules that \nyou put out that have changed what we have been doing now forever. So \nthat is really what it amounts to.\n  I think it is very important that we move on these. We have had some \nother debates today about whether there have been hearings or whether \nthere have not been hearings. It depends on which side you are on as to \nwhether that is important. But the fact is, this is a relatively minor \nchange and one that simply puts us back to where it is. If, in the \nhearings that subsequently occur, there is evidence that the OMB change \nis appropriate, then I urge the committee to authorize, in committee, \nthem to do that. In the meantime, I think we ought not remove the \nrequirements, the simple requirements that if you are going to offer a \nservice to another agency--not services for yourself, offer them for \nanother agency, which is a growing tendency within Government--that, \nfirst of all, you have to consider the outrageous notion of seeing if \nthere is an alternative that is less expensive. That is really not very \ndifficult. It is really not a new idea. Most people who do significant \nwork contracting try to get more than one idea of what it costs. That \nis what we are talking about here.\n  As a matter of fact, I mentioned the idea that the statute on \nefficiency continues to exist. The problem is OMB is not abiding by it. \nThat is the problem. It does continue to exist. It does say, yet, in \nthe statute, that we ought to be doing this stuff in the private \nsector. The problem is, it is not being adhered to. The procurement act \nprovides that an agency ``can provide another agency with goods and \nservices if the goods and services cannot be provided by contract as \nconveniently or cheaply as a commercial enterprise.'' That is the law, \nbut the rule negates that. That is what we are talking about. It is not \na widespread change, not an unknown. It simply says we ought to go by \nwhat it says in the economy act, and not change it by OMB.\n  So, I suppose if we are going to deal with a broader bill, which I \nhope we do--I hope we make some conversions more to private sector \nuse--then I agree we ought to take a look at it in the committee. This \npart of it, however, simply says, live under the law. It simply says, \ndo not change the law. Go ahead and ask that, when you want to provide \nservices to another agency, that the private sector ought to be \nexamined first to see if, indeed, that is a more efficient and more \neffective way to provide those services.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. THOMAS. We will ask when there are more people here.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from Wyoming \nyield?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes, I yield.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, after consultation with the Democratic \nleader and with the hope we can get a finite list and begin to work \nthrough these amendments, as we have done over the past couple of \nweeks, so we can get an agreement on amendments that we must, in fact, \nhave votes on, I ask unanimous consent that the following be the only \nfirst-degree amendments remaining in order to the Treasury-Postal \nService appropriations bill; that they be subject to second-degree \namendments which are relevant to the first-degree amendment; that they \nmay be offered in the first degree or in the second degree to a \ncommittee amendment; that the committee amendments be subject to \nsecond-degree amendments which are either on the list or relevant to an \namendment on the list, if that amendment has been offered to the \ncommittee amendment; that no motions to recommit be in order and that \nupon the disposition of these amendments and the committee amendments \nthe bill be read for a third time.\n  Mr. President, I submit for the Record the list.

Mr. President, I would like to say right here that if there \nare any additions made to this list, it will be only after consultation \nand agreement between the two leaders.\n  That is the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his cooperation. It \nis a rather lengthy list, unfortunately, but now we have, at least, a \nlist we can work on. Hopefully, we will both be able to work through \ngetting these amendments removed if they are not really relevant to \nthis bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just say, the majority leader and \nI have had the opportunity in the last couple hours to talk to our \nMembers and to urge their cooperation in coming forth with prospective \namendments. I would emphasize that they are prospective. I hope that in \nmany cases Senators would not feel compelled to offer them. Our hope is \nthat we can resolve this bill some time in the not-too-distant future.\n  I hope that all of our colleagues can work with us to limit the list \nof amendments, to limit the debate on the amendments, once they are \ncalled up, and to see if we cannot complete our work. I have asked \nMembers of our leadership to work with our caucus in order to put this \nlist together now in a realistic fashion. And I hope that only in those \ncases where Senators truly felt that it was essential that the \namendment be offered on this bill, that it be done so.\n  So I am urging cooperation, in concert with the majority leader, in \nthe hope that we can come to some completion successfully on this bill \nsome time in the not-too-distant future.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, did we get unanimous consent agreement on \nthat?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/11/senate-section/article/S10280-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 3662\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, it is my understanding we will each use \nabout 5 minutes, and then I think the two leaders want to propose a \nunanimous-consent request after that. So if we can proceed on that \nbasis, would that be satisfactory with my colleague?\n  Mr. THOMAS. That is fine.\n  Mr. GLENN. I ask unanimous consent that we have 5 minutes on a side \nto wrap this up, and then we will probably go to a vote after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I want to respond briefly to the comments \nmy colleague made a moment ago. This is a broad act. He said the \nEconomy Act of 1982 is really not working and that is one reason we are \nputting this in. I don't like putting other legislation that might not \nwork on top of legislation he says is already not working. Let's make \nwork the legislation that is in law now. I am all for that.\n  Basically, it does what we are proposing here. In fact, I have a copy \nof that Economy Act of 1982 here, and one of the things provided under \nsection 1335 under ``agency agreements,'' part 4 of paragraph (A) says: \n``The head of the agency decides ordered goods or services cannot be \nprovided as conveniently or cheaply by a commercial enterprise already \nrequired.''\n\n  I agree that should be lived up to. So then we come in with the \nlegislation that my colleague and friend, Senator Thomas, says is not \nas broad as I am interpreting it to be, and yet the words in it say \nthat ``except as provided in subsection (B)''--which I will get to in a \nmoment--``none of the funds appropriated under any other act may be \nused by OMB or any other agency to publish, promulgate or enforce any \npolicy, regulation, circular or any rule or authority in any other form \nthat would permit any Federal agency to provide a commercially \navailable property or service to any other Department of Government \nunless the policy, regulation, circular or other rule meets the \nrequirements in subsection (B).''\n  Subsection (B) says 120 days after this OMB will prescribe \nregulations as required, subject to the following, which shall include \nthe following: A requirement for comparison between the costs of \nproviding the property or service concerned through the agency \nconcerned and the cost of providing such property or service through \nthe private sector.\n  That is a mammoth requirement for any law or regulation to come out \nunder. The (B) part of that, which is the last part, is a requirement \nfor cost and performance benchmarks relating to the property or service \nprovided relative to comparable services provided by other Government \nagencies and contractors permitting the oversight of this--and so on--\nagency concerned with the Office of Management and Budget.\n  That is a very, very broad-reaching, extremely broad-reaching, \namendment.\n  I would say it is true, it is already covered under the Economy Act \nof 1982, as I quoted just a moment ago, and the best thing I would \nadvise is we bring this to the attention of Mr. Koskinen, who is going \nto appear before the committee next week, that we ask his opinion about \nhow broad-gauged this is and why he is not already enforcing the \nEconomy Act of 1982. That is the way to proceed, as I see it, in good \nGovernment, not just to automatically pass something that does the same \nthing that is not being adhered to in earlier legislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest we have that as our method of procedure. I \nam all for efficiency in Government, but I am not just for passing one \nlaw and covering up deficiencies in carrying out a law that is already \non the books and should be adhered to.\n\n[[Page S10286]]\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. How much time do I have \nremaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think for the interest of Senators, as \nI understand it, we are about to have a vote. Does the Senator from \nWyoming know approximately what length of additional time he will need \nto complete his remarks?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I believe I probably have about 2 minutes, and Senator \nGlenn has 1\\1/2\\ minutes. So I would guess less than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, assuming that is \nagreeable to the majority leader, to have the vote on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Wyoming no later than 6:20.\n  Mr. THOMAS. It is fine with me.\n  Mr. GLENN. That will be fine.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if that request was not made, I enter that \nrequest now. I ask unanimous consent that we have that vote not later \nthan 6:20, and before if all time is yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 2 minutes 5 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would agree with the Senator if what he \nis saying were the case, and I think it is not. We have indicated that \nthe statute requires under the Efficiency Act what we are asking here: \nthat there be this effort to communicate in the private sector and \nmeasure that cost.\n  The problem is this one right here. This is March 1996, called the \n``Revised Supplemental Handbook, Performance of Commercial Activities, \nExecutive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget.'' \nIt says:\n\n       The cost comparison requirements of this supplemental \n     handbook will not apply to existing or renewed ISSA's or the \n     consolidation of commercial services.\n\n  So it is not just a function of the law not being lived up to but, in \nfact, is a change that has been put in place by OMB. So that is what we \nare seeking to do. We are not seeking to change the law. We are not \nseeking to change the basic operation of this statute, but we are \nsaying that there are changes made by Executive order which remove that \nrequirement that those activities that are being carried on by one \nagency for another, not the activities for themselves, one agency for \nanother, that the requirement continue to exist as it has in the past, \nthat we see if there are commercial activities available at a lesser, \nmore efficient cost.\n  This is simply an effort to put back in place the requirement that \nhas been in place for a very long time, that for the activities that \nare acquired from another agency within Government, that there be an \neffort to determine if it can be done more cheaply, more efficiently in \nthe private sector.\n  This is not a new idea. This is an idea that now exists in law but \nhas been taken out of the law by OMB. This would put it back. It is not \nbroad. I hope very much that the Senator from Ohio, and his committee, \nwill take a look at this whole broad thing. But in the meantime, I \nthink we need to return where we were so that private industry can be \npart of this idea.\n  We have used it for a very long time. It has to do with being more \nefficient. It has to do with good Government. It has to do with \nstrengthening the private sector. I certainly urge my colleagues to \nvote aye.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield back the balance of my time, and \nassume my colleague does.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nMcConnell as a cosponsor to amendment No. 5232.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 5224, as modified, \noffered by the Senator from Wyoming. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.

(a) No later than 45 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Inspector General of each Federal \n     department or agency that uses administratively \n     uncontrollable overtime in the pay of any employee shall--\n       (1) conduct an audit on the use of administratively \n     uncontrollable overtime by employees of such department or \n     agency, which shall include--\n       (A) an examination of the policies, extent, costs, and \n     other relevant aspects of the use of administratively \n     uncontrollable overtime at the department or agency; and\n       (B) a determination of whether the eligibility criteria of \n     the department or agency and payment of administratively \n     uncontrollable overtime comply with Federal statutory and \n     regulatory requirements; and\n       (2) submit a report of the findings and conclusions of such \n     audit to--\n       (A) the Office of Personnel Management;\n       (B) the Governmental Affairs Committee of the Senate; and\n       (C) the Government Reform and Oversight Committee of the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (b) No later than 30 days after the submission of the \n     report under subsection (a), the Office of Personnel \n     Management shall issue revised guidelines to all Federal \n     departments and agencies that--\n       (1) limit the use of administratively uncontrollable \n     overtime to employees meeting the statutory intent of section \n     5545(c)(2) of title 5, United States Code; and\n       (2) expressly prohibit the use of administratively \n     uncontrollable overtime for--\n       (A) customary or routine work duties; and\n       (B) work duties that are primarily administrative in \n     nature, or occur in noncompelling circumstances.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment will address the abuses of \nAdministratively Uncontrolled Overtime--AUO--throughout the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The costs to taxpayers of AUO misuse, estimated at $323 million at a \nsingle Federal agency since 1990, are significant. With improper \noversight, AUO is likely to be costing the Treasury tens of millions of \ndollars a year. This amendment will empower the Office of Personnel \nManagement [OPM] to stop these abuses.\n  First, it directs the Inspector General [IG] of each agency that \nutilizes AUO to audit its use and cost. The findings of these audits \nmust be reported to the Congress and the Office of Personnel Management \nwithin 45 days.\n  Second, OPM shall review these IG audits, and issue revised \nguidelines to the respective agencies to limit the use of AUO to its \nstatutory intent. These strengthened guidelines shall prohibit the use \nof AUO for routine or inappropriate work duties.\n  The amendment directs OPM to issue these new guidelines, to prevent \nthe ongoing misuse of AUO, within 30 days of receiving the Inspector \nGeneral audits.\n  For my colleagues who, like myself, have not been acutely aware of \nthe details and minutiae of Federal overtime policies, let me briefly \ndescribe AUO and how it can readily be fixed on behalf of taxpayers in \nthis appropriations bill.\n  ``Administratively Uncontrolled Overtime'' was authorized by Congress \nto pay overtime to law enforcement officers for vital investigative \nduties that require them to work irregular and unscheduled hours--\npursuing suspects, undercover work, special investigative operations, \net cetera. That makes sense. Agency regulations stipulate that AUO \nshould be reserved for work duties that are ``compelling'' and where it \nwould be negligent for officers to stop their enforcement actions.\n  What has been going on, however, for too many of the 6,300 employees \nreceiving AUO, is that it has turned into a unjustified salary and \nretirement supplement for the most routine work duties imaginable. And \nthat makes no sense whatsoever for taxpayers.\n  I'd like to describe the abuses of AUO that occurred in a single \nFederal agency in my State, as revealed by a selfless Federal employee \nwho stood much to lose by uncovering this waste.\n  One Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS] officer in Arizona \nreported that every single officer and supervisor at his facility was \nreceiving the maximum AUO possible, despite the fact that ``In two \nyears . . . not one legitimately qualifying AUO hour has been worked in \nmy department.''\n  Mr. President, somehow those duties don't sound like ``hot pursuit'' \nto me. They certainly are necessary, but they do not meet the statutory \ncriteria for AUO. This is not an isolated problem of mere local \nconcern. Both the Inspector General and the INS's top policymakers have \nrecognized this ongoing abuse of AUO.\n  The INS investigated the use of AUO at a detention facility in \nArizona and found that: ``None of the work performed [in Florence] met \nthe criteria for AUO, because the overtime hours could be \nadministratively controlled.''\n  The Inspector General at the Department of Justice then further \ninvestigated this INS facility, and the IG's findings provide the \nperfect rationale for this amendment. The IG stated that ``[W]e \nencountered no information [at the INS detention center] to demonstrate \nefforts to follow up on or implement'' the INS's own recommendations.\n  The IG recommended that ``The issue of AUO needs to be systematically \naddressed.'' That is exactly what this amendment would accomplish.\n  I would like to add that ``Citizens Against Government Waste'' have \nendorsed this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that some accompanying material be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 11, 1996]\n\n          INS Accused of Tolerating Citizenship Testing Fraud\n\n                         (By William Branigin)\n\n       The Immigration and Naturalization Service came under fire \n     yesterday from congressional Republicans over allegations of \n     fraud in the testing of new citizenship applicants and the \n     payment of millions of dollars in overtime to federal law \n     enforcement officers.\n       In a hearing of the House Government Reform and Oversight \n     subcommittee on national security Republican members assailed \n     what they described as a ``controversial Clinton \n     administration program,'' called Citizenship USA, that has \n     streamlined naturalization procedures and helped produce \n     record numbers of new citizens this year.\n       Rep. Mark Edward Souder (R-Ind.) charged that a program in \n     which the INS licenses private organizations to test \n     applicants on U.S. civics and English proficiency has led to \n     ``serious instances of testing fraud in the citizenship \n     process.'' He said the INS ``has done a very poor job of * * \n     * cracking down on testing fraud'' and suggested that the \n     Clinton administration is pushing naturalization as part of a \n     plan to enlist large numbers of new Democratic voters in time \n     for the November elections.\n       T. Alexander Aleinikoff, executive associate commissioner \n     of the INS for programs, rejected those charges. He said the \n     agency has tightened monitoring of the privatized testing, \n     which began under the previous Republican administration, and \n     defended the Citizenship USA program as a needed response to \n     an upsurge of applicants that threatened to overwhelm the \n     naturalization system.\n       While Republicans see politics behind the processing of \n     this year's record 1 million-plus citizenship applicants, \n     administration officials regard the subcommittee's \n     investigation itself as politically motivated.\n       Among the witnesses at yesterday's hearing was Jewell \n     Elghazali, who formerly worked in Dallas for Naturalization \n     Assistance Services, Inc., one of six entities authorized by \n     INS to test immigrants on civics and English as part of the \n     naturalization process.\n       ``There is a lot of fraud going on'' in the programs, she \n     testified. When she alerted a superior in the company to \n     indications of cheating on tests administered by affiliates, \n     she was fired, she said.\n       Elghazali said that in grading tests during her five months \n     at the firm, she found numerous cases in which the written \n     answers of different applicants were in the same handwriting \n     and responses to multi-choice questions--including wrong \n     answers--were identical. She said that in many cases, \n     applicants who had passed the test could not speak English \n     when they called to inquire about the results. Some Spanish \n     speakers became irate when there was no one in the office who \n     could respond to them in their native language, she said.\n       Paul W. Roberts, the chief executive officer of \n     Naturalization Assistance Services, told the subcommittee \n     that the firm has ``acted swiftly to revoke all licensees \n     discovered engaging in improprieties.'' He said the for-\n     profit company has shut down 43 of its test sites as a result \n     of its own monitoring and argued that, in any case, passing \n     the standardized test does not automatically guarantee \n     citizenship for an applicant, who must still pass an \n     interview with an INS examiner.\n       INS Commissioner Doris M. Meissner acknowledged that \n     ``there have been problems'' with the company, which has been \n     warned that it faces suspension unless cleared by an INS \n     review. ``If we need to suspend them, we will,'' she said. \n     But she insisted that ``there is no validity to the notion \n     that people are becoming citizens today who would not have 10 \n     years ago'' because of a lowering of standards. She said \n     citizenship requirements have remained unchanged.\n       In a separate news conference yesterday, Sen. John McCain \n     (R-Ariz.) called for a congressional investigation into \n     alleged abuses\n\n[[Page S10288]]\n\n     by the INS and other government agencies of a type of \n     overtime pay. He cited a report by a watchdog group, Citizens \n     Against Government Waste, that the INS has spent $323 million \n     on ``administratively uncontrollable overtime'' since 1990, \n     much of it in violation of regulations.\n       The overtime pay, amounting to as much as 25 percent of \n     many employees' salaries, has become an ``entitlement \n     program'' that wastes tens of millions of dollars a year, the \n     watchdog group charged.\n       While the overtime is supposed to compensate law \n     enforcement officers for working long hours on investigations \n     or surveillance, it has been used routinely to pay for \n     mundane duties such as delivering mail, guarding prisoners \n     during meal times and substituting for absent employees, the \n     citizens group charged. Besides the INS, ``administratively \n     uncontrollable overtime'' has been used in the departments of \n     justice, defense, interior and agriculture, the group said.\n       Meissner said that in principle, the overtime category ``is \n     a very good deal for the taxpayers.'' But she conceded that \n     there has been a tendency to misuse it as ``an ongoing \n     bonus'' and vowed renewed efforts to ensure it is properly \n     managed.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   [From the Tribune, Sept. 2, 1996]\n\n         INS To Review Overtime Policies After Charges of Abuse\n\n                       (By the Associated Press)\n\n       FLORENCE.--The Immigration and Naturalization Service will \n     review its policies for filing overtime after government and \n     civic groups showed it improperly spent millions of dollars \n     on overtime.\n       The agency's decision followed criticism by U.S. Sen. John \n     McCain and a citizens watchdog group, which released a report \n     last week estimating that the INS office here spent $60 \n     million on overtime last year alone.\n       The extra payments allow officers to pad their pensions and \n     up their salaries by as much as 25 percent, according to the \n     Citizens Against Government Waste.\n       At issue is special pay called Administratively \n     Uncontrollable Overtime (AUO). The fund was created to \n     compensate federal officers for duties that require irregular \n     hours, such as surveillance or undercover work.\n       Federal rules say such overtime can be used only for \n     ``uncontrollable'' overtime--work that can't be regulated or \n     routinely scheduled by supervisors.\n       According to government reports, the INS managers in \n     Florence are using the fund for day-to-day duties, such as \n     delivering mail, guarding prisoners during meals, going to \n     court and filling in for absent employees.\n       Documents obtained by The Arizona Republic show a 1995 INS \n     probe and another in April 1996 by the Justice Department's \n     Office of the Inspector General concluded the practice being \n     abused.\n       ``None of the work performed in Florence met the criteria \n     for AUO because the overtime hours could be administratively \n     controlled,'' the 1995 INS report said.\n       Virginia Kice, spokeswoman for the INS Western Region, said \n     the agency is aware of the concerns and is conducting a \n     review of the policy.\n       ``We want to be sure that whatever we do is not only \n     appropriate, that it's prudent, it's responsible and it won't \n     have a negative impact on our enforcement operation,'' she \n     said.\n       According to John Raidt, McCain's legislative director, \n     such abuse is likely rampant in government agencies. The \n     special overtime is available for employees of at least four \n     agencies: the Justice Department, which includes INS; the \n     Defense Department; the Department of Interior; and the \n     Department of Agriculture.\n       McCain plans to amend a Senate appropriations bill to place \n     tighter restrictions on such overtime and will ask for \n     hearings this fall before the Senate Governmental Affairs \n     Committee, Raidt said.\n       Critics say INS supervisors have an incentive to keep \n     paying the special overtime. If managers supervise employees \n     who qualify for the extra pay, then the managers also qualify \n     for the money, according to federal guidelines.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5252\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding section 8116 of title 5, United \n     States Code, and in addition to any payment made under 5 \n     U.S.C. 8101 et seq., beginning in fiscal year 1997 and \n     thereafter, the head of any department or agency is \n     authorized to pay from appropriations made available to the \n     department or agency a death gratuity to the personal \n     representative (as that term is defined by applicable law) of \n     a civilian employee of that department or agency whose death \n     resulted from an injury sustained in the line of duty on or \n     after August 2, 1990: Provided, That payments made pursuant \n     to this section, in combination with the payments made \n     pursuant to sections 8133(f) and 8134(a) of such title 5 and \n     section 312 of Public Law 103-332 (108 Stat. 2537), may not \n     exceed a total of $10,000 per employee.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, my amendment is quite simple. It \nincreases the reimbursement for funeral and burial costs and specific \nrelated expenses to $10,000 for Federal civilian employees who die as \nresult of injuries sustained in the performance of duty. This amendment \nwould apply to the dedicated civil servants who were tragically killed \nin the line of duty while accompanying Commerce Secretary Ron Brown on \nhis trade mission to Bosnia and Croatia. And it would apply to the \nsurvivors of those Federal civilian employees who died during the \nbombing of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City.\n  Under current law, Federal civilian employees who die in the \nperformance of duty receive only a $1,000 reimbursement for funeral and \nburial costs, and related expenses. This amount was set in 1960, and it \nhas not been adjusted since that time.\n  This is not the case for military personnel. In 1990, at the \nbeginning of the gulf war, Congress increased death-related benefits \nfor the survivors of the military personnel killed in the line of duty. \nMilitary survivors are currently provided slightly more than $10,000 \nfor funeral and burial costs.\n  My amendment recognizes that civilian employees are no less dedicated \nand they are all too often called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice \nin the service of the United States. Further, I should note that this \namendment does not require additional appropriations. It provides the \ndiscretion to agency heads to pay these increased benefits from \nexisting appropriations.\n  Mr. President, in short, this amendment provides for equity and \nupdates current law. This is a good amendment that I believe all my \ncolleagues should support.\n  I urge its adoption.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5253\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for training of explosive detection canines)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.  .

Although progress \n     has been made in recent years, Federal accounting standards \n     have not been uniformly implemented in financial management \n     systems for agencies.\n       (2) Federal financial management continues to be seriously \n     deficient, and Federal financial management and fiscal \n     practices have failed to--\n       (A) identify costs fully;\n       (B) reflect the total liabilities of congressional actions; \n     and\n       (C) accurately report the financial condition of the \n     Federal Government.\n       (3) Current Federal accounting practices do not accurately \n     report financial results of the Federal Government or the \n     full costs of programs and activities. The continued use of\n\n[[Page S10289]]\n\n     these practices undermines the Government's ability to \n     provide credible and reliable financial data and encourages \n     already widespread Government waste, and will not assist in \n     achieving a balanced budget.\n       (4) Waste and inefficiency in the Federal Government \n     undermine the confidence of the American people in the \n     Government and reduce the Federal Government's ability to \n     address vital public needs adequately.\n       (5) To rebuild the accountability and credibility of the \n     Federal Government, and restore public confidence in the \n     Federal Government, agencies must incorporate accounting \n     standards and reporting objectives established for the \n     Federal Government into their financial management systems so \n     that all the assets and liabilities, revenues, and \n     expenditures or expenses, and the full costs of programs and \n     activities of the Federal Government can be consistently and \n     accurately recorded, monitored, and uniformly reported \n     throughout the Federal Government.\n       (6) Since its establishment in October 1990, the Federal \n     Accounting Standards Advisory Board (hereinafter referred to \n     as the ``FASAB'') has made substantial progress toward \n     developing and recommending a comprehensive set of accounting \n     concepts and standards for the Federal Government. When the \n     accounting concepts and standards developed by FASAB are \n     incorporated into Federal financial management systems, \n     agencies will be able to provide cost and financial \n     information that will assist the Congress and financial \n     managers to evaluate the cost and performance of Federal \n     programs and activities, and will therefore provide important \n     information that has been lacking, but is needed for improved \n     decisionmaking by financial managers and the Congress.\n       (7) The development of financial management systems with \n     the capacity to support these standards and concepts will, \n     over the long term, improve Federal financial management.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) provide for consistency of accounting by an agency from \n     one fiscal year to the next, and uniform accounting standards \n     throughout the Federal Government;\n       (2) require Federal financial management systems to support \n     full disclosure of Federal financial data, including the full \n     costs of Federal programs and activities, to the citizens, \n     the Congress, the President, and agency management, so that \n     programs and activities can be considered based on their full \n     costs and merits;\n       (3) increase the accountability and credibility of Federal \n     financial management;\n       (4) improve performance, productivity and efficiency of \n     Federal Government financial management;\n       (5) establish financial management systems to support \n     controlling the cost of Federal Government;\n       (6) build upon and complement the Chief Financial Officers \n     Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-576; 104 Stat. 2838), the \n     Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law \n     103-62; 107 Stat. 285), and the Government Management Reform \n     Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-356; 108 Stat. 3410); and\n       (7) increase the capability of agencies to monitor \n     execution of the budget by more readily permitting reports \n     that compare spending of resources to results of activities.\n\n     SEC. ____03. IMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT \n                   IMPROVEMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each agency shall implement and maintain \n     financial management systems that comply with Federal \n     financial management systems requirements, applicable Federal \n     accounting standards, and the United States Government \n     Standard General Ledger at the transaction level.\n       (b) Priority.--Each agency shall give priority in funding \n     and provide sufficient resources to implement this title.\n       (c) Audit Compliance Finding.--\n       (1) In general.--Each audit required by section 3521(e) of \n     title 31, United States Code, shall report whether the agency \n     financial management systems comply with the requirements of \n     subsection (a).\n       (2) Content of reports.--When the person performing the \n     audit required by section 3521(e) of title 31, United States \n     Code, reports that the agency financial management systems do \n     not comply with the requirements of subsection (a), the \n     person performing the audit shall include in the report on \n     the audit--\n       (A) the name and position of any officer or employee \n     responsible for the financial management systems that have \n     been found not to comply with the requirements of subsection \n     (a);\n       (B) all facts pertaining to the failure to comply with the \n     requirements of subsection (a), including--\n       (i) the nature and extent of the noncompliance;\n       (ii) the primary reason or cause of the noncompliance;\n       (iii) any official responsible for the noncompliance; and\n       (iv) any relevant comments from any responsible officer or \n     employee; and\n       (C) a statement with respect to the recommended remedial \n     actions and the timeframes to implement such actions.\n       (d) Compliance Determination.--\n       (1) In general.--No later than the date described under \n     paragraph (2), the Director, acting through the Controller of \n     the Office of Federal Financial Management, shall determine \n     whether the financial management systems of an agency comply \n     with the requirements of subsection (a). Such determination \n     shall be based on--\n       (A) a review of the report on the applicable agency-wide \n     audited financial statement;\n       (B) the agency comments on such report; and\n       (C) any other information the Director considers relevant \n     and appropriate.\n       (2) Date of determination.--The determination under \n     paragraph (1) shall be made no later than 90 days after the \n     earlier of--\n       (A) the date of the receipt of an agency-wide audited \n     financial statement; or\n       (B) the last day of the fiscal year following the year \n     covered by such statement.\n       (e) Compliance Implementation.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Director determines that the \n     financial management systems of an agency do not comply with \n     the requirements of subsection (a), the head of the agency, \n     in consultation with the Director, shall establish a \n     remediation plan that shall include the resources, remedies, \n     and intermediate target dates necessary to bring the agency's \n     financial management systems into compliance.\n       (2) Time period for compliance.--A remediation plan shall \n     bring the agency's financial management systems into \n     compliance no later than 2 years after the date on which the \n     Director makes a determination under paragraph (1), unless \n     the agency, with concurrence of the Director--\n       (A) determines that the agency's financial management \n     systems are so deficient as to preclude compliance with the \n     requirements of subsection (a) within 2 years;\n       (B) specifies the most feasible date for bringing the \n     agency's financial management systems into compliance with \n     the requirements of subsection (a); and\n       (C) designates an official of the agency who shall be \n     responsible for bringing the agency's financial management \n     systems into compliance with the requirements of subsection \n     (a) by the date specified under subparagraph (B).\n       (3) Transfer of funds for certain improvements.--For an \n     agency that has established a remediation plan under \n     paragraph (2), the head of the agency, to the extent provided \n     in an appropriation and with the concurrence of the Director, \n     may transfer not to exceed 2 percent of available agency \n     appropriations to be merged with and to be available for the \n     same period of time as the appropriation or fund to which \n     transferred, for priority financial management system \n     improvements. Such authority shall be used only for priority \n     financial management system improvements as identified by the \n     head of the agency, with the concurrence of the Director, and \n     in no case for an item for which Congress has denied funds. \n     The head of the agency shall notify Congress 30 days before \n     such a transfer is made pursuant to such authority.\n       (4) Report if noncompliance within time period.--If an \n     agency fails to bring its financial management systems into \n     compliance within the time period specified under paragraph \n     (2), the Director shall submit a report of such failure to \n     the Committees on Governmental Affairs and Appropriations of \n     the Senate and the Committees on Government Reform and \n     Oversight and Appropriations of the House of Representatives. \n     The report shall include--\n       (A) the name and position of any officer or employee \n     responsible for the financial management systems that have \n     been found not to comply with the requirements of subsection \n     (a);\n       (B) the facts pertaining to the failure to comply with the \n     requirements of subsection (a), including the nature and \n     extent of the noncompliance, the primary reason or cause for \n     the failure to comply, and any extenuating circumstances;\n       (C) a statement of the remedial actions needed; and\n       (D) a statement of any administrative action to be taken \n     with respect to any responsible officer or employee.\n       (f) Personal Responsibility.--Any financial officer or \n     program manager who knowingly and willfully commits, permits, \n     or authorizes material deviation from the requirements of \n     subsection (a) may be subject to administrative disciplinary \n     action, suspension from duty, or removal from office.\n\n     SEC. ____04.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title shall take effect on October 1, 1996.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I offer an amendment that has already \npassed the Senate as a free-standing bill called the Federal Financial \nManagement Improvement Act of 1996 (S. 1130). This measure brings \nurgent reforms to Federal financial management and restores \naccountability to the Government. The Senate should include this \nmeasure in the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government \nappropriations bill because it is our best hope for enacting these \nimportant reforms into law this year. There is very little time left in \nthis session and it is of the utmost importance that Congress send this \nmeasure to the President before we leave town. However, I strongly \nencourage efforts currently underway in the House Government Reform and \nOversight Committee to pass S. 1130. Chairman Clinger as well as \nGovernment Management Subcommittee Chairman Horn are working hard on \nthe bill and I hope they are able to get it through the House of \nRepresentatives during these busy weeks.\n  Mr. President, I'll make just a brief statement on financial \nmanagement reform. Several years ago, in an effort to identify excess \nspending in the Federal budget, I inquired as to overhead costs in \nFederal programs. I was advised that the Federal accounting system \nmakes it impossible to identify overhead expenses for most Federal \noperations. The Federal Government, it turned out, has over 200 \nseparate primary accounting systems, making it impossible to compare \nsomething as basic as overhead costs.\n  Worse, many of these systems are shamefully inadequate even on their \nown terms. The Internal Revenue Service offers another disturbing \nexample of poor financial management and its consequences. The General \nAccounting Office testified before the Governmental Affairs Committee \non June 6, 1996, that despite years of criticism, ``fundamental, \npersistent problems remain uncorrected'' at the IRS. For example, the \nIRS cannot substantiate the amounts reported for specific types of \ntaxes collected, such as Social Security taxes, income taxes, and \nexcise taxes. The IRS cannot even verify a significant portion of its \nown nonpayroll operating expenses, which total $3 billion. One can \nhardly resist observing that this is the agency that demands precision \nfrom every taxpayer in America.\n\n  The IRS is just a small part of a Government so massive and complex \nthat it controls and directs cash resources of almost $2 trillion per \nyear, issuing 900 million checks and maintaining a payroll and benefits \nsystem for over 5 million Government employees. Clearly it is \nimperative that the Government use a uniform and widely accepted set of \naccounting standards across the hundreds of agencies and departments \nthat make up this Government.\n  Enactment of this measure into law would be a great step toward \nputting Federal financial management in order. It requires that all \nFederal agencies implement and maintain uniform accounting standards. \nThe result will be more accurate and reliable information for program \nmanagers and leaders in Congress, meaning better decisions will be \nmade: tax dollars will be put to better use, and a measure of \nconfidence in the Government will be restored. While this is not the \nkind of legislation that makes headlines, it is of great significance. \nIts passage would be a major accomplishment for the 104th Congress.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the amendments I have offered are as \nfollows: One is for Senator Stevens, to provide that the ACIR utilize \nnonappropriated funds for continued operations; for Senator Inhofe, to \nstrike section 404 of the bill; for Senator McCain, regarding a study \nof the administratively uncontrollable overtime; for Senator Hollings, \nto provide certain death benefits to civilian Government employees; for \nmyself and Senator Kerrey, regarding explosive detection training for \ncanines; for myself, naming the new courthouse in Portland, OR; for \nSenator Brown, regarding Federal financial management improvement.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, we have reviewed the amendments on this \nside, and we support all of them.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these \namendments be considered and agreed to, en bloc, and that any \naccompanying statements be placed at the appropriate place in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (No. 5249 through 5255), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the chairman withhold?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I am glad to withhold.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside so that I may be allowed to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Reserving the right to object, I would like to check with \nSenator Kassebaum on her amendment, and also Senator Wyden, who has \nbeen conferring with her, before we do that.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Did the Senator from Alabama ask unanimous consent to lay \naside----\n  Mr. SHELBY. The Senator from Nevada asked unanimous consent. What\n\n[[Page S10291]]\n\nwe would like to know is, where are the Senator and Senator Kassebaum \non the amendment?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Senator Kassebaum and I are continuing to discuss these \nmatters. I think it is fair to say, in fact, that Senator Kassebaum \nindicated that she thought it was appropriate to go on with further \nbusiness, and we will continue to discuss the matters with respect to \nthe gag rule a bit more.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I have no objection to temporarily setting aside the \nKassebaum amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will shortly send the amendment to the \ndesk on my behalf and that of Senator Levin and that of Senator Biden.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot in this Chamber about the issue of \nreimbursing the former employee of the White House Travel Office, Billy \nDale, for attorney fees. There have been hours of talk in this Chamber \nabout that issue. Unfortunately, Mr. President, much of what we have \nheard has been based on emotion and not on facts. In fact, there is \nvery little, if any, factual support for this very costly expenditure \nof a $0.5 million--$500,000--to reimburse attorneys on the Billy Dale \ncase.\n  The American people, in effect, are being asked to pay for the \nattorney fees of a person who was lawfully indicted and legitimately \nprosecuted. Let me repeat: The American people are being asked to pay \nthe attorney fees for a person who was indicted lawfully--no question \nabout that--and who was legitimately prosecuted.\n  Proponents of this taxpayer expenditure contend that Mr. Dale was \nwrongfully prosecuted. Yet, neither Dale nor these high-powered lawyers \nwho represented him--and still represent him--ever raised any of this \nin any proceeding or in any case that was before the courts. They \ndidn't move to dismiss his indictment on the ground of prosecutorial \nmisconduct.\n  In fact, when they filed a motion for acquittal, the court, having \nheard the evidence, denied the motion for acquittal. Why? Because it \nwas the judge's reasonable assessment that sufficient evidence existed \nfor a reasonable person to find Billy Dale guilty of the charges.\n  Mr. Dale and his attorneys also failed to allege wrongdoing against \nthose who investigated him, and there is no evidence to support that \nthere was any wrongdoing by the people who did the investigation. The \nwatchdog of Congress, the General Accounting Office, reviewed the case \nand determined that the FBI and the IRS action taken during the period \nsurrounding the removal of the Travel Office employees were reasonable \nand consistent with the Agencies' normal procedures.\n  Mr. President, a review by the Office of Professional Responsibility \nin the Justice Department concluded that there was no wrongdoing on the \npart of any FBI employees regarding the Travel Office matter.\n  Mr. President, I want to say that I believe that the chairman of this \nsubcommittee and the ranking member, the junior Senators from Alabama \nand Nebraska, have brought a good bill before this body. There are \nscores of amendments that have been filed. I would bet that a number of \nthem are not germane. Certainly this one is, and I felt there is \nlanguage in this bill that relates to this issue where this bill would \npay, in effect, Mr. Dale's attorneys $500,000, and that this should be \nsomething that should be discussed. This should be an issue that is \ndebated, and I do that under the recognition that I think the two \nmanagers of this legislation have done a good job.\n  But let me repeat regarding these attorney fees that there is no \nevidence to support that Mr. Dale--as Mr. Dale and his attorneys did \nraise--there is nothing to support that there was any wrongdoing in \nthis investigation. I repeat: The General Accounting Office reviewed \nthis matter and determined that the FBI and the IRS did nothing wrong \nregarding the procedures in the Travel Office. They were reasonable and \nconsistent with the Agencies' normal procedures and practices.\n  A review by the Office of Professional Responsibility in the Justice \nDepartment concluded that there was no wrongdoing on part of any FBI \nemployee regarding the Travel Office matter, and it is clear that all \nthe people who investigated this case were there long before this \nadministration took office. Notwithstanding this, the American \ntaxpayers have been asked to pay almost $0.5 million to Dale's \nattorneys. This is clearly a private relief bill.\n  If this had been in the form of an amendment, our rules would have \nallowed us to raise a point of order, and this procedure could have \nbeen knocked out. But in that the committee and the subcommittee had, \nin effect, amended the House bill, we have nothing to raise a point of \norder on. As a result of that, this is the only alternative we have.\n  We are being asked as a body to grant this relief absent any hearing \nor committee report on this subject. The matter should be subject to \nthe ordinary procedures for private relief bills provided under Senate \nrule XIV.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment, along with Senators Levin \nand Biden, that comports with the procedures set out in rule XIV. The \namendment that will shortly be offered refers the reimbursement of Mr. \nDale's attorney fees to the Federal Court of Claims.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Court of Claims is a body in which the \njudges are appointed for a period of 15 years. This is a body that has \nbeen in existence for over 100 years. It has decided exactly the type \nof issue presented in the Billy Dale matter on hundreds and hundreds of \ncases. This court has special jurisdiction for cases involving claims \nagainst the Federal Government.\n\n  As I have indicated, it is made up of approximately 15 judges. These \nare referred to as article 1 judges because they serve for a time \ncertain, and these people are appointed by the President of the United \nStates for these 15-year terms. They handle primarily contractual \nclaims, fifth amendment claims, and certain Indian claims.\n  Over the past century, Congress has referred thousands of cases to \nthe court. The court reviews these cases under specific statutory \nauthority and procedures set out in claims cases under the United \nStates. Initially, the case is referred to a chief judge who designates \nanother judge. In fact, they usually have three people that hear these \ncases, and these three judges become the reviewing body.\n  The bottom line is this panel has the most expertise that we have in \nAmerica to handle this kind of case.\n  I think this is something we would want to do to avoid the bitter \npolitical acrimony that has taken place on this floor in the past \nregarding this matter. It would seem that we should refer it to the \nbody separate and apart from the policy involved. If in fact this \namendment carries, it is up to the Court of Claims to determine the \nextent to which Mr. Dale has a legal and equitable remedy in this \nmatter and whether or not the taxpayers should pay him money.\n  Now, I think justice and equity weighs against Mr. Dale, but let the \nCourt of Claims determine that. This amendment is the least we can do \nfor the American taxpayer. Half a million dollars may be pocket change \nfor some and maybe even Mr. Dale's attorneys, but it is not to the \nAmerican public. It is a lot of money to the American public.\n  Facts do not support such a controversial expenditure on behalf of \nsomeone who has been indicted for embezzlement and offered to plead \nguilty.\n  Here is what we are being asked to do. We are being asked to pay \n$500,000 in attorney's fees for someone who admitted his guilt, \nbasically, according to his attorney. Here is what his attorneys wrote \nto the U.S. attorney:\n\n       Mr. Dale will enter a plea of guilty to a single count of \n     18 U.S.C. section 654. He will acknowledge that he \n     intentionally placed Travel Office funds in his personal \n     checking account without authorization.\n\n  Here is what he, Mr. President, has agreed to plead guilty to.\n  This is the statute.\n\n       Whoever, being an officer or employee of the United States \n     or of any department or agency thereof, embezzles or wrongly \n     converts to his own use the money or property of another \n     which comes into his possession or under his control in the \n     execution of such office or employment, or under color or \n     claim of authority as such officer or employee, shall be \n     fined under this title . . . the value of the money and \n     property thus embezzled . . . or imprisoned not more than 10 \n     years, or both.\n\n  It seems somewhat unique to me that someone who, in writing, agreed \nto\n\n[[Page S10292]]\n\nplead guilty, could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison, fined the \namount of money he stole, is now coming before the Congress of the \nUnited States and saying pay my attorney's fees. Why? Because he was \nacquitted.\n  Mr. President, I am a trial lawyer. Before I came here, I tried a lot \nof cases. I did criminal work. I believe in our system of justice. The \nvast majority of times trial by jury works out right. The right \ndecision is not always reached, but most of the time it is. The vast \nmajority of the time the right decision is reached. A lot of times the \njury does not arrive at the right result, but they arrive at a result. \nSometimes they do not, as we know it appears to a lot of us in the O.J. \nSimpson case or the Menendez brothers. The juries do not always do the \nright thing, but most of the time they do. This is an instance clearly \nwhen they did not do the right thing.\n  Now, the facts do not support such a controversial expenditure on \nbehalf of someone who is indicted for embezzlement and offered to plead \nguilty to a felony.\n  This issue is not about the firing of the Travel Office employees in \n1993. Most agree that these terminations were not handled \nappropriately. But everyone also agrees that their dismissals were \nlegal, that the administration, the White House, had a right to do that \nwithin the prerogatives of the law and the office held by the \nPresident.\n\n  I repeat, the people who were relieved of duty there were relieved of \nduty legally. Whether it was done in an appropriate manner without \nhurting a lot of feelings and kind of roughshod, that is something we \ncan all talk about. We would all agree it could have been handled \nbetter. But nothing was done illegally. This amendment that will be \noffered is about putting an end to the partisan election year games \nthat are now occurring in Congress. Half a million dollars is too high \na price to ask of taxpayers, the people of the State of Nevada, Ohio, \nWashington, Kansas, Pennsylvania, Utah, and the rest of the country. \nThis is about putting an end to partisan, election-year games now \noccurring in Congress. I repeat, half a million dollars is too high a \nprice to ask the taxpayers to bear for such an obvious election-year \nprogram.\n  Those who seek to embarrass this administration should not ask the \ntaxpayers to finance their fun and games. If we decide as a body to \nreimburse Mr. Dale as called for in this legislation now before the \nSenate, we will be setting a dangerous precedent. This will be the \nfirst time in the history of this Congress that we will have paid the \nattorney's fees of a lawfully indicted and prosecuted individual. There \nis precedent to pay the legal fees for the Travel Office employees who \nwere not indicted, and we should do that. No problem with that. There \nis nothing in precedent that would prevent the Government from \nrectifying a wrong. Travel Office employees who had to pay legal fees \nshould be reimbursed. The independent law governs this area. That is \nthe best we have. We can talk about it.\n  Payment of attorney's fees is permitted if the following two \nconditions are satisfied. No. 1, the subject in the investigation would \nnot have been investigated but for the independent counsel, and No. 2, \nthe person was not indicted. Not indicted. Clearly, Mr. Dale would \nfollow under that basis. He was indicted and he was lawfully indicted. \nUnder independent counsel, the way the statute reads, there could even \nbe prosecutorial misconduct when the indictment takes place and he \nstill would not be reimbursed for his attorney's fees. In this \nsituation, there is no question that he was indicted properly, legally. \nMr. Dale's attorneys never raised prosecutorial misconduct, never.\n  As we all know, Mr. Dale was indicted. The independent counsel law is \nexplicit about the requirement that attorney's fees can be recovered \nonly if the individual was not subject to indictment. There are no \nexceptions to this rule. If we are going to establish new precedent, \nthere at least should be a foundation for doing so, and the indictment \nof a person legally is certainly strange grounds to set a precedent for \nthis Congress to start reimbursing people after the jury returns an \nacquittal verdict.\n  There have been no Congressional hearings. There is no foundation in \nthe instant case. There is no committee report laying out the reasons \nfor breaking long-established precedent.\n  Without a lot of politics involved, we have offered the appropriate \nresponse to Mr. Dale's problem. If in fact he has been wronged, which I \ndo not think he has, but if he has, why is this not referred to the \nappropriate tribunal, which would be the Court of Claims? We have done \nit hundreds and thousands of times, as I have indicated earlier. \nLegislation to pay attorney's fees for specific individuals is a form \nof private relief. Senate rule 14.9 governs the Senate consideration of \nprivate relief legislation.\n  What we have in this instance is that private relief legislation has \nbeen folded over into this Treasury-Postal Service bill. If this \namendment were not raised, the American public would be paying half a \nmillion dollars. They may pay half a million dollars anyway if this \nbill passes and this amendment does not carry, but they will know that \na man who agreed to plead guilty to a felony, a man who was properly \nindicted--there was never a question of prosecutorial misconduct ever \nraised during the trial proceedings--is going to be paid $500,000 in \nattorney's fees. I think that sets a very, very dangerous precedent. In \nshort, it requires, this amendment I will offer, the adoption of a \nresolution referring such matter, as I have indicated, to the Court of \nClaims. That is why we have the Court of Claims.\n\n  What would the American public think if anytime someone is indicted \nand acquitted that we pay their attorney's fees? Or do we pick and \nchoose what attorney's fees we pay if there is an acquittal? We do that \nlegislatively? If there is a problem it should be referred to the Court \nof Claims. There is statutory procedure in place for dealing with this. \nUnder 28 U.S.C. 2509, the Federal claims court determines whether the \nprivate relief sought from U.S. taxpayers is appropriate.\n  We have heard the plaintive cries of how they were terminated \nimproperly. Remember, the President had the ability and the legal right \nto fire the people for no reason. I have acknowledged that they could \nhave been terminated in a different manner. Procedurally, the claims \ncourt assumes jurisdiction of these cases upon referral of either House \nof Congress. Upon review, the court must determine whether there is a \nlegal or equitable claim to taxpayer money or whether such payment \nwould be simply a gratuity. Our amendment follows precedent and is in \ncompliance with the statute.\n  To many, Billy Dale is the epitome of the modern-day victim. The \nmedia--remember where he worked. He worked in the White House Travel \nOffice. Millions of dollars went through his hands every year. And his \njob was to make happy the people who travel from the White House, but \nespecially the press, especially the press. He had to make them happy. \nThat was his main function. He served them well. He made them happy, \nand they have done a great job of portraying him as victim. In Nevada, \nSeattle, Cleveland, or anyplace else, it would not be that way. It \nwould not be that way. In any city in Nevada, if this were explained to \nthem, he would not be a victim. He would be somebody who should be \nprosecuted, as was determined by the Justice Department.\n  In addition to his high-priced attorney, Mr. Dale has received public \nsupport from many notable heavyweights in the media. He took good care \nof them. He runs in powerful circles and has no shortage of influential \nsupporters. Today he has become the poster boy for every--I should not \nsay for every--for many fundraisers. At many Republican fundraisers \naround the country, Billy Dale is the poster boy. As it was reported in \nAugust in the media, candidate Dole had offered him a job in his \nPresidential campaign. He is still the subject of a plethora of \nsympathetic pieces in the news by his old friends in the media.\n  This has all culminated in today's effort to attempt to embarrass the \nPresident by appropriating $500,000 very quietly. It is in the bill. \nThere would be no vote on it. It was just slipped through here quietly \nand the American taxpayers then would be confronted with people saying, \n``Yeah, we told you so. The President has agreed to pay this money \nbecause he was so wrong.'' He is not so wrong. The Congress of the\n\n[[Page S10293]]\n\nUnited States should not be involved in this. It should be referred to \nthe Court of Claims.\n  The real facts according to his indictment have yet to be aired, but \nwe are going to talk about those. If such an appropriation took place \nin this bill, under the Federal election laws it should be deemed as an \nin-kind contribution to campaigns around the country, Republican in \nnature.\n  When it comes to Billy Dale, many speak of conspiracies. But it is \nthe conspiracy of silence that I would like to speak about a little bit \ntoday. The silence over the activities that led to Mr. Dale's \nindictment is deafening. All we seem to hear about is poor Billy Dale. \nHowever there is reason why the man was indicted, and let us not forget \nthat Mr. Dale agreed--I repeat--to plead guilty to embezzlement. Mr. \nDale is, in my opinion, an admitted crook. He is today asking the \nAmerican taxpayer to pick up his legal bill.\n\n  He has every right to do this, but let us do it in the Court of \nClaims. He has waived, in my opinion, every right of confidentiality, \nwith his campaign by his attorneys and him to be reimbursed for \nattorney's fees, regarding the facts supporting his prosecution. If the \nAmerican public is going to pay $500,000 to a high-priced Washington \nlaw firm, they should know the whole story. So let us talk a little bit \nabout the whole story. Let us talk about some of the things that he \ntestified to at his trial.\n  He testified to a number of things. He admitted putting 55 checks for \nTravel Office funds totaling some $54,000 in his personal bank account. \nMr. President, if we want to get into more detailed facts, and we can \ndo that, we will find that he was very careful in the checks that he \nput in his personal bank account. He basically put in checks that would \nbe very, very difficult to trace. What checks did he put in his \npersonal bank account? Checks that came from foreign news outlets, from \nMexico, from places in Europe, from Asia. He was very careful. He did \nnot put into his personal bank account checks from CBS, ABC, and other \nAmerican media outlets. He took into his personal checking account \nchecks that could not be traced.\n  He also had a number of explanations why he did this. It was more \nconvenient--that is a real laugher--more convenient. The bank that held \nthe checks legally for the Travel Office was about a block from the \nWhite House where he worked. His personal bank was miles away, out in \nMaryland someplace.\n  He admitted during the trial, admitted cashing refund checks to the \nTravel Office received from telephone companies for trips where the \npress had been overcharged.\n  He admitted that by not putting the refund checks in the Travel \nOffice bank account he was breaching an obligation he had to apply any \nsurplus in that account toward the very next trip. He even got into--he \nwas storing this money up so he could cover foreign trips during \nOctober and November. It is a little difficult in an election year. \nThey just do not happen.\n  He admitted that there were times in 1992 that he cashed Travel \nOffice checks but did not write them down in his petty cash log, and \nthat anyone looking for them in the log would not know that he had \ncashed the checks.\n  He admitted during the trial to putting checks that were supposed to \ngo into the Travel Office surplus fund account at the Riggs Bank into \nhis own personal account. This is what I have talked about. One was a \nblock away, the other was at his home.\n  He admitted during the trial that he did not even tell the individual \nwho worked with him in the Travel Office for 30 years, his chief \nassistant, Gary Wright, of this practice of putting these checks into \nhis own account and not the office account. No one knew except him. It \nwas a secret. Why? Because he was stealing the money. He admitted to \ncashing one check for $5,000, writing down only $2,000 for that check \nin the petty cash log. When he was first contacted by the investigators \nabout that he was silent. They talked to him again: Silent. Suddenly, \nafter having run to his credit union and borrowing enough money to \ncover this, he brought the money back and said, ``I had it in my desk \ndrawer.'' Of course he did not have it in his desk drawer.\n\n  Dale admitted that he overcharged for some of the flights and \nundercharged for others, instead of just charging exactly what the trip \ncost. Then he offered some incomprehensible explanation to the \ninvestigators, why that was beneficial.\n  There are many other things that he admitted during the trial, but \nthe fact of the matter is we are being asked here to reimburse \nattorney's fees of $500,000 for Billy Dale, his attorneys, so he can \ncarry on this campaign of harassment that he has been engaged in in the \npast 6 months or year.\n  We can look at a prosecution memo. Before cases are brought in \nFederal court--you have heard the expression, ``What are they trying to \ndo, make a Federal case out of it?'' That, Mr. President, comes with \nvery good reason, because in the federal system, and the Presiding \nOfficer knows, having been an Attorney General, as most people, that \nFederal cases are developed under very detailed circumstances. Almost \nevery time a case is filed that results in indictment, a prosecution \nmemo is prepared. A prosecution memo was prepared in this case.\n  I will read just a little bit from the prosecution memo:\n\n       The FBI has investigated this matter and strongly supports \n     these charges.\n\n  That is in the first paragraph. I repeat:\n\n       The FBI has investigated this matter and strongly supports \n     these charges.\n\n  What are these charges?\n\n       We propose to charge Billy Ray Dale, the former director of \n     the White House Telegraph and Travel Office, with converting \n     to his own use approximately $54,000 in checks and $14,000 in \n     cash received by him in connection with his official duties.\n\n  The only reason the $14,000 figure isn't higher is because records \nwere destroyed. This is the petty cash fund for only 1 year. It \ncertainly would have been much higher if those records had been \navailable.\n  There are a number of other things in this prosecution memo that I \nthink call out for comment when Congress is being asked to respond to \nhalf a million dollars:\n  No legitimate explanation for these deposits. It talks about the \nmissing cash in addition to the missing checks. There were numerous \nchecks cashed, unreconciled estimated bills and large fluctuations in \nthe bank balances. This is from the prosecution memo.\n\n       A decision was made to inform the Travel Office employees \n     that the examination was being conducted as part of the \n     National Performance Review. Records were in a shambles.\n\n  Thirteen checks made out to cash for which there was little or no \ndocumentation established how the cash was spent. There was a \nquestionable transaction involving a $5,000 check to cash. Further, he \nhad no explanation of the discrepancy--this is the $5,000 check--but \nthat he later found the money in his desk. The report found a lack of \nfinancial controls and accounting systems. We know that.\n  Most importantly, the report found discrepancies with the petty cash \nfund, which he controlled.\n  Also, they indicate that this certainly was no kind of a witch hunt. \nThey also, Mr. President, came to the conclusion:\n\n       We found no evidence of illegal conduct by any other member \n     of the Travel Office. The media checks selected by Dale for \n     deposit into his account were not from mainstream press \n     organizations, but rather English, Japanese, German and \n     Hispanic media. Dale's selection of these checks is \n     significant. The refund checks invariably were generated by \n     the vendors on their own. They arrived unexpectedly, and \n     their absence would not be missed. Similarly, the checks from \n     these esoteric news services were less likely to be \n     scrutinized by these services when returned by their bank, \n     and those organizations would be less likely to understand \n     the meaning of Dale's name on the deposits and not the Travel \n     Office.\n\n  Because he wrote on them ``For deposit only to Billy R. Dale.''\n\n       We could find no legitimate reason for these checks to be \n     deposited in Dale's personal bank account. It certainly was \n     not easier--\n\n  Still quoting from this memo:\n\n       It certainly was not easier for Dale to have taken checks \n     to home, to Maryland, rather than walk across the street. \n     Indeed, on four occasions, Travel Office checks were \n     deposited by Dale in his account on the same day deposits \n     were made to the Travel Office account at Riggs.\n\n  There is certainly no evidence at all that Dale ever used any of \nthese moneys from his personal account to pay Travel Office expenses. \nThen why\n\n[[Page S10294]]\n\nwould he put it in there? He would put it in there so he could use the \nmoney.\n  Then, of course, they do a minimal accounting to find out what would \nhappen if he spent this money and where he spent it. They did that and \narrived at the conclusion he had to take the money and use it on his \nown: homes purchased, children getting money. These are not my words. \nThis is from the Justice Department:\n\n       The evidence indicates that Dale stole the missing $14,000 \n     in cash. He cannot claim credibly that he used relatively \n     large amounts of unused checks to pay trip expenses during \n     the period. He offered no explanation for the misrecording.\n\n  Dale was asked three times about the $5,000 check, and he finally \nsaid on the third occasion:\n\n       He now had an explanation for the missing money. Dale went \n     to his desk and produced an envelope containing $2,800 in \n     cash, enough to make up the difference, which he told the \n     investigator this corresponded to a portion of the missing \n     money. Dale told the investigator that he had set the $3,000 \n     aside for an upcoming trip to Indonesia because he sometimes \n     had to pay kickbacks when he traveled to that part of the \n     world.\n\n  Dale's explanation, of course, is not credible. There is no reason \nwhy this cash would not have been used for another trip. So his \nexplanation is without any foundation whatsoever.\n  His explanation about needing this money in Indonesia is inconsistent \nwith the travel records for that period. The $5,000 check was cashed in \nOctober of 1992. He made no international trips from January 10, 1992, \nuntil he left the office in May of 1993. The question is asked, why \nwasn't he convicted? We all ask that question.\n  I am not going to impugn the ability of the prosecutors, but it must \nhave been a busy week. I don't think they were very well prepared for \nthis case. Acquittals come, as we all know. Sometimes they shouldn't \ncome. So, in finality, the prosecution memo says:\n\n       We propose to charge Dale with two counts of conversion \n     under United States Code 654.\n\n  So, Mr. President, there is more here to this than we have heard in \nthe past. For example, we have referred to his plea agreement. November \n30, 1994, I am reading directly from his letter:\n\n       Mr. Dale will enter a plea of guilty to a single count of \n     18 U.S. Code 654. He will acknowledge he intentionally placed \n     Travel Office funds in his personal checking account without \n     authorization.\n  It goes on to explain what he would like in the way of a sentence.\n  I believe the facts simply do not support a half-million-dollar \npayment to Dale's attorneys. It is clear that the Justice Department \nhad probable cause to indict and prosecute Billy Dale. It is important \nto keep in mind who it was who made this determination--career service \nattorneys at the Department of Justice. The White House had nothing to \ndo with this. Likely--not likely; no question about it--that people \ndoing this were holdovers from the Bush and Reagan administrations, \nprofessional prosecutors.\n  This is a private relief claim at best and should be referred to the \nCourt of Claims. It has been turned into a political matter and should \nbe removed from the political arena. Claims court is the proper forum \nfor deciding whether Mr. Dale's attorneys are entitled to receive \ntaxpayer compensation; otherwise, we are breaking well-established \nprecedent for purely political purposes. In doing so, we would create a \ntremendously dangerous precedent in this body.\n  We cannot make a mistake about it. This reimbursement is for \nPresidential politics. Mr. Dale runs in high circles now and has become \nthe poster boy for every Republican--I should not say ``every''--for \nmany political fundraisers held by the Republicans. He was offered a \njob by Presidential candidate Dole, as reported in the press. And there \nare a few $1,000 fundraisers at which he appears.\n  Any appropriations should be considered an in-kind contribution to \nthe Republican Presidential campaign. The record we have laid out today \nevidences the need to remove this matter from this body and to take it \nto the Court of Claims where appropriate consideration can be given. At \na minimum, don't the taxpayers at least deserve this? What kind of a \nprecedent would we set by including, in an appropriations bill, a \npayment for somebody's attorney's fees who was rightfully indicted and \nwas acquitted by a jury, which happens in our system?\n  Mr. Dale's attorneys down on K Street, or wherever they are, I do not \nthink will go hungry awaiting this decision. It is the right thing to \ndo. The amendment that is going to be offered says that he should be \nreimbursed if the Court of Claims determines Dale has a legal or \nequitable claim.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5256\n\n(Purpose: To refer the White House travel office matter to the Court of \n                            Federal Claims)\n\n  Mr. REID.

I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5256, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the appropriations bill before the Senate \nincludes a provision to pay attorney's fees for the employees of the \nWhite House Travel Office who were dismissed from their jobs in 1993. \nThis provision is similar to Senate bill 1561 sponsored by Senator \nHatch earlier this year and to House bill 2937.\n  The provision would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to pay up to \n$500,000 of taxpayers' money to six former Travel Office employees; \n$50,000 of that amount would go to five of the employees who were \nalready partially reimbursed by last year's appropriations bill. The \nrest, or about $450,000, would go to reimburse former Travel Office \nDirector Billy Dale's attorney fees.\n  Unlike the other Travel Office employees, Billy Dale was subject to a \nFederal indictment and prosecution for embezzlement and conversion. It \nis that indictment and prosecution for embezzlement and conversion \nwhich is the source of the attorney fees. I want to repeat that because \nthat is the critical issue that is before the Senate: It is the \nattorney fees that related to the FBI indictment and prosecution for \nembezzlement and conversion that is the source of the attorney fees \nthat is in this bill. The provision, though, in this bill, lumps \ntogether both the unindicted and the indicted Travel Office employees. \nThat is the mistake which should be remedied.\n  We know that the White House staff acted inappropriately when they \nsummarily fired all the Travel Office employees in May 1993. The White \nHouse acknowledged that in their July 1993 management review when it \nsaid--this is the White House speaking--that the White House erred in \nnot treating the Travel Office employees with more sensitivity. We also \nknow that the White House staff erred in that conduct with respect to \nthe FBI. They took actions which they should not have, which had the \nappearance of trying to influence the FBI. The White House acknowledged \nthat in their 1993 management review when that review said, ``The White \nHouse erred in not being sufficiently vigilant in guarding against even \nthe appearance of pressure on the FBI.''\n  The White House, by its own acknowledgment, was wrong when it allowed \npeople with personal financial interest in the Travel Office to be \ninvolved in the work of the office and in evaluating the office. The \nWhite House management report acknowledged this, as well, when it said, \n``The White House erred in permitting people with personal interests in \nthe outcome to be involved in evaluating the Travel Office.''\n  Now, it is because of those errors, those facts, on the part of the \nWhite House relative to the firing of those employees that the Congress \nagreed to pay the attorney fees of former Travel Office employees who \nwere fired, who should not have been fired, who were improperly filed. \nWe appropriated $150,000 in last year's appropriation for\n\n[[Page S10296]]\n\nthe Department of Transportation, and we will complete that course of \naction with the remaining $50,000 with this appropriations bill.\n  I do not have any argument with that. Quite the opposite. I think it \nwas the right thing to do. We ought to pay those attorney fees relative \nto the firing of those employees.\n  However, $450,000 of the money in this bill would go for something \nfar different than paying attorney fees for employees who everybody has \nalready acknowledged should not have been fire--$450,000 of the \ntaxpayers' money in this bill will go to pay the attorney fees that \nBilly Dale incurred in his defense against a criminal indictment. That \n$450,000 was not incurred because Dale was wrongly fired. It was \nincurred because a proper FBI investigation and a proper Department of \nJustice review found substantial evidence of embezzlement and \nconversion on the part of Billy Dale.\n\n  It was not the wrongful firing which relates to these $450,000 in \nbills for attorneys. It is because Billy Dale was indicted. He was \nindicted following a proper FBI investigation. He was indicted \nfollowing a proper Department of Justice review which found substantial \nevidence of embezzlement and conversion on his part.\n  Now, as best as I can determine, if we pass this legislation as \ncurrently drafted, it will be the first time in our history that we \nhave passed legislation to pay attorney fees incurred by someone who \nhas been, from all appearances, lawfully indicted.\n  Now, maybe there is another case; maybe there is another instance \nwhere someone who was--I emphasize this--lawfully indicted following a \nproper investigation by the FBI, and following a proper review by the \nDepartment of Justice. Maybe there is another instance, but we can't \nfind it.\n  So what is in this bill is precedent-setting. There is not an \nadequate foundation to set this precedent. The only law that allows for \nthe payment of attorney fees incurred because of a criminal \ninvestigation is the independent counsel law. That law explicitly \nprohibits individuals from recovering their attorney fees if they have \nbeen indicted.\n  Now, while the attorney fees at issue here don't involve the \nindependent counsel law, it is the only standard that we have on the \nbooks where the situation is comparable, so that it is reasonable that \nit would serve as our guide. Ten years ago, when we reauthorized the \nindependent counsel law for the first time, we concluded that the \nindependent counsel statute may create inequitable situations, where \npersons who would otherwise not be involved in a criminal investigation \ncould incur sizable attorney fees solely because of the independent \ncounsel law.\n  We decided, therefore, to allow for the reimbursement of attorney \nfees for persons subject to investigation under the independent counsel \nlaw if they met a two-part test. First, they had to show that they \nwould not have incurred the attorney fees but for the independent \ncounsel statute, and, second, they were not eligible if they were \nindicted.\n  No one at the time, or since, has ever mentioned, much less \nconsidered, the possibility of paying attorney fees for an indicted \nindividual. Now, when Congress took the first step last year of paying \nthe attorney fees of the fired White House Travel Office employees by \nincluding $150,000 in the Department of Transportation appropriations \nbill, that legislation explicitly limited payment of that money to \nreimburse attorney fees only of White House Travel Office employees who \n``were not the subject of the FBI investigation.'' That is why it was \npassed so easily by a voice vote. It coincided with the independent \ncounsel standard. But the legislation before us would violate that \nstandard. If we are going to do that, we better have some criteria for \nthe precedent that we are setting.\n  The reason that we have made an indictment the threshold beyond which \nthere is to be no reimbursement for attorney fees is because an \nindictment requires a determination that there be probable cause that \nthe person subject to the indictment committed a crime. The grand jury \nis comprised of average citizens who make a determination as to whether \nor not there is probable cause to go forward with an indictment and a \ntrial. It is a system that we use thousands of times a year, if not a \nday, across this country. In order to be indicted, a prosecutor must \npresent evidence to a grand jury to show probable cause that a crime \nwas committed and that a specific person is the one who committed the \ncrime.\n  Whether or not the indicted person is eventually acquitted does not \ntake away from the fact that there was probable cause to believe that \nthe person had committed a crime. Acquittal doesn't mean that the \nindictment never should have been brought. It means that the judge or \njury did not believe there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the \nindicted individual was guilty. We have almost a thousand acquittals a \nyear in this country in the Federal system alone, and I suspect a \nreasonable number of those involve relatively short jury \ndeliberations, like the Billy Dale case. There is nothing unusual or \nsuspect about such acquittals. That is the way the criminal process \nworks.\n\n  But what if an indictment had been improperly obtained? If that is \nthe case, that the indictment was tainted or obtained improperly, the \ndefendant can seek to have it thrown out before or during trial. Rule \n12 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides for a defendant \nto make a number of pretrial motions, ``including any defense or \nobjection to the prosecution, based on defects in the institution of \nthe prosecution''--there I am quoting rule 12--``or based on defects in \nthe indictment,'' and again I am quoting rule 12. Those motions are \nmade in hundreds--probably thousands--of cases.\n  Outside of rule 12, courts may also recognize challenges to a \nprosecution or an indictment based on lack of due process. The court \nmay dismiss an indictment as an exercise of its inherent supervisory \nauthority to protect a defendant's due process.\n  These are long-recognized defenses to improper criminal prosecutions. \nThose defenses, though, are supposed to be raised in the judicial \nprocess and, in most cases, prior to trial. Rule 12 explicitly requires \nthat any claim of defect in the institution of the prosecution, or the \nindictment, must be made prior to trial. Extensive case law supports \nthe requirement with the result that any claim not raised prior to \ntrial is deemed waived. So there is a clear and appropriate way for a \ndefendant in a criminal case to challenge the fairness or the propriety \nof a prosecution.\n  As far as I can tell, Billy Dale did not raise any of these \nchallenges during the course of his prosecution. The court docket for \nBilly Dale's case does not show any motion to dismiss because of \nalleged defects in the indictment, or because of alleged Government \nmisconduct, or because of a claim of lack of due process; nor does the \ndocket show that Billy Dale made any of those claims during the course \nof his trial. If he had these claims, he should have raised them at the \ntrial. Had he been convicted and appealed the conviction, he would have \nbeen precluded from raising them on appeal, because if the claims \nhaven't been made before trial, then the defendant will be treated as \nhaving waived those defenses.\n  Now, in support of this legislation, Senator Hatch has claimed that \nDale's indictment and prosecution were a ``grave miscarriage of \njustice,'' and that Dale was ``wrongfully prosecuted.'' Well, if Billy \nDale had those claims at the time of his trial, he had the opportunity \nand the legal obligation to raise them at trial. If he did not raise \nthose claims there, then unless there are compelling reasons, we should \nbe particularly careful in considering them here under this very rare \nand unusual process of private relief legislation.\n  If the answer is that Billy Dale has one of these claims, but did not \nraise it at the appropriate time, then we need an explanation as to why \nhe did not raise it in the appropriate form at the appropriate time. \nThere may be a legitimate reason, and we should hear that. But, so far, \nthere is nothing on the record to that effect.\n  Without a compelling reason to justify Dale's failure to make his \ncase about a wrongful prosecution while at trial, we would be \noverthrowing longstanding and critically important precedent in \ncriminal procedure and in our handling of private relief bills were we \nto act at this time. We would be saying to hundreds, perhaps thousands,\n\n[[Page S10297]]\n\nof defendants, that although they failed to make a timely motion \nchallenging the legitimacy of the private prosecution brought against \nthem, they can still come to Congress and we will consider paying their \nlegal fees, even though they would be forbidden from challenging the \nlegitimacy of the prosecution were the case on appeal from a \nconviction.\n\n  But let's assume there was a legitimate reason for Dale to have \nfailed to raise this claim of wrongful prosecution at the trial. If \nthat were true, then we could be in a position to consider the \nsubstance of the claim. But, surely, before we pay his attorney fees \nout of taxpayer money, we ought to determine that the prosecution was \nimproper.\n  As the record now stands, I don't see evidence to support such a \nclaim. We don't have a Senate hearing record, or even a Senate \ncommittee report on this legislation, because there aren't any. The \nonly record we have upon which we are supposed to judge this matter is \nthe House committee report that accompanies the bill.\n  Mr. President, I have read the House committee report. I do not find \nanything in that report to justify a finding that either the FBI \ninvestigation or Department of Justice prosecution of Billy Dale was \nimproper. What I have found is this: White House staff did a poor job \nin responding to evidence of financial mismanagement in the White House \nTravel Office, did a poor job of handling long-time White House Travel \nOffice employees, and the White House summarily fired all the Travel \nOffice employees before all the facts were known. The White House \nitself acknowledged these errors back in 1993. There is nothing new \nabout those findings. In July 1993, the error was acknowledged by the \nWhite House in the firing of Travel Office employees.\n  What else have we found? It was found before, but the White House \nconveyed a heightened sense of urgency about the allegations involving \nthe Travel Office to the FBI and coordinated a press release with the \nFBI which created the appearance of pressuring the FBI. The White House \nacknowledged that error back in July 1993.\n  Those White House errors do not mean that the investigation by the \nFBI or the prosecution by the Department of Justice were improper. That \nis the heart of the matter. Errors in the firing, yes. They have been \nacknowledged for years. But the prosecution of Billy Dale, the \ninvestigation by the FBI, the prosecution by the Department of \nJustice--were they defective? There is not even an allegation of that. \nThat is what these legal fees relate to. They do not relate to the \nfiring. We are paying those legal fees. They relate to the defense of a \ncriminal indictment which was properly brought following a proper FBI \ninvestigation, following a proper Department of Justice prosecution \nthat no one has said was improper. There is nothing in the House \nreport, which is the only report we have, that says that the FBI \ninvestigation was tainted, or wrong, or defective, or improper. There \nis nothing in that House report which says that the Department of \nJustice prosecution was tainted, or defective, or improper.\n  That is what these legal fees relate to. We are paying the legal fees \nfor the firing. And we ought to. They were done inappropriately. That \nhas been acknowledged for years. We paid $150,000 last year in the \nappropriations bill. And this appropriations bill appropriates an \nadditional $50,000, and we ought to pay it. It is the $450,000 for the \ndefense against an indictment which was properly brought which is the \nissue here and which would set a precedent. We have never paid the \nlegal fees of someone who was properly and legally indicted. If we open \nup that door, we would have thousands of folks out there who are \nacquitted, and many of whom are acquitted in just as short a time, who \nwill have an equal claim.\n  That is the issue. Whether or not we ought to have the Court of \nClaims say that there was something inappropriate here before this \nmoney is paid, that is what this amendment does. It does not say strike \nthe money. It says refer this to the Court of Claims to see if there is \nan equitable claim. And if there is, pay it.\n  Mr. President, it was not the White House which carried out the \ncriminal investigation which led to the indictment of Billy Dale. It \nwas the FBI. Has anyone said that investigation by the FBI was \ninappropriate, or tainted? Not that I have heard; not in the House \ncommittee report, which is the only report we have on it. The White \nHouse did not review the evidence obtained by the FBI and determine \nthat it should be presented to a grand jury for possible indictment. \nThat was the Department of Justice. It was not the White House that \nreviewed the FBI investigation and said, ``Hey, we are going to indict \nthis person.'' The Department of Justice made that decision. I have not \nheard anyone say that the Department of Justice concluded that it \nshould seek an indictment of Billy Dale which was tainted, or \ndefective, or inappropriate, or improper. That is not in the House \nreport, the only report we have.\n\n  The White House did not hear the evidence and determine that there \nwas probable cause to believe that Billy Dale had embezzled $54,000 \nfrom the White House Travel Office. That was the grand jury, and the \nWhite House did not try this case and determine that there was \nsufficient evidence to sustain a conviction. That was the judge. The \njudge did that. The judge heard this evidence and decided that there \nwas sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction of Billy Dale and let \nthis case go to the jury and denied a motion for directed verdict.\n  There is no evidence, there is no allegation, that the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation pursued its investigation in an improper manner. There \nis no evidence that the decision to prosecute a decision made by career \nattorneys at the Justice Department was improper. That allegation has \nnot been made. It is not in the House report. I do not think it would \nbe sustainable if someone made it. There is no evidence that the \nindictment by the grand jury was improper. There is no evidence that \nthe criminal trial conducted by a well-respected judge, whom Dale \nhimself lauded as being fair, was in any way improper. In fact, Dale \nwas asked at a hearing on the House side before the Committee on \nGovernment Reform and Oversight in January of this year by Congressman \nKanjorski whether Dale was ``suggesting in any way that either those \nattorneys in the Justice Department, the people in the grand jury, the \njudge that tried the case, or the people that made up the jury were in \nsome way compromised?'' That was the exact question. Billy Dale \nresponded, ``Absolutely not.''\n  On May 28, 1993, the FBI released a report of its internal review of \nits contacts with the White House on the Travel Office. The FBI \nDirector concluded that ``The FBI acted correctly''. He said that ``FBI \npersonnel declined to offer guidance, restricted their interest to the \nparameters of a possible criminal investigation and did not commit to \nconducting a criminal investigation until after consultation with \nappropriate personnel within the FBI and Department of Justice.''\n  The GAO looked into the handling of the White House Travel Office. In \nits report in May of 1994 it stated, ``FBI interactions with Associate \nCounsel Kennedy and White House press officials occurred in a mode of \nurgency but GAO found no evidence that the FBI took inappropriate \naction as a result of those conditions.''\n  The GAO went on to say that it found that the FBI actions ``during \nthe period surrounding the removal of the Travel Office employees were \nreasonable and consistent with the agency's normal procedures.''\n  The Office of Professional Responsibility in the Department of \nJustice also reviewed the conduct of the FBI in this matter, and in its \nreport, dated March 18, 1994, said the following: ``Based on our \ninquiry, we have concluded that the FBI acted properly throughout its \ndealings with the White House regarding the Travel Office matter.''\n  Providing more detail, the report went on to say, ``As noted, we \nfound no wrongdoing on the part of any FBI employees regarding the \nTravel Office matter, but the various FBI agents who had direct contact \nwith White House Associate William Kennedy have different recollections \nof their conversations with him. All agreed that they did not interpret \nKennedy's statements as threats or attempts by him to pressure them to \nrespond to the factual situation in an inappropriate manner, or in any \nway inconsistent with normal procedures.''\n\n[[Page S10298]]\n\n  I am continuing to quote. ``And the record makes clear that the \nagents who had direct contact at the White House, as well as their \nsuperiors at FBI headquarters, followed normal procedures in responding \nto the Travel Office matter.''\n  The Office of Professional Responsibility goes on to say that ``ill-\nadvised and erroneous'' action by White House staff during this time--\n``ill-advised and erroneous'' action by White House staff during this \ntime; everyone concedes that. But the Office of Professional \nResponsibility said, ``--created the appearance that the FBI was being \nused by the White House for political purposes'' but concluded that the \nproblem was one of appearance and not substance with regard to the FBI.\n  The House committee report lays out a summary of the facts in this \ncase, a summary with which I do not have much dispute, but in reaching \nits conclusion it, like the legislation, makes no distinction between \nformer Travel Office employees who were not indicted and Billy Dale who \nwas indicted. That is the distinction which this appropriations bill \ndoes not make either. It is the critical distinction because there has \nbeen concession, there has been acknowledgement, there has been \nawareness for years that errors were made by the White House in the \nfiring of those people and the attorney's fees have been paid, and they \nhave been paid except for $50,000, in this bill, properly.\n  But there is another case, there is another situation in here. That \nis the proper legal indictment of Billy Dale following a proper \ninvestigation by the FBI, following a proper review of that \ninvestigation by the Department of Justice, following a proper \nindictment by the Department of Justice from the grand jury, following \na proper jury trial.\n  The issue with respect to this legislation then is not the payment--\nand I am going to repeat this because we are going to hear a lot about \nthe improper firing, which is conceded, has been acknowledged for \nyears, and I have no doubt that we will hear later tonight, perhaps \ntomorrow, in great detail about the improper firing of these employees \nof the Travel Office, and that is not the issue. That has been \nacknowledged at least for 2 years. Those attorney fees, again, should \nbe and have been paid for the most part and will be paid, the balance, \nin this legislation. I think it is supported universally that they were \ninappropriate firings and that the legal fees should be paid. I do not \nknow anyone who disagrees with that one.\n  The issue here is the payment of attorney fees to somebody who was \nproperly and legally indicted for the first time that I can find in our \nhistory. No standards in the committee report, no committee report from \nthe Senate, just a private bill to pay attorney fees of people legally \nindicted, following a proper investigation by the FBI, not tainted, not \nalleged to be tainted, following proper prosecution, not tainted, not \nalleged to be tainted, either at trial or in the House report or as far \nas I know here. What was improper was the firing. But the indictment \nwas proper, too, and I am going to spend a few minutes as to what that \nevidence was that led the FBI and the Department of Justice to seek an \nindictment and to prosecute Billy Dale.\n  This indictment was based on a finding of probable cause that a named \nindividual committed a crime. Billy Dale was in charge of the White \nHouse Travel Office. He served as its head for 11 years, had been in \nthe office for 32 years. There were six other employees in the Travel \nOffice who worked under Billy Dale. None of these employees, including \nBilly Dale, was a member of the civil service. All the employees, \nincluding Billy Dale, served at the pleasure of the President and could \nbe fired at will.\n  The job of the White House Travel Office is to accommodate the White \nHouse press corps by arranging for their transportation and housing \nwhile on travel to cover the President. Although the Federal employees \nin the Travel Office are paid for at taxpayer expense, the payment for \nthe travel, the airplane, taxi, train, hotel costs are paid for by the \nrespective news organizations. The moneys for travel are funneled \nthrough the White House Travel Office, so while the White House Travel \nOffice employees will make the arrangements for the airplane charter \nand handle the reservations for hotel accommodations and meals, the \nmoney to pay for those items will be collected by the Federal employees \nat the Travel Office from the news organizations and then paid to the \nrespective companies that have incurred the costs.\n\n  To cover the costs in advance and keep the operation running, the \nFederal employees at the Travel Office oversee and maintain an account \nat the Riggs Bank through which payments and reimbursements are made.\n  So let's say that the White House press corps needs 20 rooms at a \nhotel in Paris. The White House Travel Office books the 20 rooms, pays \nfor them when required either upfront or after the trip, and then it \nbills each respective news organization for its share of the expenses.\n  That is how it is done. Why Federal employees should be the ones \nresponsible for getting the press corps around the world and \naccommodated may not be 100 percent clear, but that is the way it \nworks. There is no problem with that. That is the way it works.\n  White House Travel Office employees would often go on these trips to \nmanage the travel and to cover incidental costs such as baggage \nhandlers and local transportation. The employees who would go on a trip \nwould take a fair amount of cash with them to pay for the necessary \nexpenses. They get this money, this cash they took along with them from \na petty cash account that they maintained at the Travel Office. They \nwere supposed to work as follows: The petty cash account would be \nreplenished by cashing checks at the Riggs Bank where the main account \nfor the office was maintained, recording the number of the check and \nthe amount cashed in a petty cash log. The Travel Office employees were \nsupposed to use either the Riggs Bank account, which was several blocks \naway, that is all, from the White House, or the petty cash account, \nwhich was in the Travel Office, to cover the expenses while traveling \nwith the White House press corps.\n  In May 1993, the White House counsel's office requested Peat Marwick, \na private accounting firm, to conduct a review of the financial records \nof the Travel Office. That review found, according to the summary, \n``significant accounting system weaknesses, including missing or \ninadequate documentation for disbursements, a lack of financial control \nconsciousness, no formal financial reporting process, no \nreconciliations of financial information, no documented system of \nchecks and balances on transactions and accounting decisions within the \noffice, no general ledger of cash receipts, disbursement journals, no \ncopies of bills on file.''\n  Now, in particular, Peat Marwick noted about ``eight discrepancies \nbetween the amounts written to cash on the Riggs National Bank account \nand the recording of these amounts into the petty cash fund.''\n  ``Each of the eight checks was made out to cash and signed by the \ndirector of the press travel office and endorsed by the same \nindividual. Those discrepancies totaled,'' according to Peat Marwick, \n``$23,000.''\n  As a result of that audit, the FBI began an investigation, and during \nthe investigation the FBI learned the following. Sometime around 1988, \nBilly Dale started depositing checks that belonged to the Travel Office \ninto his own personal account in Maryland that he had with his wife. \nDale deposited, the FBI found, 55 checks over 3 years totaling $54,000. \nHe did not reveal that he was depositing those checks into his account \nin Maryland instead of in the office account across the street to \nanybody. He did not acknowledge or notify Peat Marwick he was doing it. \nHe did not tell the FBI he was doing it. He did not tell his coworkers \nat the White House he was doing it--nobody. The FBI uncovered the \ndeposits in his account because it had subpoenaed the records from that \naccount.\n\n  The FBI also learned that on numerous occasions Dale cashed Travel \nOffice checks for petty cash at the Riggs Bank but failed to record \nthat fact on the petty cash ledger, which he was supposed to do. There \nwas an unaccounted-for discrepancy of $13,000. During the Peat Marwick \naudit, Dale never mentioned these facts and irregularities to auditors. \nHe never told anyone else about that money. We are here talking about \npetty cash. He did not\n\n[[Page S10299]]\n\ntell his fellow employees in the White House Travel Office, anybody at \nthe FBI once the FBI investigation started. And this is from the trial \ntranscript now of Billy Dale.\n\n       Question: And you never told your deputy that you had taken \n     checks out of the Travel Office and put them into your \n     personal account, did you?\n       Answer: That is correct.\n       Question: And you never told any of the people in the \n     Travel Office that you had taken checks out and put them in \n     your personal account?\n       Answer: That is true.\n\n  Over the course of 3 years, 1988 to 1991, Billy Dale took checks \nintended for the White House Travel Office, which were checks mostly \nfrom telephone companies to reimburse the Travel Office for prior \npayments in excess of needs. He took those checks, which were supposed \nto go to the Travel Office, deposited them in his personal bank account \nin Clinton, MD. He never told anyone, again, people he had worked with \nfor decades, about taking those checks.\n  When he was asked about which checks he took, this is what he \nadmitted at trial. How did he select the checks which he was not going \nto deposit in the Riggs account across the street? It was the office \naccount. The ones he took to Clinton, MD, and deposited and merged with \nhis own private funds with his wife in his own personal bank accounts, \nhow did he pick them? Which ones? There were thousands of checks which \ncome in:\n\n       Question: And you took a little more care in selecting \n     these checks, didn't you?\n       Answer: I don't know what you mean.\n       Question: Well, you took the telephone refund checks, \n     because there was no record in the office that these \n     telephone refund checks were issued and coming back to the \n     office; right?\n       Answer: That is right.\n       Question: And so no one would know that the money was \n     missing, right?\n       Answer: That is right.\n       Question: And, so that no one would learn of what were you \n     doing, right?\n       Answer: That is right.\n\n  Now, again, the FBI was not told by Billy Dale that he deposited \n$54,000 in checks in his personal account. He did not tell Peat Marwick \nduring their review. Despite the negative report by Peat Marwick about \nfinancial mismanagement, he did not disclose it then. He never told \nanyone about that--3 years, deposits checks in his personal account. It \nwas only after they were subpoenaed by the FBI that they discovered the \ndeposits of these Travel Office checks by Mr. Dale.\n  So, now the FBI learns, because of its subpoenaed bank records, of \nthese deposits of $54,000 in Travel Office money in his personal \naccount. That is not a small amount of money and it is not a minor act \nby a Federal employee. It is a willful, intentional deposit of Travel \nOffice funds in an employee's private bank account. He did not keep the \nfunds separate. He merged them in his own private account, all mixed \ntogether.\n  There is not one of us in this Chamber who would tolerate that \nconduct by any of our employees. No one in private industry would allow \nthat. He did it surreptitiously, he did it secretly, and even when he \nknew that the FBI was investigating the financial management of the \nTravel Office, he kept it a secret.\n  That is about as good probable cause as a lot of prosecutors are \ngoing to get in a lot of cases. At trial, Billy Dale testified and \npresented an explanation for his conduct. He said that he was under \npressure by news organizations to keep the size of the office account \nat Riggs, the so-called surplus in that account, at a reasonable \namount. But he said he needed more money than that in order to pay the \nbills, and he testified he needed ``convenience and flexibility'' in \ngetting cash for trips.\n\n  Apparently walking two blocks to the Riggs Bank and cashing a \ntelephone refund check to take on a trip was not sufficient \nconvenience. So here is what he testified he did. He testified he kept \na personal hoard of cash at his home, not his home bank in Clinton, but \nhis house. He kept $20,000, he said, at his house. This came, he said, \nfrom the proceeds of a small business that he sold, from rent that he \nreceived from his children, and from the proceeds of his brother's \nestate. He testified that he would take a telephone refund check for \nthe Travel Office, which might be in an amount of, say, $800 or $1,000, \nhe would go home, take that amount from his cash reserve. He would then \nbring that amount from his cash reserve into the Travel Office. He \nwould then take the refund check which was intended for the Travel \nOffice and deposit it in his personal account at the Clinton, MD, bank. \nThat is his explanation as to how he deposited $54,000 of Travel Office \nmoney in his personal checking account, for flexibility and \nconvenience.\n  He could have cashed these checks two blocks away at the Riggs Bank, \na bank that Travel Office employees used all the time, but he did not \ndo that. He deposited them in his personal bank account, merged with \nhis personal money for ``flexibility and convenience.'' He never made a \ncopy of the checks, never told anyone in the Travel Office about them. \nNo other Travel Office employee who had the same financial needs and \nresponsibilities on these trips--no other Travel Office employee \ndeposited Travel Office checks in their personal checking accounts. All \nthe other Travel Office employees used either cash from the Riggs \naccount or cash from the petty cash account in the office. All the \nothers--not Billy Dale.\n  Now, those facts surely were reasonable grounds upon which to \nproceed. No one has argued--again, I emphasize, no one has argued that \nthe decision to prosecute was not reasonable here or that the FBI \ninvestigation was not reasonable here. The judge found that that was \nadequate to sustain a conviction.\n  Supporters of Billy Dale say because he was acquitted in just a few \nhours, somehow or other that taints the prosecution. Are we going to \nget into the business of awarding attorney's fees to an indicted, \nproperly indicted but acquitted, individual based on the amount of time \nthat it took to acquit? O.J. Simpson's trial lasted over a year and the \njury deliberated less than a day. Should the State of California pay \nO.J. Simpson's attorney's fees because of the brevity of the \ndeliberation? I do not think we want to walk down that road. I do not \nthink we want to base our judgment on the validity of a criminal \nprosecution on the length of a jury's deliberation.\n  Moreover, Billy Dale offered to plead guilty to a felony. This is a \nsituation where we are asked to decide whether a person who offered to \nplead guilty to a felony should receive $450,000 in taxpayers' money to \npay for his defense when his offer to plead guilty was rejected by the \nGovernment as not being adequate and he went to trial. The offer is to \na felony called ``wrongful conversion'' to one's own use and property \nunder his control. He offered to plead guilty to a felony \ncalled ``wrongful conversion.'' He did it on November 30, 1994. This \ninformation has been made public in many newspapers. Several points in \nthis written plea offer are important to note.\n\n  First, it is clearly and unequivocally an offer to plead guilty to \none count. It is one count of violation of the U.S. Code, section 654, \nwhich states as follows:\n\n       Whoever, being an officer or employee of the United States, \n     or of any department or agency thereof, embezzles or \n     wrongfully converts to his own use the money or property of \n     another which comes into his possession or under his control \n     in the execution of such office or employment, or under color \n     or claim of authority as such officer or employee, shall be \n     fined under this title not more than the value of the money \n     or property thus embezzled or converted . . . .\n\n  And so forth.\n  Billy Dale says he did not agree to plead guilty to embezzlement, and \nthat is correct. He did agree to plead guilty to wrongful conversion, \nwhich is part of the same statute as the embezzlement language, the \nsame section, section 655 of 18 U.S. Code, which makes it a felony to \neither embezzle or wrongfully convert. Both crimes carry the same \nmaximum penalties of up to 10 years in prison.\n  Billy Dale not only offered to pay a fine of not to exceed $69,000, \nhe also offered to accept up to 4 months imprisonment, one-half of \nwhich was to be served in jail.\n  Why was Billy Dale offering to plead guilty? As he has said in \nvarious testimonies since he offered to plead guilty: Because he wanted \nto spare his family the grief and expense of a trial. But he also \noffered to plead guilty because he did not want to face the risk, a \nrisk that he must have thought he had a reasonable likelihood of \nincurring, the risk of a longer jail term. His attorney wrote in the \nplea offer and the consequences of the acceptance of the\n\n[[Page S10300]]\n\nplea--this is the attorney for Billy Dale that said in the plea offer:\n\n       The Government will be able to publicize the conviction in \n     a case that has received considerable notoriety. The \n     defendant will in all likelihood receive some jail time and \n     will suffer a substantial financial detriment, all of which \n     is important to the Government. Moreover, Mr. Dale will be \n     forced to live with the stigma of having acted criminally in \n     his handling of the Travel Office money.\n       On the other hand--\n\n  His attorney writes in the plea offer:\n\n     Mr. Dale will avoid the expensive trial and the risk of a \n     substantially longer jail term.\n\n  So he offered to plead guilty, pay both a sizable fine and actually \nserve some time in jail.\n  One other fact relative to the trial. At the end of the Government's \ncase, Billy Dale made a motion for acquittal, and that was denied. This \nmotion allows the judge to assess the presentation of the Government's \nevidence and decide if, on its face, it is insufficient to present to a \njury.\n  Rule XXIX of the Federal rules of criminal procedure provide that:\n\n       The court, on motion of a defendant or on its own motion, \n     shall order the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or more \n     offenses charged in the indictment after the evidence on \n     either side is closed if the evidence is insufficient to \n     sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.\n\n  So here was another check on the legitimacy of the prosecution. Even \nthough the grand jury was appropriately convened and the indictment was \nwithout defect and the prosecution did not violate due process and was \nnot inappropriately selective, the defendant can ask the judge to \nconsider whether the evidence of guilt, as presented by the Government, \nis sufficient to sustain a conviction by the jury. If the Government \ndid not present sufficient evidence to convict, then the case does not \ngo to the jury. The judge must acquit based on the motion of the \ndefendant over its own motion.\n  Billy Dale made this motion, and it was denied by the judge. So, in \nthe opinion of the judge, after the Government had presented all of its \nevidence, there was sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction.\n  I think a reasonable person looking at this record would find it \nreasonable to conclude that the criminal prosecution of Billy Dale was \nlegitimate. Three separate reports on the firing of the White House \nTravel Office employees concluded there was no wrongdoing by the FBI, \nwhich was the lead investigative agency into alleged criminal conduct \nin the Travel Office. The GAO concluded in May 1994 that ``the FBI and \nthe IRS actions during the period surrounding the removal of the Travel \nOffice employees were reasonable and consistent with the agency's \nnormal procedures.''\n  The FBI's internal review in May 1993 determined ``the FBI acted \ncorrectly:''\n\n       FBI personnel declined to offer guidance, restricted their \n     interest to the parameters of a possible criminal \n     investigation and did not commit to conducting a criminal \n     investigation until after consultation with appropriate \n     personnel within the FBI and the Department of Justice.\n\n  Third, the review by the Office of Professional Responsibility and \nthe Department of Justice concluded:\n\n       We found no wrongdoing on the part of any FBI employees \n     regarding the Travel Office matter.\n\n  The Senate has not had 1 hour of hearings on this bill. We don't have \na committee report upon which we can assess the facts, not only of the \ncriminal prosecution but of the estimate for the attorney's fees.\n  The House committee report upon which we are supposed to rely does \nnot even mention, does not discuss the nature of the indictment or the \nfacts surrounding the indictment or the basis for it. Those facts are \nignored. What it focuses on and what I am sure will be focused on here \ntonight is the inappropriateness of the firings, which the White House \nand others concede.\n\n  The attorney's fees relating to the firing are, concededly, \nappropriately paid. We should pay them. We paid three-quarters of them. \nWe should pay the balance in this bill. Those are not at issue. It is \nnot the firings that is at issue here. It is whether or not the \ncriminal indictment and the prosecution was defective and \ninappropriate. That is the issue, because that is what these $450,000 \nof attorney's fees relate to.\n  The basis upon which we should consider paying Mr. Dale's attorney's \nfees would be if there had been information uncovered that the Federal \nGovernment acted unfairly in indicting Mr. Dale. If there was \nsufficient evidence of that, then we should be given that information. \nThat is the only basis upon which we ought to be considering spending \nalmost a half million dollars of the taxpayers' money to reimburse \nBilly Dale and setting a precedent, which, as far as we can determine, \nis, indeed, a precedent, paying the attorney's fees of someone who is \nproperly and legally indicted.\n  We do not have a record of the facts upon which we can make such a \njudgment.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there is a process in law to get that record. \nThis legislation is effectively a private relief bill. In fact, the \nParliamentarian has already ruled that the freestanding bill is a \nprivate relief bill for Billy Dale.\n  There is a statutory procedure, 28 U.S. Code, section 2509. That \nprocedure provides that the Court of Claims can determine whether or \nnot private relief sought from Congress and the taxpayers by an \nindividual or group of individuals is appropriate.\n  Under that statute, the Court of Federal Claims, on referral from \neither the Senate or the House, is required to determine if there is a \nlegal or equitable claim to taxpayers' money or whether such payment \nwould be simply a gratuity. The statute provides the following in part, \nand here I am reading section 2509 of 28 U.S. Code:\n\n       Whenever a bill is referred by either House of Congress to \n     the chief judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims, \n     the chief judge shall designate a judge as hearing officer \n     for the case and a panel of three judges of the court to \n     serve as a reviewing body.\n       Each hearing officer and each review panel shall have \n     authority to do and perform any acts which may be necessary \n     or proper for the official performance of their duties, \n     including the power of subpoena and the power to administer \n     oaths and affirmation.\n       The hearing officer shall determine the facts and shall \n     append to his findings of fact conclusions sufficient to \n     inform Congress whether the demand is a legal or equitable \n     claim or gratuity and the amount legally or equitably due \n     from the United States to the claimant.\n\n  Referral under this statute to the Court of Claims would require the \ncourt to develop a factual record outside the rhetoric of politics upon \nwhich we could either then base a judgment or, in the case of the \namendment that has actually been filed, all that would be necessary is \nfor the Court of Claims to determine that, in fact, it is an equitable \nclaim. And then the legal fees would be automatically paid. We would be \ngiven a report under the amendment which the Senator from Nevada \nfiled, but it would not have to come back here for further action. We \nwould authorize these attorney's fees subject to a determination and \nfinding by the Court of Claims pursuant to a law which is on the books \nthat that is an equitable claim against the United States.\n\n  Surely, we owe that much to the American taxpayers who would be \npaying this bill, and we owe that much to ourselves before making a \ndecision on overturning decades of precedent. That is what the \namendment would do.\n  Again, it allows for the five Travel Office employees who were not \nindicted to receive the final reimbursement of $50,000 for their legal \nfees, which I think we all support. But it would refer the matter \nrelative to Billy Dale's attorney's fees to the Court of Federal Claims \nfor determination on the merits, and if the court determines that Billy \nDale has either a legal or equitable claim, then this amendment would \nprovide Billy Dale would be paid directly at that time when the \nfindings of the Court of Claims become final.\n  No additional action would be required other than a report to us of \nwhat that final decision is. If, however, the court were to conclude \nthat the payments to Billy Dale were not based on a legal or equitable \nclaim but would be a gratuity, then the fees would not be paid.\n  This is a routine procedure. We use this procedure dozens of times. \nWe refer cases to the Court of Claims all the time. We do it with \nprivate relief bills all the time. Sometimes the court finds that there \nis a legal or equitable claim; sometimes it finds that it is a mere \ngratuity. But before we set a precedent that we may come to regret, \nthere should be, from some objective source, a determination that this \nclaim is a legal or equitable basis.\n\n[[Page S10301]]\n\n  Adoption of the Reid amendment, which has been cosponsored by myself \nand Senator Biden, is the surest way to remove this issue from \npolitics, which is regrettably infused. Mr. President, I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr HATCH. I yield to the distinguished majority leader. I would like \nto retain my right to the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah \nfor yielding, but I do think we need to notify our Members of where we \nare. It will not take me but just a moment.\n  For the information of all Senators, earlier this evening the Senate \nreached an agreement which limits the amendments in order to the \nTreasury-Postal Service appropriations bill. The managers have been \nworking, along with the leadership representatives, with a number of \nSenators, to reduce that list, instead of just a large list of \namendments here.\n  However, the grand total of amendments on the list is somewhere \nbetween 95 and 97, I guess, amendments, which certainly is \nunsatisfactory at this point. It makes it very difficult for us to be \nable to complete the bill. But in order for the managers to continue to \nwork and try to reduce these amendments or to clear some of the \namendments, I would like to announce now, there will be no further \nvotes this evening, and any votes ordered tonight on this or other \namendments will be stacked at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday.\n  Senators should be aware that the managers are here and are willing \nto debate, perhaps accept amendments or to conclude some of the \namendments that are now being debated. Members should expect rollcall \nvotes, of course, throughout the day on Thursday. It would be my \nintent, in the morning, after consultation with the managers and the \nminority leader, that we would continue on amendments in the morning.\n  After the stacked votes, if any, at 9:30--we had hoped to go to the \nChemical Weapons Convention at 10 o'clock in the morning. It looks like \nwe will have to just delay that and see where we are, which means that \nwe could have to go very, very late into the night on Thursday night, \ncould actually have to go over until Friday to have a vote on Friday \nmorning.\n  In any event, there will not be any votes after 12 noon on Friday, \nsince it is a Jewish holiday. I had hoped we could come to some \nreasonable conclusion on this bill, get it completed, and then spend \nthe necessary time tomorrow on the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  It is my intent to go to the Chemical Weapons Convention tomorrow. I \njust do not know when it might be now in an effort to try to get some \nconclusion on these amendments and complete this bill. But there will \nbe no further rollcall votes tonight. The next vote will be at 9:30 in \nthe morning, if any are ordered.\n  Does the minority leader have any comment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just say, I want to thank the \nMembers of our leadership for working with Members on our side. As I \nunderstand it, the list is quite extensive on both sides. There are 51 \nRepublican amendments and almost that many, not quite that many, \nDemocratic amendments. But we are going to do our best to work with the \nmajority leader to see if we can bring that list down substantially by \ntomorrow.\n  Obviously, Senators would be very helpful to both of us if we could \nlimit the amount of time on many of those amendments and offer \nadditional amendments tonight. There is no reason even if there are no \nmore votes why we cannot have a number of amendments yet tonight. So, \nhopefully we can do that and be in a much better position to come to \nsome final assessment as to what the list looks like by midmorning \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just in conclusion, certainly we will be \nworking with the Senator from South Dakota. We will get this list pared \ndown to what I guess is a real list, probably two or three or four or \nfive max. I do not know why we have to go through these exercises, but \nwe do, and we will do the best we can.\n  Again, under the rules we have, every Senator has his right or her \nright to make their case, and we will work with them on that. But I do \nwant to remind Senators, a lot of times they think, ``Well, this will \nkind of just go away, and I won't have to stay late tomorrow night, and \nI can fly home tomorrow night or I'll be able to leave Friday \nmorning.''\n\n  There are some things around here that have to occur. And we have a \nunanimous-consent agreement on the Chemical Weapons Convention. I have \nan obligation to call that up. And I am going to. It requires 10 hours \nunder the rule. We can either cut that time down or we can take the \nwhole 10 hours. We can go late tomorrow night. But if we do not begin \nuntil 1 or 2 or whatever time, it would be very late tomorrow night, \nand we could not do anything about it basically. That one would go \nuntil we got to the end.\n  So when Senators come, pleading, saying, ``I want to go home,'' there \nwould not be anything we could do if we wanted to. Or I guess one other \noption is, we can go over and have a vote on that on Friday morning. I \nknow that there are some Members of the Jewish faith who would like \nvery much on their holiday to be able to leave on Friday morning so \nthey can be with their families before the Jewish holiday begins. I \nwould like to honor that, but we are in a bind here.\n  If we finish this bill at a reasonable time, we can go to chemical \nweapons at a reasonable time. We either get a time agreement, or vote \nlate tomorrow night, or vote on Friday. This is one time where the \nleadership is not going to have a lot of options.\n  So I plead, once again, with our Members, let us be reasonable. This \nis not the last train. We still have plenty of times to play games, if \nwe insist, on both sides of the aisle. I am not putting the other side \ndown. We have ours on there, you have yours. So let us agree to hold \nhands and do this bill, and we can save all of our choice, lovely, \nluscious amendments for the next bill or the next bill. We still have 3 \nweeks. We do not have to do it on this one. Then we can do two very \nimportant bills--Treasury-Postal Service, Chemical Weapons Convention. \nAnd I believe we can work on that in the morning. I have seen miracles \nhappen around here before. Maybe we could come up with one in the \nmorning.\n  Mr. REID. Would the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Might I just make one other point.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator from Nevada.\n  As I look at the list on both sides, the one thing I think the \nmajority leader will agree with me on, about two-thirds, if not three-\nfourths of those amendments are legislative amendments. I believe we \nmade a very big mistake a year ago in overriding the Chair on the \nquestion of legislating on appropriations bills.\n  I think we are paying a heavy price, and will continue to pay a heavy \nprice, so long as we continue to insist that even on appropriations \nbills we can add anything to everything. And that issue will come back. \nIt stung us and it has caused us more problems in the last 2 years than \nvirtually anything else. I think it was a big mistake. Our Republican \ncolleagues insisted at the time to overrule the Chair and allow the \npractice of legislating on appropriations bills, so these amendments \nare fair game. But we are now paying the price, and continue to pay the \nprice so long as that issue becomes almost a joke with regard to these \nappropriations bills.\n  So I think when we get back for the 105th Congress, and when we have \nthe opportunity again, in the majority, to deal with this issue, I hope \nwe can restore the rule.\n  Mr. LOTT. The majority will certainly look at that very closely \nbecause we will be working in the majority with the minority. I think \nthis is one case where maybe we can agree and in fact change the rule \nor take action to bring some reasonableness back to this area. I think \nI agree with what the Senator is saying. Let us work together no \nmatter, you know, which party is in control to get that resolved.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S10302]]\n\n  Mr. REID. While both leaders are on the floor, speaking for me, this \nSenator, and for--sorry.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe that is correct. I believe the Senator from Utah \nhad yielded to me.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield for a question, and then retain \nmy right to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I want to make a brief statement. I apologize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. While both leaders are here, I want them to understand \nthat, speaking for this Senator, Senator Levin and Senator Biden, we do \nnot intend to hold this bill up because of the amendment we have \noffered. However, if we do not get a vote on our amendment, then we \nhave no alternative. We need an up-or-down vote on our amendment. And \nthe procedure, the way things are now before us, we will not be able to \ndo that. So we will agree to a time agreement, and be totally \nreasonable, but we want an up-or-down vote on whether or not this \nmatter should be referred to the Court of Claims.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, would it be in order to ask unanimous \nconsent to get a time agreement, say, for additional debate of no more \nthan an hour and 20 minutes? I am prepared to offer one of the \namendments I was planning to offer in order to accommodate the schedule \nif we could, perhaps, divide the next 90 minutes equally.\n  Mr. HATCH. I might add, it is going to take me a little bit of time \nto rebut what they have said. I will certainly be amenable to trying.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. How much time does the Senator from Utah need?\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no idea. I imagine 45 minutes to an hour.\n  Mr. REID. I need about 15 minutes if I get an up-or-down vote on my \namendment sometime through this process.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would like about 10 minutes, so perhaps we could take \nan hour on the Republican side and a half hour on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the chairman of the committee has some comments.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Could we ask unanimous consent that the time for the \namendment be divided two-thirds/one-third, providing the Republicans \nwith an hour, the Democrats with half an hour, beginning at 8:45, with \na vote to be held tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. LOTT. Is this on the Hatch amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. And the Reid amendments, back to back, following the end \nof the debate.\n  Let me say this: The proponents have taken 2 hours; I believe I can \nfinish in about an hour, and I will try to do it in less time than \nthat, but I do have to rebut what they have had to say because I think \nit has been outrageous.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator would yield again, I have no problem with \nthe reasonable suggestion made by the Democratic leader as long as we \nhave a vote on both amendments.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I wonder if the Democrat leader would yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the time.\n  Mr. HATCH. The parliamentary situation is that the Reid-Levin \namendment has been filed. We filed a second-degree amendment. Their \namendment would go to the Court of Claims. Frankly, I do not see any \nreason why, if we went on my amendment, why you have to have a vote on \nyour amendment.\n  Mr. REID. That is the whole problem. We want a vote. We want the \nSenate to vote as to whether that matter should be referred to the \nCourt of Claims. If the Senate says no, we will walk away from this.\n  If we only get a vote to keep this in the bill, then I think I can \nspeak for the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Delaware, we \nare going to talk here a while.\n  Mr. HATCH. You are going to filibuster the bill over that issue?\n  This is legitimate. You filed an amendment; we filed a second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Would it accommodate both to have two freestanding \namendments back to back, voted up or down at 9:30? That would \naccommodate everyone and resolve the matter, and we could move on to \nother issues.\n  Mr. HATCH. Fine with me.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we can get an agreement to that. I \nwant to clarify the time that we are talking about.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield? I will move to table the Reid \namendment, but it would be a vote up or down.\n  Mr. REID. We understand. We would have an opportunity to offer our \namendment, and you could move to table it.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe that would do it.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for the suggestion in \ntrying to put that in motion here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time on the pending issue be limited \nto 60 minutes under the control of Senator Hatch, with 50 minutes to \nSenator Hatch and 10 minutes with Senator Shelby, and then 30 minutes \nof time under the control of Senator Daschle or his designee, and votes \noccur first on the amendment No. 5257, and then on or in relation to \nthe amendment of the Senator from Nevada, and that vote occur at 9:30.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It would accommodate a Senator if that vote could occur \nat 9:45.\n  Mr. LOTT. We would have that vote at 9:45. Every time we do that, it \npushes the Chemical Weapons Convention further back down, but the vote \nis to occur at 9:45.\n  I also ask each amendment be in the first degree and no second-degree \namendments be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this has to be one of the most hypocritical \nWhite Houses in this century. And that is really saying something. \nFrankly, I think it is abominable, absolutely abominable. And my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are attempting to retry Mr. \nDale right here in the Senate. Senator Levin, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan, is even suggesting that Billy Dale should have been \nfound guilty.\n  Fortunately--fortunately--our system calls for a more equitable fair \nprocess. Mr. Dale has been tried by a jury of his peers, and he was \nacquitted in less than 2 hours. I think there is a principle called \ndouble jeopardy. I am really amazed that after this man was smeared by \nthe White House--for greedy purposes, to help their buddies, the \nThomasons, and their relative, Ms. Cornelius--was put through an \nabysmal trial that cost him $500,000. And this outfit is acting like \nsomething should not be done.\n  I found the White House critical in this issue, and that is an \nunderstatement. The fact is, these people were smeared. They were \ntreated improperly. They were abused. The FBI was abused, and it was \nall done for the purposes of greed, so they could take care of their \nbuddies.\n  The fact of the matter is, if you look at what has happened here, it \nis just pathetic. A memorandum we got from the White House admits to \nthe wrongdoing:\n\n       You all may dimly remember the Travel Office affair in \n     which a number of White House staff, many immature and self-\n     promoting, took impulsive and foolhardy actions to root out \n     problems at the beginning of the Clinton administration and \n     gallantly recommended they take over its operation.\n\n  Those comments were from the White House itself.\n  Now, let me read from the Watkins memorandum. This is an interim \nWhite House memorandum. I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [Privileged and Confidential--Memorandum]\n\n     From: David Watkins.\n     Subject: Response to Internal White House Travel Office \n         Management Review.\n\n       In an effort to respond to the Internal Travel Office \n     Review, I have prepared this memorandum, which details my \n     response to the various conclusions of that Report. This is a \n     soul cleansing, carefully detailing the surrounding \n     circumstances and the pressures that demanded that action be \n     taken immediately. It is my first attempt to be sure the \n     record is straight, something I have not done in previous \n     conversations with investigators--where I have been \n     protective and vague as possible. I know you will carefully \n     consider the issues and concerns expressed herein.\n       As a preliminary matter, the procedure followed in \n     finalizing the report was needlessly unfair. Even in the \n     context of General Accounting Office audits and reviews, the \n     reviewed agency is afforded the opportunity to respond to the \n     report and criticisms prior to\n\n[[Page S10303]]\n\n     release and publication. This is an important step which \n     allows inaccuracies or erroneous conclusions to be addressed \n     and corrected prior to publication, and more importantly, \n     allows the criticized party to respond to the contents of the \n     report. Unfortunately, in this case, neither I nor others \n     directly involved were afforded any opportunity to rebut the \n     contents and conclusions of the internal Review.\n       In this case, I was notified of the forthcoming reprimand \n     around 10 a.m. on July 2. But I received a copy of the report \n     shortly after noon the same day, and at the exact time from \n     that briefing the report was publicly released. I was never \n     afforded the opportunity to respond, and until this \n     memorandum, I have never responded to the report or its \n     contents.\n       With the recent release of GAO audits and the resultant \n     press coverage and criticism of my office, setting the record \n     straight on the Travel Office occurrences is important.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       As you recall, an issue developed between the Secret \n     Service and the First Family in February and March requiring \n     resolution and action on your's and my part. The First Family \n     was anxious to have that situation immediately resolved, and \n     the First Lady in particular was extremely upset with the \n     delayed action in that case.\n       Likewise, in this case, the First Lady took interest in \n     having the Travel Office situation resolved quickly, \n     following Harry Thomason's bringing it to her attention. \n     Thomason briefed the First Lady on his suspicion that the \n     Travel Office was improperly funnelling business to a single \n     charter company, and told her that the functions of that \n     office could be easily replaced and reallocated.\n       Once this made it onto the First Lady's agenda, Vince \n     Foster became involved, and he and Harry Thomason regularly \n     informed me of her attention to the Travel Office situation--\n     as well as her insistence that the situation be resolved \n     immediately by replacing the Travel Office staff.\n       Foster regularly informed me that the First Lady was \n     concerned and desired action--the action desired was the \n     firing of the Travel Office staff. On Friday, while I was in \n     Memphis, Foster told me that it was important that I speak \n     directly with the First Lady that day. I called her that \n     evening and she conveyed to me in clear terms that her desire \n     for swift and clear action to resolve the situation. She \n     mentioned that Thomason had explained how the Travel Office \n     could be run after removing the current staff--that plan \n     included bringing in World Wide Travel and Penny Sample to \n     handle the basic travel functions, the actual actions taken \n     post dismissal and in light of that she thought immediate \n     action was in order.\n       On Monday morning, you came to my office and met with me \n     and Patsy Thomasson. At that meeting you explained that this \n     was on the First Lady's ``radar screen.'' The message you \n     conveyed to me was clear: immediate action must be taken. I \n     explained to you that I had decided to terminate the Travel \n     Office employees, and you expressed relief that we were \n     finally going to take action (to resolve the situation in \n     conformity with the First Lady's wishes). We both knew that \n     there would be hell to pay if, after our failure in the \n     Secret Service situation earlier, we failed to take swift and \n     decisive action in conformity with the First Lady's wishes. \n     You then approved the decision to terminate the Travel Office \n     staff, and I indicated I would send you a memorandum \n     outlining the decision and plan, which I did.\n       I have never stated all this so clearly before, but to form \n     a complete and accurate picture it must be kept in mind while \n     reading the specific criticisms of the Podesta Management \n     Review. I will now address those criticisms directly.\n\n\n  response to section ii ``discussion of principal issues'' of travel \n                             office review\n\n     ``Travel Office Management'' (Page 14):\n       ``The review conducted by KPMG Peat Marwick uncovered \n     serious financial mismanagement.'' At     .\n       At the strong recommendation of myself and others in my \n     office, KPMG Peat Marwick was brought in--instead of having \n     the FBI take over immediately--to review the financial \n     practices of the Travel Office. I concurred in Peat Marwick's \n     analysis and conclusions: Management of the Travel Office was \n     abysmal.\n\n     ``Treatment of the Travel Office Employees'' (Page 15):\n       ``While all White House Office employees serve at the \n     pleasure of the President, the abrupt manner of dismissal of \n     the Travel Office employees was unnecessary and \n     insensitive.'' At ____.\n       In the conversation with the Travel Office staff notifying \n     them of their termination, I explained that a review of the \n     Travel Office operations had always been planned to conform \n     to the general review process implemented across the White \n     House administrative offices and the Office of \n     Administration. I further explained my decision to terminate \n     them; I explained that from a management perspective, in this \n     case it was best to relieve them all immediately from their \n     jobs and provide them a additional two weeks in pay. I \n     informed them of this and asked them to leave immediately. \n     The tone was firm, with emphasis on the mismanagement \n     recounted in the Peat Marwick report. I explained that in \n     light of that mismanagement, it was best to dismiss the \n     entire office.\n       The allegation in the report that this was insensitive is \n     wrong. These employees work at the pleasure of the President \n     and all in the White House Office should understand that \n     there is extremely low tolerance for the severely negligent \n     and unaccountable procedures followed in that office. In \n     light of the First Lady's insistence for immediate action and \n     your concurrence, the abrupt manner of dismissal, from my \n     perspective, was the only option.\n       ``Moreover, the Peat Marwick report did not furnished \n     efficient cause for terminating the employees without \n     financial authority. As a legal matter, the White House has \n     this right to terminate an employee without cause. In this \n     case, however, the White House asserted that this termination \n     of all seven was for cause. Based on the information \n     available, this assertion was inappropriate with respect to \n     the employees who did not exercise financial authority. . . . \n     Abuses cause, in some humans approach was in order. For \n     example, even if it were decided that the Travel Office would \n     operate more efficiently with a reorganized, smaller staff, \n     an effort could have been made to locate other federal \n     employment for those who would be displace.'' At 15.\n       As early as February, the intent of Management and \n     Administration was to review and reorganize the Travel Office \n     before October 1 into a leaner operation--just as with every \n     other office within the domain of Management and \n     Administration, from the Photo Office to the Telephone Office \n     to the Travel Office. That remained the plan until the \n     intense pressures surrounding this incident arose in May. If \n     given time to develop, the original plan to reorganize the \n     Travel Office for a smooth transition in September would have \n     allowed the Travel Office employees to seek other federal \n     placement, along with other Executive Office of the President \n     staff, in anticipation of the end of the fiscal year staff \n     cuts; however, when pressure began to build for immediate \n     action in the Travel Office, the long-term plans were short-\n     circuited.\n       ``The other major White House mistake in the treatment of \n     the former Travel Office employees was in tarnishing their \n     reputations. This resulted, in discussed above, from the \n     inappropriate disclosure of an FBI investigation into \n     potential wrongdoing in the Travel Office. (p. 15) * * * It \n     was a mistake for the White House to publicly discuss FBI \n     involvement, which led to the disclosure of the FBI \n     investigations. * * * The talking points prepared by Watkins' \n     office for the press office stated that the White House had \n     asked the FBI to investigate. Eller had also sanctioned \n     the FBI in an earlier draft of talking points. In making \n     that reference, Watkins and Eller were insensitive to the \n     effect such reference can have on the reputation of an \n     innocent person. This mistake was compounded when Fouter's \n     and Kennedy's instruction to eliminate the FBI reference \n     was not carried out. Watkins did attempt to reach Myers, \n     and Eller himself omitted the FBI references in his own \n     background press briefings the morning of May 19. However, \n     neither ensured that Myers avoided the reference.'' At 18.\n       Revealing the ongoing FBI investigation was insensitive, \n     but that fact comprised one sentence in a draft version of \n     talking points drafted by one of my staff and distributed for \n     comment on the morning of May 19--the day of the termination. \n     The talking points were distributed to Foster, Kennedy, \n     Myers, and Eller with the expectation that we would have \n     until the 2 o'clock press briefing to get the kinks worked \n     out of the talking points. As soon as the suggestion came to \n     delete the reference to the FBI, it was done. I immediately \n     went to see Myers to inform her of the change and sensitivity \n     to the ongoing investigation, but she had gone to the Hill \n     with the President. I struck that sentence from Eller's copy \n     and asked him to inform Myers. As soon as Myers returned from \n     the Hill, prior to noon--more than an hour before the press \n     briefing--I proceeded to her office and told her not to \n     mention the FBI investigation She informed me that it was too \n     late. She had already responded by phone to a reporter's \n     inquiry by phone.\n       Thus, this was a mistake made on my part because I was not \n     intuitive enough to take the talking points drafted by one of \n     my staff and realize that the FBI investigation should not be \n     mentioned--despite the strong support this provided for White \n     House actions.\n       ``Catherine Cornelius also played a role in the dismissal \n     of the Travel Office employees, and she to had a personnel \n     stake in the outcome. As the three memos she wrote on the \n     Travel Office attest, who was eager to work in and, if \n     possible, manage the Office. Her proposal to reorganize the \n     travel office was appropriate and would be considered usual \n     to any transition process. But her role in the decision-\n     making process after she came, in effect, an `accuser' of the \n     Travel Office employees, by collecting documents and alleging \n     possible wrongdoing, was inappropriate. * * * [E]very effort \n     should be made to insulate the federal government's \n     management decisions from even the appearance that personal \n     interests have played a role in the outcome of those \n     decisions.'' At 20.\n       Catherine Cornelius had no part in the dismissals. I put no \n     stock in most of what Cornelius told me except to the degree \n     it was factual. Her arguments for dismissal and \n     reorganization had absolutely no bearing on the final \n     decision to terminate the employees. If her input had been \n     respected, the need for Peat Marwick would have been \n     negligible, but in light of her self-interest and\n\n[[Page S10304]]\n\n     her tendency to exaggerate, I decided to rely exclusively on \n     a professional accounting firm. Catherine Cornelius, despite \n     the Review's suggestion to the contrary, had absolutely no \n     role in the decision-making process, and was in no danger of \n     being placed in charge of the Travel Office. My intent all \n     along was to put a trained financial manager over all the \n     White House administrative operations, including the Travel \n     Office.\n       When I assigned Catherine to the Travel Office, I did ask \n     her to provide a report to me on May 15 based on her previous \n     experience and actual experience in the Travel Office. She \n     was placed in the Travel Office because of her prior \n     experience in that area and a need to move her out of my \n     immediate office--where she had become a liability to daily \n     operations. Having had extensive experience with Catherine, I \n     knew that her report would contain unworkable \n     recommendations, but as I have in the past, I expected to \n     distill those with which I disagreed from those I thought \n     helpful. Unfortunately, due to her desire to revamp the \n     Travel Office in her own likeness, Catherine may have ignored \n     my intent to carefully review and scrutinize any \n     recommendations made.\n       After Catherine became an ``accuser'' of the Travel Office \n     staff, her input was merely on a factual level. I interviewed \n     her to derive the factual basis of her allegations and for \n     facts about the tasks performed by the Travel Office staff, \n     but never asked for other, non-factual input other than the \n     May 15 report I was expecting. All views she expressed were \n     evaluated in light of her known bias. To put it simply, she \n     had no impact on the decision-making process other than by \n     providing factual information.\n       ``The White House took several actions that demonstrated an \n     insensitivity to the appearance of favoritism. Hiring World \n     Wide Travel on a no-bid basis--even as an interim, stop-gap \n     measure--created the appearance of favoritism toward a local \n     friend from the campaign. World Wide's president, Betta \n     Carney, is a long-time acquaintance of Watkins. Watkins' \n     Little Rock advertising agency was a client of World Wide in \n     the 1970s and World Wide was a client of Watkins' agency \n     during that time period.'' At 20.\n       Part of the plan for immediate replacement of the Travel \n     Office staff was use of World Wide Travel Service to book \n     commercial flights for the Office. This aspect of the plan \n     was discussed with all interested parties, and all concurred \n     with knowledge that World Wide had been the campaign's travel \n     agent. This made the most sense due to the fact that we could \n     not have publicly solicited bids in light of confidentiality \n     concerns and when we had ongoing business needs that had to \n     be taken care of immediately following the terminations.\n       As for my longtime acquaintance with Betta Carney and World \n     Wide Travel, I must point to my experience in the business \n     world. There, reliance on a firm from whom one has received \n     exceptional service is the rule.\n       As well, since the time I was a client of World Wide's and \n     since World Wide was a client of my advertising agency in the \n     1970s, I have personally and professionally used at least \n     half a dozen other travel services. So, any suggestion that \n     calling them in this case derived from that history is \n     absurd, and the media suggestions of improper favoritism were \n     likewise absurd.\n       We had recent experience with World Wide, and based on that \n     experience I knew we could rely on them for confidentiality \n     in handling and preparing to handle the Travel Office \n     business, until the business could be subject to full and \n     open competition.\n       ``None of this implies any improper conduct by World Wide, \n     which is a well-established, successful travel agency, \n     twenty-third largest in the country. World Wide executives \n     understood that they could secure White House business only \n     through an open, competitive bidding process. But the \n     impression of favoring a local supporter was impossible to \n     dispel.''\n       At this point in the sequence of events, with the current \n     plan approved by the First Lady and yourself including resort \n     to World Wide Travel, it would have unnecessarily heightened \n     confusion to recruit an unknown travel service. Again, a \n     primary source of the problem was the abruptness caused by \n     the calls for immediate action in the Travel Office and the \n     at least daily inquiries. If my plan to slowly shift as the \n     fiscal year came to a close had remained intact, a travel \n     agent would have been procured in a more transparent fashion. \n     However, since at the time of hiring World Wide it was known \n     that they had a GSA contract, hiring World Wide was not as \n     questionable or ``non-competitive'' as the Report or the \n     press would have one believe.\n       ``Bringing in Penny Sample, President of Air Advantage, to \n     handle press charters on a no-bid, volunteer basis furthered \n     the appearance that the White House was trying to help its \n     friends. Sample was the Clinton-Gore campaign's charter \n     broker and a close associate of Darnell Martens. This implies \n     no improper conduct on Sample's part, but, again, created an \n     appearance of favoritism.'' At 20.\n       Like World Wide Travel, Penny Sample was part of the short-\n     term plan for running the Travel Office after the \n     terminations. Since she was willing to volunteer her services \n     without her or her company receiving any compensation--\n     because we realized, like they did, that they would be \n     conflicted out of virtually all White House business--we \n     believed the conflicts and appearance of favoritism issue had \n     been sufficiently addressed. Again, we did not believe it to \n     be favoritism to have a former service provider for the \n     campaign volunteer to assist the White House.\n\n     ``White House Management'' (Page 21):\n       ``The White House made a number of management mistakes in \n     handling the Travel Office.''\n\n     ``Lax Procedures''\n       ``The responsibility for Thomason's influence on the Travel \n     Office incident must be attributed to White House management. \n     Thomason should have avoided continued involvement in a \n     matter in which his business partner and his friends in the \n     charter business stood to benefit and in which there was an \n     appearance of financial conflict of interest. But lax \n     procedures allowed his continued participation in the \n     process. . . . There should be better management control with \n     respect to the mission that any non-White House staff person \n     is brought in to carry out. Permitting Thomason--or any non-\n     staff person who comes in on special assignment--to work on \n     problems outside the scope of his or her assignment is not a \n     good practice.'' At 21.\n       Management and Administration had no part in bringing \n     Thomason into the White House. In fact, the responsible \n     office failed or intentionally neglected to inform Management \n     and Administration of the nature of his work. Contact with \n     this Office on the subject consisted only of the First Lady's \n     Office calling to insist on immediate access for Thomason.\n\n     ``Placing Cornelius in Travel Office.''\n       ``Given Cornelius' personal interest in running the Travel \n     Office, Watkins should not have placed her in the Office to \n     make recommendations on how the Office should be \n     structured.''\n       As stated above, Catherine was placed in the Travel Office \n     because of her experience in travel and to allow her to make \n     a meaningful and significant contribution to this \n     Administration. The original assignment was made to see if \n     she would work there permanently--if she liked that work and \n     if it likewise suited her. The report I asked her to draft \n     and provide on May 15 was in no way the driving force for her \n     assignment to the office, it was simply a way to help \n     determine her long-term suitability. She was placed in that \n     office because of her extensive experience since October 1991 \n     in coordinating travel for then-candidate Bill Clinton. She \n     was not placed in the Travel Office primarily to make \n     recommendations on its future structure.\n       ``Watkins compounded the problem where in responses to \n     Thomason's complaints, he asked Cornelius to be alert to \n     possible wrongdoing or corruption. Cornelius lacked the \n     experience or preparation for this role. Nor was she given my \n     guidance.'' At 21.\n       Catherine was not asked to investigate or document \n     wrongdoing by the Travel Office staff. I understood that she \n     lacked experience to perform such a task. Catherine was \n     merely asked to observe what transpired in the Travel \n     Office--nothing further was requested or expected. Special \n     training is not needed to keep one's eyes and ears open, to \n     observe. I never asked her to collect documents or other \n     information; she undertook this of her own volition.\n       ``If, in April, Watkins thought the allegations reported by \n     Thomason should be looked at more seriously, he should have \n     done so in a more professional manner.'' At 21.\n       The suggestion that this could be more professionally \n     handled is absurd. I noted the allegations, but thought they \n     could wait for review--and knew they would be examined--\n     during the course of the planned internal review of the \n     Travel Office. For that reason, no action was taken other \n     than to ask to Catherine to ``keep her eyes and ears open.''\n\n     ``Poor Planning.''\n       ``There was no adequate plan in place to manage the Travel \n     Office in the aftermath of the dismissals.'' At 21.\n       Harry Thomason indicated that he could put a more efficient \n     structure in place in an hour's time to handle all the tasks \n     of the Travel Office. While I believed that my original plan \n     to carefully review the Travel Office would best serve the \n     White House, when I spoke with the First Lady on Friday \n     night, May 14, she cited Thomason's plan as support for the \n     need for immediate action. That action involved utilizing \n     World Wide Travel and Penny Sample in the short term. As \n     well, in my memo to you on May 17 explaining my intent to \n     terminate the Travel Office employees the next day, the \n     intention to use World Wide Travel was outlined. You approved \n     this action based on this memo prior to the actual \n     terminations.\n       ``For example, no one in the decision-making chain spoke to \n     the White House press and press advance staff members who \n     worked closely with the Travel Office employees, knew the \n     employees there, understood the services they provided and \n     the degree to which they were relied upon by members of the \n     travelling press and other considerations. None was contacted \n     by Watkins.'' At 22.\n       In light of the need for absolute confidentiality, it would \n     have been foolhardy to consult the press or press advance \n     staffs. From the staff review and Catherine Cornelius' \n     experience (this is the primary area where her factual \n     expertise was relied upon), we in fact did know the services \n     that the Travel Office staff performed. Catherine Cornelius \n     and Harry Thomason regularly and repeatedly reassured me that \n     the press charter function\n\n[[Page S10305]]\n\n     could easily be assumed with the assistance of Penny Sample. \n     ``Thus, plans to replace these aspects of the Travel Office \n     functions were in place prior to the dismissals. Then, when \n     the need for immediate replacement became evident, I \n     committed to provide whatever manpower was needed to perform \n     the services the Travel Office staff had performed.\n       Immediately following the dismissals, meetings were held \n     with the press and press advance staff to make all necessary \n     arrangements for upcoming trips. These discussions came after \n     the fact, but were accompanied with a commitment from my \n     office for all necessary resources to perform the job.\n       ``The absence of a plan prompted the last-minute use of \n     World Wide Travel and Penny Sample of Air Advantage, which \n     fueled the charges of favoritism already discussed.'' At 22.\n       As explained above, the plan was to use World Wide Travel \n     and Penny Sample; there was no absence of a plan. Because of \n     the need for confidentiality and the need for quick action, \n     reliance on those with whom we had experience seemed the only \n     rational decision. Having performed superbly in the campaign \n     and in light of our need for immediate travel agent support--\n     due to the pressure for immediate action from several \n     quarters--we decided the plan would include short-term \n     reliance on World Wide Travel.\n       I would have much preferred to have my staff carefully \n     review the Travel Office and make a detailed business plan \n     for the new fiscal year. This proved impossible, though, when \n     the pressure for action from the First Lady and you became \n     irresistible. This demand for immediate action forced me to \n     accept hastily formulated plans for hasty, inadvisable \n     action.\n\n     ``Overview.''\n       ``The management problems in the handling of the Travel \n     Office extended beyond the White House Office of Management \n     and Administration. The Chief of Staff and the White House \n     Counsel's Office had the opportunity to contain the momentum \n     of the incident, but did not take adequate advantage of this \n     opportunity.'' At 22.\n       ``The process should have been handled in a more careful, \n     deliberate fashion. Before any decision was made, the Travel \n     Office employees should have been interviewed and other White \n     House staff who understood the operations of the Travel \n     Office should have been consulted. If dismissals were deemed \n     appropriate, a new structure should have been designed and \n     readied for implementation before any action was taken. \n     Throughout, the process should have treated the Travel Office \n     employees with sensitivity and decency.'' At 22.\n       As stated above, I too would have much preferred to have my \n     staff carefully review the Travel Office and formulate a \n     detailed business plan for the new fiscal year. This proved \n     impossible, though, when pressure for action became \n     irresistible. It forced me to accept hastily formulated plans \n     for hasty, inadvisable action.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       I think all this makes clear that the Travel Office \n     incident was driven by pressures for action originating \n     outside my Office. If I thought I could have resisted those \n     pressures, undertaken more considered action, and remained in \n     the White House, I certainly would have done so. But after \n     the Secret Service incident, it was made clear that I must \n     more forcefully and immediately follow the direction of the \n     First Family. I was convinced that failure to take immediate \n     action in this case would have been directly contrary to the \n     wishes of the First Lady, something that would not have been \n     tolerated in light of the Secret Service incident earlier in \n     the year.\n       For this reason, I was forced to undertake the Travel \n     Office reorganization without a business plan firmly in \n     hand--something I had never before done in years as a \n     management consultant, where such plans were my business.\n       All failings outlined in the Podesta Management Review were \n     either mistaken and groundless criticism, or were based on \n     actions dictated by the need for instant action. This \n     reorganization required more careful review, but in this case \n     that possibility was foreclosed. Delaying action was beyond \n     my control.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I am absolutely astounded that people would come here and \ntry to try Billy Dale again.\n  I am now going to quote Mr. Watkins:\n\n       On Monday morning, you came to my office and met with me \n     and Patsy Thomasson. At that meeting, you explained this was \n     on the First Lady's radar screen. The message you conveyed to \n     me was clear: immediate action must be taken. I explained to \n     you that I had decided to terminate the Travel Office \n     employees, and you expressed relief that we were finally \n     going to take action (to resolve the situation in conformity \n     with the First Lady's wishes.) We both knew that there would \n     be hell to pay if after our failure in the Secret Service \n     situation earlier, we failed to take swift and decisive \n     action in conformity with the First Lady's wishes. You then \n     approved the decision to terminate the Travel Office staff, \n     and I indicated I would send you a memorandum outlining the \n     decision and plan, which I did.\n\n  This is a memorandum, which is marked privileged and confidential, is \nfrom David Watkins in response to the internal White House Travel \nOffice Management Review. The White House even admits they were doing \nthe wrong things.\n  The distinguished Senator from Michigan claims this case should be \nreferred to the Claims Court because the Senate has not done a report \non the issue. I disagree: the facts in this case are not in dispute. \nThe reason you have a Claims Court proceedings is because you have \ndisputed facts. In this case, the facts are not in dispute.\n  And these facts have been well-documented: no less than four reports \nhave been done on this issue, as well as 2 years' worth of \ninvestigations and hearings, and a debate on the floor of this chamber \nthat was filibustered when the bill was filibustered as a freestanding \nbill. Two years' worth of investigations and hearings on the House side \nhas established the facts. The only reason to refer this case to the \nclaims court would be if the facts were in question. The facts, in this \ninstance, are not even in dispute.\n  I might also add that the other side has referred to a document that, \nfor all intents and purposes, is a privileged document that should \nnever have been made public. It is the prosecutor's memorandum.\n  Somebody has violated the most sacred canons of ethics in giving a \nprosecutor's memorandum, which tells the Government's side of the case. \nMy colleagues have read from it like it is fact, when, in fact, it \nisn't fact. They refer to two documents--one is the ``prosecution \nmemorandum,'' and the other is a ``plea agreement.''\n  Now, where did they get those documents? Those documents are not \npermitted to be given to anybody. Somebody at Justice or the \nprosecutor's office has violated the most sacred canons of ethics, \ngiving a memorandum of one side of the case, which may or may not be \nthe true facts with regard to the other side. In this case, they are \nnot the true facts. They are relying on confidential documents that \nwere given improperly--through the Department of Justice, I presume. \nThe Administration ought to know better than that.\n  Those documents are protected under the Department of Justice' own \nregulations. Once again, this is a politicization of the Justice \nDepartment, or the prosecutor's office, one or the other. There is no \nother way it could be. If the Justice Department has allowed White \nHouse people to get these documents, which apparently has been the case \nhere, so they could leak them to Members of Congress to smear again \nBilly Dale and his colleagues, then that is further evidence of \nhypocrisy.\n  One thing I found interesting, is the quote the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada has on the chart behind him. Notably, it is only part of \nthe quote. Let me read the whole quote. I am reading from a response \nfrom Billy Dale's lawyer to an op ed written by Robert Bennett to the \nWall Street Journal. In the op ed, Mr. Bennett suggested that Billy \nDale had entered a plea agreement of guilty, which he never did. Mr. \nBennett was incorrect in his suggestion that the letter of the counsel \nfor Billy Dale of November 30, 1994, constituted a willingness by Billy \nDale to admit the charge of embezzlement of which he was acquitted. The \nattorney for Billy Dale criticized Mr. Bennett because he said that Mr. \nBennett accurately quoted the first sentence of that letter which \nstated that Mr. Dale was prepared to enter a plea of guilty to one \nsingle count under 18 U.S.C. 654. However, Mr. Bennett, as well as my \nfriend from Nevada on his chart, chose to omit the sentence that \nimmediately follows. That sentence says that Mr. Dale would not admit \nto any intent to defraud or to permanently deprive anyone of the money \nthat was represented by the checks he deposited in his personal \naccount.\n  This admission is imperative in order for the Government to have an \nactual plea. In order to take a plea, Mr. Dale would have had to have \nadmitted or pled guilty to defrauding the Government. Mr. Dale refused \nto do that. Now, the quote illustrated by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada doesn't give the full facts. Instead of giving the full \nfacts, the distinguished Senator from Nevada is attempting to retry Mr. \nDale's case on the Senate floor. I think that it is wholly improper, \nespecially when a jury tried it\n\n[[Page S10306]]\n\nand Mr. Dale was acquitted within 2 hours.\n  I will tell you one more thing. I am going to refer the matter of the \nleaking of confidential documents by the Administration to the Office \nof Professional Responsibility, because the Justice Department has \nacted irresponsibly, or the prosecutor's office has acted \nirresponsibly.\n  I oppose the Reid amendment that would strike the provision to \nreimburse Billy Dale and to refer his case to the claims court. As I \nreiterated time and again, reimbursement of these legal fees simply \nremedies the grave miscarriage of justice that resulted in the \ninvestigation of Billy Dale and the other former White House Travel \nOffice employees, which they are willing to reimburse. They are \nunwilling to admit, as really gentlemen ought to, that they have \nsmeared this man, that the White House deliberately did it, that they \nwere acting pursuant to Mrs. Clinton's demands, according to Watkins--\nthat was a memorandum written at or near the time of the demands--that \nthe White House acted out of greed, and that they put Mr. Dale through \na half-million dollars of legal fees, not to speak of the loss of \nreputation, the bad publicity, the tremendous strain of going through a \ncriminal trial when they knew he did nothing wrong. Then, my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle come here to the floor of the Senate and \nclaim that Mr. Dale entered a plea of guilty.\n\n  Let me tell you something. I have been around courtrooms for many \nyears of my life. I know a number of people who weren't guilty that \nwould enter a plea to some really minor, lesser count so that they \nwould not get bled to death with attorney's fees, court costs, ulcers, \nbad health, ruination of the family, and 101 other things that happen. \nAnybody that doesn't understand that has never been in a court of law, \nor at least doesn't understand, or just plain isn't telling the truth.\n  For many months, the Congress and the Nation believed President \nClinton had supported Mr. Dale's reimbursement. In fact, I publicly \ncommended the President on numerous occasions for his equitable \ndecision to sign the bill if we would pass it up here. Unfortunately, I \nunderstand the President Clinton has chosen to retract his support for \nsuch reimbursement. That is why I call this a hypocritical White House. \nUnder these facts and circumstances, knowing what has transpired, and \nknowing the hell they put these people through, not to be willing to \nreimburse them is just unbelievable.\n  I am very disappointed that the President has changed his position on \nthis issue, because passing this legislation is the right thing to do. \nAfter being fired, the Travel Office employees were forced to seek \nlegal representation to defend themselves against a Federal criminal \ninvestigation in which they had become targets. These public servants \nbecame the victims of unjust and inappropriate abuse of Federal law \nenforcement by some White House officials. I continue to be outraged by \nthe arrogance of power demonstrated by this Administration in this \nmatter.\n  The way these individuals were fired and investigated was \nunconscionable. Over the course of the last several months, I have \nworked in a bipartisan effort to get a freestanding Billy Dale \nreimbursement measure passed. I wanted to pass this measure months ago \nso that President Clinton could put this ordeal behind him. He said he \nwould sign it. But the Senate has continued to be met with resistance \nby some Members on the other side of the aisle. First, my colleagues \nwanted to offer a GATT amendment to the proposal and then they wanted \nto offer a minimum wage amendment. Then we worked together to advance \ntheir objectives on both the GATT and minimum wage issues. We dealt \nwith both of them in the Senate.\n  Having worked in a bipartisan manner, I thought the Senate would be \nable to pass a freestanding bill without any additional delays. The \nlast time we tried to bring up this bill, the distinguished minority \nleader objected, stating Mr. Dale had a fee arrangement with his \nlawyers that would obligate him to pay only part of his bill, which, \nfor the record, is not true. As well, we were told that some Members on \nthe other side of the aisle had additional amendments--amendments which \nto this day we have not seen.\n  Accordingly, Senator Shelby, the chairman of the Treasury-Postal \nSubcommittee took this initiative by incorporating the Dale measure in \nthis appropriations bill. Yet, once again, this is an effort to thwart \na proposal to restore Dale and his colleagues to the position they were \nin before being attacked by ``friends'' of President and Mrs. Clinton \nand their allies on the White House staff.\n  Mr. Dale and his Travel Office colleagues served at the pleasure of \nthe President. Some of the employees served as many as eight different \nPresidents, both Republican and Democrat. They provided years of \nfaithful service. For this service, they were fired based upon trumped \nup charges by political ``friends'' of the President and the First \nLady. These loyal public servants were then investigated by the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Internal \nRevenue Service. The FBI was intimidated to do this by none other than \nMr. Kennedy at the White House, who no longer is there--and for good \nreason. Mr. Dale was subsequently indicted and prosecuted for \nembezzlement. On December 1, 1995, after 2\\1/2\\ years of being \ninvestigated by Federal agencies, as well as incurring tremendous legal \nexpenses, Mr. Dale was found not guilty of all charges after only 2 \nhours of jury deliberation.\n  You would think our colleagues on the other side would give \ncredibility to that and not try to retry him here in the U.S. Senate. \nIt is unseemly. This questionable use of the Federal criminal justice \nsystem created a situation where Mr. Dale had to spend some $500,000 on \nattorney's fees and even consider accepting a plea agreement, when he \nhad committed no crime, but with the express provision that he would \nnot plead guilty to embezzlement. To make matters worse, the \nadministration went so far as to leak, in violation of its own \nregulations, a confidential letter in which Mr. Dale's attorney \ndiscussed the notion of a plea agreement--something that goes on in \nalmost every criminal case where there is a chance of resolving a case \nby settlement.\n  That is what was involved here in that matter.\n  Mr. Dale's attorney, on behalf of his client, offered to end the case \nbut expressly stated that Mr. Dale would not admit that he converted or \nstole funds, the necessary elements for an embezzlement prosecution. \nFaced with the ruinous legal costs, Mr. Dale's lawyers explored the \npossibility of a settlement, but not as an admission of guilt. The \nDepartment of Justice's leaking of the plea agreement discussion was \nirresponsible. But, this administration does have a troubling record of \nfailing to respect the privacy of individuals. The President himself \nunfairly repeated information derived from this unconscionable leak, \nsuggesting that the confidential discussions of a possible plea bargain \nwith the prosecutors in the face of his own administration's outrageous \nabuse of the FBI should somehow count against Mr. Dale.\n  Mr. Dale and his colleagues recently found themselves in the news \nagain after trying to put the circumstances of this behind them. It was \ndiscovered that Mr. Dale's FBI background file was requested by the \nWhite House Personnel Security Office 7 months after he was fired. It \nnow appears that the Travel Office Seven were not only fired \nunjustifiably but in some cases their personal background file \nsummaries were inappropriately requested and possibly reviewed. Some \nthink the whole 900 files that were improperly requested--and possibly \nreviewed; many of which were reviewed--was as a result of trying to get \nBilly Dale.\n  So the invasion of privacy that these individuals have had to endure \ncontinued, and to have to put up with these arguments here today, again \nI say it is unseemly.\n  What makes President Clinton's opposition to the reimbursement to Mr. \nDale all the more astonishing is the fact that no less than 23 White \nHouse employees have requested Federal reimbursement of counsel fees in \nconnection with congressional or independent counsel investigations \ninto the White House Travel Office, or Whitewater. Among those who have \nrequested reimbursement are Thomas (Mack) McLarty, George \nStephanopoulos, John Podesta, Ricki Seidman, and Bruce\n\n[[Page S10307]]\n\nLindsay --just to mention a few of the 23.\n  A number of these requests have been approved by the Clinton Justice \nDepartment. For instance, Mr. Podesta. I am glad they did in the case \nof Mr. Podesta. And the Department has said, ``We are continuing to \nprocess requests and anticipate acting on some of them in the near \nfuture.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter to me from the Department of \nJustice dated September 6, and a memorandum from the Department of \nJustice to Lisa Kaufman, Senior Investigative Counsel of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, dated September 5, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 6, 1996.\n     Hon.  Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This supplements our prior informal \n     responses to your letter, dated August 21, 1996, which \n     requested documents and information about recent assertions \n     of executive privilege and requests for reimbursement of \n     private counsel fees arising from certain congressional and \n     Independent Counsel inquiries. We have already provided on an \n     expedited basis the principal documents that are responsive \n     to the first two items of your request. This letter provides \n     further information regarding those two items, as well as \n     information and documents regarding the remaining items. We \n     hope that what we are providing today will be sufficient to \n     complete our response to your request, but we would be \n     pleased to work with Committee staff if you desire additional \n     documents or information.\n       The first two items of your request seek documents and \n     information concerning the President's two assertions of \n     executive privilege in May 1996 in response to a subpoena \n     issued to the White House by the House Committee on \n     Government Reform and Oversight. This past Friday, August 30, \n     1996, we provided your staff copies of the submissions to the \n     House Committee on May 9 and May 30, 1996, informing the \n     Committee of the President's privilege assertions. The \n     submissions include the Attorney General's two letter \n     opinions to the President, dated May 8 and May 23, 1996, \n     setting forth the legal basis for the assertions. These \n     documents should provide you with a good understanding of the \n     purpose and scope of the privilege assertions.\n       The first of the President's assertions of executive \n     privilege, on May 8th, was a protective assertion of \n     privilege over the entire group of confidential White House \n     Counsel's Office documents being sought by House Committee at \n     that time, to be effective only for such time as was \n     necessary for the review and consultations required to \n     determine whether to make a conclusive claim of privilege for \n     particular documents. The Attorney General's May 8th letter \n     to the President summarizes the circumstances necessitating \n     the protective assertion:\n       ``The subpoena covers a large volume of confidential White \n     House Counsel's Office documents. The Counsel to the \n     President notified the Chairman of the Committee today that \n     he was invoking the procedures of the standing directive \n     governing consideration of whether to assert executive \n     privilege, President Reagan's memorandum of November 4, 1982, \n     and that he specifically requested, pursuant to paragraph 5 \n     of that directive, that the Committee hold its subpoena in \n     abeyance pending a final Presidential decision on the matter. \n     This request was necessitated by the deadline imposed by the \n     Chairman, the volume of documents that must be specifically \n     and individually reviewed for possible assertion of \n     privilege, and the need under the directive to consult with \n     the Attorney General, on the basis of that review, before \n     presenting the matter to the President for a final \n     determination. The Chairman rejected the request and \n     indicated that he intends to proceed with a Committee vote on \n     the contempt citation tomorrow.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ The background for the protective assertion of privilege \n     is described in letters from the White House to the House \n     Committee. The subpoena issued by the House Committee in \n     January of this year sought a large number of confidential \n     documents held by the White House Counsel's Office. These \n     included confidential deliberative, attorney-client and \n     attorney work-product materials prepared by the Counsel's \n     Office in response to ongoing congressional and independent \n     counsel investigations, as well as other confidential \n     materials such as the personnel files of individual \n     employees. In February, the Counsel to the President met with \n     the Committee Chairman seeking to negotiate an accommodation. \n     We understand that the Counsel to the President offered the \n     Committee at that time the opportunity to review all of the \n     personnel files (which included Mr. Dale's file), but raised \n     objections to making available certain deliberative, \n     attorney-client and attorney work product materials and made \n     an accommodation proposal with respect to these materials. \n     The Committee Chairman agreed to consider the proposals and \n     respond, but no response was received until May 2nd, when the \n     Committee indicated it would vote on May 9th on whether to \n     hold the Counsel to the President in contempt of Congress, \n     unless all withheld documents were turned over beforehand. \n     This one-week notice provided the White House Counsel's \n     Office insufficient time to review all of the materials and \n     consider, together with the Attorney General, whether \n     assertion of executive privilege with respect to particular \n     documents was warranted.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Attorney General's letter went on to advise the \n     President as follows:\n       ``Based on these circumstances, it is my legal judgment \n     that executive privilege may properly be asserted with \n     respect to the entire set of White House Counsel's Office \n     documents currently being withheld from the Committee, \n     pending a final Presidential decision on the matter. This \n     would be a protective assertion of executive privilege \n     designed to ensure your ability to make a final decision, \n     after consultation with the Attorney General, as to which \n     specific documents are deserving of a conclusive claim of \n     executive privilege.''\n       The Counsel to the President's letter to the Committee \n     Chairman the following day, May 9th, informed the Committee \n     of the President's assertion of executive privilege:\n       ``Consistent with [the Attorney General's letter opinion], \n     the President has directed me to inform you that he invokes \n     executive privilege, as a protective matter, with respect to \n     all documents in the categories identified [previously in the \n     letter], until such time as the President, after consultation \n     with the Attorney General, makes a final decision as to which \n     specific documents require a claim of executive privilege. * \n     * *\n       ``I hereby request that your Committee hold its request in \n     abeyance until such time as a Presidential decision as to \n     executive privilege has been made with respect to specific, \n     individual documents.''\n       The review and consultation process implemented after the \n     May 8th protective assertion of privilege was as follows: The \n     White House Counsel's Office conducted a specific review of \n     all withheld documents and made an initial determination as \n     to which particular documents should be considered further \n     for inclusion in a conclusive assertion of privilege. Then, \n     only the documents that the Counsel's Office had determined \n     as a preliminary matter should be considered further for the \n     conclusive assertion were presented to the Department for the \n     required consultation with the Attorney General.\n       After this process was completed, the President made a \n     conclusive assertion of privilege with respect to particular \n     documents. The Counsel to the President's May 30th letter \n     informed the Committee of the President's assertion of \n     privilege with respect to the specified documents and also \n     produced to the Committee the remaining documents that had \n     been subject to the May 8th protective assertion of \n     privilege. The Counsel's May 30th letter also enclosed the \n     Attorney General's May 23rd letter to the President setting \n     forth her opinion that executive privilege could properly \n     be asserted with respect to the specified documents. \n     Although the entirety of the letters from the Counsel to \n     the President and the Attorney General should be reviewed \n     in order to understand the rationale for the conclusive \n     assertion of privilege, the essential separation of powers \n     and confidentiality concerns underlying the claim are \n     summarized in the following passage from the Attorney \n     General's letter to the President:\n       ``The Counsel to the President is appropriately concerned \n     that the Committee's demand raises significant separation of \n     powers concerns and that compliance with it beyond the \n     accommodations already reached with the Committee would \n     compromise the ability of his Office to advise and assist the \n     President in connection with the pending Committee and \n     Independent Counsel investigations. It would also have a \n     chilling effect on the Office's discharge of its \n     responsibilities in future congressional investigations, and \n     in all of its other areas of responsibility. I agree that the \n     ability of the White House Counsel's Office to serve the \n     President would be significantly impaired if the \n     confidentiality of its communications and work-product is not \n     protected, especially where the confidential documents are \n     prepared in order to assist the President and his staff in \n     responding to an investigation by the entity seeking the \n     documents. Impairing the ability of the Counsel's Office to \n     perform its important functions for the President would in \n     turn impair the ability of you and future Presidents to carry \n     out your constitutional responsibilities.\n       ``The Supreme Court has expressly (and unanimously) \n     recognized that the Constitution gives the President the \n     power to protect the confidentiality of White House \n     communications. This power is rooted in the ``need for \n     protection of communications between high Government \n     officials and those who advise and assist them in the \n     performance of their manifold duties.'' United States v. \n     Nixon. 418 U.S. 683, 705 (1974). ``A President and those who \n     assist him must be free to explore alternatives in the \n     process of shaping policies and making decisions and to do so \n     in a way many would be unwilling to express except \n     privately.'' Id. at 708. Executive privilege applies to these \n     White House Counsel's Office documents because of their \n     deliberative nature, and because they fall within the scope \n     of the attorney-client privilege and the work-product \n     doctrine, see Upjohn Co. V. United States, 449 U.S. 383 \n     (1981); Hichman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 (1947). Both the \n     attorney-client privileges and the work-product doctrine \n     are subsumed under executive privilege.'' See Response to \n     Congressional Requests for Information Regarding Decisions \n     made Under the Independent Counsel Act, 10 Op. O.L.C. 68, \n     78 & n.17 (1986); Confidentiality of the Attorney \n     General's Communications in Counseling the President, 6 \n     Op. O.L.C. 481, 490 & n.17, 494 & n.24 (1982).\n\n[[Page S10308]]\n\n       As for the particular focus of your inquiry, the White \n     House Counsel's Office determined during the initial stage of \n     the review process following the protective assertion of \n     privilege to exclude from further consideration for the \n     conclusive assertion of privilege the set of personnel \n     records it had earlier called to the Committee's attention \n     (see note 1, supra). It is our understanding that Mr. Dale's \n     personnel file, including FBI-related material, was among \n     these personnel records. Because of this determination by the \n     Counsel's Office, the personnel records were not presented to \n     the Department for review and they were among the documents \n     the White House produced to the House Committee on May 30th. \n     Thus, there was never an occasion for the Department to be \n     consulted concerning the possibility of an assertion of \n     executive privilege with respect to FBI-related material \n     contained in Mr. Dale's personnel file. Accordingly, we have \n     no documents responsive to your request for ``documents \n     discussing or analyzing whether executive privilege could be \n     asserted with respect to'' such material.\n       On Thursday, September 5, 1996, we provided information and \n     three documents responsive to the third and fourth items of \n     your request. A copy of our memorandum to Committee staff is \n     enclosed along with an additional copy of the accompanying \n     documents. In summary, the following FBI employees have \n     requested representation with regard to the White House \n     Travel Office matter: James Bourke, David Bowie, John \n     Collingwood, Patrick Foran, Richard Hildreth, Barbara King, \n     Peggy Larson, Sharon MacGargle, Patrick Maloy, Larry Potts, \n     Thomas Renaghan, Therese Rodrique, Gregory Schwarz, Dennis \n     Sculimbrene, Cecilia Woods. The requests of Bourke, Bowie, \n     Collingwood, Foran, Larson, MacGargle, Potts, Renaghan, \n     Schwarz, Sculimbrene, and Woods have been approved. The \n     remaining requests have been held in abeyance because we have \n     been advised that no congressional depositions are \n     anticipated at this time. Enclosed are FBI records regarding \n     these requests.\n       In addition, Sherry Carner and Janice George initially \n     requested reimbursement for private counsel fees; however, \n     the House Committee ultimately allowed them to be accompanied \n     by FBI counsel, so their requests were withdrawn.\n       We have completed consultation with the White House and the \n     Independent Counsel in accordance with established \n     executive branch consultation practices and, hence, we are \n     providing the following additional information regarding \n     the fourth and fifth items of your request: The following \n     White House employees requested reimbursement of counsel \n     fees in connection with congressional or Independent \n     Counsel investigations about the White House Travel Office \n     or Whitewater: Mary Beck, Lisa Caputo, Nelson Cunningham, \n     Jonathan Denbo, Nell Doering, Charles Easley, Dwight \n     Holden, Carolyn Huber, Ed Hughes, Bruce Lindsay, Kelli \n     McClure, Thomas McLarty, Douglas Matties, DeeDee Myers, \n     Beth Nolan, Bruce Overton, John Podesta, Ashley Raines, \n     Ricki Seidman, Clifford Sloan, George Stephanopoulos, \n     Kathleen Whalen, Jonathan Yarowsky. The requests of Beck, \n     Holden, Podesta, and Yarowsky have been approved. The \n     remainder are pending, but we are continuing to process \n     requests and anticipate acting on some of them in the near \n     future.\n       With regard to the fifth item of your request, the \n     Department of Justice has paid no fees to date in connection \n     with these matters. The Department has agreed to pay private \n     counsel fees as indicated in our September 5th memorandum to \n     Committee staff in accordance with the enclosed sample \n     retention agreement.\n       I hope that this information is helpful. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact me if we can provide additional \n     assistance regarding this or any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Andrew Fois,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 5, 1996.\n     To: Lisa Kaufman, Senior Investigative Counsel, Senate \n       Judiciary Committee; Karen Robb, Minority Staff Director, \n       Senate Judiciary Committee.\n     From: Faith Burton, Special Counsel, Office of Legislative \n       Affairs.\n     Re: Chairman Hatch's Letter of August 21, 1996.\n       This is to provide information on an expedited basis in \n     response to Lisa's request in connection with Chairman \n     Hatch's August 21, 1996, letter regarding requests for \n     government reimbursement of private counsel. This \n     information, and three enclosed documents, respond to the \n     third and fourth items of the letter.\n       The following FBI employees have requested representation \n     with regard to congressional inquiries regarding the White \n     House Travel Office matter: James Bourke, David Bowie, John \n     Collingwood, Patrick Foran, Richard Hildreth, Barbara King, \n     Peggy Larson, Sharon MacGargle, Patrick Maloy, Larry Potts, \n     Thomas Renaghan, Therese Rodrique, Gregory Schwarz, Dennis \n     Sculimbrene, Cecilia Woods. The requests of Bourke, Bowie, \n     Collingwood, Foran, Larson, MacGargle, Potts, Renaghan, \n     Schwarz, Sculimbrene, and Woods have been approved.

We are working on a more complete \n     response to the Chairman's letter and will get it to you as \n     soon as possible.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Conditions of Private Counsel Retention by the Department of Justice \n       for Representation of Current and Former Federal Employees\n\n       The following items and conditions shall apply to the \n     retention of a private attorney's legal services by the \n     Department of Justice to represent current and former federal \n     employees in civil, congressional, or criminal proceedings.\n\n\n                          nature of retention\n\n       Subject to the availability of funds, the Department of \n     Justice agrees to pay an attorney, or other members of his or \n     her firm, for those legal services reasonably necessitated by \n     the defense of a current or former federal employee \n     (hereinafter ``client'') in civil, congressional, or criminal \n     proceedings.\n       The Department will not honor bills for services that the \n     Department determines were not directly related to the \n     defense of issues presented by such matters. Examples of \n     services for which the Department will not pay include, but \n     are not limited to:\n       a. administrative claims, civil actions, or any \n     indemnification proceedings against the United States on \n     behalf of the client for any adverse monetary judgment, \n     whether before or after the entry of such an adverse \n     judgment;\n       b. cross claims against do-defendants or counterclaims \n     against plaintiff, unless the Department of Justice \n     determines in advance of its filing that a counterclaim is \n     essential to the defense of the employee and the employee \n     agrees that any recovery on the counterclaim will be paid to \n     the United States as a reimbursement for the costs of the \n     defense of the employee;\n       c. requests made under the Freedom of Information or \n     Privacy Acts or civil suits against the United States under \n     the Freedom of Information or Privacy Acts, or on any other \n     basis, to secure documents for use in the defense of the \n     client;\n       d. any legal work that advances only the individual \n     interests of the employee; and\n       e. certain administrative expenses noted in paragraph \n     number 4 below.\n       The retained attorney is free to undertake such actions as \n     set for the above, but must negotiate any charges with the \n     client and may not pass those charges on to the Department of \n     Justice.\n       The above list is not exhaustive. The Department of Justice \n     will not reimburse services deemed reasonably necessary to \n     the defense of an employee if they are not in the interests \n     of the United States.\n       To avoid confusion over whether the retained attorney may \n     bill the Department for a particular service under this \n     retention agreement, the retained attorney should consult the \n     Justice Department attorney assigned to the case, mentioned \n     in the accompanying letter before undertaking the service.\n\n\n                             billable hours\n\n       The Department of Justice agrees to pay the retained \n     attorney for any amount of time not exceeding 120 billable \n     hours per month for services performed in the defense of the \n     client. The retained attorney may use the services of any \n     number of attorneys, paralegals, or legal assistants in his \n     or her firm so long as the aggregate number of billable hours \n     in any given month does not exceed 120 hours. The client is \n     free, however, to retain the attorney, or members of the \n     firm, to perform work in excess of 120 hours per month so \n     long as the firm does not bill the excess charge to the \n     Department of Justice.\n       The Department will consider paying for services in excess \n     of 120 hours in any given month if the press of litigation \n     (e.g., trial preparation) clearly necessitates the \n     expenditure of more time. The retained attorney must make \n     requests for additional compensation to the Department in \n     writing in advance of such expenditures.\n\n\n                               legal fees\n\n       The Department agrees to pay the retained attorney up to \n     $99.00 per lawyer hour, plus expenses as described in \n     paragraph 4 below. The charge for any services should not \n     exceed the retained attorney's ordinary and customary charge \n     for such services. This fee is based on the consideration \n     that the retained attorney has been practicing law in excess \n     of 5 years.\n       In the event the retained attorney uses the services of \n     other lawyers in his or her firm, or the services of a \n     paralegal or legal assistant, the Department agrees to pay \n     the following fees.\n       a. Lawyer with more than 5 years practicing experience: \n     $99.00 per lawyer hour\n       b. Lawyer with 3--5 years of practicing experience: $79.00 \n     per lawyer hour\n       c. Lawyer with 0--3 years of practicing experience: $66.00 \n     per lawyer hour\n       d. Paralegal or legal assistant: $39.00 per hour.\n       The Department of Justice periodically reviews the hourly \n     rates paid to attorneys retained to defend federal employees \n     under 28 C.F.R. Sec. 50.16. If, during the period of this \n     agreement, the Department revises the\n\n[[Page S10309]]\n\n     schedule of hourly rates payable in such cases, the \n     Department will pay revised rates for services rendered after \n     the effective date of the revision in rates.\n\n\n                                Expenses\n\n       While the Department will pay normal overhead expenses \n     actually incurred (e.g., postage, telephone tolls, travel, \n     transcripts), the retained attorney must itemize these \n     charges. The Department will not accept for payment a bill \n     that shows only a standard fee or percentage as ``overhead''. \n     The retained attorney must describe, justify, and clear IN \n     ADVANCE unusual or exceptionally high expenses.\n       In addition, the retained attorney must describe, justify, \n     and clear in advance any consultations with or retention of \n     experts or expert witnesses.\n       The retained attorney must secure advance approval to use \n     computer-assisted research that involves charges in excess of \n     $250.00 in a given month.\n       The retained attorney must separately justify and obtain \n     advance approval for services such as printing, graphic \n     reproduction, or preparation of demonstrative evidence or \n     explanatory exhibits.\n       The retained attorney must itemize and justify in-house \n     copying costs exceeding $125.00 in a given month. The \n     Department will pay the per page copying cost at the \n     government rate set forth at 28 C.F.R. Sec. 16.10(2).\n       The retained attorney must itemize and justify facsimile \n     transmission costs exceeding $150.00 in a given month.\n       The Department will pay expenses such as secretarial \n     overtime or the purchase of books only in exceptional \n     situations. The retained attorney must obtain advance \n     approval for such expenditures.\n       Travel expenses may not include first class service or \n     deluxe accommodations. The retained attorney may not bill \n     time spent in travel unless it is used to accomplish tasks \n     related to the litigation. The retained attorney must \n     specifically identify such tasks.\n       The Department will not pay for meal charges not related to \n     out-of-town travel.\n       The Department will not provide compensation for client or \n     other entertainment.\n       The Department will not pay expenses for meals incidental \n     to overtime.\n       The Department will not pay for expenses that can normally \n     be absorbed as clerical overhead, such as time spent in \n     preparing legal bills and filing papers with the Court. The \n     retained attorney must separately list and justify messenger \n     services.\n       The retained attorney must enumerate the expenses incurred \n     for hiring local counsel by rate, hour, and kind of service. \n     These hours must fall within the 120-hour monthly maximum. \n     The hourly rates paid to local counsel may not exceed the \n     rates listed in paragraph 3 above.\n\n\n                            format of bills\n\n       The retained attorney must submit bills on a monthly basis, \n     stating the date of each service performed; the name of the \n     attorney or legal assistant performing the service; a \n     description of the service; and the time in tenths, sixths, \n     or quarters of an hour, required to perform the service. \n     Because of the limitation on reimbursable hours, a bill must \n     include all services rendered in a given month. The \n     Department will not consider subsequent bills for services \n     rendered in a month for which it has already received a bill.\n       In describing the nature of the service performed, the \n     itemization must reflect each litigation activity for which \n     reimbursement is claimed.\n       The retained attorney must attach copies of airline \n     tickets, hotel bills, and bills for deposition and hearing \n     transcripts to the billing statement.\n       The retained attorney must itemize local mileage costs \n     (e.g., purpose of travel and number of miles). The Department \n     will pay the standard government cost per mile rate for the \n     use of privately owned vehicles.\n       Before the Department of Justice will pay a bill, \n     Department attorneys with substantive knowledge of the \n     litigation will review it. If the retained attorney believes \n     that the detail of the legal bill would compromise litigation \n     tactics if disclosed to Department attorneys assigned to the \n     case, the retained attorney should list those particular \n     billing items on a separate sheet of paper with an indication \n     of the specific concern. Department attorneys uninvolved with \n     this case will independently review the separated, sensitive \n     portion of the bill solely to determine if payment is \n     appropriate under applicable standards.\n       The individuals reviewing the bills will not discuss these \n     items with the Department of Justice attorneys having \n     responsibility for the case, nor will those responsible \n     attorneys review the items in question.\n       After Department attorneys complete the review of a bill, \n     the Department will notify the billing counsel if the \n     Department deems any item or items nonreimbursable or if any \n     item or items require further explanation. When further \n     information or explanation is needed, the Department will \n     hold the entire bill until the retained attorney responds. \n     Only after the Department receives and reviews the response \n     will the Department certify the bill in whole or in part for \n     payment. For that reason, the retained attorney must respond \n     promptly.\n       Should the Department determine that any items are not \n     reimbursable under this agreement, the billing counsel may \n     request further review of the Department's determination. The \n     retained attorney shall make such a written request to the \n     appropriate Branch director at the address indicated in the \n     forwarding letter. The billing counsel must submit such \n     requests for further review within 30 days, unless additional \n     time is specifically requested and approved. Thereafter, the \n     Department will not reconsider its determination.\n\n\n                            billing address\n\n       The retained attorney should submit all bills to:\n       Director, Office of Planning, Budget and Evaluation, Civil \n     Division, United States Department of Justice, Washington, \n     D.C. 20530, Attn: Room 7038 Todd Building.\n\n\n                             prompt payment\n\n       The Prompt Payment Act is applicable to payments under this \n     agreement and requires the payment of interest on overdue \n     payments. Determinations of interest due will be made in \n     accordance with provisions of the Prompt Payment Act and \n     Office of Management and Budget Circular A-125.\n\n\n                               GAO REVIEW\n\n       Periodically, the Department of Justice may ask the \n     retained attorney to submit copies of the time sheets to the \n     General Accounting Office (GAO) for purposes of auditing the \n     accuracy of corresponding monthly bills, copies of which the \n     Department will forward directly to GAO.\n\n\n                              TERMINATION\n\n       The Department of Justice reserves the right to terminate \n     its retention agreement with the retained attorney at any \n     time for reasons set forth in 28 C.F.R. Sec. 50.16.\n\n\n                               ACCEPTANCE\n\n       I agree that my retention by the Department of Justice to \n     represent John Yarowsky in connection with the House \n     Committee on Government Reform and Oversight's Investigation \n     of the White House Travel Office matter will be in accordance \n     with the applicable statutes, regulations, and the foregoing \n     terms and conditions. This written instrument, together with \n     the applicable statutes and regulations, represents the \n     entire agreement between the Department of Justice and the \n     undersigned, any past or future oral agreements \n     notwithstanding.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, here we have the Clinton administration \nquietly approving reimbursement of legal expenses for its people at a \ntime when President Clinton opposes giving Mr. Dale a ``special \npreference.'' That was said by the President in his Rose Garden \nconference of August 1, 1996. It was hypocritically said by the \nPresident under these circumstances.\n  The reimbursement of the legal fees of Billy Dale, and other hard-\nworking, honest civil servants wrongly fired from the White House \nTravel Office, will right the wrong of an overreaching executive \nbranch. You would think they would want to get this mess behind them. \nBut, no. They come here and besmirch representatives of the other side. \nThese people have been through hell enough. It is unseemly.\n  This provision is also an attempt, I might add, to make the Travel \nOffice Seven whole at least financially by providing for their \nattorney's fees. My colleagues on the other side are willing to let the \nothers get reimbursed their attorney's fees because they do not amount \nto much. They are also, I am sure, in support of reimbursing the 23 \nWhite House employees their attorney's fees, but not Mr. Dale.\n  I believe reimbursing Mr. Dale and all of the Travel Office employees \nis the least we can do after all that they have been through.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle not to hold up \nthis measure any longer--no more excuses, no more delays. Let us get \nthis legislation passed today and put an end to it once and for all.\n  I appreciate the Clinton administration's desire to cover the legal \nfees of those who have been loyal to the President, and I want to point \nout that a mechanism exists for the Department of Justice to consider \ndoing so, too. That is OK. Mr. Dale is not so fortunate. He also was \nloyal to a number of Presidents, including this one. But his reward is \nto be put through an unseemly, vicious, miserable, costly criminal \nindictment and trial.\n  To indict somebody, all you have to show is reasonable suspicion. To \nconvict them, you have to show guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. And \nthat is where the White House, the Justice Department, and the \nprosecutors failed. And they rightly failed, because Mr. Dale was not \nguilty.\n  As I noted, the Clinton White House staff is certainly availing \nthemselves of the current avenues for reimbursement. But for the \nClinton administration to oppose the reimbursement of Mr. Dale's legal \nfees at the same time White House staff are seeking reimbursement \nthrough the Department of\n\n[[Page S10310]]\n\nJustice is transparent. It is inconsistent, to say the least. And I \nmight add it is hypocritical. It is hypocritical. And it is amazing to \nme that the people at the White House don't have the guts to admit it \nand just say, ``Let us do what is right here.''\n  To me there isn't any question. They can't show any wrongdoing by \nBilly Dale. To try to besmirch him on the Senate floor in a double-\njeopardy type of situation by bringing up what you think is one side of \nthe case facts after a jury of his peers acquitted him, I have to tell \nyou, it is unseemly. Moreover, anybody would consider a guilty plea to \nsomething that does not amount to very much if they could get a load of \nhundreds of thousands of dollars of additional legal fees off their \nbacks. Anybody would do that. To suggest otherwise is just not right. \nTime after time, I have seen defendants consider plea agreements in \nunjust prosecutions, and this was one of them.\n  This provision provides for payment of the legal expenses incurred by \nBilly Dale, Barney Brasseaux, John Dreylinger, Ralph Maughan, John \nMcSweeney, and Gary Wright incurred after being terminated in May 1993, \namid false allegations made by President Clinton's political cronies.\n  Although Mr. Dale suffered the greatest financial loss, half a \nmillion dollars, the remaining six employees collectively incurred \nabout $200,000 in their own defense. The appropriations bill for the \nDepartment of Transportation for fiscal 1994 provided approximately \n$150,000 in reimbursement of legal fees. This provision would provide \nthe balance.\n  This provision would not provide for compensation of all expenses \nassociated with the investigation into the Travel Office matter, such \nas legal costs incurred in preparation for appearing before Congress. \nBut it would provide for attorneys' fees and costs that resulted from \nthese seven men defending themselves against criminal charges.\n  The Travel Office employees will have 120 days after this legislation \nis enacted to submit verification of valid legal expenses.\n  Reimbursement is limited up to $500,000, and does not include fees \nassociated with appearances before or in preparation of congressional \ninvestigations or hearings.\n  After the former Travel Office employees were fired due to charges of \nfinancial irregularities by political profiteers, they were \ninvestigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of \nJustice, and the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Dale was subsequently \nindicted and tried as a result of the investigation and after incurring \na tremendous legal debt for his defense, Mr. Dale was acquitted on all \ncharges. The other Travel Office employees also incurred legal expenses \nfor their own defenses.\n  None of these former Travel Office employees held high-level \npositions in the administration. Many of them had worked for both \nDemocratic and Republican Presidents. Were it not for their positions \nas employees of the Federal Government, and because they found \nthemselves in the unfortunate position of having jobs coveted by \nfriends of the Clintons, they would not have been subject to a Federal \ncriminal investigation.\n  The legal fees placed on these middle-class public servants have been \nastronomical. The monetary damage they sustained is quantifiable. This \nprovision will not cover the emotional damage of this abuse of power by \nthe Clinton administration. Nor will it return to these faithful \nGovernment employees their reputations or faith in the Government they \nhad served. It merely covers the attorneys' fees and costs associated \nwith the criminal investigation.\n  According to Attorney General Reno, the White House has the authority \nto seek representation from the Department of Justice for Government \nemployees who have been called to testify regarding matters within the \nscope of their employment. Customarily, representation of these \nemployees is handled by attorneys for the agency for which the employee \nworks. There are instances however, in which it would be inappropriate \nfor agency attorneys to represent employees of the agency. In these \ncases, the Department of Justice has authority to provide reimbursement \nfor the fees associated with retaining private counsel. With respect to \nthe Travel Office and FBI files and Whitewater investigations, 23 White \nHouse employees have requested reimbursement for the legal fees of \ntheir private attorneys.\n  Should a White House employee want to receive reimbursement for their \nlegal fees for their cooperation in providing testimony, there is a \nrelatively simple procedure they must follow. First, all bills for \nlegal fees for private counsel must be submitted to the White House \nCounsel's Office. This information is then forwarded to the Civil \nDivision of the Justice Department with a written recommendation as to \nthe merit of the request. The Department will then, either approve or \ndeny the request consistent with their own guidelines. That is the \nextent of it.\n  As I stated previously, 23 White House employees have requested \nFederal reimbursement of counsel fees in connection with congressional \nor independent counsel investigations into the White House Travel \nOffice or Whitewater. A number of these requests have been approved by \nthe Clinton Justice Department, and the Department has said: ``we are \ncontinuing to process requests and anticipate acting on some of them in \nthe near future.''\n  Today, I am not addressing whether the reimbursement of legal fees \nfor individuals appearing before Congress is appropriate or not. In \nfact, if the law permits it, I have no objection to employees of the \nWhite House seeking reimbursement. My point in raising the issue at all \nis to expose the hypocrisy of the Clinton administration. The Clinton \nWhite House victimized Billy Dale and his colleagues which lead to the \npolitical prosecution of Mr. Dale leaving him with $500,000 in legal \nfees. Even the White House has admitted it improperly handled the White \nHouse Travel Office matter. In fact, a document produced to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee from the White House, which appears to be talking \npoints for a meeting with the House Democratic Caucus, states the \nfollowing, ``You all may dimly remember the Travel Office affair: in \nwhich a number of White House staff--many immature and self-promoting--\ntook impulsive and foolhardy actions to root out problems at the \nbeginning of the Clinton administration and to then gallantly recommend \nthat they take over its operation.'' Now, the White House has the \nchutspah to authorize the payment of fees to its people and not to \nBilly Dale. I find this astonishing.\n  In a press conference on November 16, 1995, months after the Travel \nOffice employees had been fired, President Clinton told the American \npublic that he regretted the hardship that Mr. Dale and his colleagues \nhad endured because of their abrupt firings. He also said that it \nappeared the White House did not handle the Travel Office dismissals \nappropriately. This was, in my opinion, a genuine attempt by the \nPresident to take responsibility for what happened to these loyal \nGovernment employees.\n  Then on January 30, 1996, White House spokesman Mr. McCurry stated, \n``Yes, and he would sign it'', referring to Mr. Clinton's intent to \nsign this measure. Again, just prior to the recent press conference in \nthe Rose Garden on August 1, 1996, White House Press Secretary, Mr. \nToiv, reaffirmed that President Clinton would sign legislation to \nreimburse the former Travel Office employees. He stated, and I quote, \n``I would just repeat that when the bill arrives on the President's \ndesk, he would sign it.''\n  Despite the administration's previous position, the President said at \nthe August 1, 1996, press conference in response to a question \nregarding whether he would keep his word and sign this bill, ``I \ndidn't--I never gave my word on that''. He then stated that an error \nhad been made by his spokesman, ``I have made it clear to Mr. McCurry \nwhat my position is on this. And if an error was made by my spokesman, \nI'm sorry, but I have not broken my word to anybody.''\n  After President Clinton's apparent U-turn on this issue, in an \ninterview with CNN on August 26, 1996, President Clinton took the \nextraordinary step to state that individuals serving in his \nadministration have been ruined by pure, naked, raw politics''. He then \nwent on to say that he would pursue every avenue, including raising \nmoney himself, to pay for the legal expenses of his\n\n[[Page S10311]]\n\naides. He then continued to say in reference to his aides, ``Do I feel \nterrible about the completely innocent middle-class people who have \nbeen wrecked financially by this? I certainly do. But I didn't abuse \nthem. And it's high time that the people who abuse have to take \nresponsibility for what they do''.\n  I must admit that I am disappointed and shocked by the steps that \nthis administration has taken to smear the Travel Office employees. The \nPresident's recent comments are in direct contradiction to his previous \nstatements expressing concern for the former Travel Office employees. \nHe is willing to assist his aides, and criticize the Congress for \npursuing an investigation into wrongdoing by his administration, but \nwill not accept responsibility for the wrongful treatment of Billy \nDale? Give me a break.\n  In the embarrassment of having lost a case so blatantly politically \nmotivated, individuals within the Department of Justice chose to leak a \ndocument revealing that Mr. Dale considered accepting a plea bargain. \nNotably, as the Justice Department is fully aware, and is articulated \nin their own regulations, information regarding plea negotiations is \nconfidential, not for public dissemination. I can only sympathize with \nMr. Dale, who after years of constant invasion of his and his family's \nprivacy, and incurring enormous expenses, considered a settlement in \nthe hopes of ending this nightmare. Some of my colleagues have \nsuggested that Mr. Dale admitted his culpability by considering a plea \nagreement. So too, has President Clinton, a former State attorney \ngeneral and law professor. Now, we have a ``Dear Colleague'' letter \ndistributed yesterday which also disseminates this confidential \ninformation. The facts are, however, that Mr. Dale never agreed to \nadmit to committing the essential elements necessary for an \nembezzlement prosecution. He simply agreed to settle the case without \nan admission of guilt. Any suggestion that such a strategic tactic \nequates to an admission of guilt is outrageous and is yet just a \nfurther attempt to smear Mr. Dale's reputation.\n\n  Department of Justice guidelines specifically state that information \nwhich ``tends to create dangers of prejudice without serving a \nsignificant law enforcement function,'' should not be released to the \npublic. The disclosure of a plea agreement clearly fits within this \ndefinition. It is troubling to me that the Department of Justice, The \nPresident, and some of my colleagues in the Senate continue to ignore \nthis.\n  Whitewater is the investigation of the possibility of the Clintons \nusing their political positions for personal gain in a virtually risk-\nfree investment, and then, engaging in damage control activities. There \nhas been no credible allegation that the Government somehow abused the \nWhitewater participants. By contrast, the Travelgate investigation is a \ncase of sheer and utter abuse by the executive branch. By politicizing \nthe Department of Justice and the FBI, the administration literally \nruined the livelihood and reputation of seven hard-working civil \nservants.\n  I believe a distinction should be made between reimbursement of fees \nfor appearances before Congress and those involving the misuse of the \njudicial system for purely political purposes. This provision does not \nallow payment of legal fees in connection with any appearance before \nCongress. Accordingly, within the parameters of the provision, \nWhitewater witnesses could not be reimbursed. Appearing before Congress \nsimply would not be covered by this provision.\n  Unlike Travelgate, however, the Whitewater matter has not been \ncompleted. Many questions have been left unanswered in the Whitewater \ninvestigation and an Independent Counsel is still trying to determine \nwhether or not there have been any criminal violations. Any \nperpetrators of a coverup must be brought to justice. Let us not forget \nit was just this past January when Rose law firm billing records \nmysteriously surfaced within the residence of the White House. \nIndividuals with access to this area of the White House must be \nquestioned to find the truth. The American people deserve no less.\n  Unlike the witnesses in the Whitewater hearings, these former \nemployees of the White House Travel Office were targeted by the Office \nof the President. They were victims of an administration that \npoliticized the Department of Justice and the FBI. In contrast, the \nWhitewater witnesses have not been subjected to such persecution, and \nwere questioned in the hope of shedding light on the details of the \nClinton's investment. These witnesses certainly had information \npertinent to the investigation, but they were not the target of the \ninvestigation. The individuals in the Travel Office matter were \nvictimized not because they happened to come into contact with an \ninvestigation as many ordinary citizens could and is clearly the case \nwith the Whitewater witnesses, but because they held positions in the \nGovernment that allowed them to become the subject of an investigative \nprobe. I think this provision affirms that it is appropriate to \ncompensate these people who have been put to such expense under these \nspecial circumstances.\n  Moreover, the victims in the Travelgate matter are clear and \nidentifiable. Mr. Dale and the six other former employees of the White \nHouse Travel Office had their reputations marred by the Clinton \nadministration. They endured investigations by the FBI, the IRS, the \nDepartment of Justice, as well as that of Peat Marwick. Their families \nwere placed under the strain of having been investigated for 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, all without a single proven instance of wrong-doing on the part \nof the Travel Office employees.\n  Mr. President, those on the other side have indicated that this bill \nwhich reimburses Billy Dale is unprecedented. I would like to point out \nthat the House passed this bill with overwhelming bipartisan support, \nand, despite the bipartisan support of the House, some of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle in this Chamber oppose this provision \nstating it sets a bad precedent.\n  Let me just quickly quote Congressman Barney Frank, a well-respected \nDemocrat, a memorandum of the Judiciary Committee over there, a person \nwith whom I work on the Judiciary Committee in the Senate as well about \nthis very issue. He said, ``This neither sets a precedent nor precludes \nsomeone. Any new case will be judged on the same merits.''\n  I agree with Congressman Frank. After all, Congress is not bound by \nthe actions of another Congress.\n  I might also add that in the Transportation appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 1995, five of the Travel Office Seven had some of their \nlegal expenses reimbursed. Since receiving reimbursement for their \nlegal expenses at that time, these individuals have incurred more legal \ndebt. Not included in the fiscal year 1995 Transportation \nappropriations bill were the legal expenses of Billy Dale. The \nprovisions of this bill allow reimbursement for these additional fees, \nand for Mr. Dale.\n  When the Transportation appropriations bill was passed, no one made a \nfuss. These individuals were reimbursed, as they deserved to be. Billy \nDale deserves the same treatment. After all, he was sacked just like \nall the others, sacked unjustly.\n  I have heard arguments that if we are to reimburse Billy Dale even \nafter being indicted, the floodgates would be opened, and we would be \nobligated to reimburse anyone who was investigated by the Federal \nGovernment and found innocent of all charges.\n  I do not believe that is the case, nor do I believe that this White \nHouse or any White House in the future is going to do the outrageous \nsmearing that occurred in this case. This is a unique case that \ninvolved the executive branch at the highest level doing this to \ndecent, honorable, honest people who have been vindicated by the courts \nof law.\n  As we are all aware, Congress can decide the merits of all claims on \na case-by-case basis. By passing this provision, we are not setting a \nprecedent as is done in a court of law. We are simply passing a \njudgment based on the circumstances of this case that the firing of the \nTravel Office Seven was unjust and the manner by which they were \ninvestigated was inappropriate and unwarranted.\n  The Administration erred in the way they dealt with the Travel Office \nsituation. By reimbursing the legal expenses of Billy Dale and his \ncolleagues, Congress would be taking a step to correct the \nadministration's error in judgment.\n\n[[Page S10312]]\n\n  Now, reimbursing legal expenses is not wholly unprecedented, I might \nadd. Although the circumstances are somewhat different, Hamilton Jordan \nis an example of someone who, in my opinion, was unfairly investigated \nafter being accused of cocaine use. After an independent counsel was \nappointed and all the evidence gathered, Mr. Jordan was cleared of all \ncharges. Congress then decided to reimburse Mr. Jordan's legal fees \nbecause the charges lodged against him were found to be baseless.\n  Because unjust situations sometimes arise, the independent counsel \nstatutes have provisions designed to rectify these grievances. Why \ncan't my colleagues treat this matter as decently as those of us who \nwere then in the Senate treated Hamilton Jordan? Why is it we have to \ngo through this? Would it not be in the best interests of the President \nto put this behind us?\n  The White House was able to bring the power of Federal law \nenforcement to bear on the Travel Office employees, and the facts show \nthat they did it improperly for purposes of greed.\n  In response to the claim that such a payment is unprecedented, I say \nthat the circumstances by which Billy Dale and the others were fired is \nunprecedented, and it should be treated as such. We are not talking \nabout some low-level bureaucrat in the halls of the bureaucracies of \nthis city. We are talking about right in the halls of the upper levels \nof the White House itself where this injustice was perpetrated. The \ncircumstances by which Mr. Billy Dale and the others were prosecuted \nand were investigated and charged and targeted, and prosecuted in \nDale's case, were unprecedented.\n  This is a meritorious case for reimbursement. It is as meritorious as \nany I have ever seen. What was done to these people never should have \noccurred in this manner. House Republicans and House Democrats \nrecognize this fact. There was not an attempt to indict him all over, \nconvict him again after a jury acquitted him, or go through the facts \nin a further attempt to smear Mr. Dale. The fact is, the media knew he \nwas honest, and everybody else knew he was honest, and, above all, a \njury of his peers found him to be honest. What was done to these people \nshould not have been done.\n  We had bipartisan passage in the House--we ought to have that here. I \nthink everyone in this body recognizes that fact. If we in Congress are \nto reimburse legal fees on a case-by-case basis when the case merits \nit, as this one does, then it is the right thing to do, and I have \nnever, never seen a case more worthy than this one that could come \nbefore the Senate. I can tell some other injustices that were certainly \nterrible that should be straightened out, too, but nothing like this.\n\n  It has also been suggested by my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle that H.R. 2937 is a private relief bill, and typically these \nbills are referred to the Court of Claims for factfinding. First, I \nwould like to point out that H.R. 2937 is not a private relief bill. \nThis bill was passed through the House on the Suspension Calendar, \nwhich handles public bills. There is a separate calendar that deals \nwith private relief bills. The Congressional Record reflects the fact \nthat H.R. 2937 was on a public bill calendar, and there was a rollcall \nvote when it finally passed earlier this year.\n  Second, a private relief bill must name all those making a claim. \nH.R. 2937 does not name the former Travel Office employees \nspecifically. Even if H.R. 2937 was a private relief bill, however, \ncongressional referrals are typically made to the Court of Claims only \nif the facts of the claim are complicated and unclear.\n  In this case, numerous reports as well as 2 years' worth of \ninvestigations and House hearings have exposed the facts in this case. \nThe facts are very clear, and there is very little dispute to what \noccurred. Additionally, the only other reason to refer the matter to \nthe Claims Court would be if there was a dispute as to the amount of \nmoney that is being claimed.\n  Once again, Mr. Dale and his former colleagues submitted their bills \nto the House Judiciary Committee, and those amounts were included in \nthe House bill. There is no dispute about the bills that have been \nsubmitted. In short, there is no reason why my colleagues should want \nto remove this language from the Treasury-Postal bill on the basis that \nthe facts are unclear. We in this body and the administration know what \nthe facts are and we know where the blame lies.\n  Mr. President, I hope our colleagues will vote to support the Hatch \namendment and will vote to turn down this attempt to throw this matter \ninto the Court of Claims. There is nothing in dispute here. I think \neverybody who is fair will acknowledge that.\n  Might I ask, how much of my time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes and 35 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5257, as Modified\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if I could, pursuant to the UC, I send a \nmodified amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment (No. 5257), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.     . (a) Reimbursement of Certain Attorney Fees and \n     Costs.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay \n     from amounts appropriated in title I of this Act under the \n     heading, ``Departmental Offices, Salaries and Expenses'', up \n     to $499,999 to reimburse former employees of the White House \n     Travel office whose employment in that office was terminated \n     on May 19, 1993, for any attorney fees and costs they \n     incurred with respect to that termination.\n       (2) Verification required.--The Secretary shall pay an \n     individual in full under paragraph (1) upon submission by the \n     individual of documentation verifying the attorney fees and \n     costs.\n       (3) No inference of liability.--Liability of the United \n     States shall not be inferred from enactment of or payment \n     under this subsection.\n       (b) Limitation on Filing of Claims.--The Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall not pay any claim filed under this section \n     that is filed later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Limitation.--Payments under subsection (a) shall not \n     include attorney fees or costs incurred with respect to any \n     Congressional hearing or investigation into the termination \n     of employment of the former employees of the White House \n     Travel Office.\n       (d) Reduction.--The amount paid pursuant to this section to \n     an individual for attorney fees and costs described in \n     subsection (a) shall be reduced by any amount received before \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, without obligation for \n     repayment by the individual, for payment of such attorney \n     fees and costs (including any amount received from the funds \n     appropriated for the individual in the matter relating to the \n     ``Office of the General Counsel'' under the heading ``Office \n     of the Secretary'' in title I of the Department of \n     Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     1994).\n       (c) Payment in Full Settlement of Claims Against the United \n     States.--Payment under this section, when accepted by an \n     individual described in subsection (a), shall be in full \n     satisfaction of all claims of, or on behalf of, the \n     individual against the United States that arose out of the \n     termination of the White House Travel Office employment of \n     that individual on May 19, 1993.\n       Sec. 529. None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used by the Executive Office of the President to request \n     from the Federal Bureau of Investigation any official \n     background investigation report on any individual, except \n     when it is made known to the Federal official having \n     authority to obligate or expend such funds that----\n       (1) such individual has given his or her express written \n     consent for such request not more than 6 months prior to the \n     date of such request and during the same presidential \n     administration; or\n       (2) such request is required due to extraordinary \n     circumstances involving national security.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority manager of the bill is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the subcommittee has included the $500,000 \nfor the reimbursement of the Travel Office employees terminated by the \nWhite House in May 1993. And why? I want to explain that briefly.\n  Over 3 years later, we are attempting to offset the cost of the \ntremendous legal fees that these individuals, I believe, were \nwrongfully forced to assume. The provision here would pay the \nattorney's fees and costs they incurred with respect to that \ntermination.\n  Why do we need this legislation? In October 1993, as part of the \nfiscal year 1994 transportation appropriations bill, the Congress \nauthorized the payment of $150,000 for the legal bills of the five \nWhite House Travel Office employees who, after being summarily fired, \nwere placed on administrative leave and\n\n[[Page S10313]]\n\nlater transferred to other Federal agencies. This sum, $150,000, was \ninsufficient to completely cover the legal costs of the five employees \nand did not address the attorney's fees of the other two fired Travel \nOffice employees because they were still under investigation. Both \nemployees have since been exonerated of any wrongdoing, and I believe \nthey deserve similar reimbursement for the extraordinary and \nunnecessary legal expenses they were required to incur. Mr. Dale's \nattorneys' costs alone are close to half a million dollars.\n  This is a unique case, to say the least. Each claim against the \nUnited States should be judged on a case-by-case basis, and it is not \nthe intent of this provision in this bill to set a precedent that in \nevery case the payment of attorney's fees and costs is justified.\n  What is the justification of the attorney's fees here? I believe the \nfiring of the White House employees, and especially Mr. Dale, was one \nof the most appalling abuses of power that I have ever seen, because I \nthink it shows what little regard the White House has had for the \nplight of these loyal, dedicated public servants and their families.\n  And it was totally unnecessary, which makes it even worse. The White \nHouse could have fired the Travel Office without as much as a whimper. \nAnd yet, the White House felt compelled to devise a strategy that would \nblunt the claims of nepotism and political motivation that would \ncertainly follow replacing a nonpartisan, career Travel office with \nLittle Rock business associates, friends and relatives.\n  Now, after several years of investigation that has sometimes raised \nissues of constitutional dimension--claims of executive privilege, \ncontempt citations--the facts make clear that:\n  No. 1, a concerted effort was undertaken in the White House and by \nclose friends and associates of the President and First Lady to take \nover the Travel Office.\n  No. 2, it was not sufficient to simply fire the career civil servants \nserving in the Office, which it was the prerogative of the White House \nto do. Instead, White House staff colluded to raise false claims of \ncriminal wrongdoing against the Travel Office staff to justify what was \npurely a political move to benefit friends and associates of the \nPresident and First Lady.\n  No. 3, the White House improperly used the FBI to initiate a criminal \ninvestigation against the White House Travel staff based solely on the \nallegations of the President's cousin, Catherine Cornelius, who \nadmittedly intended to run the White House Travel Office once the \ncareer employees were ousted.\n  No. 4, the White House publicly made allegations of criminal \nwrongdoing and financial mismanagement before an accounting audit was \never completed on the Travel Office.\n  No. 5, the seven long-time career employees were never given an \nopportunity to respond to the allegations or answer the accusations \nmade against them--they were given minutes notice of their termination, \nand almost immediately escorted off the White House premises by, none \nother than Craig Livingstone, the head of White House Personnel \nSecurity.\n  No. 6, the GAO found in its May 1994 report that while senior White \nHouse officials said the terminations were based on ``findings of \nserious financial management weaknesses, we noted that individuals who \nhad personal and business interests in the Travel Office created the \nmomentum and ultimately led to the examination of the Travel Office \noperations.''\n  No. 7, the GAO also agreed with the White House's own Management \nReview of the Travel Office affair that ``the public acknowledgment of \nthe criminal investigation had the effect of tarnishing the employees' \nreputations, and the existence of the criminal investigation caused the \nemployees to retain legal counsel, reportedly at considerable \nexpense.''\n  I am saddened to see that the President went back on his commitment \nto support reimbursing the Travel Office employees. In January of this \nyear, Mike McCurry, the President's spokesman and Press Secretary made \nit clear that the President was not only sorry for the treatment of Mr. \nDale and his colleagues, but that he would sign a bill to reimburse \nthem for their legal costs.\n  It appears now that the President intends to make a political \nstatement out of their misfortune. Upset with congressional \ninvestigations into Whitewater and the Travelgate matter itself, he now \nintends to hold these long-time career employees hostage to his \npolitical posturing.\n  It was not enough that they were used as an excuse to give his \nfriends and relatives Government jobs.\n  It was not enough that these employees were accused of criminal \nconduct without a shred of evidence, other than the allegations of a \n24-year-old relative.\n  It was not enough that these employees were subject to IRS audits, \nthat their FBI files were improperly requested as late as seven months \nafter they were fired. Recall that it was Craig Livingstone who \nescorted the Travel Office employees out of the White House in May of \n1993. We are now supposed to believe that he was not aware that Billy \nDale was not working in the White House when his own office requested \nMr. Dale's FBI file 7 months later in December of that year?\n  It was not enough that Mr. Dale was acquitted after only 2 hours of \ndeliberation by the jury. Two hours. The man was acquitted. And what \nwas the White House response? What was the President's personal lawyer \ndoing on all the morning talk shows? He accused Mr. Dale of accepting a \nplea bargain. Talk about insult to injury.\n  This decent, loyal employee is set-up by the White House, and then \nwhen he is acquitted in a court of law by a jury of his peers, the \nPresident's personal attorney gets on national television and implies \nthat Mr. Dale is a criminal that tried to get off easy.\n  Why is the White House so intent on destroying Billy Dale?\n  The White House has every reason to be embarrassed by their actions, \nevery reason to want to avoid talking about Billy Dale--but it is an \nabsolute outrage, that the President of the United States would seek to \nuse this man as a foil for his own political gain. It is wrong. It is \nunjust. It is unkind, uncharitable, and indecent.\n  The Senators' amendment, Senators Reid and Levin, is, therefore, \nmisplaced and I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the minority leader \nwishes to speak at this time. I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nindicate the time not run that is left for the Senator from Utah and \nthe Senators from Michigan and Nevada. He should be here momentarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am dumbfounded that we are tonight \ndebating whether or not we should, for the first time in history, pay \nthe attorney's fees for an individual who was properly indicted and \nproperly prosecuted. Is the U.S. Congress going to start reimbursing \nevery Federal defendant who is acquitted? If the answer is no, then I \nmust question why are we being asked to do so in this case. There is no \nargument about reimbursing fees for those who are not indicted. The \nonly argument is about paying the fees for one individual who was, \nagain, properly indicted and properly prosecuted.\n  Unfortunately, instead of addressing the issues the American people \nare really concerned about--job security, personal security, retirement \nsecurity--some of our Republican colleagues have decided to raise this \nissue in a blatant attempt to score political points in a Presidential \nelection year. They are willing to spend $500,000 of taxpayer dollars \nin an attempt to embarrass the White House. In this era of tight \nbudgets and competing priorities, we cannot afford to waste that kind \nof money to pay for Republican attack ads from the Senate floor. There \nis absolutely no precedent for this legislation to pay Billy Dale's \nlegal expenses.\n\n[[Page S10314]]\n\n  We have never agreed to pay the legal expenses for anyone who is \nindicted. The Independent Counsel Act provides for the reimbursement of \nlegal expenses for a person who is not indicted. Billy Dale, however, \nwas indicted and was prosecuted by the Justice Department, not the \nindependent counsel. Moreover, there is absolutely no evidence that \nBilly Dale was indicted unfairly. Mr. Dale never filed any motions or \nraised any legal objections to his indictment, and I am unaware of any \nfinding by any court that the indictment was somehow improper or \nmotivated by political purpose. Nor have we held any hearings on the \nmatter. There is no factual basis for violating the Senate precedent \nand giving half a million dollars to Billy Dale or anyone else.\n  There are also undisputed facts about this matter that I find \nsomewhat disturbing.\n  We know that Mr. Dale deposited over 50 Travel Office checks worth \napproximately $54,000 into his personal account over a 3-year period of \ntime. He never told anyone in the Travel Office or in the Bush or \nClinton White Houses about these secret deposits. These deposits only \ncame to light because of a FBI investigation, not because Mr. Dale \ndisclosed this information.\n  We know that Mr. Dale offered to plead guilty to a felony before the \ntrial. That is fact.\n  We know that Mr. Dale admitted that it was ``a terrible decision on \nmy part.''\n  We know that at the end of the trial, the judge ruled that there was \nsufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to convict Dale of all \ncharges brought against him.\n  In the end, the jury acquitted Mr. Dale of the charges, but that does \nnot mean the taxpayers should pay his legal expenses. If we gave a half \na million dollars to every defendant who was acquitted, I am sure we \nwould have people lining up for criminal trials in every courthouse in \nAmerica. The fact is, we have never reimbursed anyone who was indicted, \neven if they were later acquitted by a jury.\n  So why do my Republican colleagues seek special treatment for Mr. \nDale? Why should Mr. Dale be treated differently than every other \ncriminal defendant in America?\n  It seems to me that he is being treated differently because my \nRepublican colleagues are using the Travel Office matter for purely \npolitical purposes. Of course, my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle say that Mr. Dale deserves to be reimbursed and that Democrats \nare blocking reimbursement for political reasons.\n  To put an end to partisan bickering over the issues, we Democrats \nhave offered a very reasonable amendment. And let me just commend the \ndistinguished Senators from Michigan and Nevada for their tenacity and \nfor their willingness to bring this issue to the floor in a way that is \ncertainly eminently reasonable, that recognizes past precedent, that \nrecognizes the importance of a procedure that has been used over and \nover again in circumstances just like this.\n  Let us send, as they suggest in their proposal, this issue to the \nneutral arbiter, the U.S. Claims Court, to determine whether it is \nappropriate to reimburse Mr. Dale. Why not do what we have done in the \npast? Why not use the procedure that we have in law that will allow us \na fair and objective hearing, a fair and objective analysis as to \nwhether or not this ought to be done?\n  The claims court can hold hearings to obtain all the facts outside of \nthe world of partisan politics 2 months before a Presidential election \nand render a recommendation that will not be tainted by partisan \nmotivations and bias. The claims court has extensive experience in \nresolving these types of claims.\n  The Parliamentarian has already indicated that the provision to \nreimburse Mr. Dale is a private relief provision. There is a law in \nplace that allows the Senate to send requests for private relief to the \nclaims court so the court can decide whether the relief is sought in a \nlegal way and is legally appropriate.\n  Mr. President, this is a fair and well-established method for \nresolving a dispute. It has worked before. Passage of this amendment \nwould allow the Senate to make a decision based on legal rather than \npolitical considerations. If the claims court recommends reimbursement \nfor Mr. Dale, then the public would know what he actually deserves, and \nwe will not worry that he is the beneficiary of some political \nwindfall. We are willing to live by the decision made by the claims \ncourt.\n\n  On the other hand, if the court would rule that Mr. Dale does not \ndeserve to be reimbursed, then he will not be given a half a million \ndollars of taxpayers' money improperly. There is one-half million \ndollars at stake.\n  The public deserves a neutral determination on this issue, and there \nis an important Senate precedent at stake. We owe it to this \ninstitution to act carefully and thoughtfully, even in the heat of a \nPresidential election year.\n  Again, let me commend my colleagues, and for all these reasons, I \nurge all of our colleagues to join them in favor of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time is left to Senator Reid?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two and a half minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am wondering if the 8\\1/2\\ minutes the \nleader used can be charged to leader time, and we can have the full \nhalf hour?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nthat I have consumed in the presentation of my remarks be taken from my \nleader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has that right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I understand there \nis time for debate in the morning. Is that debate part of the time \nwhich the Chair just indicated Senator Reid has left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has been no order entered yet with \nrespect to the debate tomorrow.\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, there will be 15 minutes divided \nequally, and I think that is the way we should go.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I also had the same understanding. I am not sure whether \nthat was part of a UC. I ask Senator Reid if he will yield 5 minutes to \nme.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can we ask unanimous consent that the 15 minutes, from \n9:30 to 9:45 before the vote, be divided equally between Senator Reid \nand myself or Senator Shelby?\n  Mr. REID. I think they are planning to do that in wrapup.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will let it go then.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask if Senator Reid might yield 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. I yield as much time as the Senator may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is plenty of evidence of White House \nmistakes and errors in the firing. Those have been acknowledged now for \nyears. They have been recounted here again tonight. They have been \nacknowledged, as they should be. People who had legal fees that \nresulted from that firing should have those legal fees reimbursed, \nthose who were not indicted. They have been reimbursed except for \n$50,000. That $50,000 is part of this bill. That is not what is at \nissue.\n\n  What is at issue is the $450,000 which would go to someone who was \nproperly indicted, properly prosecuted, and whether or not this Senate, \nfor the first time in our history, will be approving legal fees to \nsomeone who was legally indicted. And that is the issue.\n  It was not the White House that carried out the criminal \ninvestigation of Billy Dale. That was the FBI, and there is no evidence \nthat has been alleged that I know of that the FBI investigation that \nled to the indictment was improper. There was no allegation at trial, \nthere was no allegation in the House committee report that the FBI \ninvestigation that led to the criminal proceeding, that led to the \nattorney's fees which are at issue here, was an improper investigation.\n  It was not the White House which decided to prosecute. It was a very \nprofessional Department of Justice which made a decision to prosecute \nbased not on anything that the White House had done, but on what Billy \nDale had done, relative to the deposit of checks that belonged to the \nTravel Office, in his own personal account, and relative to\n\n[[Page S10315]]\n\ncashing checks that were intended for petty cash that didn't end up \ngoing through the petty cash ledger.\n  It was his actions which the FBI investigation determined were \nindictable.\n  It was his actions, not the White House action, it was his deposit of \nchecks in his personal account, mingling money that did not belong to \nhim in his private bank account. It was those actions that led to the \nindictment, led to the prosecution, not the White House action.\n  It was his own actions which led to an indictment which resulted in \nlegal fees which are the subject of this issue.\n  Should we, for the first time without a Senate hearing, without a \nHouse report which makes even a reference to any impropriety in the \nindictment and prosecution, should this Senate decide that this \ndefendant, unlike any other defendant, should have his legal fees paid, \nalthough he was indicted?\n  Our good friend from Utah said, ``What about Ham Jordan?'' Ham Jordan \nwas not indicted. That is the dividing line which we are asked to \ncross, the dividing line between people who were indicted and people \nwho were not.\n\n  The White House Travel Office people, except for Billy Dale, were not \nindicted. Ham Jordan was not indicted. People who were investigated by \nthe independent counsel who were not indicted are entitled to legal \nfees if legal fees result because of the existence of an independent \ncounsel. We have provided for legal fee reimbursement for people not \nindicted. We have awarded legal fees for people not indicted. The \nindependent counsel statute provides for legal fees for people not \nindicted.\n  Should we cross that line? I think we ought to be very careful of \nsetting a precedent, so careful that we ought to simply say, OK, these \nfees will be paid subject to one thing, and that is, that we got a law \nwhich says that we can refer a private claim, a private bill, to the \nCourt of Claims, and the Court of Claims can determine if there is a \nlegal or equitable basis for the claim.\n  Is there an equitable basis for this claim? The Senator from Utah \nfeels that there is. He feels that with great intensity, as does the \nSenator from Alabama. I would propose to both of them that we test \ntheir hypothesis. There is a test. There is a test in law. We wrote the \nlaw. It is a reference to the Court of Claims. I propose to them that \nthey test their hypothesis that there was anything wrong, that there \nwas something wrong with the prosecution, investigation and indictment \nhere. Because unless there was, there is no basis for the payment of \nlegal fees. Test that hypothesis.\n  I call upon them to support an amendment which simply says, yes, we \nwill pay those fees if the Court of Claims finds that there was an \ninequity here. That is the way to test their hypothesis. We can argue \nthese facts back and forth all night. But one thing is indisputable, we \nhave put in law a process to give us an objective evaluation of a \nprivate claim of this kind. Take it out of politics. It does not belong \nthere. When you set a precedent of this kind, be sure you are acting on \nfirm ground, free it from any political taint, any political \ncoloration, refer it to the body that we have set up in law to \ndetermine whether or not a claim of this kind is based on an equitable \nclaim.\n  Mr. President, I made an inquiry of the Chair back on May 14 relative \nto the Senate bill that Senator Hatch introduced, which would provide \nrelief for the Travel Office employees. That inquiry which I made to \nthe Chair on May 14 was whether or not the bill before us, which was \nthat freestanding bill of Senator Hatch, is a private bill. The \nPresiding Officer ruled, after, if my recollection is clear, he \nconsulted with the Parliamentarian, that it is a private bill.\n  My parliamentary inquiry at this time is, is the Senator correct that \nthat was the ruling of the Chair on May 14 relative to that \nparliamentary inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was the response of the Chair to that \ninquiry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for that, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. There has been some talk about there should not be talk on \nthis floor about the prosecution memo, about a plea of guilty. Mr. \nPresident, we are not in court. We are in the Senate of the United \nStates, some say the greatest debating society in the history of the \nworld. I think it is appropriate, in a great debating arena, to talk \nabout the facts. This is not a court of law where there are objections \nas to hearsay, objections as to questions having already been asked, or \nit is repetitive, or you do not understand it. We are here to bring out \nthe facts, the facts from wherever we might find them. We have found \nfacts relating to this case that for a long time have been covered up. \nThey have been hidden in the bowels of wherever they are hidden in this \nbig city.\n  The fact is that in this instance we have learned that there was an \ninstance in a document called the prosecution memo, where among other \nthings they found: ``We propose to charge Billy Ray Dale . . . with \nconverting to his own use approximately $54,000 in checks and $14,000 \nin cash''--and I put here recognizing that they could only get 1 year \nof the money that he stole; there was a lot more money he stole, but \nthe records, as indicated, have been destroyed--``received by him in \nconnection with his official duties. The FBI has investigated this \nmatter and strongly supports these charges.'' Justice Department, \nPublic Integrity Section.\n\n  We are here in the Senate of the United States to talk about the \nfacts. And the facts are, this man was indicted, and he was properly \nindicted. There was never a question of whether or not he was properly \nindicted. Had it been on the basis of the legislation talked about by \nmy friend from Michigan, these facts would have never been given to the \nAmerican public, they would have never been given to the American \npublic that he wrote a letter through his attorney saying he would \nplead guilty, that the prosecution memo, line after line, indicates \nthat this man did a lot of things that were criminal in nature. The \nfact, Mr. President, that he was acquitted by a jury is really too bad. \nBut it happens, it happens in our system of justice.\n  It is simply wrong to accuse this administration of leaking the memo. \nI do not think it is my obligation to indicate where the prosecution \nmemo was obtained, but I do know that I obtained it, and I do know it \ndid not come from anybody in the Justice Department, did not come from \nanybody in the White House, directly or indirectly. It is a reckless \ncharge, lacking in merit. We are entitled, in this Senate Chamber, to \ntalk about letters written admitting guilt. We are entitled, in this \nSenate Chamber, to talk about facts as determined in a prosecution \nmemo.\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Senator yield on that for just a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate my colleague yielding.\n  My question is this. I know the Senator did not get it from the White \nHouse directly or from the Justice Department directly, because the \nSenator told me where he got it. The Senator got it from the House of \nRepresentatives, which I presume whomever they got it from got it from \nthe White House or the Justice Department. Those are the only two \nplaces it could have been obtained. I am not accusing the Senator from \nNevada, although I question--I question--whether a document that so one \nsided should be used especially a document that is confidential. I \nquestion whether that sort of document should be used on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Utah, and he is my friend from the \nneighboring State of Utah, that the prosecution memo sets forth facts \nin the case. We are entitled in this body to have facts in the case. We \nhave heard a lot of facts over these many months from the other side \nabout this poor Billy Dale, how he has just been put upon by everybody. \nThe fact of the matter is, he has not been. The fact of the matter is, \nhe was indicted, properly indicted. After having been indicted, he had \na letter written saying, ``I want to plead guilty.'' And I think we are \nentitled to hear that. The American taxpayers are entitled to hear it. \nI think it is important to acknowledge, not only that, but his \nadmissions during the trial phase.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for an additional question?\n\n[[Page S10316]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for an additional question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is in line with the question of the Senator from Utah. \nIs it not true that when the Justice Department was asked for that \nprosecution memo by the House, it did everything in its power not to \ngive that prosecution memo to the House, and, as a matter of fact, it \nwas only after the House subpoenaed that prosecution memo that it was \nthen delivered to the House? So it is not as though the Department of \nJustice just handed it over to the House. They told the House, this is \na sensitive document. They did not want to turn that over to the House. \nThe House, Representative Clinger insisted on it, issued a subpoena, \nand that is when this document was delivered to the House of \nRepresentatives. Is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely, that is correct. It is not just that the \nJustice Department was hoping who would read it. They did not want to \ngive it up.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Justice Department was not subpoenaed for that \ndocument. If anybody was, it was the White House. Why would they have \nthat document?\n  Mr. REID. I do not know how they got it. But it was by virtue of the \nsubpoena.\n  Mr. HATCH. But you do not know?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Michigan and my friend from Utah, I \ndo not know how it wound up in the House. It got there as a result of \nChairman Clinger wanting it and having gotten it, and it worked its way \nto this body, as it should.\n  Now, I repeat, if the Billy Dale constituency is so confident that \nthey have merits on their side, they should allow for this to be \nremoved from this political arena during this Presidential election \ntime and decided by an independent body. That is why we have the Court \nof Claims.\n  There has been a lot of talk here tonight about other Travel Office \nemployees. The other Travel Office employees were not indicted, and \nthey have been or will be fully reimbursed. They have gotten most of \ntheir money now, except for a few incidentals, and everyone \nacknowledges they should be paid. We are willing to do that.\n  The House and others at the time they acted simply did not have the \nfacts. Billy Dale is not an honest person. The jury did not find that \nhe was honest. They acquitted him. The jury in the Menendez brothers \ncase did not find they were good sons. They acquitted them on the first \ngo-round. They were acquitted. It was a hung jury--hung jury. They did \nnot find that they were nice young men who were good to their parents, \njust as this jury did not find that Billy Dale was honest. That was not \na requirement of their findings. They looked at jury instructions and \nruled upon those jury instructions in weighing the fact that he was not \nguilty as charged.\n  I disagree with them. I think any reasonable person would. But the \nprosecution did a lousy job of presenting the case to the jury. It \nhappens.\n  He admitted being dishonest, and I think it is important we recognize \nthat there are many disputed facts. My good friend, the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Utah, says there are no disputed facts. There are \nlots of disputed facts. That is why, in my opinion, it is not right to \ngive him attorney's fees. This is raw politics. This money is not for \ntrial. Some of the money in the time sheets that have been presented \ndeal with even press events. He had to appear at press events.\n  Mr. President, the prosecution memo, we should not leave that memo so \nsoon. We will go to a few pages on the prosecution memo in summation.\n  Shortly after the Travel Office employees were fired, the FBI began \nits investigation under our supervision. The vast majority of the \nallegations we examined prove meritless as to other Travel Office \nemployees. However, we found substantial evidence that Dale, in fact, \nstole at least $14,000 in petty cash, and he converted approximately \n$54,000 worth of travel checks to his own use.\n  We found no evidence of illegal conduct by any other member of the \nTravel Office. That is why we have agreed to reimburse them. The media \nchecks selected by Dale for deposit in his account were not for Main \nStreet press organizations but English, Japanese, German, and Hispanic \nmedia.\n  The selection is significant. The refunds were generated by the \nvendors on their own and arrived unexpectedly, and their absence would \nnot be missed. Similarly, the checks from the esoteric news services \nwere less likely to be scrutinized.\n  Mr. President, I think it is also of note in the prosecution memo--\nbecause until I read this, this is the first I knew about this--the \npetty cash logs covering the period prior to February 1992 are missing. \nDale had no explanation for the missing logs. These deal with petty \ncash. This is where he got the cash. He did not deal with checks in \nthis instance.\n  Another few lines from the prosecution memo:\n\n       The evidence indicates that Dale stole this missing $14,000 \n     in cash.\n\n  Next:\n\n       There was simply no need to cash these sizable checks \n     at the time they were presented.\n\n  Next:\n\n       He cannot claim credibly he used the relatively large \n     amounts of unrecorded cash to pay trip expenses during this \n     period.\n\n  Finally:\n\n       Dale's explanation is not credible.\n\n  That is what this case is all about. That is why the Court of Claims \nshould review this.\n  Mr. President, this is important that we go forward on this to the \nCourt of Claims. It would take politics out of this. It would send it \nto a body that is designated under our laws and the Constitution to \ndeal with cases like this. Hundreds and hundreds of cases have been \nforwarded to them--private claims cases.\n  Now, if this amendment offered by the Senators from Nevada, Michigan, \nand Delaware, if it does not pass, if this amendment does not pass, the \nnext thing that will be said is that the Senate approved the payment of \n$500,000 to Billy Ray Dale. The fact of the matter is that the right \nway to handle this is not in the political arena, where people are \ncrowing over what was done or not done. The fact is, it should be \nreferred to the Court of Claims, and let this body decide this disputed \nfactual case on the facts and on the money.\n  We are given $500,000, or $499,999 to approve this. This is the \ndispute, the amount of money. And there is a dispute whether he is \nentitled to it and whether he is entitled to the amount of money \nrequested.\n  We have done, I think, the honorable thing. We have come before this \nbody, as many have suggested, in an outright denial in the amendment of \ngiving him this money. We have done it, we think, in a reasonable \nmanner, and we have an independent third party determine whether or not \nthis money should be paid to Billy Ray Dale and, if so, how much should \nbe paid.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes remaining, and the \nother side has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me just say a few words, and then I \nwill again yield the floor. I would like not to use all of my time, if \nmy colleagues are willing to yield back.\n  The distinguished Senator from Michigan has repeatedly stated time \nand time again that Mr. Dale put money into his own account. No one \ndisputes that. That is the way it was done through the years, and there \nwas nothing illegal about doing that, either. The White House Travel \nOffice is run for the benefit of the White House and the media. As part \nof that job, Mr. Dale had to have access to funds on short notice. No \none has complained about that fact. Most importantly, the media did not \ncare that Mr. Dale put their money, the media's money, into his \naccount.\n  However, Mr. Dale does deny, and the jury agreed, that he did not \nsteal or convert that money or those funds, and was found not guilty of \nthe charges that were levied against him. In fact, one of the \ndistinguished members of the media testified for him, Sam Donaldson, \none of the most well-known people in the press today, a person for whom \nI have a lot of respect.\n  The fact of the matter is that the Justice Department can indict \nanybody they want to. Grand juries generally do what the prosecutors \ntell them to do.\n\n[[Page S10317]]\n\n That is no big deal. I find it unconscionable that after having been \ntried, having incurred legal expenses of half a million dollars, and \nthen having a jury of his peers acquit him that my colleagues here on \nthe Senate floor are suggesting that they think Mr. Dale is still \nguilty.\n  I do not find that in good form. Frankly, it really is a sin, \nespecially when you go to the real facts of how this man and his \npartners, his colleagues in the Travel Office, were screwed by the \nWhite House, for greedy purposes, by people who just got the White \nHouse, thought they had total power, and wanted to move their friends \ninto the lucrative Travel Office business. I am specifically speaking \nof Mr. and Mrs. Thomasson and a personal relative of the President. Not \nonly did they do that, but they even used White House counsel to \nintimidate the FBI in this matter. They did an inadequate accounting in \nthis matter. It was anything to get rid of these people so they could \nput their cronies into this lucrative position.\n  These people had served the White House for years, various \nPresidents, and had done so with the respect of all prior White Houses. \nThe White House itself, in the memo I read earlier, found in the \nmaterial sent by the White House, said they had messed this up, and \nthey had acted improperly.\n  This is from the White House:\n\n       You all may dimly remember the Travel Office affair, in \n     which a number of the White House staff--many immature and \n     self-promoting--took impulsive and foolhardy actions to root \n     out problems at the beginning of the Clinton administration \n     and to then gallantly recommend that they take over its \n     operation.\n\n  That was straight out of a document provided by the White House.\n  The fact is that I don't think anybody who looks at this fairly could \ndeny that these people deserve to be treated fairly. This is a question \nof fairness. It is a question of justice. It is a question of making \namends for a White House that acted improperly, and did so, for the \nmost part based on personal greed.\n  To clarify the record, I have done some investigation in the interim \nperiod here. I want to discuss, for a minute, the exposure of the plea \nagreement and the prosecution memo. I believe these are the accurate \nfacts. We have checked with the parties concerned. The White House \ncalled us and said they were not responsible. I don't want to accuse \nthe White House. I just said it has to be the Justice Department or the \nWhite House, one or the other. That is all it could be. In fact, the \nplea agreement was leaked from the Department of Justice or the White \nHouse to U.S. News and World Report. In addition, the Department of \nJustice, when they did produce that document to Chairman Clinger's \ncommittee, failed, in violation of their own regulations, to treat that \ndocument in a sensitive and confidential manner. The second document, \nthe prosecution memorandum, was produced after the trial to the House \nof Representatives. Once again, someone on the Democrat side of the \nHouse of Representatives leaked this very confidential memo. Once \nagain, it is my contention that this Administration and their friends \nin Congress would do anything to harass Mr. Dale.\n  It is hypocritical. It is hypocritical for the White House to take \ncare of their own people and not be willing to right this wrong. I \ncan't imagine anybody who looks at the facts, clearly, coming to any \nother conclusion other than that this is an injustice to these people, \na terrible ordeal to Mr. Dale and his family, and it ought to be \nrectified. That is what the Congress is trying to do at this point. \nThat is certainly what I am trying to do. I think that is what any \nfair-minded person would try to do.\n  To come in here and make a case that they don't believe that Mr. Dale \nwas innocent, after he was proven innocent, after a jury of his peers \nfound him to be innocent, after members of the media, whose money was \ninvolved, testified he was innocent, is pretty astounding to me. Once \nagain, I oppose the motion of the Senator from Nevada to strike the \nlanguage to reimburse the legal expenses of the seven White House \nTravel Office employees who were victimized by the Clinton \nadministration for nothing more than political favoritism.\n  The only crime that Mr. Dale and his colleagues committed was having \nthe bad fortune of holding a job which political cronies of the White \nHouse wanted. The politicization of the Department of Justice and the \nFBI in bringing numerous investigations, and finally a bogus \nprosecution against Mr. Dale, is unconscionable and it should not be \ntolerated. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that such \na payment is unprecedented, in response to which, I say, the \ncircumstances by which Billy Dale was persecuted and smeared, and the \nothers fired, is unprecedented. It deserves unprecedented treatment and \nresolution. And it should be treated as such. This is a meritorious \ncase. If I have ever seen one, this is one. What was done to these \npeople should never have occurred in this manner. House Republicans and \nHouse Democrats recognize this fact. Why can't Senate Republicans and \nSenate Democrats recognize this fact? I think everybody in this body \nreally knows this to be the fact. If we in Congress are to reimburse \nlegal fees on a case-by-case basis when the case merits it, then that \nis a good thing. I have never seen a case more worthy than this \nparticular case.\n  Now, there is no reason to go to the court of claims in this matter. \nLet's just do what is right. There is no doubt in my mind that part of \nthe reason why our colleagues on the other side want the court of \nclaims to decide this matter is so they get it beyond the election. \nFrankly, this should not involve the election. This is doing what is \nright. If I were the President, I would say, if you could get rid of \nthis, do what's right, pass the bill, and let it be forgotten.\n  But I will tell you some people who are never going to forget this, \neven if this bill passes and the President signs it into law, and that \nis Billy Dale and the people with him. No amount of reimbursement of \nattorney fees, no amount of compensation, no amount of money, \ncompensatory, punitive, or otherwise, will make up for what they have \nbeen through. I can tell you right now that Billy Dale undoubtedly has \nlost 8 or 10 years of his life because of this ordeal, and so would \nanybody in this body.\n  I want you to know that if we have any self-respect at all, this body \nwill do what is right here. I am asking my colleagues to do what's \nright here. I hope there are some on the other side that will see their \nway clear to do what's right in this matter. That is what I ask.\n  If my colleagues are prepared to yield back their time, I will yield \nback mine.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will reserve the balance of my time then.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Nevada yield 2 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have a couple of quick comments. First of \nall, I believe I heard the Senator from Utah, some minutes back, say \nthat the Justice Department leaked the prosecution memo. I now ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the \nJustice Department to Representative William Clinger, saying that the \nonly reason they are presenting this prosecution memo, as \nRepresentative Clinger was insisting upon, is because they were \nthreatening the Attorney General with contempt, unless that prosecution \nmemo was provided to the House committee.\n  So this was not a memo that was provided to anybody willingly, as far \nas I know, by the Justice Department. This was a memo that was \nsubpoenaed and obtained upon threat of contempt of the Attorney General \nherself.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the Department of \nJustice, not from the White House, to Representative Clinger, dated May \n8, saying that they were now enclosing this, despite their very strong \nreluctance to do so, and it was all set forth in this letter, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. What I said was that somebody from either the Justice \nDepartment or White House leaked it to the U.S. News & World Report \nbefore Chairman Clinger asked for this material.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I don't know what the basis of the Senator's statement \nis--\n\n[[Page S10318]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. The U.S. News & World Report.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The basis of the Senator's statement 10 minutes ago that \nthe Justice Department leaked this, it seems to me, is not established \nby any factual evidence that he has provided.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, the point I was making is this. \nAlthough Representative Clinger had a right to ask for it, I am not \nsure they should have given it to him. But they did. But at least \nbefore they gave it to him, somebody leaked it to U.S. News & World \nReport. That somebody had to be somebody in the Justice Department or \nthe White House, which were the only two bodies who could possibly have \nhad it. The White House called me, and, in all fairness to them, they \nsaid it wasn't them.\n  So it had to be. If it was not them, the Justice Department, or \nsomebody who got into the Justice Department, stole it. I do not think \nthat is possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 1996.\n     Hon. William F. Clinger, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, House \n         of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Based upon my conversation with Barbara \n     Olson this morning, we understand that the Attorney General \n     will be removed from the Committee's contempt proceedings \n     agenda as a result of our providing the enclosed documents.\n       The enclosed documents are the prosecution memorandum for \n     Billy Ray Dale and a related prosecutorial decisionmaking \n     document plus two declination memoranda concerning decisions \n     not to bring criminal charges against other individuals. As \n     our February 26th letter explained other individuals. As our \n     February 26th letter explained, extremely sensitive criminal \n     justice documents of this kind are made available outside the \n     Department only under the most extraordinary circumstances. \n     We made these particular documents available for committee \n     review only as a result of the Committee's subpoena; we \n     brought them to the Committee's offices for review three \n     times and advised the staff that we would return with them as \n     often as necessary to accommodate the Committee's oversight \n     needs.\n       We would prefer to continue to provide these core \n     deliberative documents to the Committee on that basis. In \n     light of the Committee's announced intention to hold the \n     Attorney General of the United States in contempt of \n     Congress, we are forwarding these documents to you. In doing \n     so, we do not intend to prejudice in any way the Department's \n     response to any future requests from the Committee or any \n     other congressional committee.\n       We are very concerned that the public disclosure of this \n     deliberative process and attorney work product material might \n     inhibit the candor of our internal deliberations. We have \n     requested and Committee staff have agreed that access to \n     these types of documents will be limited to Members and \n     Committee staff and that the Committee will not disclose the \n     documents outside the Committee without first affording the \n     Department an opportunity to confer with staff further about \n     our concerns regarding such disclosure. We reiterate that \n     request as to these documents and, further, urge the \n     Committee to limit access to Committee staff only and make no \n     copies.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Andrew Fois,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The document in question had been brought to the \ncommittees, and I am now here quoting the letter, prior to its being \ndelivered pursuant to the threat of contempt of the Attorney General, \nthat these documents, according to the letter, were made ``available \nfor committee review only as a result of the committee's subpoena; we \nbrought them to the committee's offices for review three times and \nadvised the staff that we would return with them as often as necessary \nto accommodate the committee's oversight needs. We would prefer to \ncontinue to provide these core deliberative documents to the committee \non that basis.''\n  But then they go on to say, ``In light of the committee's announced \nintention to hold the Attorney General of the United States in contempt \nof Congress, we are forwarding these documents to you.''\n  They have previously shared the document with Members three times. So \nto attribute leaks to any particular source without evidence under \nthese circumstances, it seems to me, is without foundation.\n  No. 2, I may have misheard the Senator from Utah on this. I may have \nmisheard the Senator from Utah on another point. If I did, then I would \nstand corrected. I believe, however, that the Senator from Utah said \nthat he had deposited checks that belonged to the Travel Office for 30 \nyears in his own account.\n  Mr. HATCH. No, I didn't say that. I said he had been depositing some \nof the checks of the media.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That this was done regularly.\n  Mr. HATCH. It was done regularly for years.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No one knew it.\n  Mr. HATCH. The people there knew it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Oh, no. May I make this very clear? No one knew that he \nwas depositing checks in his own personal checking account.\n  Mr. HATCH. The media has never objected. The point I was making is \nthe media, when they knew about it, never objected--never objected at \nany time. And, in fact, one major representative of the media \ntestified--\n  Mr. LEVIN. His colleagues did not know. The FBI was not informed when \nthey were investigating the practices in the office. Peat Marwick, when \nthey looked at this, were not informed by him that he had done this.\n  So the point that that practice being somehow or other appropriate \nbecause it had been going on for a long time, it seems to me, begs the \nquestion.\n  Finally, I would urge my friend from Utah to test this course of \naction. He said that he cannot imagine anyone coming to any other \nconclusion than the one that he has come to, that there was an \ninjustice for these people. Again, I urge him to test that hypothesis \nby doing what we do regularly with private bills, which is to refer \nthem to the Court of Claims. This will be the only defendant in history \nlegally indicted whose legal fees will be paid. It will be the only \ndefendant whose legal fees will have been paid who was properly \nindicted.\n  The Senator from Utah feels, with great certainty under his \nhypothesis, that no one else can come to any other conclusion that an \ninjustice was done here should be tested by doing what we have done \nwith private bills over and over and over again. This would be the \nexception to a rule that we do not pay legal fees to people properly \nindicted.\n  Test the hypothesis, Senator. Send this claim to the Court of \nAppeals. And, if you are right, that they find, and that any reasonable \nperson would find, that there was an inequity here, in fact, not only \nwill the fees be paid, but they should be paid. But that should be done \nby an objective person, an objective party, an objective institution, \nthe Court of Claims, and not by this body 2 months before an election \nin the heat of a political campaign.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, because the question has been raised from \nthe trial transcript at pages 129 and 130, Dale admitted that he didn't \ntell anyone else at the Travel Office that he was putting these checks \ninto his own account and not the Travel Office account. He admitted \nthat he didn't even tell the individual he worked with in the Travel \nOffice for 30 years, his chief assistant, Gary Wright, of this \npractice.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will take a couple of minutes, Mr. President.\n  For the record, in the House interview with the Peat Marwick \nrepresentative that was so mightily represented here, the Peat Marwick \nrepresentative said that this case, meaning the White House Travel \nOffice audit, was the only one he has been involved in where he was \ntold the outcome before the investigation was completed.\n  This was a trumped-up case against decent people, and even though \neverybody admits that it would have been better for Mr. Dale to not \nhave put the money in his account, that it was a mistake to do that, \nnevertheless, nobody that I know of accuses him of having taken that \nmoney for his own use. In fact, to the contrary, the testimony in the \ntrial, and that which resulted in his acquittal, was that he used the \nmoney properly, that he had to have access to it to be able to solve \nthe problems with the media.\n  So I think it is really overreaching to try to say because a person \nis indicted, that an injustice could not have occurred. I can give a \nlot of cases where\n\n[[Page S10319]]\n\npeople have been unjustly indicted. This is one of them. This is an \nexceptional case. It ought to be treated exceptionally.\n  The fact of the matter is that the White House was trying to please \nfour people, Harry Thomasson and his wife, Linda, Catherine, Cornelius, \nand Clerissa Cerda. The David Watkins memo makes that clear. I do not \nthink anybody could read that memo and then fail to get outraged by the \nway these people were treated.\n  Finally, just to make the Record clear, the plea agreement was leaked \nby someone in the Justice Department, or the White House, to U.S. News \n& World Report. The prosecution memo was provided to Chairman Clinger, \nwho shared it with his minority counterparts, and somebody on the \nminority staff gave it to the media. The plea agreement had to be \nleaked by either the White House or the Justice Department. I am \nwilling to take the White House word that they did not do that. Then, \nit had to be somebody in the Justice Department who did, because they \nare the only other people who had access to it. And it was improper. It \nwas wrong. It was unethical.\n  But be that as it may, that does not change the facts of this case \nthat these were decent people who had served successive Presidencies, \nwho had decent reputations, who did their job well and who pleased both \nthe White House and the media, who were just plain mistreated, \nunjustly, by a superaggressive White House that was acting in its own \ngreedy interests. And if there is ever a case where we ought to stand \nup and say this is an exceptional situation, we ought to provide this \nexceptional remedy, this is the case to do it in.\n  So I am asking my colleagues to vote for the Hatch amendment, which \nwould grant these funds, and to vote down the Reid-Levin amendment, \nwhich would again force this man to get attorneys and go to the Court \nof Claims to get that which is justly his to begin with. That is what \nyou call justice in America: making wrongs right.\n  Having said all of that, I understand I still have some time. So I \nyield the remainder of my time, and I do not want to keep my colleagues \nany longer than I have to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n\n         Live Animal Holding Facility at Boise State University\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the Chairman a \nprocess that has been initiated between the General Services \nAdministration [GSA] and several Federal, State and local agencies, of \nwhich the Appropriations Committee would want to take cognizance. This \nprocess concerns the feasibility of designing and constructing a live \nanimal research and holding facility at Boise State University.\n  The facility would be used for basic and applied ecological research, \nproviding biological information and related technical support to \nnatural resource managers and policymakers, and education and \ninformation transfer. It would directly serve the Raptor Research \nCenter at Boise State University.\n  A first meeting has been held between GSA representatives and some of \nthe agencies that will use the proposed facility, including the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, the \nPeregrine Fund, and Boise State University, which would be the site of \nthe facility. GSA believes this is the kind of project that falls \nwithin its purview and is something that may be beneficial to \nundertake.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senator from Idaho for providing this \ninformation and would ask what are the goals of this process at this \ntime?\n  Mr. CRAIG. The discussions currently underway are preliminary and \nshould lead to a determination of whether to initiate a formal \nfeasibility study.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Does the Senator foresee any costs associated with these \npreliminary steps?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No. These initial contacts are necessary to determine if \nthe project can and should be pursued by GSA and other agencies \ninvolved.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senator for this information and assure him \nthe committee will follow the outcome of these meetings with interest. \nSuch activities would be under this subcommittee's jurisdiction and we \nwill want to continue to monitor any progress on this project and keep \nit under consideration for the future.\n\n\n                         regulatory accounting\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to address the regulatory \naccounting provision in section 645 of the Treasury-postal \nappropriations bill, H.R. 3756. I believe the public has the right to \nknow the benefits of Federal regulatory programs, as well as their \ncosts, which have been estimated to be $600 billion per year.\n  To address concerns raised by Senators Glenn and Levin, I made \ntechnical changes. First, subsection 645(a)(1) requires OMB to provide \nestimates of the total annual costs and benefits of Federal regulatory \nprograms in the upcoming fiscal year. This includes impacts from rules \nissued before fiscal year 1997, not just new rules. But OMB need not \nassess costs and benefits realized in preceding years. I deleted the \nword ``cumulative'' to clarify that. OMB should use the valuable \ninformation already available, and supplement it where needed. Where \nagencies have, or can produce, detailed information on the costs and \nbenefits of individual programs, they should use it. I expect a rule of \nreason will prevail: Where the agencies can produce detail that will be \ninformative to the Congress and the public, they should do so. Where it \nis extremely burdensome to provide such detail, broader estimates \nshould suffice.\n  Subsection 645(a)(3) requires OMB to assess the direct and indirect \nimpacts of Federal rules on the private sector, State and local \ngovernment, and the Federal Government. Beyond compliance costs, \nregulation also creates a drag on real wages, economic growth, and \nproductivity. OMB should use available information, where relevant, to \nassess the direct and indirect impacts of Federal rules. OMB also \nshould discuss the serious problem of unfunded Federal mandates and \ninform Congress what it is doing about the problem.\n  In the end, I expect OMB to produce a credible and reliable picture \nof the regulatory process--a picture that highlights the costs and \nbenefits of regulatory programs and that allows Congress to determine \nwhich programs and program elements are working well, and which are \nnot.\n\n\n                    erie federal courthouse project\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to address the issue of \nfunding for the Erie Federal Complex construction project, which \nincludes a courthouse annex. The current courthouse provides inadequate \nspace and is not consolidated at a single location. The new facility \nwill accommodate the existing and anticipated future demands of the \ncourts and will allow for the consolidation of the courts in one \nconvenient location. The House bill for fiscal year 1997 provides the \n$3.3 million required for site acquisition and design work, as \nrequested by the General Services Administration. I am troubled, \nhowever, that the Senate bill does not include funding for the Erie \nFederal Complex.\n  I join with my constituents in Erie in recognizing the importance of \nthis project to the community and support funding the Erie project in \nfiscal year 1997. This project is duly authorized. Further, $3.135 \nmillion for site acquisition and design was contained in both the House \nand Senate versions of the fiscal year 1995 Treasury, postal \nappropriations bill, but was dropped in conference that year because of \nan internal House decision to defund certain projects which I am \nadvised was not based on the merits of the proposed Erie project.\n  I would ask the distinguished Chairman, my good friend from Alabama, \nfor his views on the Erie project and whether he believes it merits \nfavorable consideration during conference.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for his comments \nin support of the Federal Complex project, which will benefit the \nadministration of justice in Erie, PA. I regret that the Senate funding \nlevels are constrained and that it has been difficult to identify funds \nfor a number of worthwhile courthouse projects. As we proceed to \nconference with the House, I intend to work closely with the senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania to obtain funds for site acquisition and \ndesign, as requested by the Administration. The Erie project has been \napproved for funds by the Senate in previous legislation and thus \ndeserves our best efforts.\n\n[[Page S10320]]\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would ask for just a few moments to \ndiscuss my amendment, which the Senate unanimously adopted during \nyesterday's debate. First, let me thank Senators Shelby and Kerrey for \ntheir support and hard work in crafting the Treasury-postal \nappropriations legislation before us.\n  My amendment, which expresses the sense of the Congress, relates to \nthe Internal Revenue Service telephone assistance program, one which \nthe IRS advertises as a first line of assistance to the American \ntaxpayer. I am pleased that it is now included in this bill because \nwhen it comes to telephone assistance, the IRS customer service record \nis abysmal. In fact, it's an embarrassment.\n  In fiscal year 1995, IRS assistors reportedly answered 38 percent of \ntaxpayers' calls. In fiscal year 1996, the figure improved slightly, \nbut still only 46 percent of taxpayers got through to IRS assistance \npersonnel. In other words, currently, less than half of the taxpayers \nin need of help even get through to an IRS assistor, and that may be \nafter trying once or trying 10 times. In terms of pure accessibility, \nthe statistics are even more startling. During the fiscal year 1996 \nfiling season, a mere 20 percent of taxpayers got through to an IRS \nassistor on their first try.\n  As many of my colleagues know, before coming to the United States \nSenate, I ran a business. And if there's one simple bit of wisdom \nlearned from my years in business, and practiced to the best of my \nability, it is that the customer always comes first. In adopting my \namendment, I am pleased that the Senate has spoken with one voice in \nsending that same message to the IRS--take whatever steps necessary to \nput your customers, the taxpayers of this country, first.\n  I would add that I know customer service is of great concern to the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, who cochairs \nthe National Commission to Restructure the Internal Revenue Service. I \nhope that we can continue to work together on this issue when the \nCommission reports to Congress next July.\n  Mr. President, each year Americans in all walks of life and from \nevery income bracket encounter questions when filling out tax forms and \ncalculating tax obligations. And since few people dispute the \nchallenges of navigating the current tax code, it comes as no surprise \nthat many Americans seek help in order to fulfill their civic duty \nresponsibly and accurately. The IRS' toll free 1-800 assistance service \nwould seem a logical first step. But the IRS, on the receiving end, if \nyou will, picks up the line less than half the time. Thus, the majority \nof callers do not even have the opportunity to pose, let alone work \nout, their questions.\n  This fact is troubling, very troubling, particularly when considered \nin light of other problems. For example, many constituents in my \nhomestate of Wisconsin who have the good fortune, or should I say the \ngood luck, to get through to IRS assistors, have then been put on hold \nand subjected to significant waits that have sometimes ended with a \nrandom and inexplicable disconnection of the line.\n  Simply put, this level of service is unacceptable. And in the end, \nit's not unreasonable to speculate that it works against our overall \nefforts to streamline the government. After all, if taxpayer questions \nare not being answered, more mistakes are being made and more IRS \nfollow-up and investigation is required.\n  The IRS is aware of the problems. The General Accounting Office has \nissued reports. The Social Security Administration and private sector \ninterests provide numerous examples of ways to improve telephone \nassistance. And now Congress has made the first of what may be many \ncalls to the IRS, urging them to establish performance goals, operating \nstandards and management practices--whatever it takes to get the lines \nanswered and put the customer first.\n\n\n                   ATF ``Disability Relief'' Program\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I say to Senator Lautenberg, I would like \nto raise an issue of great importance. The current version of this \nappropriations bill would not fund the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms' [ATF] disability relief program. Under current Federal law, \nsomeone who has been convicted of a crime punishable by more than 1 \nyear is ineligible, or disabled, from possessing a firearm--a sensible \nidea. However, Congress created a loophole in 1965 whereby convicted \nfelons could apply to ATF to have their firearm privileges restored, at \nan estimated taxpayer cost of $10,000 per waiver granted.\n  We have fought to end this program and have succeeded in stripping \nthe program's funding in annual appropriations bills since 1992.\n  This year, we face an additional challenge in our efforts to keep \nguns out of the hands of convicted felons. A recent court case in \nPennsylvania has misinterpreted our intentions and opened the door for \nthese convicted felons to apply for judicial review of their disability \nrelief applications.\n  In this case, Rice versus United States, the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals found that the current funding prohibition does not make clear \ncongressional intent to bar all avenues of relief for convicted felons. \nBy their reasoning, since ATF is unable to consider applications for \nrelief, felons are entitled to ask the courts to review their \napplications.\n  This misguided decision could flood the courts with felons seeking \nthe restoration of their gun rights, effectively shifting from ATF to \nthe courts the burden of considering these applications. Instead of \nwasting taxpayer money and the time of ATF agents--which could be much \nbetter spent on important law enforcement efforts, such as the \ninvestigation of church arsons--we would now be wasting court resources \nand distracting the courts from consideration of serious criminal \ncases.\n\n  Fortunately, another decision by the fifth circuit in U.S. versus \nMcGill found that congressional intent to prohibit any Federal relief--\neither through ATF or the courts--is clear. The fifth circuit concluded \nthat convicted felons are therefore not eligible for judicial review of \ntheir relief applications.\n  Given this conflict in the circuit courts, we should clarify our \noriginal and sustaining intention. The goal of this provision has \nalways been to prohibit convicted felons from getting their guns back--\nwhether through ATF or the courts. It was never our intention to shift \nthe burden to the courts.\n  Congressman Durbin and his colleagues succeeded in their efforts to \ninclude language in the House appropriations bill to make clear that \nconvicted felons may not use the courts in their efforts to get their \nguns back. I applaud the House committee for its wise vote on this \nissue.\n  During the same markup, Congressman Durbin's efforts were undermined \nby a related exemption offered by Congressman Obey. This exemption \nwould allow those individuals convicted of nonviolent felonies the \nability to appeal for judicial review of their relief application.\n  According to Congressman Obey's amendment, the opportunity to appeal \nto the courts would be closed to those ``felons convicted of violent \ncrimes, firearms violations, or drug-related crimes.'' All other felons \nwould be allowed to apply to the courts for review of their relief \napplications.\n  Mr. Obey's exemption is clearly inconsistent with the original intent \nof this provision for three simple reasons:\n  First, one need only consider people like Al Capone and countless \nother violent criminals who were convicted of lesser, nonviolent \nfelonies, to understand how dangerous this ``Capone amendment'' will be \nto public safety. Our intent when we first passed this provision--and \nevery year thereafter--has been to prohibit anyone who was convicted of \na crime punishable by more than 1 year from restoring their gun \nprivileges via the ATF procedure or a judicial review.\n  Second, as Dewey Stokes, the former President of the Fraternal Order \nof Police noted, most criminals do not commit murder as their \nfirst crime. Rather, most criminals start by committing non-violent \ncrimes which escalate into violent crimes. An ATF analysis shows that \nbetween 1985 and 1992, 69 non-violent felons were granted firearms \nrelief and subsequently re-arrested for violent crimes such as \nattempted murder, first degree sexual assault, child molestation, \nkidnaping/abduction, and drug trafficking.\n\n[[Page S10321]]\n\n  Third, there is no reason in the world for the taxpayers' money and \ncourt resources to be wasted by allowing the review of any convicted \nfelons' application to get their guns back. It made no sense for ATF to \ntake agents away from their important law enforcement work, and it \nmakes even less sense for the courts, which have no experience or \nexpertise in this area, to be burdened with this unnecessary job. Let \nme make this point perfectly clear: It was never our intent, nor is it \nnow, for the courts to review a convicted felon's application for \nfirearm privilege restoration.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator for clearly laying out the facts. \nAs the coauthor of this provision, I share his interest and concern \nabout this issue. I agree with his analysis completely and intend to \nclosely follow this situation in the coming year to see if any further \nlegislation is necessary to clarify our intent. I would also like to \ntake this opportunity to let my colleague know how much I enjoyed \nworking on this issue with him as well as so many other matters. I want \nto ensure him that although he will not be here next year to continue \nhis work in the Senate on this matter, I fully intend to carry on the \nfight for us both.\n\n\n                 flexibility for telecommuting centers\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in an effort to meet the changing needs of \nthe Federal work force, I rise in support of a provision contained in \nthe Treasury postal appropriations bill which authorizes the General \nServices Administration to begin work on a series of flexiplace work \ntelecommuting centers.\n  Currently, many Federal employees from both the legislative and \nexecutive branches are enjoying the convenience and efficiency of six \ncompleted telecommuting centers located throughout the Metropolitan \nWashington, DC area.\n  While Federal employees enjoy the advantages of working at these \ntelecommuting centers, their employer, the Federal Government, reaps \nthe benefits of increased productivity and improved work quality.\n  As the Senate accepts the important responsibility to reign in \nFederal spending and control our Federal debt, we surely realize that \nthese telecommuting centers must be economically self-supporting or \nthey will not succeed.\n  For that reason, I, along with my friend in the House of \nRepresentatives, Congressman Frank Wolf, have asked our respective \nAppropriations Committees to insert language granting much needed \nflexibility to the General Services Administration in regard to \ntelecommuting centers.\n  In order to maintain these centers as self-sufficient entities, the \nCongress must allow non-Federal employees to fill any vacant slots in \nthe telecommuting centers. Currently, Federal employees cannot fill all \nof the slots all of the time, so it only makes sense to allow non-\nFederal employees utilize these facilities and increase the revenue \ngoing to these important centers.\n  This legislation also permits the Administrator of General Services \nAdministration to transfer control of any or all of the telecommuting \ncenters to State, local, or nonprofit organizations. This step will \nfurther ensure the economic viability of these telecommuting centers.\n  While maintaining the necessary commitments to our Federal work \nforce, this language will provide the necessary flexibility to let \nthese telecommuting centers thrive and prosper without Federal \nmicromanagement and increased Government spending.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/11/senate-section/article/S10285-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, on Sunday, August 11, 1996, the Zion No. \n1, Missionary Baptist Church celebrated its 126th anniversary. Zion No. \n1 was formed in 1870, only a few miles from its present location in \nBarton, AL. It is one of the oldest in the State of Alabama.\n  Arthur Barton, a white landowner, donated the land for this church as \na gift to its organizers, who had a phenomenal zeal for worshipping \nGod. The church they built stood for many years. A second building, \nhome of the Pine Grove Methodist Episcopal Church, located on a hill \njust off Highway 72 in west Colbert County, was purchased from the \nMethodist Conference by the small Zion No. 1 congregation in 1891 for \n$300.\n  This church building was held together by wooden pegs. It is reported \nthat there are no nails in the building. Kerosene or coal oil lamps \nwere used for light. Two enormous pillars were visible in the center of \nthe sanctuary running from the floor to the ceiling. These are still in \nplace today.\n  During the Civil War, the Pine Grove Methodist Episcopal Church \nbuilding had been used as a temporary hospital for wounded soldiers. It \nis said that two cannon balls were found in the walls as a result of a \nbattle which took place between the town of Barton and the Tennessee \nRiver. There were blood stains on the floor and on portions of its \nbaseboards and gunshot holes were visible in the walls. The basic \nstructure which exists today remains largely as it was when it was \nconstructed before the Civil War. Subsequent renovations have hidden \nevidence that it was once a hospital and church for wounded Confederate \nsoldiers.\n  In 1969, brick was added, as well as new fixtures, carpeting, and a \npublic address system. In 1977, a new roof was added, carpeting was \nlaid in the educational annex, and folding doors were added.\n  The years between 1978 and 1986 were a time of rapid growth for Zion \nNo. 1, Missionary Baptist Church. The congregation purchased three \nacres of land to expand the cemetery, and the central heating system \nwas installed. A second educational annex, which includes a baptismal \npool, was constructed. Previously, the Tennessee River had been used \nfor baptizing new members.\n  The Reverend Wayne S. Bracy became the 16th and current pastor on \nFebruary 8, 1992. He has brought a fervent spiritual atmosphere and a \ncommitment to teaching and training to Zion No. 1.\n  I am pleased to congratulate the Zion No. 1, Missionary Baptist \nChurch on the occasion of its 126th anniversary.\n\n[[Page S10322]]\n\n Its rich heritage and dedicated leaders and members are testaments to \nthe tremendous role religion continues to play in America's culture and \ndevelopment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/11/senate-section/article/S10321-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SHERIFF JOHN L. ALDRIDGE\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, my long-time friend, Sheriff John L. \nAldridge, is one of the giants of law enforcement in the State of \nAlabama. He has spent over 30 years in law enforcement and is presently \nserving his sixth term as sheriff of Colbert County, AL, having first \nbeen elected in 1975. He was the commissioner of public safety for the \ncity of Tuscumbia from 1960 through 1969. He is a loyal and dedicated \npublic servant whose service and commitment to law enforcement in \ngeneral and his community in particular have been impeccable.\n  Sheriff Aldridge received his bachelor of science degree in law \nenforcement from the University of North Alabama. He is a past \npresident of the Alabama Sheriff's Association and is a member of the \nboard of trustees of the Alabama Sheriff's Boys-Girls Ranches. He has \nreceived many honors and awards, including County Officer of the Year \nfrom the Sheffield Elks' Lodge and the Colbert County American Legion. \nHe is a past State Officer of the Year and Officer of the Year for \nColbert, Lauderdale, and Franklin Counties. In 1977, he received the \nLiberty Bell Award from the Colbert County Bar Association. Under \nformer Governor George Wallace, he served on the executive board of the \nAlabama Law Enforcement Agency.\n  He is also a past president of the Lions Club and past commander of \nAmerican Legion Post 31. He is a Mason and first vice president of the \nSheffield, Alabama Kiwanis Club, as well as a former member of the \nTuscumbia Utility Board and of the Colbert County Hospital Board. He \nserved for a time as a board member of the Colbert-Lauderdale Attention \nHome for Delinquent Boys and Girls.\n  He is a loyal Democrat whose enthusiasm for the party has never \nwavered. In 1992, he served on the Steering Committee for the Clinton-\nGore Campaign. He strongly endorsed the ticket that year and, although \nthe Democrats did not carry Alabama, campaigned tirelessly for his \nparty's candidates.\n  Sheriff Aldridge's leadership and service have gone far beyond what \nwe traditionally think of as law enforcement duties. He initiated a \nrape counseling program for the Muscle Shoals Mental Health Center to \nassure victims of rape were interviewed by a female professional \ncounselor rather than a male. When the program was begun, there were no \nfemale officers in law enforcement in Colbert County. Sheriff Aldridge \nmade a firm commitment to change this. He received an award from the \nMuscle Shoals Mental Health Center for initiating this program.\n  Under his tenure as chairman of the Sheffield Kiwanis Club Major \nEmphasis Program on ``Safeguard Against Crime,'' the club received the \nSilver Bell Award for his work in organizing a county-wide program \naimed at reducing crime and spurring public interest in law \nenforcement.\n  I am proud to commend and congratulate Sheriff John Aldridge for his \nmany years of outstanding leadership in terms of law enforcement and \ncommunity service. I look forward to seeing more of the fruits of his \nlabors first-hand when I return home to Colbert County next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/11/senate-section/article/S10322-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GREATER RECOGNITION FOR TAIWAN\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to recognize the \nachievements and contributions of one of Massachusetts' most beloved \nsports personalities, Mr. Cam Neely of the Boston Bruins.\n  Last week, Cam announced his retirement from the Boston Bruins after \n5 years of struggle and pain caused by nagging injuries. He had played \n13 years in the National Hockey League, 3 with the Vancouver Canucks \nand the last 10 seasons with the Bruins. Through his decade with the \nBruins, Cam has become the prototype NHL power forward by combining \nbone-crushing power with overwhelming talent and grace.\n  In addition to his presence on the ice, he has made a continuing \ncontribution\n\n[[Page S10323]]\n\nto the community off the ice by establishing the Cam Neely Foundation \nand planning the Neely House, which will provide a place to stay in \nBoston for families of cancer patients undergoing treatment at area \nhospitals.\n  Throughout his career, Cam Neely rose to the challenge of being a top \ntier player in the NHL, setting records, redefining his position, and \nsetting the standard by which forwards in the NHL are measured today. \nHe played with courage and finesse. His career is a string of highlight \nfilms peppered with accomplishments and awards. In his first season \nwith the Bruins, he was awarded the coveted Seventh-Player Award which \nis given to the Bruin who makes the most significant sustained \ncontribution to the club over the duration of the season. That same \nseason he led the team in scoring with 36 goals. In 1988, Cam provided \nthe spark that lit the fire behind the Bruins' playoff series victory \nover the Montreal Canadiens--the first such victory in 45 years. During \nthe 1989-90 season, Cam became only the fifth Bruin in history to reach \nthe 50 goals mark and in 1990-91 he became only the second Bruin ever \nto reach 50 goals in consecutive seasons, joining the great Phil \nEsposito.\n  Cam was at the height of his talent and skills in the 1991 playoff \nseries against the Pittsburgh Penguins when he suffered an injury that \nwould change his career. The hit resulted in an injury to his thigh \nthat never fully healed. That injury led to another, and then another, \nand the pain never ceased. For 5 years, Cam Neely was the epitome of \nperseverance as he worked to keep his body in shape and prepared to \nplay. He never let up and he never gave up. Every season marked a \ntriumphant return to the ice for Boston's most admired hockey player. \nHe would play in pain until the pain became unbearable. He would play \nwhenever he was needed and his body would allow him. He kept coming \nback, and the Bruins' fans loved him dearly for his efforts.\n  Cam rose above the issues of money and contracts and salary disputes \nand always seemed to be smiling and happy. He played hockey because he \nloved the game and it was part of him. During his announcement last \nweek he said, ``I've always wanted to stay in this game as long as I \ncould [while] achieving results and making positive contributions to my \nteam. I never, ever wanted to play the game for the money or simply to \ngo through the motions. Believe me, I loved playing in the big game. I \nloved the competitiveness of the sport. Since the day I arrived in \nBoston, I gave 100 percent to our team, to my teammates, and our \nfans.''\n  Nobody would argue that fact. Cam worked hard for the Bruins. Even \nhis teammates, opponents, and coaches agree.\n\n  ``There'll be a lot of highlight clips. I'll just remember him \nrunning over people, things like him grabbing the puck and splitting \nthe defense to score against [Patrick] Roy the year we finally beat the \nCanadiens,'' Bruins captain Ray Bourque said. ``And I'll remember \nseeing stars when he ran over me during a Canada Cup practice. It was \nfun to know you had Cam on your side.''\n  ``You know when I realized how great he was?'' asked Don Sweeney, \ndefenseman and long time teammate of Neely's. ``When he was back for a \ngame and then out for a game, then back for a game, then out for a \ngame. The difference when we had him and when we didn't was tremendous. \nThere was a ripple effect he had on every player in that locker room.''\n  Adam Oates, Cam's longtime line mate and the man who with him \ncomprised one of the most feared scoring combinations in the NHL, said \nthat Cam's announcement was ``something that we knew was going to \nhappen all along. And today's the black day that it's happening.''\n  Former Bruin standout Derek Sanderson has always considered Cam Neely \none of the game's best forwards. ``His teammates will miss him, and no \none will miss him more than Oates. Guys like him don't come along very \noften. No one can score like Cam; no one can hit like Cam,'' he said. \n``You can't replace him, you go along without him.''\n  Derek's words echo the feelings of most of the Bruins' faithful. Cam \nNeely cannot be replaced. The team will go on without him. Like Bobby \nOrr, Gord Kluzak, and Normand Leveille, Cam is forced to leave the game \nhe loves too soon, and before the fans are ready to let him go. But for \nevery game, every period, and every shift, I, and every other Bruins \nfan, will look to the right wing and imagine the hulking No. 8 \nstreaking along the boards, taking the puck onto his stick, and blazing \nit past the netminder into the mesh netting of the goal. And, quietly, \nwe will cheer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/11/senate-section/article/S10322-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO HOWELL HEFLIN: MY FRIEND, THE ``JUDGE''\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to \nSenator Howell Heflin, a dear friend and colleague who is retiring from \nthe Senate this year. Senator Heflin and I are classmates, having been \nelected to the Senate at the same time. During the past 18 years, I \nhave had the opportunity to watch my friend from Alabama establish \nhimself as a distinguished leader and statesman. As a U.S. Senator and \nAlabama Supreme Court Justice, he has served his country and his State \nwell. Alabamians should be proud of their country judge.\n  Howell Heflin continues a family tradition of public service. As the \nnephew of U.S. Senator Thomas Heflin, Senator Heflin brought to the \nSenate a bloodline of conviction to America's foundation and potential. \nHis character and background as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme \nCourt have shone brightly during his chairmanship of the Ethics \nCommittee and during his service on the Senate Judiciary Committee. As \na champion of ethics and an independent thinker, it is no wonder \nSenator Heflin still is referred to as the judge by his fellow \nSenators.\n  Mr. President, as a farm State Senator, I salute Howell Heflin's \ncommitment to Alabama agriculture. As chairman of the Senate Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee, I commend him for his work on \nrural electrification. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, \nNutrition, and Forestry Committee, he has fought for the interests of \nAlabama's cotton, peanut, and soybean industries. He also has strived \nfor Federal crop insurance and flood relief for Alabama farmers. \nAlabama farmers and farm families surely will miss his undying \ndedication to their industry.\n\n  Mr. President, one of the toughest jobs for members of Congress \noccurs when we have to vote on legislation that has sparked strong \ndivision within our constituencies. As an infamous storyteller, Senator \nHeflin often relays metaphors that shed light on the difficulty of this \npredicament. For example, Howell Heflin once told us a story about a \nhunter who is caught in a treetop and is being chased by a bobcat. The \nhunter yells to his friend, ``Hurry up and shoot it!'' Unsure of his \naim, his comrade yells back, ``I'm not sure I can hit him. I might hit \nyou!'' In return, the trapped hunter yells, ``Shoot anyway. I need some \nrelief!''\n  Another account of Howell Heflin's lightheartedness was a speech he \ndelivered during a Senate floor discussion regarding the status of the \nrose as the official national flower. As the Senate deliberated whether \nor not to designate the rose as America's flower, Senator Heflin took \nto the floor with a poem. He remarked that, ``Roses are red, violets \nare blue, why must I choose between the two?'' Remarks such as this \nhave provided the members of this body--and his Alabama constituents--\nwith many moments of fond repose over the past 18 years. Senator \nHeflin's sense of humor will be missed dearly.\n  So soon we will bid farewell to our dear friend from Alabama--Howell \nHeflin. My wife, Harriet and I wish Senator Heflin and his lovely wife, \nElizabeth Ann, the very best. They are a wonderful couple, and we will \nmiss them very much. As the 104th Congress draws to a close, they can \nlook forward to being able to return to their home State of Alabama and \nenjoy one of their favorite pastimes: spending time with their \ngrandchildren.

The deposit of the United States \n     instrument of ratification of the Convention shall not be \n     contingent upon the United States providing financial \n     guarantees to pay for implementation of commitments by Russia \n     or any other party to the Convention.\n       (6) Implementation arrangements.--If the Convention does \n     not enter into force or if the Convention comes into force \n     with the United States having ratified the Convention but \n     with Russia having taken no action to ratify or accede to the \n     Convention, then the President shall, if he plans to \n     implement reductions of United States Chemical forces as a \n     matter of national policy or in a manner consistent with the \n     Convention.\n       (A) consult with the Senate regarding the effect of such \n     reductions on the national security of the United States; and\n       (B) take no action to reduce the United States Chemical \n     stockpile at a pace faster than that currently planned and \n     consistent with the Convention until the President submits to \n     the Senate his determination that such reductions are in the \n     national security interests of the United States.\n       (7) Presidential certification and report on national \n     technical means.--Not later than 90 days after the deposit of \n     the United States instrument of ratification of the \n     Convention, the President shall certify that the United \n     States National Technical Means and the provisions of the \n     Convention on verification of compliance, when viewed \n     together, are sufficient to ensure effective verification of \n     compliance with the provisions of the Convention. This \n     certification shall be accompanied by a report, which may be \n     supplemented by a classified annex, indicating how the United \n     States National Technical Means, including collection, \n     processing and analytic resources, will be marshalled, \n     together with the Convention's verification provisions, to \n     ensure effective verification of compliance. Such \n     certification and report shall be submitted to the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations, the Committee on Appropriations, the \n     Committee on Armed Services, and the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate.\n       (c) Declarations.--The advice and consent of the Senate to \n     ratification of the Convention is subject to the following \n     declarations, which express the intent of the Senate:\n       (1) Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the constitutionally based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in Condition \n     (1) of the Resolution of Ratification with respect to the INF \n     Treaty, approved by the Senate on May 27, 1988. For purposes \n     of this declaration, the term ``INF Treaty'' refers to the \n     Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of \n     Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their \n     Intermediate-Range and Shorter Range Missiles, together with \n     the related memorandum of understanding and protocols, \n     approved by the Senate on May 27, 1988.\n       (2) Further arms reduction obligations.--The Senate \n     declares its intention to consider for approval international \n     agreements that would obligate the United States to reduce or \n     limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States in a \n     militarily significant manner only pursuant to the treaty \n     power set forth in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the \n     Constitution.\n       (3) Retaliatory policy.--The Senate declares that the \n     United States should strongly reiterate its retaliatory \n     policy that the use of chemical weapons against United States \n     military forces or civilians would result in an overwhelming \n     and devastating response, which may include the whole range \n     of available weaponry.\n       (4) Chemical defense program.--The Senate declares that \n     ratification of the Convention will not obviate the need for \n     a robust, adequately funded Chemical defense program, \n     together with improved national intelligence capabilities in \n     the nonproliferation area, maintenance of an effective \n     deterrent through capable conventional forces, trade-enabling \n     export controls, and other capabilities. In giving its advice \n     and consent to ratification of the Convention, the Senate \n     does so with full appreciation that the entry into force of \n     the Convention enhances the responsibility of the Senate to \n     ensure that the United States continues an effective and \n     adequately funded Chemical defense program. The Senate \n     further declares that the United States should continue to \n     develop theater missile defense to intercept ballistic \n     missiles that might carry Chemical weapons and should enhance \n     defenses of the United States Armed Forces against the use of \n     chemical weapons in the field.\n       (5) Enforcement policy.--The Senate urges the President to \n     pursue compliance questions under the Convention vigorously \n     and to seek international sanctions if a party to the \n     Convention does not comply with the Convention, including the \n     ``obligation to make every reasonable effort to demonstrate \n     its compliance with this Convention'', pursuant to paragraph \n     11 of Article IX. It should not be necessary to prove the \n     noncompliance of a party to the Convention before the United \n     States raises issues bilaterally or in appropriate \n     international fora and takes appropriate actions.\n       (6) Approval of inspectors.--The Senate expects that the \n     United States will exercise its right to reject a proposed \n     inspector or inspection assistant when the facts indicate \n     that this person is likely to seek information to which the \n     inspection team is not entitled or to mishandle information \n     that the team obtains.\n       (7) Assistance to Russia.--The Senate declares that, if the \n     United States provides limited financial assistance for the \n     destruction of Russian chemical weapons, the United States \n     should, in exchange for such assistance, require Russia to \n     destroy its chemical weapons stocks at a proportional rate to \n     the destruction of United States chemical weapons stocks, and \n     to take the action before the Convention deadline. In \n     addition, the Senate urges the President to request Russia to \n     allow inspections of former military facilities that have \n     been converted to commercial production, given the \n     possibility that these plants could one day be reconverted to \n     military use, and that any United States assistance for the \n     destruction of the Russian chemical stockpile be apportioned \n     according to Russia's openness to these broad based \n     inspections.\n       (8) Expanding chemical arsenals in countries not party to \n     the chemical weapons convention.--It is the sense of the \n     Senate that, if during the time the Convention remains in \n     force the President determines that there has been an \n     expansion of the chemical weapons arsenals of any country not \n     a party to the Convention so as to jeopardize the supreme \n     national interests of the United States, then the President \n     should consult on an urgent basis with the Senate to \n     determine whether adherence to the Convention remains in the \n     national interest of the United States.\n       (9) Compliance.--Concerned by the clear pattern of Soviet \n     noncompliance with arms control agreements and continued \n     cases of noncompliance by Russia, the Senate declares the \n     following:\n       (A) The Convention is in the interest of the United States \n     only if both the United States and Russia, among others, are \n     in strict compliance with the terms of the Convention as \n     submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to \n     ratification, such compliance being measured by performance \n     and not be efforts, intentions, or commitments to comply.\n       (B)(i) Given its concern about compliance issues, the \n     Senate expects the President to offer regular briefings, but \n     not less than several times a year, to the Committees on \n     Foreign Relations and Armed Services and the Select Committee \n     on Intelligence of the Senate on compliance issues related to \n     the Convention. Such briefings shall include a description of \n     all United States efforts in diplomatic channels and \n     bilateral as well as the multilateral Organization fora to \n     resolve the compliance issues and shall include, but would \n     not necessarily be limited to a description of--\n       (I) any compliance issues, other than those requiring \n     challenge inspections, that the United States plans to raise \n     with the Organization; and\n       (II) any compliance issues raised at the Organization, \n     within 30 days.\n       (ii) Any Presidential determination that Russia is in \n     noncompliance with the Convention shall be transmitted to the \n     committees specified in clause (i) within 30 days of such a \n     determination, together with a written report, including all \n     unclassified summary, explaining why it is in the national \n     security interests of the United States to continue as a \n     party to the Convention.\n       (10) Submission of future agreements as treaties.--The \n     Senate declares that after the Senate gives its advice and \n     consent to ratification of the Convention, any agreement or \n     understanding which in any material way modifies, amends, or \n     reinterprets United States and Russian obligations, or those \n     of any other country, under the Convention, including the \n     time frame for implementation of the Convention, should be \n     submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to \n     ratification.\n       (11) Riot control agents.--(A) The Senate, recognizing that \n     the Convention's prohibition on the use of riot control \n     agents as a ``method of warfare'' precludes the use of such \n     agents against combatants, including use for humanitarian \n     purposes where combatants and noncombatants intermingled, \n     urges the President--\n       (i) to give high priority to continuing efforts to develop \n     effective nonchemical, nonlethal alternatives to riot control \n     agents for\n\n[[Page S10327]]\n\n     use in situations where combatants and noncombatants are \n     intermingled; and\n       (ii) to ensure that the United States actively participates \n     with other parties to the Convention in any reassessment of \n     the appropriateness of the prohibition as it might apply to \n     such situations as the rescue of downed air crews and \n     passengers and escaping prisoners or in situations in which \n     civilians are being used to mask or screen attacks.\n       (B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``riot control \n     agents'' is used within the meaning of Article II(4) of the \n     Convention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/11/senate-section/article/S10325-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n       S. 2063.

A bill to limit the authority of the Secretary of the Army \nto acquire land adjacent to Abiquiu Dam in New Mexico; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                        abiquiu dam legislation\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that \nclarifies the intent of Congress regarding Public Law 100-522. That law \nauthorized the Army Corps of Engineers to store water at Abiquiu Dam in \nnorthern New Mexico. The law also authorized the corps to acquire lands \nadjacent to Abiquiu Dam for recreational access purposes.\n  For the past several years, the corps' Albuquerque office has been \nworking to determine how the area around the dam should be developed. \nDuring that time, it became clear that the local community was \nextremely concerned that the corps might proceed with condemnation of \nall 6,000 acres of flood easement lands around the lake. Such an action \nwould be extremely disruptive to the Abiquiu community.\n  In response to those concerns, I introduced legislation last Congress \nthat would have clarified that the acquisition of lands adjacent to the \ndam by the corps would be from willing sellers only. Since that time, \nthe corps and the local Abiquiu Reservoir Advisory Council have been \nmeeting to address the concerns of the local community.\n  Both the local community and I are very appreciative of the outreach \nand involvement that the Army Corps' Albuquerque district engineer has \nshown on this issue since I introduced my legislation last Congress. \nIndeed, in July of 1995 the corps released its master plan/\nenvironmental assessment for Abiquiu Reservoir, a plan which \nspecifically reflected the intent of Public Law 100-522 by recommending \nthat acquisition of land around the reservoir should only be from \nwilling sellers.\n  However, because of the inherent short-term nature of the position of \nAlbuquerque district engineer, and because of past concerns about corps \npolicy toward condemnation of land at the reservoir, the local \ncommunity still believes, as do I, that there should be an express \nclarification of congressional intent to protect the local community at \nAbiquiu from unreasonable condemnation proceedings.\n  Consequently, today I am again introducing legislation that will \nclarify congressional intent that land acquired by the corps at Abiquiu \nDam is to be acquired from willing sellers only. This legislation will \ngive the citizens of the Abiquiu area the peace of mind that they \ndeserve about the integrity of their property. As one long-time Abiquiu \nresident told me recently, ``I don't want my grandchildren to have to \ngo through this terrible threat of the Government taking away our \nranch.'' My legislation will put an end to that threat, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2063\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LIMITATION ON LAND ACQUISITION.\n\n       Section 1 of the Act entitled ``An Act to authorize \n     continued storage of water at Abiquiu Dam in New Mexico'', \n     approved October 24, 1988 (43 U.S.C. 620a note), is amended \n     by inserting immediately following ``acquire lands'' the \n     following: ``only from willing sellers''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 2064. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to extend the \nprogram of research on breast cancer; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n            The Breast Cancer Research Extension Act of 1996\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which \nauthorizes increased funding for breast cancer research.\n  Over the past 5 years, Congress has demonstrated an increased \ncommitment to the fight against breast cancer. Back in 1991, less than \n$100 million was spent on breast cancer research. Since then, Congress \nhas steadily increased this allocation. These increases have stimulated \nnew and exciting research that has begun to unravel the mysteries of \nthis devastating disease and is moving us closer to a cure. Today, we \nmust send a message through our authorization level to scientists and \nresearch policymakers that we are committed to continued funding for \nthis important research.\n  This increase in funding is necessary because breast cancer has \nreached crisis levels in America. This year alone, 184,000 new cases of \nbreast cancer will be diagnosed in this country, and more than 44,000 \nwomen will die from this disease. Breast cancer is the most common form \nof cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American \nwomen. Today, over 2.6 million American women are living with this \ndisease. In my home State of Maine, it is the most commonly diagnosed \ncancer among women, representing more than 30 percent of all new \ncancers in Maine women.\n  In addition to these enormous human costs, breast cancer also exacts \na heavy financial toll--over $6 billion of our health care dollars are \nspent on breast cancer annually.\n  Today, however, there is cause for hope. Recent scientific progress \nmade in the fight to conquer breast cancer is encouraging. Researchers \nhave isolated the genes responsible for heritable breast cancer, and \nare beginning to understand the mechanism of the cancer cell itself. It \nis imperative that we capitalize upon these advances by continuing to \nsupport the scientists investigating this disease and their innovative \nresearch.\n  For this reason, my bill increases the fiscal year 1997 funding \nauthorization level for breast cancer research to $575 million. This \nlevel is just $20 million over the National Cancer Institute's fiscal \nyear 1997 bypass budget, representing the funding level scientists \nbelieve is necessary to make progress against this disease. This \nincreased funding will contribute substantially toward solving the \nmysteries surrounding breast cancer. Our continued investment will save \ncountless lives and health care dollars, and prevent undue suffering in \nmillions of American women and families.\n  On behalf of the 2.6 million women living with breast cancer, I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2065. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require \nopen campus security crime logs at institutions of higher education; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n[[Page S10328]]\n\n                the open campus police logs act of 1996\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Open \nCampus Police Logs Act of 1996.\n  Mr. President, every year around this time thousands of students \nleave home to begin their pursuit of a college degree. These students--\nand their parents--expect not only a quality education, but also a \ncampus on which they can study and live in safety. Yet, statistics show \nthat during a 4-year-period, one in four college students will become a \nvictim of violent crime. And according to the Chronicle of Higher \nEducation, the number of crimes on college campuses are on the rise.\n  Under the Campus Security Act of 1990, colleges and universities are \nrequired to make crime statistics available to students, applicants and \nschool employees. However, under-reporting of crime statistics by \nschool administrators and the utilization of internal campus \ndisciplinary systems, which are protected by privacy laws, have \nrendered the existing law ineffective.\n  All too often, we hear stories of college administrators who pressure \nvictims to use discretion and to settle cases internally--without \nresort to the criminal justice system. Offenders then come before the \ncampus tribunal, and are never publicly processed for the crimes. \nSometimes, even the victims themselves cannot find out what happened in \nthese internal trials.\n  And all too often, Mr. President, colleges and universities concerned \nabout their image have been found to underreport crime and hide the \ntrue statistics from applicants and the media.\n  Students are unable to discover the true rate of campus crime, and \nare therefore unable to make informed decisions about where to go and \nhow safe certain areas truly are.\n  The bill I am proposing today would extend the current law, in order \nto further inform students of the crimes occurring on college campuses \nso that they can better protect themselves.\n  This bill would continue to require that schools receiving Federal \nmoney compile statistics on crimes like murder and rape. However, it \nwould also require schools to maintain a daily log--one that is open to \npublic inspection--of all crimes committed against person or property.\n  These daily logs would chronicle not only the time, place and date of \nthe crime, but also the names and addresses of all those arrested by \nthe campus police or security force. No more could colleges hide \nstatistics in annual reports and with secret, unreported disciplinary \nhearings. Every student or employee would have access, every day, to \ninformation about every arrest occurring on campus.\n  Some colleges and universities will argue that this bill is too \nburdensome. But this legislation should not be viewed by college \nadministrators as an added burden for the campus security office, but \nrather as an effective tool to better inform the collegiate community. \nStudents and employees have a right to know what dangers they face on \ncampus. It is through this improved awareness that students and faculty \nwill be able to better protect themselves. After all, one of the best \nweapons we have for deterring crime is accurate and timely information.\n  A New York Times reporter recently wrote about a woman who had been \nraped in February of last year--by a fellow student at her university \nin Ohio. Although the university's disciplinary board found the accused \nguilty of violating the student code regarding sexual assault, he was \nmerely placed on student probation. He never went through a criminal \ntrial.\n  As a result, the offending student was free to come and go on a \ncampus where most women did not--and indeed could not--realize that he \nhad committed any crime at all.\n  At this same school, Mr. President--where the student rapist was \nplaced on probation--possession of a beer by an underage student can \nresult in automatic suspension.\n  Furthermore, when the university published their official crime \nstatistics later that fall, no rapes were reported. It is clear that \ncompliance with reporting requirements could be far better.\n  Colleges and universities have made it their mission to provide a \nquality education in a suitable environment to America's students. By \nfailing to disclose the true nature of crime on their campuses, \nadministrations are not living up to this goal. We must make our \ncampuses safer, by allowing students to better protect themselves from \npotential crime through the daily, public disclosure of past incidents \nand potential dangers.\n  Mr. President, it is an unfortunate fact that today's students must \ntake care to protect themselves from serious crime on our college \ncampuses. Yes, protecting the privacy of accused students is important. \nBut protecting the safety of potential victims is equally vital to \nproviding an enriching and safe experience for each and every one of \nthe many children who leave home each year in search of a future full \nof promise and prosperity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2065\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The \n     provision of this paragraph shall not be construed to require \n     an institution to identify in its log, unless otherwise \n     provided by law, the names of the persons reporting the \n     crime, the victim or victims, any witnesses or suspects who \n     have not been arrested, or other information relating to any \n     investigation of the crime. All entries in such daily logs \n     shall, unless otherwise provided by State or Federal law, be \n     open to public inspection.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Exon, \n        Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. \n        Harkin):\n  S. 2066.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Federal Financial \n     Management Improvement Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Much effort has been devoted to strengthening Federal \n     internal accounting controls in the past. Although progress \n     has been made in recent years, Federal accounting standards \n     have not been uniformly implemented in financial management \n     systems for agencies.\n       (2) Federal financial management continues to be seriously \n     deficient, and Federal financial management and fiscal \n     practices have failed to--\n       (A) identify costs fully;\n       (B) reflect the total liabilities of congressional actions; \n     and\n       (C) accurately report the financial condition of the \n     Federal Government.\n       (3) Current Federal accounting practices do not accurately \n     report financial results of the Federal Government or the \n     full costs of programs and activities. The continued use of \n     these practices undermines the Government's ability to \n     provide credible and reliable financial data and encourages \n     already widespread Government waste, and will not assist in \n     achieving a balanced budget.\n       (4) Waste and inefficiency in the Federal Government \n     undermine the confidence of the American people in the \n     Government and reduce the Federal Government's ability to \n     address vital public needs adequately.\n       (5) To rebuild the accountability and credibility of the \n     Federal Government, and restore public confidence in the \n     Federal Government, agencies must incorporate accounting \n     standards and reporting objectives established for the \n     Federal Government into their financial management systems so \n     that all the assets and liabilities, revenues, and \n     expenditures or expenses, and the full costs of programs and \n     activities of the Federal Government can be consistently and \n     accurately recorded, monitored, and uniformly reported \n     throughout the Federal Government.\n       (6) Since its establishment in October 1990, the Federal \n     Accounting Standards Advisory Board (hereinafter referred to \n     as the ``FASAB'') has made substantial progress toward \n     developing and recommending a comprehensive set of accounting \n     concepts and standards for the Federal Government. When the \n     accounting concepts and standards developed by FASAB are \n     incorporated into Federal financial management systems, \n     agencies will be able to provide cost and financial \n     information that will assist the Congress and financial \n     managers to evaluate the cost and performance of Federal \n     programs and activities, and will therefore provide important \n     information that has been lacking, but is needed for improved \n     decisionmaking by financial managers and the Congress.\n       (7) The development of financial management systems with \n     the capacity to support these standards and concepts will, \n     over the long term, improve Federal financial management.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) provide for consistency of accounting by an agency from \n     one fiscal year to the next, and uniform accounting standards \n     throughout the Federal Government;\n       (2) require Federal financial management systems to support \n     full disclosure of Federal financial data, including the full \n     costs of Federal programs and activities, to the citizens, \n     the Congress, the President, and agency management, so that \n     programs and activities can be considered based on their full \n     costs and merits;\n       (3) increase the accountability and credibility of Federal \n     financial management;\n       (4) improve performance, productivity and efficiency of \n     Federal Government financial management;\n       (5) establish financial management systems to support \n     controlling the cost of Federal Government;\n       (6) build upon and complement the Chief Financial Officers \n     Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-576; 104 Stat. 2838), the \n     Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law \n     103-62; 107 Stat. 285), and the Government Management Reform \n     Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-356; 108 Stat. 3410); and\n       (7) increase the capability of agencies to monitor \n     execution of the budget by more readily permitting reports \n     that compare spending of resources to results of activities.\n\n     SEC. ____03. IMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT \n                   IMPROVEMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each agency shall implement and maintain \n     financial management systems that comply with Federal \n     financial management systems requirements, applicable Federal \n     accounting standards, and the United States Government \n     Standard General Ledger at the transaction level.\n       (b) Priority.--Each agency shall give priority in funding \n     and provide sufficient resources to implement this title.\n       (c) Audit Compliance Finding.--\n       (1) In general.--Each audit required by section 3521(e) of \n     title 31, United States Code, shall report whether the agency \n     financial management systems comply with the requirements of \n     subsection (a).\n       (2) Content of reports.--When the person performing the \n     audit required by section 3521(e) of title 31, United States \n     Code, reports that the agency financial management systems do \n     not comply with the requirements of subsection (a), the \n     person performing the audit shall include in the report on \n     the audit--\n       (A) the name and position of any officer or employee \n     responsible for the financial management systems that have \n     been found not to comply with the requirements of subsection \n     (a);\n       (B) all facts pertaining to the failure to comply with the \n     requirements of subsection (a), including--\n       (i) the nature and extent of the noncompliance;\n       (ii) the primary reason or cause of the noncompliance;\n       (iii) any official responsible for the noncompliance; and\n       (iv) any relevant comments from any responsible officer or \n     employee; and\n       (C) a statement with respect to the recommended remedial \n     actions and the timeframes to implement such actions.\n       (d) Compliance Determination.--\n       (1) In general.--No later than the date described under \n     paragraph (2), the Director, acting through the Controller of \n     the Office of Federal Financial Management, shall determine \n     whether the financial management systems of an agency comply \n     with the requirements of subsection (a).

Mr. President, I have said in the past, and \ncontinue to believe, that the action taken by Congress in eliminating \nsection 936 without a permanent replacement program that provides a \nmajor stimulus to economic development in Puerto Rico and the creation \nof well-paying and stable jobs was unfortunate.\n  We have the seeds of a replacement program in new Internal Revenue \nCode section 30A that provides a targeted wage credit to companies \ncurrently doing business in Puerto Rico based upon the compensation \npaid to their qualified employees. Although this is certainly movement \nin the right direction, it does not allow new business starts, and the \ncredit will sunset in 10 years. As such, it does not provide the \npermanency that is needed to maintain the economic development of \nPuerto Rico, and will adversely impact States like New York.\n  Corporations headquartered in New York State that have invested in \nPuerto Rico employ over 39,000 persons in New York. Moreover, Puerto \nRican subsidiaries of mainland companies purchase approximately $195 \nmillion per year worth of supplies and services from New York. \nConsequently, when the wage credit sunsets in 2006 and corporations are \ndrawn to other regions where there are tax incentives, New York State \nwill lose not only jobs, but a significant amount of income from goods \nand services.\n  Mr. President, Congress needs to work with the elected \nrepresentatives of Puerto Rico to expand section 30A into a dynamic and \neffective job creation incentive that helps to bring new and high-\npaying jobs to Puerto Rico. By doing so, we will raise Puerto Rico's \neconomic standards and provide efficient Federal incentives to \naccomplish those goals. I firmly believe that Congress, working with \nGovernor Rossello and other elected leaders from Puerto Rico, can \nsuccessfully fashion a program that achieves economic progress for \nPuerto Rico and efficiency in Federal expenditures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/11/senate-section/article/S10343-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10343-S10344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SHOULD WE TROT OUT THE NEW DEAL AGAIN?\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the ablest aldermen in the \ncity of Chicago, Burton F. Natarus, recently had a commentary in the \nChicago Tribune in which he calls for a public works program along the \nlines of the WPA. It makes eminent good sense.\n  We can learn from history, but we're apparently unwilling to do it.\n  The welfare bill that passed is going to cause huge problems in our \nsociety if we don't come up with something better and do it quickly.\n  A WPA type of welfare reform would cost a little more initially, but \nsaves huge amounts of money in the long run and be of great assistance \nto impoverished areas, whether rural or urban.\n  Right now we are trying to have welfare reform but do it without \ncreating jobs for the unskilled and without having day care for their \nchildren.\n  Anything labeled ``welfare reform'' that doesn't provide the jobs and \ndoesn't provide day care is not really welfare reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Alderman Natarus' article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribute, Aug. 22, 1996]\n\n                 Should We Trot Out the New Deal Again?\n\n                         (By Burton F. Natarus)\n\n       On July 24, the Senate approved a comprehensive welfare \n     bill, the most sweeping change since the creation of the New \n     Deal 60 years ago. Federal guarantees of cash assistance for \n     the nation's poorest children have evaporated and states will \n     be given new powers to run welfare on their own. The measure \n     also imposes a five-year lifetime limit on cash assistance \n     payments to any family and requires the head of every family \n     on welfare to work within two years or lose benefits.\n       While we laud the new thrust toward the self-sufficiency of \n     our population, and the end of the obsolete aspects of the \n     60-year-old welfare system, we have serious concerns about \n     jobs. Where are they to come from? Where is the new workforce \n     to go? To Bainbridge Island, Wash., to work for Microsoft? To \n     the high-tech Naperville corridor for that chemical \n     engineering position? The welfare reform bill, which \n     President Clinton is expected to sign, presumes there will be \n     jobs available for the workforce. These jobs may or may not \n     exist and we have to face the brutal fact that generations of \n     welfare families have no saleable working skills. Recall the \n     controversial ``workfare'' Comprehensive Employment and \n     Training Act program from the Nixon administration in the \n     flush, moneyed '70s, when Congress tried to create jobs \n     accompanied by teaching and skills\n\n[[Page S10344]]\n\n     training. Limited in scope and a short-term solution to \n     unemployment, it finally ended with the Reagan era and here \n     we are 10 years later with no significant federal jobs \n     program as we throw the poor out on their own.\n       With the CETA program, the private sector created low-level \n     and semi-skilled jobs, which concentrated in the food \n     service, truck driving and clerical fields. There were \n     considerable financial incentives for the private sector to \n     participate in CETA. These incentives do not exist today and \n     the private sector may not be willing nor is it able to \n     create entry-level jobs in sufficient numbers.\n       In 1929, the Depression commenced its sad and ugly course \n     and by 1933 12 million able-bodied Americans were out of \n     work. No work. No money. The country was, however, fortunate \n     enough to have Franklin Roosevelt as its 32nd president. We \n     know of his long roster of massive relief measures and social \n     programs to cope with the Depression and a country in crisis: \n     farm relief, unemployment insurance, Social Security, fair \n     bankruptcy and foreclosure procedures and numerous federal \n     jobs measures. At the 1932 Democratic National Convention in \n     Chicago, Roosevelt declared, ``I pledge myself to a new deal. \n     . . . This is more than a political campaign; it is a call to \n     arms.''\n       What we need is a ``new'' New Deal and a call to arms. Let \n     us recall some of those job-creating public works bills of \n     the Roosevelt administration.\n       In March 1933, his recovery plan included the Civilian \n     Conservation Corps, which gave 250,000 young men meals, \n     housing, wages and the necessities of life for their work in \n     the national forests and other government properties.\n       There was the Works Progress Administration and in the \n     words of Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) 10 years ago, it was \n     ``refreshingly sensible.'' The WPA put 8.5 million people to \n     work building bridges, airports, highways and developing \n     programs to foster cultural awareness. The Federal Art \n     Project's works are still seen today in murals at such places \n     as Lane Tech and the Lakeview Post Office. Hundreds of \n     thousands of Chicagoans worked for the WPA during these \n     years, including thousands of laborers, artists and writers \n     who worked for $95 a month. In Illinois, from 1935-38, these \n     new hires built 28 million square feet of sidewalks, 1,895 \n     rural bridges, 300,000 public artworks. A recent New York \n     Times Magazine article entitled, ``When Work Disappears'' \n     recounts the staggering national accomplishments of the \n     administration, from playgrounds, athletic fields, viaducts \n     and culverts, to LaGuardia Airport and FDR Drive. This week \n     it has been nationally reported that the cities with the most \n     decrepit crumbling and unsafe bridges in the country are New \n     York and Washington, D.C. In Chicago, we could also use the \n     help of our citizens in repairing old infrastructure.\n       The Public Works Administration created jobs and stimulated \n     business between 1933 and 1939. The federal government spent \n     $6 billion on construction of the Washington, D.C. Mall, \n     Hoover Dam, the Lincoln Tunnel and Ft. Knox. This bureau also \n     created jobs geared toward the preservation of public works.\n       The creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority put the \n     government in the electric power business, selling \n     electricity in competition with private firms, and giving the \n     government ownership of hydroelectric plants in large rivers. \n     Under the program, Norris Dam was built on the Tennessee \n     River and the Bonneville and Grand Coulee on the Columbia \n     River. These dams employed hundreds of thousands of people \n     who ended up not only supporting themselves and their \n     families but constructing enduring legacies for the country. \n     How many flood plains could use dams right here in Illinois?\n       World War II eventually solved the unemployment problem but \n     you can imagine how bereft the country would have been for \n     those 10 years without the PWA, the WPA, the CCC and the TVA. \n     One powerful reason why it makes good economic sense to place \n     people on the federal payroll is that the jobs are taxable \n     and the tax monies revert to the federal government as wages \n     are disbursed. Programs such as the WPA pay for themselves in \n     the long run, which is so much more financially efficient \n     than a dole or handout.\n       Furthermore, when the federal worker leaves his public \n     sector job he will be ready, or at least more ready, for \n     private sector employment, having received on-the-job \n     training in a specific field. Incidentally, the jobs would \n     not be ad aeternitum nor for the lifetime of an individual. \n     They would be for a finite period after which time others \n     would be hired and given a chance to learn replicable skills. \n     By creating these government jobs an economic rippling effect \n     inevitably occurs in which private industry is stimulated.\n       A federal public jobs program would not carry the stigma of \n     welfare so public jobs must be made available for those who \n     will no longer be on the dole. We owe our citizens this much. \n     This is indeed a call to arms and in this matter we have no \n     choice.\n       `The WPA was the most beneficial project in the history of \n     the United States. Bringing it back is long overdue . . . \n     There are plenty of projects now without having to make work. \n     Everything is deteriorating--bridges, buildings, roads, \n     schools, everything.'\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/11/senate-section/article/S10343-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRIBUTE TO OATS\n\n Mr. BOND.

It is a great \npleasure to recognize OATS for its 25 years of loyal service to \nresidents in the State of Missouri.\n  OATS was founded in November 1971, as the Cooperative Transportation \nService, to provide reliable transportation to seniors, people with \ndisabilities and rural residents of Missouri in order to increase their \nmobility to live independently in their own communities. Since then, \nthe not-for-profit corporation has grown from 3 buses serving 8 mid-\nMissouri counties, into a fleet of over 300 vehicles serving 87 out of \nMissouri's 113 counties. Today, over 1,000 volunteers and 342 drivers \nand staff dedicate their time and energy to increasing mobility and \nextending a lifeline for those with special transportation needs.\n  As OATS celebrates its 25th anniversary on September 25, 1996, it is \nan honor to congratulate its members on their long lasting commitment \nto Missourians. I wish OATS the best of luck in all its future \nendeavors and continued success in its service to others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/11/senate-section/article/S10344-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10344-S10345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WHY DO WE KEEP STIFFING THE UNITED NATIONS?\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the Los Angeles Times recently \ncarried an op-ed piece by James P. Muldoon, Jr., and Rafael Moreno \nunder the title, ``Why Do We Keep Stiffing the U.N.?''\n  My colleagues know of my unhappiness with our failure to pay the debt \nwe owe.\n  Our provincialism is astounding. The article refers to our debt as \nbeing $1.5 billion. That may be a slight exaggeration, but it is at \nleast $1.2 billion and probably somewhat higher than that.\n  What is also of interest is their paragraph on relative cost paid by \ndifferent countries. They write:\n\n       It's difficult for Europeans to accept that the U.N. is a \n     budget-buster for the U.S. The costs to Americans for the \n     U.N. in general and U.N. peacekeeping in particular are \n     significantly lower than they are for Europeans. The U.S. \n     costs for the 1996 U.N. regular budget come to only $1.24 per \n     American, while the people of San Marino owe $4.75 each. \n     Luxembourg $2.06 each and for the Swedes $1.57 each. The U.S. \n     per capita cost for 16 U.N. peacekeeping operations in 1994 \n     was less than $4.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to read what Mr. Muldoon and Mr. Moreno have to \nsay.\n  I ask that the op-ed piece be printed in the Record.\n  The op-ed piece follows:\n\n                   Why Do We Keep Stiffing the U.N.?\n\n              (By James P. Muldoon Jr. and Rafael Moreno)\n\n       Italian President Oscar Scalfaro, in an address to the U.N. \n     General Assembly earlier this year, diplomatically yet firmly \n     took the United States to task about its mountain of debt to \n     the United Nations. Sadly, Scalfaro's message is hardly new. \n     Over the past few months, nearly all our European partners \n     have expressed similar discontent with U.S. leadership at the \n     U.N.\n       This week the Council on Foreign Relations issued a report \n     by a bipartisan group of U.S. foreign-policy experts, who \n     warn that Washington's hostility to the U.N. is damaging both \n     the world organization and America's national interests. The \n     report says that politicians have misrepresented U.N. \n     activities in such trouble spots as Somalia and Bosnia in \n     order to cover up their own policy failures.\n       America's U.N. debt now tops $1.5 billion. French President \n     Jacque Chirac chided members of Congress, in a joint session, \n     saying their shortsightedness was weakening America's \n     position of global leadership. Behind the scenes, similar \n     messages of concern are being registered across Europe. \n     America's allies are confounded by the intense anti-U.N. \n     rhetoric that has emerged during the U.N.'s 50th anniversary \n     year, intensifying as the presidential election nears.\n       Since the end of the Cold War, the major powers have \n     recognized that the U.S. could not (and would not) be the \n     world's policeman. For that reason, many countries, including \n     the U.S. attempted to make the U.N.'s ``collective security'' \n     machinery function in response to a range of conflicts over \n     the past five years that were not imagined by the drafters of \n     the U.N. Charter. Yet when the peacekeeping missions in \n     Somalia, the former Yugoslavia and Haiti lost their way, the \n     ``great powers'' who approved and mandated these missions \n     conveniently shifted most of the blame onto the secretary-\n     general and the U.N. secretariat, distancing themselves from \n     their decisions and mandates in the Security Council. When \n     the bills came due, the greatest power--the United States--\n     said it was unable to pay.\n       It's difficult for Europeans to accept that the U.N. is a \n     budget-buster for the U.S. The costs to Americans for the \n     U.N. in general and U.N. peacekeeping in particular are \n     significantly lower than they are for Europeans. The U.S. \n     costs for the 1996 U.N. regular budget come to only $1.24 per \n     American, while the people of San Marino owe $4.75\n\n[[Page S10345]]\n\n     each. Luxembourg $2.06 each and for the Swedes $1.57 each. \n     The U.S. per capita cost for 16 U.N. peacekeeping operations \n     in 1994 was less than $4.\n       Making matters worse is the U.S. arrogance when discussing \n     problems of U.N. peacekeeping, especially regarding the U.N. \n     troops in the former Yugoslavia, and the disavowal of \n     Washington, particularly Congress, for America's part in the \n     ``failure'' of the U.N. in the Balkans. The real facts \n     regarding the limitations of U.N. peacekeeping in the post-\n     Cold War period is a shameful record of ``great power'' \n     mismanagement and unrealistic mandates. The vast majority of \n     U.N. Troops in peacekeeping missions are from such member \n     states as Fiji, Pakistan, Malaysia, Italy and Spain. The \n     permanent members of the Security Council--the U.S., Britain, \n     France, Russia and China--have extraordinary power and can \n     stop the expansion or addition of U.N. missions simply by \n     voting no. The fact that they hold such power is the primary \n     reason that they are expected to pay more for these missions \n     and to deploy larger troop contingents.\n       European concerns go well beyond the matter of America's \n     $1.5-billion U.N. debt. One thing that most bothers our \n     allies is the cynical American tendency to take advantage of \n     the organization when it serves our national interest--as it \n     did with Haiti--or to use it as an excuse to hide behind when \n     it doesn't--Bosnia, for example.\n       This is not a debate about the $4.40 that each American \n     owes the U.N. but about the kind of world we want in the 21st \n     century. Will it be one with the U.S. as the haughty and \n     lonely superpower or one with nations and peoples following \n     America's moral leadership and working out differences \n     through dialogue, cooperation and common will, something very \n     similar to what the U.N. is all about?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/11/senate-section/article/S10344-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNIROYAL GOODRICH PLANT IN TUSCALOOSA, AL\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the \nUniroyal Goodrich Tire Manufacturing facility in Tuscaloosa, AL, which \nis celebrating its 50th year of successful production and community \nservice. For half a century, the Uniroyal Goodrich plant has been an \nimportant part of Tuscaloosa's economic and social fabric as well as a \nsource of great pride within the community.\n  For the last 50 years, the history of the Uniroyal Goodrich plant has \nreflected that of our Nation. In 1946, as our Nation was moving from \nwartime to a peacetime economy, BF Goodrich was leading the way, \npurchasing an unfinished tire plant from the Federal Government, and on \nOctober 23, 1946, rolling the first tire off the assembly line. Since \nthen, a long series of ambitious modernizations and expansions have \nenabled the Tuscaloosa facility to keep pace with the constant business \nand technological innovations which have been the hallmark of American \nindustry. Although Tuscaloosa's tire manufacturing plant began by \nproducing belted bias tires in an 860,000-square-foot structure, today \nthe facility is double its original size, 40 acres under one roof, and \nproduces high performance radial tires 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n  America's post-war success, like the success of the Tuscaloosa \nfacility, has been a product of teamwork. In 1986, BF Goodrich joined \nforces with the Uniroyal Co. to produce high-quality tires. In 1990, \nthe Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. became part of Michelin North America. \nThis new team promises to be a leader in American industry for many \nyears to come.\n  The important role the Uniroyal Goodrich plant has played in the \ndevelopment of Tuscaloosa as a growing and prosperous community cannot \nbe overstated. It is a rare Tuscaloosa family who does not have a \nfather, son, brother, sister, or cousin who is a current or previous \nemployee of the plant. The plant's first weekly payroll, back in 1946, \nwas $542.23 for 12 employees. This payroll has grown to over $1.3 \nmillion for 2,000 hard-working local men and women. This income rolls \nover many times in the local economy, benefiting all of Tuscaloosa's \nbusinesses and individuals.\n  I am immensely grateful for, and proud of, the Uniroyal Goodrich Tire \nManufacturing plant and the men and women who work hard there every \nday. On behalf of all Tuscaloosans, I would therefore like to \ncongratulate the Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Manufacturing plant for 50 \nyears of outstanding production and community service. I wish them \nanother 50 years of success and prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/11/senate-section/article/S10345-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10345-S10346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IF WE WERE SERIOUS\n\n   Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, when Richard Darman served as The \nOffice of Management and Budget Director, I sometimes disagreed with \nhim; but I always had great respect for him.\n  He had an op-ed piece in The New York Times on September 1 that \ncontains a great deal of common sense; and as we know, common sense is \nall too often the last thing that gets discussed during a political \ncampaign.\n  He says correctly that we have to look at the entitlement picture. To \npretend that we can balance the budget without looking at entitlements \nis living in a dream world, even if both political parties were not \nasking for tax cuts. The request for tax cuts simply compounds this \nproblem.\n  Second, he suggests that we have to look at urban problems. If I can \nexpand that to say we ought to be looking at the question of poverty, \nwhich is what he is really suggesting. That means looking at education \nand some other basics.\n  I have long favored having a WPA type of jobs program where we would \npay people the minimum wage for 4-days a week. The fifth day they would \nhave to be out trying to find a job in the private sector. When people \ncannot read and write, we would get them into a program. If their \nliteracy and educational background was woefully inadequate, we would \nget them into a program to get their GED. If they have no marketable \nskill, we would get them to a community college or technical school.\n  The reality is there is no way of achieving the kind of society we \nshould have on the cheap, as Darman points out.\n  The third reality that he mentions in his article is that we are \ngrowing older and obviously that has a huge impact on the entitlement \nscene.\n  There is one other reality that he does not mention that ought to be \nput on the table and that is in terms of taxation. Contrary to the \ngeneral myth, the percentage of our taxes that goes for government \nsupport is lower than any of the countries of western Europe or Japan, \nAustralia, and New Zealand, if the Japanese industrial compact is \nconsidered. The lone exception to that is Turkey.\n  We ought to be looking at a value-added tax; we ought to be looking \nat a more realistic gasoline tax; we ought to be raising cigarette \ntaxes, both for our economic health and our physical health.\n  In any event, the Darman discussion should move us a little more \ntoward reality.\n  Mr. President, I ask that this article from The New York Times be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Sept. 1, 1996]\n\n                           If We Were Serious\n\n                          (By Richard Darman)\n\n       The prime-time convention shows have come to their balloon-\n     drop endings. The mini-movies, zingers and dramatic speeches \n     are over. What follows now, we are told, is the ``serious \n     campaign.''\n       That is a notion which many would dismiss as oxymoronic. \n     But it has the virtue of suggesting an interesting question: \n     What important issues might the candidates address if the \n     campaign actually were serious?\n       The question is not put to dismiss what has been presented \n     so far. Bill Clinton and Bob Dole have both recognized that a \n     governing majority requires far broader appeal than either \n     party's traditional base provides. They have both broadened \n     their reach.\n       Bob Dole has distanced himself from the dour anti-\n     government focus of the House Republicans by selecting Jack \n     Kemp--signaling an interest in growth, while underlining his \n     commitment to equal opportunity, inclusiveness and tolerance. \n     Bill Clinton has adopted a Reaganesque command of symbols and \n     ceremony, declaring ``hope is back.'' And he has again \n     reversed himself on welfare and taxes, asserting ``the era of \n     big government is over.''\n       How much of this is to be taken seriously, others may \n     judge. Choices have been framed: whether to continue on the \n     current path or pursue a bolder reach for growth; to rely on \n     government or ``trust the people''; to ``bridge'' forward or \n     back to the future. The problem is that such formulations, \n     though important, are abstract. As presented by the major \n     candidates, they barely touch fundamental issues America must \n     face.\n       One such issue, growing middle-class entitlements, was \n     mentioned in a convention speech, but not by any of the \n     candidates. Colin Powell warned of ``condemning our children \n     and grandchildren with a crushing burden of debt that will \n     deny them the American Dream.'' He noted, ``We all need to \n     understand it is the entitlement state that\n\n[[Page S10346]]\n\n     must be reformed, and not just the welfare state.'' Virtually \n     all serious analysts agree: if entitlements are not reformed \n     before the baby-boom generation reaches age 60, the feel-good \n     talk about recent progress on the deficit will be replaced by \n     a sense of crisis.\n       The sensible course is to avoid a baby-boomer retirement \n     shock by addressing the problem well in advance. But the \n     major candidates either pretend the problem does not exist, \n     propose to hand it to a commission, or wish it away with \n     heroic assumptions about economic growth. Indeed, while \n     sidestepping the problem, the candidates actually act as if \n     government were going to be long, not short, on revenue. \n     Without providing credible proposals for spending reduction, \n     both candidates offer the voters attractive tax cuts--what \n     Ross Perot has termed ``free candy just before elections.''\n       The facts are these, however: There are good reasons public \n     policy should seek to increase growth. These range from \n     interests in reducing the deficit and financing Social \n     Security to increasing opportunity for the poor and improving \n     the quality of life for all. But growth is limited by labor-\n     force participation and the rate of increase in productivity. \n     These can and should be improved by cutting marginal tax \n     rates and the tax on capital gains. But significant \n     improvements in productivity also require radical \n     improvements in education and training, and major \n     breakthroughs in research and development. These, in turn, \n     require the expenditure of political and financial capital. \n     Even with these, the likely increase in growth would not \n     suffice to offset too much free candy.\n       In any case, major improvements in long-term productivity \n     growth take time to achieve. Meanwhile, the deficit cannot be \n     eliminated by focusing on non-entitlements and using the new \n     line-item veto. The ``anti-government'' public and \n     politicians care too much about expenditures for law \n     enforcement, immigration control, drug abuse prevention, air \n     safety, environmental protection, biomedical research, and so \n     on. So if the baby-boomers are to avoid a shock, if the \n     deficit is to be kept under control, and if a tax increase is \n     to be avoided, entitlement reform will have to be faced \n     promptly.\n       This issue is at the heart of the budget problem. Yet if it \n     were merely budgetary, it would long since have been solved. \n     The dilemma is that entitlements principally involve the \n     broad American middle that is key to electoral success. That \n     is why entitlements are the ``third rail'' of American \n     politics and lend themselves to demagoguery. They are treated \n     simplistically though they involve complex questions: Who in \n     the middle class should be protected against exactly what \n     risks? What should be the relative responsibility of \n     government and individuals in assuring risk protection? What \n     are the obligations of working generations to generations too \n     young or too old to work? Leadership is needed to help frame \n     responsible answers to just such difficult questions. Yet no \n     candidate has trusted the people enough to risk a serious \n     discussion.\n       A second fundamental problem is as obvious as the first and \n     as unattended: America's deposing inner cities. Clearly, talk \n     of hope, history and the American Dream is hollow if it does \n     not address the large population trapped in ghettos. Urban \n     ghettos represent a moral failure and a substantial economic \n     cost. Indeed, if left unattended, the decivilizing effects of \n     urban neglect may pose a more widespread threat to the \n     American Dream. Yet this problem, too, has difficulty \n     attracting a serious word.\n       Jack Kemp deserves credit for being among the few major \n     politicians to put the urban problem on the national agenda. \n     But, unfortunately, putting this problem on the agenda and \n     offering viable solutions are not necessarily the same. Jobs \n     must be created near blighted areas, and tax incentives could \n     help. but they cannot possibly suffice. A zero capital gains \n     rate will not counter the fear of random violence or \n     organized mayhem. Low marginal rates alone will not produce \n     healthy role models or families, effective education, a \n     reduction in drug abuse, or the basics of a civilized \n     infrastructure. Given the scale of the urban problem, very \n     large amounts of public and private investment are required. \n     And while the investment may pay for itself over generations, \n     in the near term it means that in addition to tax incentives \n     there must be significant spending. Yet these days, no major \n     politician seems willing to admit publicly that great dreams \n     cannot be achieved on the cheap.\n       A third fundamental problem is not quite as obvious as the \n     first two. It is the flip side of a good thing: Americans can \n     expect to live longer. The Census Bureau estimates that, in \n     2010, there will be more than 40 million Americans aged 65 \n     and over. Six million will be 85 and over--and that is before \n     the baby-boomers reach 85. with breakthroughs in biomedical \n     research, these numbers will be even more compelling. There \n     is not only a very large generation headed toward retirement. \n     But in the move from the 20th to the 21st century, something \n     close to an additional generation is being added to expected \n     life.\n       This will necessitate a minor cultural and economic \n     revolution. It is not merely an issue of entitlement finance. \n     Retirement ages will have to increase. Job and retraining \n     opportunities will have to be developed. New community-living \n     arrangements will have to be expanded. Profound issues of \n     morality will have to be confronted.\n       Bob Dole has spoken eloquently of the ``gracious \n     compensations of age.'' At 73, he is healthy and active--a \n     symbol of the enormous potential represented by the growing \n     numbers of healthy older Americans. He is perfectly \n     positioned to raise national consciousness about the risks \n     and opportunities presented by the aging of America.\n       As the campaign moves into its ``serious'' phase, however, \n     it may be naive to imagine that candidates might actually \n     treat us as if we could face serious problems seriously. Bill \n     Clinton has had four years to address these problems and has \n     not yet done so. And while elections elicit new proposals, \n     they rarely produce serious discussion. The politicians are, \n     naturally enough, trying to get elected. To get them to be \n     serious, we ourselves would have to be serious. And if \n     balloons, simple nostrums and promises of free candy are all \n     we demand, that is probably about all we will get.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/11/senate-section/article/S10345-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO THE TOWN OF HOLLIS, NH, ON THE OCCASION OF THEIR 250TH \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \npeople of Hollis, NH, on their town's 250th anniversary. Since April, \nthe residents of Hollis have been celebrating their town's anniversary \nwith numerous festivities including the strawberry festival, a museum \nopening, a civic profile, a firemen's muster, an apple festival, a \nmarathon road race and many other enjoyable events. The town's \ncelebration on September 14th will mark their official 250th \nanniversary and is certain to bring the whole town together for this \nhistoric event.\n  The history of Hollis dates back to the year 1746 when the area of \nWest Dunstable was divided into four different parts--Dunstable, \nMonson, Merrimack, and Hollis. Later on April 3, 1746, then-Governor \nBenning Wentworth signed the town's first charter officially naming the \ntown Holles. It was on this date that the people from a loose \nsettlement of families gathered under one wing of a church in the \nHollis area to join together to unite their town.\n  Originally, Hollis was granted the name of Holles after Governor \nWentworth's friend, the Duke of Newcastle. Eventually, the town \nresidents changed the spelling of Holles to Hollis in honor of an \nEnglish merchant they admired for his high level of intellect and his \ngenerosity to Harvard College. Many descendants of the town's first \nsettlers still live in Hollis today. Before the signing of the charter, \nthere were 75 families that resided in the geographical location of \nHollis. When the charter was signed, 20 families were forced to reside \nin the Dunstable area. These 20 families fought for 30 years to be \nreunited with their fellow neighbors and their home, Hollis. To this \nday, the residents of Hollis use this example as an illustration of \ntheir town's commitment of unity.\n  The passage of 250 years of history has changed the way of life for \nthe people of Hollis. Some of the minor changes include the tithing men \nand fence viewers who have disappeared from election ballots and the \ndecay of the whipping post in the town common. Nevertheless, these few \nminor changes have not changed the bond the families feel for Hollis, \nnor the civic responsibilities they have held in the town since 1746. \nJoan Tinklepaugh, who wrote a history for the town, states it best when \nshe says, ``we are all joined together by the stitches of the quilt of \nhumanity that makes up the town called Hollis.''\n  I congratulate the many residents of Hollis on this festive occasion, \nand for their sense of unity and dedication. Enjoy the celebration and \nmay the years to come be as prosperous as your last 250 years. Happy \nbirthday Hollis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/11/senate-section/article/S10346-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10346-S10347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1996\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.
