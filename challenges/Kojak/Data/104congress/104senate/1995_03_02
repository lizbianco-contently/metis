Under the previous order, the Democratic \nleader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this debate has now continued for more \nthan a month. There have been many conflicting statements and some \nmisunderstandings, but no one should misinterpret this vote. It is not \na vote on balancing the budget or reducing the deficit. Democrats have \nbeen committed to that for a long time, and our record is very, very \nclear. We demonstrated that in 1990 on a very tough vote. And, without \nany help from Republicans, we again demonstrated that in 1993; $600 \nbillion of deficit reduction later, we find ourselves here this \nafternoon. We are prepared to continue that commitment for as long as \nit takes to put this debt behind us for good.\n  So no one should be misled by the political rhetoric about our \nposition. We will do what we have already done. We will work to bring \ndown the debt with or without a constitutional amendment.\n  This debate really should not even have to be about the need for a \nconstitutional amendment. By my count, there are over 70 Senators who \nfavor one. More than two-thirds of this body favor writing a balanced \nbudget requirement into the U.S. Constitution, and I am one of them.\n  What this debate is all about is what that amendment should say. And \nwhat our Republican colleagues have said is that it has to be this \nversion, this amendment, or no amendment at all. That is what this \ndebate has been about.\n  Can we improve upon this amendment? Can we make sure that it is our \nbest effort? We have made a number of suggestions that, in our view, \nwould have vastly improved the language that we are about to vote on \ntoday. We proposed that we lay out just how we achieve our goal before \nwe begin doing so, as any other undertaking of this importance and \nmagnitude would require. The majority said, ``No, we'll do that later. \nTrust us. Somehow it will all work out.''\n  We proposed changes that deal with national emergencies. The majority \nsaid, ``No, we'll do that later.''\n  We proposed changes to put the Federal Government on the same level \nas other governments as we make important budgetary decisions. The \nmajority said, ``No. We'll probably have to do that later.''\n  We proposed changes to give the Federal Government the ability to \ndeal with recessions. The majority said, ``No.''\n  Most importantly, we proposed that Social Security not be used to pay \noff the debt. We have argued that we have not solved anything if we \ncreate one debt to erase another. If we go further into debt to senior \ncitizens, even more than we have already, to bring down the debt to all \ntaxpayers, then what have we accomplished? And, more importantly, \nperhaps, what have we lost?\n  I believe we will have lost our credibility. We will have lost our \ncommitment to working people who are counting on us this afternoon. We \nwill have lost our only real hope of balancing the budget correctly.\n  So let me make it very clear. The vast majority of Democrats support \na balanced budget. Many support a constitutional amendment to require \none. But virtually no Democrat supports \n [[Page S3312]] using the Social Security funds that we now have to do \nso. It is wrong. We all know it is wrong. Republicans know it, and \nDemocrats know it.\n  Originally, Republicans said it was wrong, but they just did not want \nto put it in writing. They wanted the certainty of a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, but they were unwilling to provide the \nsame constitutional certainty for Social Security. Given that \nunwillingness, a significant number of my colleagues were left with no \nchoice. In spite of our best efforts to find a provision that \nRepublicans could accept, we were left with no choice but to vote \nagainst this version of an amendment. So this was their choice. This \namendment could have passed by more than 70 votes.\n  All we ask is that we not rob the bank to pay the debt; that we not \ntake Social Security funds away to do something that we know we must \ndo. Too many people have put too much money into the bank for anyone to \ndo that now. That has been our message--protect current and future \nAmericans who are dependent upon Social Security, and we will find the \nvotes to pass this amendment. We will do it today. The Republicans \nsaid, ``No. No, it is this amendment or no amendment at all.''\n  Already there is talk about using this amendment for political \npurposes. Frankly, I am disappointed to hear that. It makes me wonder \nwhether this was just another political ploy, another bumper sticker \ncreation, courtesy of the Republican National Committee, or something \nreal, something which merits being added to the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  If it is politics--as I suspect this threat to bring the amendment \nback right before the next election may be--then I say, let us do it, \nlet us have it out then, too.\n  The one thing the American people really understand when they see it \nis politics. And they do not like it, not when it comes to amending our \nConstitution, not when it is something this important. And they will \nnot want to see us rob Social Security then any more than they do right \nnow.\n  So, Mr. President, let me emphasize, let me make sure no one \nmisunderstands, Democrats want to work to find a meaningful way to \nreduce the deficit. We all understand the critical nature of this vote, \nno matter how many times we will be called upon to cast it. We stand \nready to work to reduce the debt to zero, just as we have already done. \nWe have done it before. We will do it again.\n  But we also stand ready to keep our commitments to all working \nAmericans. We will do that today, too, and we will do it again. As we \ncast our vote, future generations are counting upon all of us to do no \nless.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. First, let me announce that, after the vote, the Armed \nServices Committee will meet in the President's room to report out some \nnominations.\n  Mr. President, let me just be brief, because I think we have said \nabout all we can say about the balanced budget amendment. We will vote \ntoday. There have been a couple of matters arise since Tuesday and I \nthink a few points bear repeating.\n  I have said many times before that the Senate cannot operate if there \nis any lack of trust between the majority and minority leaders. And I \nhave had such relationships with Senator Mitchell, Senator Byrd, and \nwith Senator Daschle.\n  The distinguished Democratic leader did say, however, that he thought \nmaybe not having the vote on Tuesday may have damaged that \nrelationship. I believe that is not the case. As the Democratic leader \nknows, Senator Hatch and Senator Simon spent much of Tuesday in \ndiscussions, which ultimately led to the amendment by the Senator from \nGeorgia, Senator Nunn. And we even had discussions since that time. In \nfact, as late as 5 o'clock last night, there was some kind of a \nsuggestion put forward by a number of Democrats who had voted for a \nbalanced budget amendment before and now are in opposition.\n  So I think the point is that we did use that time and did try to come \ntogether, as the Democratic leader has just suggested. But I think now \nwe have reached a firm decision and it is time for a vote. The time for \na vote has arrived.\n  I must say, I have been a little bit amused, I guess you would say, \nabout all this talk on the other side about Social Security, \nparticularly after most every Democrat in 1993 voted to increase taxes \non Social Security recipients to the tune of about $25 billion, \naffecting millions and millions of retired people. So I must say I was \na bit amused when I saw all the gnashing of the teeth.\n  I also would put in the Record at this point this year's budget \nresolution, the one that many of my colleagues voted for and are now \nvoting against. The only difference is we changed the date of 2001 that \nSenators voted for last year. It is now 2002. And we also added the \nNunn language.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both of these resolutions be made a part \nof the Record. If anybody wants the facts, the facts are there.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Senate Joint Resolution 41, Balanced Budget Amendment to Constitution \n             as Voted on by the U.S. Senate, March 1, 1994\n\n       Section 1: Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not \n     exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-\n     fifths of each House of Congress shall provide by law for a \n     specific excess of outlays over receipts by a rollcall vote.\n       Section 2: The limit on the debt of the United States held \n     by the public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of \n     the number of each House shall provide by law for such an \n     increase by a rollcall vote.\n       Section 3: Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall \n     transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the United \n     States Government for that fiscal year, in which total \n     outlays do not exceed total receipts.\n       Section 4: No bill to increase revenue shall become law \n     unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each \n     House by a rollcall vote.\n       Section 5: The Congress may waive the provisions of this \n     article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is \n     in effect. The provisions of this article may be waived for \n     any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in \n     military conflict which causes an imminent and serious \n     military threat to national security and is so declared by a \n     joint resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number \n     of each House, which becomes law.\n       Section 6: The Congress shall enforce and implement this \n     article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on \n     estimates of outlays and receipts. The power of any court to \n     order relief pursuant to any case or controversy arising \n     under this Article shall not extend to ordering any remedies \n     other than a declaratory judgment or such remedies as \n     specifically authorized in implementing legislation pursuant \n     to this section.\n       Section 7: Total receipts shall include all receipts of the \n     United States Government except those derived from borrowing. \n     Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States \n     Government except those for repayment of debt principal.\n       Section 8: This article shall take effect beginning with \n     fiscal year 2001 or with the second fiscal year beginning \n     after its ratification, whichever is later.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution as Amended by Senator \n                                  Nunn\n\n                               Article --\n\n       Section 1. Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not \n     exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-\n     fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall \n     provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts \n     by a rollcall vote.\n       Section 2. The limit on the debt of the United States held \n     by the public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of \n     the whole number of each House shall provide by law for such \n     an increase by a rollcall vote.\n       Section 3. Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall \n     transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the United \n     States Government for that fiscal year, in which total \n     outlays do not exceed total receipts.\n       Section 4. No bill to increase revenue shall become law \n     unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each \n     House by a rollcall vote.\n       Section 5. The Congress may waive the provisions of this \n     article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is \n     in effect. the provisions of this article may be waived for \n     any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in \n     military conflict which causes an imminent and serious \n     military threat to national security and is so declared by a \n     joint resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number \n     of each house, which becomes law.\n       Section 6. The Congress shall enforce and implement this \n     article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on \n     estimates of outlays and receipts. The judicial power of the \n     United States shall not extend to any case of controversy \n     arising under this Article except as may be specifically \n     authorized by legislation adopted pursuant to this section.\n\n[[Page S3313]]\n\n       Section 7. Total receipts shall include all receipts of the \n     United States Government except those derived from borrowing. \n     Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States \n     Government except for those for repayment of debt principal.\n       Section 8. This article shall take effect beginning with \n     fiscal year 2002 or with the second fiscal year beginning \n     after its ratification, whichever is later.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. And there was nothing in the resolution last year that \nprotected Social Security. All this talk about protecting Social \nSecurity is a cover for the taxes that were increased on Social \nSecurity benefits by the very people who are announcing, ``Oh, no; we \ncannot touch Social Security.'' We want the record to be clear on that \nissue, as people look at it in the next few months. There will be ample \ntime to look at it in the next few months.\n  On January 26, the Senate voted 83 to 16 to adopt a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment stating we should not raise Social Security taxes or \ncut Social Security benefits in order to balance the budget. On \nFebruary 9, the Senate adopted a motion reaffirming that commitment by \na vote of 87 to 10. The House had done the same by a vote of 412 to 8. \nNo doubt about it, there is clearly strong, bipartisan support to \nprotect Social Security.\n  So all these other machinations and all the games that have been \nplayed in the last few days was an effort. I do not know what the \neffort was all about. I guess maybe to tell people, ``Well, I voted one \nway last year, but this is a different year, and things have changed.'' \nWell, nothing has changed in the amendment. That is why I want the \namendments put in the Record, so the American people know precisely \nthat some people voted for one thing, and against the same thing the \nnext year. That is fine. We have a right to change our mind.\n  It seems to me that if we increase taxes on Social Security \nbeneficiaries $24.6 billion that probably is a cause for some concern. \nAnd not a single Republican in either the House or the Senate joined in \nthat new tax on senior citizens. Not a single Republican.\n  Let me again state for the Record that later this year, Republicans \nwill put forward a detailed 5-year plan to put the budget on the path \nof balance by the year 2002. Our plan will not raise taxes and our plan \nwill not--will not--touch Social Security. I do not know what other \nassurances some people need. Maybe they do not really want assurances.\n  Make no mistake about it, everything else--every other spending \nprogram--will be on the table. If this amendment fails, you are still \ngoing to get the tough votes. We will offer the plan that we would have \noffered if this amendment had passed, and then we will see where \neverybody falls out, see how strongly they feel about spending cuts--\nnot tax increases, but spending cuts.\n  When all is said and done, it all comes down to one question: Does \nthe Senate of the United States trust the American people? Well, 98 \npercent of Republicans do, and less than 30 percent of Democrats do. \nThat is how it adds up: 14 out of 47, and 52 out of 53. So we trust the \nAmerican people by almost 98 percent.\n  We are not changing the Constitution if we pass this amendment. The \nFounding Fathers did not give Congress that power. Instead, they \nreserved that power to the States and to the people, and by passing \nthis amendment, we are in effect authorizing a national debate on the \nmerits of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. That is all \nwe do. And, over the years, we will have the pros and cons because all \n50 States chosen by people in our States are going to make that \ndetermination--Democrats and Republicans and State legislatures in 50 \nStates.\n  There is a word for that process. It is called democracy. It is \ncalled democracy. Nobody is going to predict with any certainty what \nthe final outcome will be. Republicans control both Chambers in 19 \nStates, Democrats control both Chambers in 18 States, and in 12 States \neach party controls one Chamber. Nebraska has a nonpartisan \nlegislature.\n  It will be tough to get 38 out of 50 States to approve this \namendment. I will do my best if it passes to convince the Kansas \nLegislature to adopt the amendment. I know the President will do his \nbest to sway the people the other way. Even though 80 percent of the \nAmerican people want this, President Clinton knows best. ``This is not \nwhat you want,'' he is saying to the American people. ``You want \nsomething else: Higher taxes, higher debt.''\n  Thomas Jefferson himself envisioned such a process when he wrote:\n\n       I know no safe depository of the ultimate power of society \n     but people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened \n     enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, \n     the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their \n     discretion by education.\n\n  If there is one man who knows as much about the Constitution as \nThomas Jefferson, it is probably Senator Robert Byrd. On August 4, \n1982, in announcing his support for the balanced budget amendment, \nSenator Byrd said:\n\n       Under our democratic system, to put a question of this \n     magnitude directly to the people is a wise and proper action. \n     Therefore I will vote for this amendment--and thus vote to \n     put this question directly to the American people. I cannot \n     doubt that their ultimate decision will be the right one.\n\n  Nothing has changed since, except the debt has gotten bigger. We have \nnot exercised the will of the Congress. It has gotten bigger. I think \nthe American people are enlightened enough to make this decision. I \nhappen to believe what some still think about this revolutionary \nprinciple--revolutionary principle--``Trust the people.'' We do not \nwant to trust the people--98 percent of us do. I am willing to trust \nthe American people to make the right decision. Those who oppose the \namendment are not.\n  That is what this debate is all about. Returning power to the people, \nreturning power to the States. That is what the American people say \nthey want. They want to make decisions. We are not going to give them \nthat opportunity. We will take that away from them if we do not adopt \nthis amendment. What we are saying is, in effect, if the amendment \nfails, ``Washington knows best. This is business as usual; we know what \nyou want. Don't tell us you know what you want, because we know better. \nEighty percent of the people don't have any idea what they are talking \nabout.'' That is the attitude that spurred last November's revolution.\n  Finally, I ask my colleagues to listen to the words Thomas Jefferson \nspoke in his first inaugural address:\n\n       Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the \n     government of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the \n     government of others? Or have we found angels in the forms of \n     kings to govern him? Let history answer this question.\n\n  Mr. President, history will remember how we respond to that question \ntoday. As for me, and as for a lot of our colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, the answer is ``democracy, democracy.'' The answer is, \n``Trust the people; trust the people.'' We trusted them when they voted \nfor us. But the election is over now. Promises that were made are in \nthe ashcan. They do not mean anything now, because I have been elected, \nwe have been elected.\n  I just suggest we ought to pass this amendment; we ought to send it \nto the States. And we ought to say to the State legislatures, ``Make \nthe decision.'' And if 38 ratify the amendment, it becomes part of the \nConstitution. If 38 do not, it fails. So I urge my colleagues, there is \nstill time to repent. There is still time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the joint resolution.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J.Res. 1) proposing a balanced budget \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask that Senators remain at their desks, and vote from \ntheir desks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendment and third reading \nof the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the joint resolution \nto be read a third time.\n  The joint resolution was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to thank several people, and then I \nwould like to take a couple of minutes for a brief comment on what has \njust taken place.\n  I wish to thank Senator Hatch, who has been great to work with, who \nhas been a real leader on this. Senator Craig came over from the House \nand was like a breath of fresh air working on all of this. Senator \nThurmond through the years provided leadership.\n  On our side, Senator Heflin was very helpful. I have to acknowledge a \nformer Senator who helped prior to this time, Senator DeConcini; my \ncolleague from Illinois, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun has been superb; \nSenator Campbell; Senator Robb. And I also want to pay tribute to the \nleader of the opposition, with whom I sincerely differ on this, Senator \nByrd. He is a powerful and highly respected opponent.\n  I also want to thank Congressman Charlie Stenholm and the House \nMembers for all the work they did, and very specifically Aaron \nRappaport from my staff, and all the other staff members on my staff \nand the other staffs who spent so much time on this.\n  Mr. President, this is a sad day in the history of our Nation. We \nhave narrowly missed the opportunity to give generations to come a \nbrighter future. Presented the chance to break our addiction to \neconomic gluttony, by the narrowest of margins, we have determined that \nwe do not have the will to kick the habit. Like a pregnant woman whose \nchild to be will suffer from a cocaine addiction, we cannot summon the \nwill to break our debt addiction even though we know it will harm our \nchildren.\n  We will break our addiction sometime in the future, the Senate said \nin 1986, when it also failed to pass the balanced budget amendment by \none vote. The national debt then was $2 trillion. We can solve our \nproblem without a constitutional amendment, voices on the Senate floor \nurged then and, of course, we have not. Now the debt is $4.8 trillion \ninstead of $2 trillion, and the attractive siren song of the opposition \nis the same.\n  It would have been easier to break the habit in 1986 than in 1995, \nand it is easier in 1995 than it will be in 1999. Each year, the grip \nof the addiction grows, and each year we spend more and more on \ninterest and less and less in ways that help the most vulnerable in our \nsociety.\n  We are headed toward monetizing our debt and devaluing our currency, \nthe steps nations take historically as they pile up too much debt. No \nnation has come close to accumulating the amount of peacetime debt that \nwe have. When and if monetizing our debt occurs, everyone in our \nsociety will suffer.\n  Ironically, among those who will suffer the most are those on Social \nSecurity, because of the devaluation of the U.S. Treasury bonds which \nsecure the Social Security retirement trust funds. I say ironically \nbecause much of the opposition to the balanced budget amendment has \nbeen mounted in the name of Social Security. The threat to Social \nSecurity is the debt, and the real way to protect Social Security is \nthis balanced budget amendment. Instead of giving our economy a lift \nwith lower interest rates that come with the reduced deficit, the \nSenate has made a decision to stumble along and have higher interest \nrates.\n  There are at least two proposals to move us on a glidepath toward a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002 without a constitutional amendment. I \nprobably will support one of them, though it is unlikely the goal will \nbe achieved without the discipline of the constitutional amendment. But \neven if the goal is achieved, because there is not the long-term \nassurance to the financial markets that a constitutional amendment \noffers, interest rates will not be reduced as much. The Nation will pay \na staggering interest penalty for which we will get nothing other than \nhigher interest rates. Those who purchase bonds combine the need for a \nsmall profit margin plus a hedge against inflation. We have just \nincreased the cost of the hedge against inflation.\n  Because the trade deficit is tied into the budget deficit, we will \ncontinue to export more American jobs, and our standard of living, that \ncould rise significantly, will at best move up modestly, perhaps \ndecline. With higher interest rates there will be less investment that \nwould create more industrial and construction jobs.\n  Is it impossible to kick the debt habit? No. But each year that goes \nby it becomes more difficult and at some point it becomes politically \nimpossible. I do not know where that point is nor does anyone else. We \nhave done today what most addicts do--postpone the tough decision. \nFuture generations will not look upon this day with pride.\n   [[Page S3315]] I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I associate myself with the excellent \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from Illinois. I do not think \nanybody could have said it better. I do not think anybody could have \nsaid it more clearly. I personally feel he has done us a great honor in \nmaking these remarks and in pointing out the future of our country--\nwhat we are going to go through if we do not ultimately pass this \nbalanced budget amendment--I would say within the near future.\n  I also want to pay tribute to him for his stalwart steadfastness in \nstanding up for this balanced budget amendment. It has not been easy \nfor him on his side of the floor, with only 13 other of his 47 Democrat \ncolleagues. I know what he has gone through. I pay tremendous tribute \nto him as one of our great leaders for this cause at this time.\n  Mr. President, I also would like to pay tribute to my colleague \nSenator Craig for the long hours and efforts he has made as the leader \nof our rapid response team. He has worked tirelessly his whole \ncongressional career, both in the House and here in the Senate, to try \nto pass a balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  There are many others who are too numerous to mention. The \ndistinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, has \nbeen our leader on the balanced budget amendment ever since I got here. \nSenator Heflin on the other side of the floor, Senator Exon, who worked \nso hard, and many, many others. I do not want to leave anybody out, but \nlet me leave it at that.\n  I want to pay tribute to my colleague from West Virginia. Unlike, I \nthink, a number of others--a number of others--he has sincerely \nbelieved in his position and he has advocated it with force and with \nstrength and, frankly, deserves credit for winning this battle. I want \nto pay tribute to him as a floor leader and an acknowledged master of \nfloor debate and as somebody for whom I have a great deal of respect. I \ndo so because of the way he has conducted himself and the way he has \nhandled his side of the debate in this matter. You have to have respect \nfor opponents who believe in what they are doing.\n  But having said that, if there is something I feel particularly badly \nabout, it is that a handful of Senators and the President have won this \nbattle and the American people have lost. That is my opinion and I \nacknowledge that. Everybody knows how sincerely I feel about this issue \nas well. The people have lost this skirmish today. But this battle is \nnot over.\n  I just want the American people to understand that one of the things \nI feel worst about in this whole debate is that some have tried to \nbring Social Security into the debate to frighten our senior citizens, \nas though that was really a part of this debate. I do not think there \nis a senior citizen in this country, not one that I know of who cares \nfor his or her country, who does not understand that when you are \ntalking about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, you can \nhave no mere statutory programs exempted from or referred to in the \ntext of the basic governing document of our country. It has never been \ndone, and it is not right. If you attempt to carve out a special \nexception to the basic law of the land for a specific group of \nstatutory beneficiaries, you will divide the country and hurt everybody \nelse who does not belong to that special interest group. Ironically, in \nthis case, you would hurt those beneficiaries too. The biggest threat \nto Social Security is our Government's profligacy. And an exemption for \nSocial Security would lead some to try to use the trust fund to pay for \nother popular programs or create a loophole to keep deficit-spending. \nAnd it would keep the debt going up, which would ultimately harm those \non fixed incomes and risk the viability of the trust funds.\n  Having said that, I do not think there is a senior citizen in this \ncountry presently on Social Security, who understands the importance of \nour country and how to keep it great, who would not be willing to \nsacrifice to keep it great if they were so called upon. And I believe \nthey would not want to have a specific carve-out of any statutory \nprograms--no matter how important--in the text of the Constitution. We \njust don't do that in the Constitution. To make Social Security part of \nthis debate in the way it was by some, I felt, was beneath the dignity \nof the Senate. Some were sincere, I will acknowledge that. But let us \nbe clear, for three or four decades now we have taken Social Security \nfunds and counted them as receipts to the Federal Government in the \nbudget system, we certainly have since President Johnson established \nthe unified budget system--under both Democrat and Republican Senates \nand Presidents. For people to make Social Security and the unified \nbudget a political football I think was just plain, downright wrong. To \nfrighten our senior citizens for mere political purposes is despicable.\n  Having said that, just so everybody in this country understands, this \nis only battle No. 1. This is not over. We lost today, 66 to 34. We had \n99 percent of all Republicans in both Houses voting for the balanced \nbudget amendment. One percent did not. Less than 33 percent of the \nDemocrats voted for it. So we have a clear delineation, as far as I am \nconcerned. But I praise the 14 Democrats who did vote for it here today \nbecause they are heroes, in my eyes.\n  The reason the vote was 65 to 35 is because our distinguished \nmajority leader, knowing that this war is not over, over the balanced \nbudget amendment, he had to switch his vote and vote ``no'' so that he \ncould make the procedural motion to reconsider the vote so that the \namendment can come back again--perhaps before the end of this year, \ncertainly before the end of next year.\n  This is just vote one on the balanced budget amendment. There \ndefinitely will be another vote. And if the American people understand \nthis issue and they really want to do something about it, they should \nstart letting those who voted against the amendment know how they feel. \nThey should start letting them know now. I call on all senior citizens \nto start telling their representatives and the special interest \nlobbyists, ``Quit playing games with Social Security, and do what is \nright for the country,'' and if they do so and we pass the balanced \nbudget amendment, Social Security, as the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois has wisely spoken, will then be secure.\n  The only way to make Social Security secure--it seems to me the only \nway--is to keep a strong economy. And with business as usual--without \nthe balanced budget amendment--we are not going to be doing that.\n  Mr. President, an effort such as the one we have been involved in \nover the past month requires the time, talent, and commitment of a \nlarge number of people. While I cannot name them all, I would like at \nthis time to extend my gratitude to the Senators and staff who were so \ninstrumental on this.\n  Let me first thank our majority leader for his pivotal role.\n  Senators Simon, Craig, and Thurmond, of course, have my admiration \nand my thanks.\n  I am also especially proud of all of our new Senators who have \ngraciously and effectively played a major role: Senators Lott, \nDomenici, Coverdell, and Smith, and all 11 of our new Senators, \nSenators Abraham, Ashcroft, DeWine, Frist, Grams, Inhofe, Kyl, \nSantorum, Snowe, Thomas, and Thompson have also joined in leading our \neffort over this past month. And Senator Nunn has been, as always, a \nstudious and effective proponent.\n  Finally, I would like to single out some of the staff members who \nworked so long and hard on this matter: David Taylor (Dole); Aaron \nRappaport and Susan Kaplan (Simon); Damon Tobias and Alan Kay (Craig); \nThad Strom (Thurmond); Andrew Effron (Nunn); Bill Hoagland and Austin \nSmythe (Domenici), and David Hoppe and Alison Carroll (Lott).\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I would like to thank the very special people \nwho have worked with me on this issue: Shawn Bentley; Larry Block; \nSharon Prost; Mark Disler; Manus Cooney; Steve Tepp; Jason Adams, and \nSteven Schlesinger. They have all worked long and hard hours in the \nmost dedicated fashion, and I love them for their devotion to duty and \nour country.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  [[Page S3316]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will not detain the Senate. Mr. President, \nI do not expect to take 7 minutes. However, I ask unanimous consent \nthat, in the event I should need an additional 2 minutes, I not be \ninterrupted and that I have them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President,\n\n       The way a crow\n       Shook down on me\n       The dust of snow\n       From a hemlock tree\n       Has given my heart\n       A change of mood\n       And saved some part\n       Of a day I had rued.\n\n  I congratulate the Senate today. The debate has been constructive, \nthe occasion has been historic, and the issue has been decided in favor \nof the sanctity of the Constitution of the United States of America.\n  The debate has been full and extensive, in the best tradition of the \nSenate, and such debates have become more infrequent in recent years. I \nbelieve the outcome is the right result because of the thoroughness and \nlength of the debate. I hope that this indicates a return to the long \ntradition of real debate on great national issues.\n  There was no way to cure the ills of this amendment. It was fatally \nflawed from the outset. There is virtually no way such an amendment can \nbe written without rearranging the carefully constructed balance of \npowers hammered out by the giant intellect and wisdom of the Framers \nover 200 years ago, or jeopardizing our Nation's economic or national \nsecurity in times of crisis or peril.\n  There are no statutory fixes that can solve the Social Security trust \nfund problem or any of the other many difficulties inherent in the \nlanguage of this constitutional amendment. Statutes can never cure a \nconstitutional amendment's flaws. The Constitution supersedes all \nlegislation that is inconsistent therewith. It is the final arbiter, \nregardless of what promises are made or what legislation is enacted.\n  So, this unwise and dangerous proposal has been rejected, as it \nshould have been. The proposal has never been well understood by the \npeople. It seems simple, and espouses a worthy goal, but it neither \nguarantees a balanced budget nor tells the people how one will be \nachieved.\n  We hear claims that 80 percent of the American people want this \namendment. But the proponents conveniently ignore the deeper probing of \nthose polls, which show that the 80 percent figure is a hollow number, \nwhich dissolves when questions about how the amendment would actually \nbe applied are posed. People do not want the Social Security trust fund \nto be raided. And it has become clear that the trust fund would be \nlooted, should this amendment ever scar the Constitution. The amendment \nwas and is a seductive, but false and dangerous promise--nothing more.\n  We have before us, now, both a responsibility and an opportunity with \nthe defeat of this constitutional amendment. We have a responsibility \nnot to delay serious progress on deficit reduction, as the amendment \nwould have allowed us to do. We also have an opportunity to put \npartisan bickering aside and begin to take steps to get our fiscal \nhouse in order. That is what the American people truly want to see. \nThey want us to put the posturing and bickering aside and get down to \nbusiness together.\n  So, I eagerly await the majority's plan for deficit reduction. And, I \ntrust that every Senator on this side of the aisle is ready to play a \ncooperative and constructive role in developing a plan that can become \na reality. This has been a bruising debate, but it is time to let the \nfires cool, and come together for the Nation. Let us begin.\n  Before I close, I want to commend Senator Hatch for his fair and \njudicious handling of this matter.\n  I also wish to again express my admiration for the statesmanlike \nleadership of Senator Tom Daschle. His is a bright and courageous \nspirit. And, Senator Mark Hatfield has written his own ``profile in \ncourage,'' as have Senators Dorgan, Conrad, Bingaman, Hollings, \nFeinstein, and Ford. Senators Dodd, Sarbanes, Moynihan, Boxer, Kennedy, \nReid, Levin, Bumpers, and Johnston have helped greatly to clarify and \nenlighten the debate on this side of the aisle, as have many others.\n  But, a special word should go to Senator Paul Simon. A more sincere \nproponent of this proposal is not to be found. Today's outcome was not \na loss for the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois. His belief \nin this solution, his absolute commitment to his cause, and his gentle \nand fair deportment throughout this debate have added nothing but \nadditional lustre to the fine legacy he leaves here in the Senate. I \nthank him for being the man that he is. I am proud to serve with him, \nand deeply honored to call him my friend.\n\n       I shall be telling this with a sigh\n       Somewhere ages and ages hence;\n       Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--\n       I took the one less traveled by,\n       And that has made all the difference.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a \nletter dated March 1, 1995, to the distinguished majority leader along \nwith an accompanying compromise proposal concerning Social Security \nwhich I and four of my colleagues delivered to the distinguished leader \nyesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock. Had we voted on this proposal, we \ncould have passed the balanced budget amendment in a flash.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 1, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert J. Dole,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: We have received from Senator Domenci's \n     office a proposal to address our concerns about using the \n     Social Security trust funds to balance the Federal budget. We \n     have reviewed this proposal, and after consultations with \n     legal counsel, believe that this statutory approach does not \n     adequately protect Social Security. Specifically, \n     Constitutional experts from the Congressional Research \n     Service advise us that the Constitutional language of the \n     amendment will supersede any statutory constraint.\n       We want you to know that all of us have voted for, and are \n     prepared to vote for again, a balanced budget amendment. In \n     that spirit, we have attached a version of the balanced \n     budget amendment that we believe can resolve the impasse over \n     the Social Security issue.\n       To us, the fundamental question is whether the Federal \n     Government will be able to raid the Social Security trust \n     funds. Our proposal modifies those put forth by Senators Reid \n     and Feinstein to address objections raised by some Members of \n     the Majority. Specifically, our proposal prevents the Social \n     Security trust funds from being used for deficit reduction, \n     while still allowing Congress to make any warranted changes \n     to protect the solvency of the funds. The prior language of \n     the Reid and Feinstein amendments was not explicit that \n     adjustments could be made to ensure the soundness of the \n     trust funds.\n       If the Majority Party can support this solution, then we \n     are confident that the Senate can pass the balanced budget \n     amendment with more than 70 votes. If not, then we see no \n     reason to delay further the vote on final passage for the \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Byron L. Dorgan.\n     Ernest F. Hollings.\n     Wendell H. Ford.\n     Harry M. Reid.\n     Dianne Feinstein.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                               Article --\n\n       Section 1. Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not \n     exceed total receipts for that fiscal year unless three-\n     fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall \n     provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts \n     by a rollcall vote.\n       Section 2. The limit on the debt of the United States held \n     by the public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of \n     the whole number of each House shall provide by law for such \n     an increase by a rollcall vote.\n       Section 3. Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall \n     transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the United \n     States Government for that fiscal year in which total outlays \n     do not exceed total receipts.\n       Section 4. No bill to increase revenue shall become law \n     unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each \n     House by a rollcall vote.\n       Section 5. The Congress may waive the provisions of this \n     article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is \n     in effect.

Mr. President, I have included this information at this \npoint because it marks the first opportunity that we have had to clear \nthe record. I would like to clarify what I think were misleading \nstatements made earlier by some of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. Mr. President, in 1982 I worked with the distinguished \nSenator from Utah and voted for a balanced budget amendment that time. \nIt was not identical to the balanced budget amendment voted on today.\n  Mr. President, I am a senior citizen as is my colleague, Senator \nThurmond. We, at age 72, have to take the benefits. And I can tell you, \nour contemporaries are not worried about receiving our benefits, \nbecause the books show almost one-half trillion dollar surplus in \nSocial Security reserves. Indeed, seniors are more concerned about the \nfight to come on Medicare. So let us put to rest the notion that we are \ntrying to frighten senior citizens. Rather, what we are attempting to \ndo is to try and keep a solemn trust with middle America. Everybody \nsays we need to do something for middle America. It is middle America \nthat is paying for me to receive Social Security benefits now, and it \nis middle America who, come their time in the next century, will be \ntaxed again when they become eligible to receive benefits.\n  The issue here should be about stopping government deficits and not \nsimply moving the general fund deficit over to the Social Security \ndeficit. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nspecifically articulated the latter idea. Indeed, my friend, the \nSenator from Mississippi said on ``Face the Nation'' on February 5:\n\n       Nobody--Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, \n     moderate--is even thinking about using Social Security to \n     balance the budget.\n\n  Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Mississippi. But the \nactions of some of my Republican friends seem to indicate otherwise. \nLike John Mitchell, the former Attorney General, used to say, ``Watch \nwhat we do, not what we say.'' Just last evening on ``Larry King \nLive,'' the distinguished Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, said:\n\n       I think we ought to balance the budget counting Social \n     Security first, and then if we want to balance it without \n     counting it, do it second.\n\n  Clearly, this statement reflects an intent to use Social Security \nsurpluses.\n  In addition, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, has said: ``You can't leave the biggest American program off \nbudget.'' However, my friend, the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico, voted to leave it off budget both in committee in July 1990 and \nlater on the floor in reference to the Hollings-Heinz amendment which \npassed 98 to 2, and was signed into law by President Bush.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the law be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Budget Enforcement Act\n\n                      Subtitle C--Social Security\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security from All Budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in any other surplus or \n     deficit totals required by this title.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Next, Mr. President, I refer to Senator Grassley of \nIowa who said:\n\n       The leadership of the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate have promised not to touch the Social Security \n     retirement program for at least 5 years.\n\n  Do they have it in mind after 5 years? On March 1, my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Craig said:\n\n       Without access to the Social Security surpluses, you would \n     create a much higher hurdle in trying to balance the budget.\n\n  That is true, but not requiring that higher hurdle means that you are \ngoing to use Social Security funds.\n  Finally, on February 5, 1995, the distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Dole said:\n\n       I also believe that we can't keep Social Security off the \n     table forever.\n\n  Mr. President, that is not the promise we made in 1983. When this \nSenator and others raised Social Security FICA taxes, we promised \notherwise. We must keep the contract made by President Roosevelt in \n1935; we must keep the promise made back in 1983 that these taxes would \nnot be used to pay for foreign aid, welfare, or any other Government \nprogram; and we must continue in our resolve to keep our commitment to \nmiddle America intact.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will be brief because several other \nSenators want to speak this afternoon. I did want to comment and thank \na variety of people who have worked so closely with myself and Senator \nHatch of Utah and Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, in attempting to pass \nthis important amendment, so that we can propose it to the citizens of \nour country for their consideration.\n  Let me, first of all, recognize Damon Tobias on my staff, who \nliterally has become ``Mr. Constitutional Amendment on the Balanced \nBudget'' as he has worked for me over a good number of years and is \nrecognized for his authority and expertise in the area. Throughout all \nof these efforts for the last good number of months, he has been \nassisted by Alan Kay on my staff, and recently by a legislative fellow \nRoy Fairchild, and an intern, Dean Sorensen, who have done a \ntremendously masterful job in cooperation with all the rest of my \nstaff, in being able to supply to the Senate a vast array of \ninformation and facts that deal with this most important issue, and to \nassemble them in a way that was readily usable so we could debate this, \nnow for nearly 5 full weeks, without breaks in the debate and with \nample material to supply the Record and to hopefully have given the \ncitizens of our country ample information in making a choice that I had \nhoped we would have the wisdom to give them.\n  But the vote turned out otherwise today. So we will be back again to \nrevisit this issue--next week or next month or next year. And we will, \nfor a very simple reason, Mr. President: There is not a Senator on this \nfloor who has the right to deny the American people an opportunity to \nchange their law--not our law but their law--the Constitution, the \norganic act that governs our country and, most importantly, Mr. \nPresident, the very law that governs us.\n  I will have to admit there has been a display of knowledge here that \nverges on all knowledge and all knowing, that this is the seat of \nwisdom, and from this seat, all decisions for America and Americans \nwill be made.\n  I suggest to those who serve here that that will be denied. There \nwill come a day--and it will be very soon--when Americans will speak \nagain to those who deny them the opportunity \n[[Page S3318]] to change their Nation in a way they see fit to change \nit, to protect the Social Security system, to assure that the \nGovernment governs properly but, most importantly, to look to the \nfuture and to honor the future.\n  Today we saw a Senate that looked backward. We saw a Senate that said \nthat the past is better than the future. Are we going to be guardians \nof the past, or are we truly going to be the visionaries of the future? \nI suggest that the American people, in November, were talking of our \nfuture. They were most assuredly not talking of our past--for the past \nis $4.8 trillion of debt.\n  This body--all of us, all Senators alike--has to take the \nresponsibility for that debt. And today and for the last 5 weeks, we \nhave struggled to give one moment of time in history to the American \npeople. So they could choose how we would handle that debt. Yet, the \ncentral power and the central wisdom prevailed today. I suggest that it \nis not the wisdom of the American people, nor was it their wish.\n  So Orrin Hatch, Larry Craig and, hopefully, Paul Simon, before he \nretires, will have an opportunity to come to the floor of the Senate \nagain, once the American people have recognized that President Clinton \ndenied them that opportunity today, that he once again backtracked away \nfrom his pledge to the American people that he would progressively and \nin a positive sense bring down the deficit. This year, in his budget \nresolution, he walked away and denied what was once a promise and a \npledge.\n  I suggest that the American people will not be denied, and they will \nhave the opportunity to change the organic law like other Congresses in \nthe past have seen the wisdom to allow them that choice.\n  I am amazed, Mr. President; I am absolutely amazed that even one \nSenator would not allow the citizens of his or her State the right to \nmake a choice. But that was denied today--falsely denied, wrongly \ndenied. I suggest that those citizens, in the long-term, will not be \ndenied.\n  It has been a tremendous opportunity for me and for all of those \ncolleagues who have joined with me in this issue and in this debate. \nAnd I would agree with the Senator from West Virginia, it has been a \npositive debate. It has been most constructive, and all ramifications \nof the issue have been thoroughly brought to this floor, some falsely, \nsome under improper clothing or dress, some presented in ways that were \nillusionary and not fact.\n  But the reality is that in the end this is an issue that will not go \naway and it will ultimately prevail.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank all of those who have joined with me, \nand most assuredly my staff, for their tremendous dedication as we \nbrought this issue to the floor.\n  And I wish to thank the majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Bob Dole, \nfor offering the tremendous leadership and taking the kinds of risks \nthat must be taken as a leader to allow the American people their right \nto govern us.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  I am a supporter of this amendment. I voted for the amendment, and I \nwill vote for it again if it comes up in a similar form that it came up \nnow.\n  But I have a parliamentary inquiry. When the majority leader changed \nhis vote from ``yes'' to ``no'' and did not make the motion to \nreconsider, is it within the province of the majority leader at any \ntime at any place as long as the Senate is in session to move without \ndebate to the motion to reconsider?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, may I have another 60 seconds?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the Senator an additional 60 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am for this amendment. There has been a \nlittle bit of blood that has been spilled on the floor here in the last \ncouple of days, especially when the unanimous consent to vote at a \ncertain time was obviated by our being pushed into a recess, a \nlegitimate parliamentary move, but one that sort of violated the spirit \nof what everyone thought was going to happen.\n  I hope and I plead with the majority leader that when he moves to \nreconsider--and I will be with him; I will be for this under the \nfollowing circumstance: as long as we all know it is going to be done \nand everyone is here. If the majority leader called for a motion to \nreconsider knowing that there were absences that would affect the \noutcome of this vote, I would, on a matter of procedure, change my vote \nto prevent that happening. I do not think that is the majority leader's \nintention, but I do not want to mislead anybody. I think this is so \nimportant that this has to be dealt with straight up, with all 100 \nSenators, unless they are ill, in the hospital and cannot make it, that \nevery consideration should be given to every Senator to be able to \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a number of people have spoken, and I \nknow others are waiting to speak. I do not want to be long.\n  Let me just say what I have said on several occasions, that we owe \nthe American people our best effort. Before this amendment was to go \nout to be voted upon by the American people, we owed it our best \neffort. The amendment that was pending prior to the last vote is not \nour best effort. Accordingly, the Senate has acted wisely in refusing \nto endorse this particular proposal to amend our Constitution.\n  Those who stood against it did so for good reasons. Supporters \nrefused to guarantee that Social Security would be protected.\n  The prospects for this amendment were entirely in the hands of the \nmajority. It was their choice.\n  Until 2 days ago, Senators were asked to bet on the chance that a new \nand different Senate 7 years from now would honor promises made by \nMembers of this Senate.\n  Two days ago, for the first time, the majority conceded that they \nindeed intend to do exactly what we and seniors feared--use the Social \nSecurity trust funds to balance the budget. In a last-minute attempt to \nsecure one more vote for this proposal, they offered to stop raiding \nthe trust funds in 2012. The offer was later modified to 2010 and, \nfinally, to 2008.\n  They missed the point. Those of us fighting to protect Social \nSecurity believe the retirement funds Americans have paid into the \nSocial Security trust funds should be left untouched, period. Every \nAmerican who has paid into the system has a right to expect those funds \nto stay there and be available to them when it is their turn to collect \nthem.\n  For the majority to agree to stop using those funds to buy down the \ndebt after virtually all those funds are gone reflects a cynicism that \nis solely disappointing. As the Senator from north Dakota has stated so \nwell, balancing the budget by depleting the Social Security trust funds \nis not balancing the budget at all.\n  During this debate, 43 motions and amendments were offered, many of \nwhich would have substantially improved the proposals. Forty-two were \nrejected, essentially along partisan lines.\n  We offered language to guarantee the future of the Social Security \nSystem. Several Democratic Senators stated explicitly they would \nsupport the amendment if Social Security were protected.\n  We offered language to protect against unconstitutional Presidential \nimpoundments; language to give States \n[[Page S3319]] a right to know what this amendment would mean to them; \nlanguage to protect veterans' health and pension benefits; language to \npreserve our ability to respond to economic and national security \nemergencies. All of those proposals were rejected.\n  This is no ordinary debate because it is our Constitution we are \nbeing asked to amend. When the stakes are so high, the substance so \nserious, the proposed changes well-tested, the out-of-hand rejection of \nthose amendments is extremely disappointing. That is the reason the \namendment failed.\n  Finally, supporters of this amendment refused, for the full 4 weeks \nthat it has been debated, to come forward and offer any realistic \noutline of a plan by which a balanced budget could be credibly produced \nin 2002.\n  Yet, outside this Chamber, supporters of the balanced budget \namendment have been willing to say that passing the balanced budget \namendment will not balance the budget at all.\n  That is right. It will not.\n  Recently, when he was asked whether the Congress would approve the \nbalanced budget amendment, Speaker Gingrich said, ``For as long as I'm \nallowed to serve as Speaker, whether we do or not, the House will make \ndecisions based on achieving a balanced budget in 2002 with or without \nthe balanced budget amendment.''\n  The majority leader restated his intention to do that today.\n  The Speaker's words reflect the fact that the ability to balance or \nunbalance the budget remains unchanged: it is in the hands of the \nmajority in the Congress.\n  Indeed, a failure to act as he has promised will serve to confirm \nthat the purpose of this debate was to create a rationale for not \nmoving to balance the budget any time soon; that the debate's purpose \nwas to be able to say, we're waiting for the States to ratify.\n  One month from today, on April 1, the Budget Committee is required by \nlaw to report a budget resolution to the Senate. Two weeks later, by \nApril 15, the Congress is required, by law, to give final approval to a \nbudget resolution for the coming year.\n  In 44 days, Congress must have debated, conferenced, and given final \napproval to a budget for fiscal year 1996. That is an obligation of \nthis Congress, not the 107th.\n  That is a responsibility for all of us serving now, not people who \nwill serve in the year 2002. It is what our job is this year, not some \nother person's job in some future time.\n  Nothing has changed the magnitude of the job ahead of us.\n  I have said consistently since the beginning of this debate and the \nbeginning of this session that it is our desire to work cooperatively, \nparticularly in getting the deficit under control.\n  The Republican majority is in control of the Congress. I hope the \nRepublican majority will adhere to the time requirements of the Budget \nAct, which are a matter of law. The budget resolution must be written, \nand action completed soon. Committees need to know their authorized \nallocations for programs. We should be getting down to work on the \nbudget now, because we do not have much time.\n  We have 44 days.\n  The budget is not going to be balanced in 2002 unless the responsible \npeople in 1995 start to focus on their share of the work.\n  It is time we stopped worrying about the responsibilities of future \nCongresses and started to discharge the responsibilities that belong to \neach of us as Members of this Congress this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask that I have 2 minutes following the \ndistinguished Democratic leader to respond to a number of things that \nhave been put in the Record in the last few minutes that should not be \nleft unanswered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I beg the indulgence of my colleagues who \nhave been here on the floor waiting to speak. I would like to take this \nopportunity to respond, for just a few minutes, to a few things that \nhave been said.\n  First, the Senator from Delaware raised some concerns about the \ndistinguished majority leader's intention for the motion to reconsider.\n  He said he would be inclined to support that, but it was essential \nthat there be notice given before that vote could occur. Frankly, I \nthink it is out of order to even imply that the majority leader would \ndo anything other than give ample notice. That is just what he did \ntoday. We had the vote shortly after 2 o'clock. It was agreed to. \nNotification was given.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that the distinguished majority leader \ndoes not participate in sneak tactics. He will notify the Chamber when \nthere will be a vote on a motion to reconsider the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  But I do warn my colleagues, that vote will come again. Today the \nAmerican people lost. The liberals who want to keep on spending just \nthe way they have for the 22 years I have been watching them here in \nthe Congress, the same old tax-and-spend liberals, won today. But there \nwill be another day for the people to try again with the balanced \nbudget amendment. Under this motion to reconsider, they will have that \nopportunity sometime during the remainder of this 104th Congress.\n  Now, with regard to what the distinguished Democratic leader just had \nto say, some Senators continue to imply that there is some difference \nbetween this year's balanced budget amendment and the one we voted on \nlast year. They are the same. Some Senators now say they opposed the \namendment because they were worried about Social Security. Where were \nthey last year? They supported the same amendment.\n  So I would like to ask unanimous consent that the statements of \nSenator Daschle, Senator Ford, Senator Hollings, Senator Dorgan, and \nSenator Feinstein from last year--what they had to say last year about \nthis very same language--be placed into the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the statements were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n       In this debate on a balanced budget amendment, we are being \n     forced to face the consequences of our inaction. Quite \n     simply, we are building a legacy of debt for our children and \n     grandchildren and hamstringing our ability to address \n     pressing national priorities * * * To remedy our fiscal \n     situation, we must stop spending beyond our means. This will \n     not require the emasculation of important domestic \n     priorities, as some suggest.--Senator Thomas Daschle, (D-SD), \n     Cong. Rec., S-1981, February 28, 1994.\n       I hear so much about if 40-some-odd Governors can operate a \n     balanced budget, why can't the Federal Government * * * I \n     operated under it. It worked * * * I think implementation of \n     this amendment will work. I think we can make it work * * * I \n     do not understand why it takes a brain surgeon to understand \n     how you operate a budget the way the States do * * * This is \n     an opportunity to pass a balanced budget amendment that will \n     work and will give us a financially sound future, not only \n     for ourselves but for our children and our grandchildren.--\n     Senator Wendell Ford, D-KY, Cong. Rec., S-2058, March 1, \n     1994.\n       I could offer my colleagues 3.5 trillion reasons for a \n     balanced budget amendment to the Constitution; that is the \n     number of deficit dollars added to the national debt since \n     1981. But I will rest my case with one simple reason: It \n     ought to be a minimal moral obligation of our national \n     government to match its income with its expenditures on an \n     annual basis * * * so that additional debt is not passed on \n     to future generations.--Senator Ernest Hollings, D-SC, Cong. \n     Rec., S-2075, March 1, 1994.\n       This deficit is not about some unusual investment that is \n     going to yield enormous potential rewards. This is a \n     structural operating budget deficit that represents a \n     permanent, continual imbalance between what we raise and what \n     we spend, and the Congress and the American people have \n     conspired together in a way in our political system that \n     prevents us from dealing with it. This constitutional \n     amendment, no matter what one thinks of it, will add to the \n     pressure that we reconcile what we spend with what we raise, \n     and that we begin to assure a better economic future with \n     economic growth and hope and opportunity for our children \n     once again.--Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND), Cong. Rec., S-2068, \n     March 1, 1994.\n       If in their heart of hearts they believe we are not going \n     to be able to balance the budget under the current process, \n     then I believe they should support the balanced budget \n     amendment. At least that is the conclusion to which I have \n     come. Without a constitutional amendment, a balanced budget \n     just is not going to be achieved.--Senator Dianne Feinstein, \n     D-CA, Cong. Rec., S-1831, February 24, 1994.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Yet those Senators today voted against the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Now, Mr. President, what has happened during this debate? What will \n[[Page S3320]] happen when we get to the serious budget votes? Will \nsome Senators say, ``Oh, yes, we want a balanced budget, but we have a \nright to know what will happen for years into the future,'' which is \nwhat they said a week ago. Will they say again, ``We must have some \nfurther guarantees on Social Security,'' or else they won't even vote \nfor deficit reduction now.\n  I will venture a prediction. I predict that they will say, ``Exempt \nthis group from any cuts, and exempt that group.'' And when we get to \nthe budget resolution, they will say, ``Oh, yes, by all means cut \nspending, but not here. Not there. Somewhere else.''\n  Where will their votes be when we get to the real deficit reduction \neffort? Will they be saying, ``Exempt my State, or exempt my region, or \nexempt this special interest''? Or will they be willing to cast the \ntough votes so that we can stop the $200 billion-a-year deficits that \nPresident Clinton has proposed, not just for this year, but for as far \nas the eye can see?\n  Today advocates of the balanced budget amendment lost. But within 2 \nmonths, the Senate will have to face tough choices about spending, \ntough choices about specific programs. The Nation will be watching to \nsee the votes that will then be cast by those who today profess \ndevotion to a balanced budget, while voting against the amendment that \nwould have achieved it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Jeffords and Mr. Leahy pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. J. Res. 28 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3318-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3320-S3325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PEACE AND FREEDOM\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, yesterday the majority leader gave a very \nimportant speech at the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom and outlined \nwhat he called the five global realities that affect our vital interest \nand dictate what it will take to maintain leadership throughout the \nworld.\n  First, the golden age of capitalism. From India and Latin America to \nChina and Russia, 4 billion people formerly under some form of \nsocialism are striving to establish market economies. This offers great \nopportunities for America and American business, but requires American \nleadership to protect our interests and ensure adherence to the rules \nof the international trading system.\n  Second, the new world energy order. Senator Dole correctly noted that \nthe security of the world's oil and gas supplies will remain a vital \nnational interest. At the same time, Iran and Iraq remain hostile \nthreats in the oil-rich gulf, while other energy rich areas in Eurasia \nare subject to disorder. He makes the insightful observation that ``in \nthis new energy order, many of the most important geopolitical \ndecisions--ones on which a nation's sovereignty can depend--will deal \nwith the location and routes for oil and gas pipelines.'' I would add \nthat we are already seeing in the case of Azerbaijan, over which Moscow \nis trying to regain effective control in order to determine the route \nthrough which Azeri oil will flow. Senator Dole concluded that ``our \nstrategy, our diplomacy and our forward military presence need \nreadjusting'' to meet this reality.\n  Third, the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The majority leader \nissued a clarion call yesterday that ``we must prepare now for the \nfuture,'' in which weapons of mass destruction will become more \nwidespread, greatly affecting our vital security interests. He wisely \nasked ``what would we have done--or not done--if Iraq had one or two \nnuclear weapons in 1990? A chilling question and one which we could \nface in just a few years as a real, not a hypothetical question, with \nregard to Iran or North Korea. In response to this threat, Senator Dole \nquite rightly focused on the possibility of preventive military action \nand the need for missile defenses to protect America and our allies.\n  Fourth, increase in extremist religious and ethnic movements. The \nmajority leader highlighted the many areas in which religious or ethnic \npassions have led to conflicts and identified those that pose a threat \nto American interests. America cannot become complacent he wisely \nwarned his audience.\n  Fifth, rivalry with Russia. In perhaps in most important \nobservations, Senator Dole warned that ``geopolitical rivalry with \nRussia did not end with the demise of Soviet communism.'' Quoting Henry \nKissinger, he noted that the Soviet threat was one of both communism \nand imperialism, and while communism was defeated the trend toward \nimperialism remains. While an early supporter of President Yeltsin, \nSenator Dole warned against ``the Clinton administration's misguided \ndevotion to a ``Russia First'' policy, which has turned into a \n``Yeltsin First'' policy, and he quoted President Nixon who told the \nDuma ``when we have differences, we should not assume they will be \novercome by a good personal relationship even at the highest level.'' \nTo buttress his case, the majority leader listed numerous examples of \nhow Moscow has taken actions in recent months that are in conflict with \nU.S. interests.\n  To address this situation, Senator Dole prescribed a ``new realism'' \nabout Russia. This would not mean a return to the cold war past, he \nnoted, but would require ``developing a more honest relationship, one \nthat does not paper over important policy differences with an appeal to \npersonal ties.''\n  In conclusion, Senator Dole reaffirmed the need for American \nleadership to secure peace and freedom for future generations of \nAmericans.\n  In an article just published in the current issue of Foreign Affairs, \nSenator Dole builds on these themes and defines his vision for the \nfuture American role in the world and 10 principles to guide our \ninternational relations. He also provides an incisive critique of the \nClinton administration's foreign policy and how and why it has, in \nSenator Dole's view, failed in various respects.\n  I will merely quote the final paragraph of his article:\n\n       As the United States approaches the next century, two \n     principles should remain constant: protecting American \n     interests and providing American leadership. The end of the \n     Cold War has provided us with a historic opportunity. Such an \n     opportunity should not be forfeited in favor of the pursuit \n     of utopian multilateralism or abandoned through intentional \n     isolationism. We have seen the danger to America's interests, \n     prestige, and influence posed by both of these approaches. \n     Instead, we must look to the lessons of the Cold War to guide \n     our future foreign policy: Put American interests first and \n     lead the way. The future will not wait for America, but it \n     can be shaped by an America second to none.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that in yesterday's speech and this new \narticle with the majority leader has provided us with a clear vision \nand practical proposals for guiding American foreign policy. I would \nurge my colleagues to give the most careful attention to both these \ndocuments, and I would ask unanimous consent to insert them in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. COHEN. In his speech yesterday, President Clinton also reaffirmed \nthat he gives very high priority to ratification of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention.\n  Mr. President, there have been many supporters on this side of the \naisle for efforts to control and ban chemical weapons--Senator Dole, \nSenator Kassebaum, Senator Hatfield, Senator McCain and others come to \nmind, and I have been pleased to work with them on different measures \nto achieve that goal.\n  During the 1980's, I supported replacement of our aging chemical \nstocks with binary weapons, a necessary step to get Moscow to negotiate \nseriously.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Foreign Policy--Winning the Peace: American Leadership and Commitment\n\n                  (By Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole)\n\n       I can't help but think back to the day in January of 1994, \n     when President Nixon made his last visit to the United States \n     Capitol.\n       The occasion was the 25th anniversary of his inauguration \n     as President. And over 100 past and present Senators and \n     Congressmen--Republicans and Democrats alike--attended a \n     lunch honoring President Nixon that Bob Michel and I hosted.\n       At the conclusion of the lunch, President Nixon stood--and \n     without a note in his hand--delivered one of the most \n     compelling speeches many of us could remember.\n       As always, he talked politics, and he also shared some \n     personal reflections on his life and career. But the majority \n     of his remarks \n     [[Page S3321]] were devoted to his life's passion--foreign \n     policy.\n       President Nixon served as our guide, leading us on an \n     around-the-world tour, offering his unique perspective on the \n     strengths and weaknesses of our allies and adversaries, and \n     on the future as he saw it.\n       In his remarks, he repeated a statement that he made again \n     and again during the last year of his life. He said, ``The \n     Soviets have lost the Cold War, but the United States has not \n     yet won it.''\n       Those words were true then--and are just as true today. And \n     while the title of this conference--``After Victory''--has a \n     nice ring to it, I believe the declaration may be a bit \n     premature. It is, after all, possible to win the war and lose \n     the peace--as the years between World War I and World War II \n     demonstrate.\n\n\n                         world still uncertain\n\n       Don't get me wrong. The stage is set. We are the world's \n     only superpower. And the words spoken by Nikita Khrushchev in \n     that famous ``kitchen debate'' were dead wrong. Not only will \n     America's children never live under communism--neither will \n     Russia's children. Still, there are far too many gains to \n     consolidate, and far too many uncertainties in the world to \n     say that a final peace has been won.\n       For example, there is a resurgent Russia, asserting its \n     position around the globe. China has international ambitions \n     of its own, and is in the midst of a leadership transition. \n     There are international terrorists--often state-supported. \n     There are global crime syndicates. There are extremist \n     movements based on religion or ethnic origin. While none of \n     these compare to the challenge of the Soviet empire, each of \n     these can pose threats to important American interests.\n\n\n            five global realities affect america's interests\n\n       It seems to me these multifaceted threats should be viewed \n     in the context of five clear global realities which affect \n     America's fundamental interests. Only by recognizing these \n     realities--and dealing with them with the same commitment \n     which led to the defeat of Soviet Communism--will America \n     truly be able to claim victory.\n\n\n            reality no. 1: the ``golden age of capitalism''\n\n       The first new reality is that the whole world is plunging \n     headlong into what David Hale of the Kemper Organization in \n     Chicago has termed a ``new golden age of capitalism.''\n       I remember when Lech Walesa told me that the definition of \n     a communist economy was ``100 workers standing around one \n     shovel.'' Now, in places like Poland, Russia, India, Latin \n     America, and\n      even China--four billion people formerly under some form of \n     socialism are now fighting with everything they can lay \n     hands on to not just grab a shovel--but to build shovel \n     factories.\n       There are now more than 30 stock markets in the developing \n     world, and capitalization of the four-year-old Shanghai \n     securities exchange has reached $30 billion. Deng Xiaoping \n     himself has said that no one cares any more what color the \n     cat is, as long as it catches mice. The bottom line is that \n     everyone wants to trade, and everyone wants to create and use \n     capital on a world-wide basis.\n       While this new ``golden age of capitalism'' offers great \n     opportunity for America, we must remember that many of the \n     countries so eager to enjoy the benefits of membership in the \n     world trading system may not fully understand or accept the \n     rules and discipline that go with it.\n       A trade war was averted with China, but other threats to \n     U.S. commercial interests will surely arise in the coming \n     months and years, and our continued vigilance and leadership \n     will be required.\n\n\n             reality no. 2: the ``new world energy order''\n\n       The second inescapable reality of the post-20th century \n     world is that the security of the world's oil and gas \n     supplies will remain a vital national interest of the United \n     States and of the other industrial powers.\n       The Persian Gulf--the heartland of world energy for half a \n     century--is still a region of many uncertainties. Saudi \n     Arabia has been weakened financially. Iran and Iraq continue \n     to exhibit great hostility to the West and pose threats to \n     their neighbors. And the boundaries of the oil and gas \n     heartland are being redrawn to the north, to include the \n     great hydrocarbon deposits of the Caucasus, Siberia, and \n     Kazakhstan.\n       In this ``new energy order,'' many of the most important \n     geopolitical decisions--ones on which a nation's sovereignty \n     can depend--will deal with the location and routes for oil \n     and gas pipelines. In response, our strategy, our diplomacy \n     and our forward military presence need readjusting.\n\n\n          reality no. 3: spread of weapons of mass destruction\n\n       The third inevitable reality for America--and for the \n     world--is the fact that while the Berlin Wall may have \n     crumbled, weapons of mass destruction haven't.\n       Listen to just a partial roll call of countries and groups \n     that already possess nuclear, biological or chemical weapons: \n     North Korea. Iraq. Iran. Libya.\n       Have any of these nations earned our trust? And given their \n     past behavior, is it any surprise that there are startling \n     signs that a world wide black market in nuclear weapons has \n     emerged?\n       All this is taking place as talks to review the global \n     treaty limiting the spread of nuclear weapons will soon \n     begin. Even if the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty is \n     extended indefinitely, however, we must avoid falling into a \n     false sense of security. We must prepare now for the future.\n       Iraq, Iran, and North Korea all illustrate the failures of \n     traditional non-proliferation efforts, which depend largely \n     on the cooperation of other states.\n       Only after Desert Storm did the West learn just how far \n     Iraqi nuclear ambitions had progressed. And instead of \n     announcing that the United States will veto any efforts to \n     ease or end U.N. sanctions on Iraq, the administration \n     dispatches an envoy to plead with the Europeans for \n     cooperation. Where would such timidity have gotten us in the \n     Cold War?\n       Iran also appears poised for a great leap forward in its \n     nuclear program--thanks to a cash-hungry Russia doing for \n     Iran what the Clinton Administration has done for North \n     Korea.\n       And make no mistake about it, the Agreed Framework with \n     North Korea has little prospect of successfully addressing \n     the North Korean threat, and apparently, has already been \n     violated by Pyongyang.\n       American leadership in addressing these non-proliferation \n     challenges is essential if additional states are not to \n     choose the nuclear option. It's worth asking: What would we \n     have done--or not done--if Iraq had one or two nuclear \n     weapons in 1990? Preventive military action as a non-\n     proliferation policy tool cannot be ruled out.\n       There are defensive options, however, that could provide \n     the United States and our allies with protection against \n     accidental and limited ballistic missile strikes. Pursuing an \n     effective\n      ballistic missile defense capability should be a top \n     priority for U.S. defense policy now and for the \n     foreseeable future.\n\n\n  reality no. 4: increase in extremist religious and ethnic movements\n\n       The fourth new global reality is the increase in violence \n     due to extremist religious and ethnic movements in many parts \n     of the globe.\n       Some of these movements, like the tribal warfare in Rwanda, \n     or conflicts in Burma or West Africa have little direct \n     impact on American interests.\n       However, some of the instability and turmoil due to ethnic \n     and religious violence is important for American interests--\n     and could lead to the disintegration of key states. Serbian \n     genocidal aggression in the Balkans, for example, threatens \n     to spill over to Macedonia, Albania, and beyond. American and \n     European inaction in the face of that aggression cannot help \n     but embolden other radical ``ethno-nationalists'' by giving \n     them a green light for ethnic cleansing.\n       The Indian rebellion in Mexico coupled with financial \n     uncertainty has resulted in genuine security concerns on our \n     southern border--and make no mistake that illegal immigration \n     is a security threat.\n       A key NATO ally in Turkey faces Islamic extremism and a \n     separatist ethnic movement. Violent Islamic fundamentalists \n     threaten the government in Algeria, and have launched an \n     assault on Egypt. How long would the Camp David Treaty be \n     honored if fundamentalists took power in Egypt?\n       Islamic terrorists seek to destroy the peace process \n     between Israel and the PLO--and may be having some success. \n     With support from Iran and others, Islamic terrorists also \n     demonstrated at the World Trade Center that America is not \n     immune from attack.\n       And ethnic turmoil in the former Soviet Union cannot be \n     ignored, as warfare has occurred in five former republics. \n     And the Chechens may be just one of many ethnic groups \n     willing to use violence to alter boundaries originally set by \n     Joseph Stalin.\n       In short, the list of world ``hot spots'' is far too \n     lengthy for anyone to conclude that America can become \n     complacent.\n\n\n                   reality no. 5: rivalry with russia\n\n       And this leads to the fifth global reality we must face: \n     the fact that geopolitical rivalry with Russia did not end \n     with the demise of Soviet Communism.\n       On his last trip abroad, President Nixon spoke before the \n     Russian State Duma, and he foreshadowed a change in Russian-\n     American relations, saying: ``Russia is a great power, and \n     Russia as a great power must chart its own course in foreign \n     policy * * * When we have differences, we should not assume \n     they will be overcome by a good personal relationship even at \n     the highest level.''\n       And as we have seen time and time again, the foreign policy \n     course that Russia is charting, is one that is often in \n     conflict with American interests.\n       For example:\n       Russia stepped in the middle of the North Korea agreement \n     by offering to provide nuclear reactors--which would have the \n     clear effect of killing the U.S. brokered deal.\n       Russia continues to threaten prospective NATO members over \n     alliance expansion, thereby confirming the need to enlarge \n     NATO sooner rather than later.\n       In December 1994, Russia vetoed a sanctions resolution on \n     Serbia in the U.N. Security Council, its first substantive \n     veto since the height of the Cold War in 1985.\n       Russia persists in supplying weapons and nuclear technology \n     to the rogue regime in Iran.\n       Russia continues to maintain an intelligence facility and \n     support personnel in Cuba, thereby prolonging Castro's \n     oppression.\n        [[Page S3322]] Russian pressure, subversion and \n     intimidation of the sovereign states in the ``Near Abroad'' \n     follows a historical pattern set long before the Bolsheviks \n     took power in 1917.\n       As Dr. Kissinger said last month before the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee, ``* * * what we dealt with in the Cold \n     War was both communism and imperialism, and while communism \n     was defeated, the trend toward imperialism still exists.''\n       Let me be clear in saying that no one has been more \n     supportive of President Yeltsin than I. In June 1991, I went \n     to Andrews Air Force Base to meet President Yeltsin virtually \n     alone,\n      since the United States State Department believed Gorvachev \n     was the ``only game in town.''\n       But just as it was wrong to place too much focus on \n     Gorbachev in 1991, it is wrong in 1995 to ignore that fact \n     that President Yeltsin has made serious errors, has moved \n     toward authoritarian rule, and has lost the political support \n     of virtually all reform-minded Russians.\n       The Clinton Administration's misguided devotion to a \n     ``Russia First'' policy--which has turned into a ``Yeltsin \n     first'' policy--resulted in the loss of a tremendous \n     opportunity to state American concerns forcefully before \n     thousands were slaughtered in Chechnya.\n\n\n                        new realism about russia\n\n       A ``new realism'' about Russia and its prospects for the \n     future does not mean a return to the Cold War past. It does \n     mean developing a more honest relationship, one that does not \n     paper over important policy differences with an appeal to \n     personal ties.\n       New realism means emphasizing the significance of Russia's \n     1996 elections, and of the pivotal importance of a peaceful, \n     democratic transition of power.\n       And new realism means that developments like arms sales to \n     Iran, violence in Chechnya, and U.N. vetoes on behalf of \n     aggressors should not be excused, ignored and minimized. Our \n     differences with Russia should be identified--they should be \n     negotiated when possible and condemned when necessary. Such \n     an approach would ultimately serve both the Russian and the \n     American people better than defending, denying and \n     rationalizing Russian misdeeds.\n\n\n                     tests for american leadership\n\n       Let me conclude by sharing with you words that Richard \n     Nixon spoke at the announcement of the creation of the Center \n     for Peace and Freedom in January 1994.\n       ``Some are tired of leadership. They say (America) carried \n     that burden long enough. But if we do not provide leadership, \n     who will? The Germans? The Japanese? The Russians? The \n     Chinese? Only the United States has the potential . . . to \n     lead in the era beyond peace. It is a great challenge for a \n     great people.''\n       Ladies and gentlemen, President Nixon was right. Leadership \n     does come with a price tag. But it is a price worth paying.\n       Dealing with the five realities I have outlined will test \n     America's resolve and her leadership. If we fail those \n     tests--if we refuse the mantle of leadership--any declaration \n     of victory will be a long time coming.\n       But I am an optimist. Like Richard Nixon, I believe in \n     America and In American leadership. I believe we will pass \n     our tests, and in doing so, we can claim the biggest victory \n     of all--we will have secured the future of our great \n     republic, and of peace and freedom, for generations to come.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    Shaping America's Global Future\n\n                             (By Bob Dole)\n\n       It is now a cliche that America is the world's only \n     superpower. But Americans would do well to reflect on how we \n     got to this point--and on how unprecedented our status is in \n     American history. America has always been blessed with \n     security, protected by two oceans, our two land borders safe \n     from invasion since the mid-nineteenth century. Never before, \n     however, has America been so alone at the pinnacle of global \n     leadership.\n       It was not always this way. America fought three major wars \n     in this century-World War I in Europe; World War II in \n     Europe, Africa, and Asia; and the Cold War across the globe. \n     In each of these conflicts, Americans were asked to give \n     their blood and treasure in support of U.S. interests and \n     ideals overseas. Three times this century, America rose to \n     the occasion.\n       It is sometimes said that Americans win the war and lose \n     the peace. Clearly that was true after World War I, when \n     Wilsonian idealist ambitions overran American interests, and \n     when protectionism, isolationism, and decline were the \n     result. Yet after the defeat in 1945 of Nazism in Europe and \n     Japanese militarism in Asia, we rose to the challenge of \n     winning the peace through American leadership. New \n     multilateral institutions were established: the United \n     Nations, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. \n     They were important, but they were insufficient. What made \n     the difference was American will and power as reflected in \n     the Marshall Plan, the Truman Doctrine, and the establishment \n     of the North Atlantic Treaty\n      Organization (NATO). These and other related actions \n     cemented the American commitment to Europe and signaled \n     America's determination to oppose Soviet expansionism.\n       It was American leadership and commitment--supported by our \n     allies throughout the world--that led to the overwhelming \n     victories in the Cold War: the crumbling of the Berlin Wall \n     in 1989 and the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. For more \n     than four decades, the central purpose and chief objective of \n     American national security policy was the containment of \n     Soviet communism. Who can doubt that U.S. policy played a \n     central role in the disintegration of Soviet communism? The \n     great success of America and its democratic allies in the \n     Cold War is something to be proud of, and the costs of the \n     victory should not be forgotten. While historic event \n     occurred barely three years ago, myths contradicting the \n     facts of why and how the Cold War was won have already \n     surfaced.\n       Myth #1: Foreign policy was easier during the Cold War. \n     While a common enemy often did serve to unite the United \n     States and its allies during the Cold War, it is difficult to \n     argue that security policy was easier when the Soviet Union \n     was ready, willing, and able to oppose American interests. A \n     nuclear-armed superpower committed to undermining the West \n     created more difficult and demanding foreign policy \n     challenges than any faced since 1991. No current challenge, \n     for example, rivals the magnitude of the Cuban Missile Crisis \n     of 1962 or the Yom Kippur War of 1973--either of which could \n     have escalated to thermonuclear war.\n       Myth #2: The Cold War was supported by a great bipartisan \n     consensus. In large part because of the historic partnership \n     between President Harry Truman and Senator Arthur Vandenberg, \n     the late 1940s saw considerable bipartisan cooperation in \n     creating a new international security system. But ``politics \n     stopping at the water's edge'' lasted only for two decades--\n     until the Vietnam War. While there were partisan \n     disagreements in the 1950s, for example over ``who lost \n     China,'' it was the war in Southeast Asia that shattered the \n     bipartisan consensus on waging the Cold War. In the 1970s, \n     even Republicans were divided over the wisdom of pursuing the \n     Nixon-Kissinger policy of detente. Moreover, in the later \n     years of the Cold War, debates over the nuclear freeze, the \n     Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), opposing communist \n     aggression in Central America, or using force to defend U.S. \n     interests reflected very little bipartisanship. Despite the \n     broad bipartisan agreement at the beginning of the Cold War, \n     precious few ``Scoop Jackson Democrats'' were around by its \n     end.\n       Myth #3: The doves were right. Unlike the revisionist \n     history written by some in the Clinton administration, the \n     ``doves'' were wrong all along in the Cold War. Why?\n       The doves advocated spending less on defense and doing less \n     with American armed forces. In the end, as former Soviet \n     leaders now reveal, American defense spending and activism in \n     Afghanistan, Poland, and elsewhere were critical to the \n     Soviet demise.\n       The doves argued for toning down anti-Soviet rhetoric no \n     matter how accurate it was (remember the shock at President \n     Ronald Reagan's proper characterization of the Soviet Union \n     as the ``Evil Empire''?). More significantly, they preferred \n     the resignation of U.S. policy to the permanent existence of \n     the Soviet Union. Fortunately, the doves' self-fulfilling \n     prophecy was not heeded.\n       The doves opposed SDI and supported the nuclear freeze and \n     other arms control measures, arguing that weapons, not \n     ideology and intentions, posed the threat to the United \n     States.\n       The doves opposed the Reagan Doctrine of supporting freedom \n     fighters opposing communist regimes around the world.\n       The breakup of the Soviet empire in 1991 came faster and \n     happened more completed than virtually anyone envisioned. If \n     the doves' policies had prevailed, however, that day would \n     have been delayed for years, if not decades--and may never \n     have come. The fall of the Soviet empire was not inevitable, \n     nor was it foreordained by impersonal forces of history; \n     rather, it was the leadership, actions, and sacrifices of the \n     West that brought victory in the Cold War.\n       Debunking the mythologies of the Cold War does not \n     automatically lead to prescriptions for a post-Cold War \n     foreign policy. Our Cold War victory allows the United States \n     to be more selective\n      in its involvement around the world, but it is not a license \n     for America to withdraw from the world. Exhaustion after a \n     great conflict is natural, but American withdrawal would \n     jeopardize the gains of the last 40 years, and it would \n     inevitably mean less prosperity and less security for the \n     American people.\n       Nevertheless, in the wake of the Soviet Union's defeat, \n     numerous observers have suggested America should withdraw \n     from the world. First, some claim America cannot be involved \n     in the world because we do not have the resources--the \n     ``declinist'' school. We won the Cold War and remain the only \n     global power but, in the perverse logic of the declinists, \n     this adds up to weakness.\n       The declinists have multilateralist cousins who promote a \n     view that America must work with and within international \n     organizations because we do not have the resources to act on \n     our own. Other multilaterialists believe America does not \n     have the legal or moral authority to act without the sanction \n     of international organizations. The declinists--and their \n     multilateralist kin--ignore the strength of America and \n     underrate the power of American leadership. It is true that \n     America must be strong domestically to be strong abroad, but \n     America has the ability to do both if resources are used \n     wisely and decisions are made soundly.\n       This is not necessarily the view in the current \n     administration. The declinists and multilateralists are alive \n     and well in the Clinton administration. First came the \n     [[Page S3323]] ``Tarnoff Doctrine'' of May 1993, when the \n     State Department's undersecretary for political affairs, \n     Peter Tarnoff, argued for retrenchment because the United \n     States lacked the resources, inclination, and will to lead. \n     Then there was the ``Halperin Doctrine'' expressed in these \n     pages in the Summer of 1993, in which a current National \n     Security Council staff member, Morton Halperin, argued that \n     the United States should use force to defend its interests in \n     cases like Grenada and Panama only with prior multilateral \n     approval.\n       There are also protectionists who argue that America should \n     engage in trade with the world only on a one-way basis--\n     shutting our doors to foreign products in the vain hope that \n     foreign doors will remain open to American products. American \n     industries do not need protection, they need competition. \n     Where there is truly free trade, U.S. businesses have \n     prospered and the U.S. economy has grown.\n       Finally, some argue that America should not get involved in \n     the world. Historically, the isolationists have had adherents \n     on the Left who believe America will corrupt the world, and \n     on the Right who believe the world will corrupt America. \n     There are no serious and immediate threats to vital American \n     interests, the isolationists say. While that may be true now, \n     retreat from the world is the surest way to invite the \n     emergence of such threats in the future. The fact is that \n     America must remain firmly engaged in the world. If we do not \n     protect our interests, no one else--neither other countries \n     nor international organizations--will do the job for us. The \n     various approaches of the declinists, multilateralists, \n     protectionists, and isolationists all would make a dangerous \n     world even more so.\n\n\n                         two failures of vision\n\n       We have witnessed two efforts to ``reinvent'' American \n     foreign policy since the end of the Cold War: President \n     George Bush's New World Order and the Assertive \n     Multilateralism, or Engagement and Enlargement, of President \n     Bill Clinton. Unfortunately, neither effort has been \n     successful.\n       The New World Order--whatever it was meant to be--rapidly \n     became a new world disorder; instead of strengthened \n     collective security, enhanced international organizations, \n     and a new partnership of nations, there was expansion of \n     violent ethnic and religious unrest, proliferation of weapons \n     of mass destruction, international aggression, and civil war. \n     The flaw of the New World Order approach was its assumption \n     that the end of the Cold War meant the end of international \n     tension that could lead to hot war. President Bush and his \n     advisers may be excused for over-optimism in the wake of the \n     stunning multilateral coalition they built--under the United \n     Nations auspices--to defeat Saddam Hussein's aggression. In \n     retrospect, however, Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm may \n     have been the high point of post-Cold War U.N. collective \n     security efforts. Just as United Nations action in Korea in \n     1950 was possible only because the Soviet Union was absent \n     for the crucial authorizing vote, United Nations action in \n     the Persian Gulf was possible only because the Soviet Union \n     was inclined to cooperate with the West in the final months \n     of 1990. Such cooperation is rapidly becoming a thing of the \n     past as Russia pursues its traditional objectives in the \n     ``near abroad'' and around the globe. In this regard, the\n      first substantive United Nations Security Council veto \n     exercised by Russia since 1984 (during the height of the \n     Cold War) came in December 1994 on the issue of tougher \n     sanctions against Serbia and may be the beginning of a \n     trend.\n       Despite the conceptual flaws of the New World Order, to \n     hear the current administration complain about its foreign \n     policy inheritance is surprising and often merely an excuse \n     for poor performance. In my view, no administration has ever \n     received a stronger foreign policy inheritance. The legacy of \n     12 years of Reagan-Bush foreign policy included millions \n     liberated in Central and Eastern Europe, finally closing the \n     book on the post-World War II era after four decades; 15 \n     independent states to replace the Soviet empire, and no near-\n     term threat from Russia; a defeated Iraq in the Persian Gulf, \n     and a newly invigorated peace process in the Middle East; the \n     dramatic expansion of democratic governments around the \n     world--best illustrated in the Western Hemisphere (where only \n     Cuba and Haiti were exceptions to the democratic tidal wave); \n     free trade agreements negotiated with Canada and Mexico (the \n     North American Free Trade Agreement), nearly negotiated with \n     the world (the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade), and outlined for the Western Hemisphere \n     (Enterprise for the Americas); and a growing Asia-Pacific \n     Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum for U.S. relations with \n     Asia and the Pacific Basin. All added up to an America more \n     secure and stronger than at any time in our history, and the \n     only global power on earth.\n       In the two years since the end of the Bush administration, \n     much has changed. In the minds of many, U.S. foreign policy \n     has been marked by inconsistency, incoherence, lack of \n     purpose, and a reluctance to lead. American lives have been \n     risked, and lost, in places with little or no connection to \n     American interests. From Bosnia to China, from North Korea to \n     Poland, our allies and our adversaries doubt our resolve and \n     question our commitments.\n\n\n                            firm principles\n\n       The failures of Assertive Multilateralism/Enlargement lie \n     not just in its execution or communication--they lie in its \n     very conception. The following 10 principles, which should \n     guide American foreign policy, have been ignored or \n     misapplied by the Clinton administration.\n\n\n             while much has changed, much remains the same\n\n       The successful end of the Cold War has not changed the core \n     interests of America:\n       Preventing the domination of Europe by a single power,\n       Maintaining a balance of power in East Asia,\n       Promoting security and stability in our hemisphere,\n       Preserving access to natural resources, especially in the \n     energy heartland of the Persian Gulf,\n       Strengthening international free trade and expanding U.S. \n     access to global markets, and\n       Protecting American citizens and property overseas.\n       These interests cannot be protected without American \n     involvement in the world. Many states and many movements \n     opposed to American interests are awaiting American \n     withdrawal.\n       In addition to our interests, America has core ideals that \n     we have supported throughout our history: freedom, democracy, \n     the rule of law, observance of human rights, and deterring \n     and responding to aggression. Too much has been made of the \n     tensions between American interests and American ideals. Some \n     went so far as to suggest that we should set aside our values \n     during the Cold War to follow a policy of moral relativism. \n     Nothing would have been more ill-conceived. The Cold War was \n     won precisely because of the convergence of our interests and \n     ideals. By preventing Soviet expansion into Europe, we \n     stopped the domination of the continent by a hostile power \n     and prevented the enslavement of millions more Europeans \n     under communist rule.\n       Our interests and ideals converge in support for free-\n     market economies and democratic pluralism as well. Capitalist \n     democracies tend to make better trading partners and stronger \n     allies, and also treat their own people and their neighbors \n     better than authoritarian, closed societies. To retain the \n     support of the American people and to protect the future of \n     our children, American foreign policy must continue to \n     combine the protection of American interests and the \n     promotion of American ideals. That is our tradition.\n\n\n                    American Leadership Is Essential\n\n       The United States, as the only global power, must lead. \n     Europe--as individual states or as a collective--cannot. \n     China, Russia, India,\n      Brazil, and Japan are important regional powers, and some \n     may be potential regional threats. But only the United \n     States can lead on the full range of political, \n     diplomatic, economic, and military issues confronting the \n     world.\n       Leadership does not consist of posing questions for \n     international debate; leadership consists of proposing and \n     achieving solutions. The American attempt in May 1993 to \n     discuss lifting the Bosnian arms embargo with NATO allies, \n     for example, was simply wrong: It was a discussion, not a \n     U.S. initiative, and was readily perceived by the Europeans \n     as a half-hearted attempt lacking President Clinton's \n     commitment. By comparison, if President Bush had followed a \n     similar course after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, \n     Saddam Hussein would still be in Kuwait today--if not in \n     Saudi Arabia--and he would very possibly be armed with \n     nuclear weapons.\n       Leadership is also saying what you mean, meaning what you \n     say, and sticking to it. That includes a willingness to use \n     American force when required. To state that North Korea \n     ``cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb'' and then one \n     year later to sign an agreement that ignores the issue of the \n     existing arsenal is confusing to the American people and to \n     our allies. To threaten to withdraw most-favored-nation \n     trading status from China because of human rights violations \n     and then to extend such status months later--despite no \n     change in Chinese human rights practices--makes the world \n     wonder why the linkage was made in the first place. To \n     introduce a resolution in the U.N. Security Council to lift \n     the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina, while top \n     administration officials claim the war is over and the Serbs \n     have won, severs any link between the words of U.S. \n     policymakers and their deeds.\n\n\n            u.s. sovereignty must be defended, not delegated\n\n       International organizations--whether the United Nations, \n     the World Trade Organization, or any others--will not protect \n     American interests. Only America can do that. International \n     organizations will, at best, practice policymaking at the \n     lowest common denominator--finding a course that is the least \n     objectionable to the most members. Too often, they reflect a \n     consensus that opposes American interests or does not reflect \n     American principles and ideals. Even gaining support for an \n     American position can involve deals or tradeoffs that are not \n     in America's long-term interests. Acquiescence in Russian \n     activities in Georgia and other border states, for example, \n     may be too high a price for Russian acceptance of U.S. \n     positions.\n       The choices facing America are not, as some in the \n     administration would like to portray, doing something \n     multilaterally, doing it alone, or doing nothing. These are \n     [[Page S3324]] false choices. The real choice is whether to \n     allow international organizations to call the shots--as in \n     Somalia or Bosnia--or to make multilateral groupings work for \n     American interests--as in Operation Desert Storm. \n     Subcontracting American foreign policy and subordinating \n     American sovereignty encourage and strengthen isolationist \n     forces at home--and embolden our adversaries abroad.\n\n\n         international bureaucrats are no substitute for allies\n\n       The United States should not look to the United Nations \n     first, but to itself and its allies--preserving alliances \n     inherited from the Cold War and leading to create new ones \n     where necessary. Who could doubt that NATO has the power to \n     address the tragic aggression against Bosnia? Instead, a \n     misnamed ``United Nations Protection Force'' provides \n     convenient ``hostages'' to the aggressors, thereby protecting \n     them from NATO power. Substituting the judgment of \n     international civil servants for NATO military professionals \n     has severely damaged the credibility of the Atlantic \n     Alliance.\n       Allies will not simply do our bidding in one area and \n     ignore our policies in another. It was folly to pursue a \n     policy of economic sanctions against North Korea while \n     publicly criticizing China on human rights concerns and Japan \n     on trade issues. And after proposing sanctions and gaining \n     support from South Korea and Japan, allowing a freelance \n     mission by a former president to reverse the policy suggests \n     that America is not to be taken at its word. Alliances and \n     allies require careful attention, not just episodic \n     engagement.\n\n\n       do not confuse u.s. hopes and desires with u.s. interests\n\n       The core interests outlined above have been played down, \n     and sometimes superseded, by the desires of Clinton \n     administration policymakers. Pollution or overpopulation in \n     West Africa or South Asia are problems, but their effect on \n     American interests is peripheral, at best.\n      Famine and disease in Somalia or Rwanda are tragic. America \n     should help in humanitarian disasters, consistent with our \n     resources, and in a manner that does not undermine our \n     military readiness. But events in Rwanda or Somalia have a \n     marginal--at most--impact on American interests.\n       The promotion of free markets and fostering of democratic \n     institutions are in America's interest, but they are not \n     absolute goals. When democratic institutions are manipulated \n     by enemies of America--as in the case of radical Islamic \n     fundamentalists in Algeria--our long-term interests must take \n     precedence over the short-term ideal of enlarging democracy. \n     Likewise, when deviations from free-market trading principles \n     threaten a key strategic alliance in the Western Pacific, \n     such a trade dispute must be handled more carefully than one \n     with a trading partner that is not also a strategic ally.\n\n\n                 allocate resources based on interests\n\n       Just as hopes and desires about the world have clouded \n     American attention, American resources have been \n     misallocated. Sometimes dollars speak louder than words. For \n     example, nearly $2 billion will be spent on occupation and \n     nation-building in Haiti, where American interests are \n     marginal; yet only a small fraction of that amount has been \n     spent supporting a free market and democratic transition in \n     the strategically critical country of Ukraine. And defense \n     dollars are spent on environmental projects and defense \n     `'conversion,'' while military readiness, modernization, and \n     personnel lack sufficient funding. Foreign aid and defense \n     dollars should be instruments of national policy to enhance \n     American security; they should not be squandered on \n     nonessential programs.\n\n\n                    use all the tools of statecraft\n\n       Diplomacy without force is empty, and force without \n     diplomacy is irresponsible. The fundamental relationship \n     between diplomacy and force is not understood by the current \n     administration. In Somalia and in Haiti (until saved by the \n     Carter-Powell-Nunn mission), we saw force without diplomacy. \n     In Bosnia, we see a clear example of diplomacy without force: \n     Hollow threats are followed by countless concessions to the \n     aggressor.\n       This administration has displayed a basic discomfort with \n     American military power--unless that power is exercised \n     pursuant to United Nations authorization. In Haiti, the 1823 \n     Monroe Doctrine has been replaced with the Halperin \n     Doctrine--unilateral action only after multilateral approval. \n     An unfortunate precedent has been set in seeking prior United \n     Nations support for what an American president proclaimed was \n     in America's interests--interests that should not be second-\n     guessed, modified, or subject to the approval of \n     international organizations.\n       Failure by the administration to appreciate military \n     assistance as a tool of diplomacy has resulted in dramatic \n     reductions in such programs. Despite presidential doctrines \n     from Truman to Nixon to Reagan advocating help for victims of \n     aggression who are willing to help themselves, and despite \n     campaign promises to the contrary, President Clinton refuses \n     to lift the illegal and immoral arms embargo on Bosnia. One \n     need only contrast this refusal to the significant military \n     and political impact of providing Stinger antiaircraft \n     missiles to the anti-Soviet resistance in Afghanistan. \n     Finally, covert and overt political action can \n     also further U.S. interests, providing important options \n     between diplomacy and sending to the Marines.\n\n\n                    rebuild american military power\n\n       America does not need the same defense posture in 1995 that \n     it had in 1985. But just because American defense spending is \n     a bargain does not mean that defending America is free. U.S. \n     defense spending has been cut too far, too fast. The current \n     administration initially planned to cut $60 billion in \n     defense--but then added plans to slash $127 billion over 5 \n     years. Despite these deep cuts--and a recent conversion to \n     supporting higher levels of defense spending--the Clinton \n     administration's thirst to commit U.S. military forces abroad \n     has not declined. As a result, for the first time since the \n     ``hollow Army'' of the 1970s, three American divisions were \n     not ready for combat in late 1994. Soldiers who expect and \n     deserve 12 months in between overseas tours are given half \n     that. My old unit from World War II, for example, the 10th \n     Mountain Division, has spent three straight Christmases \n     overseas: deployed to Somalia in December 1992 (only weeks \n     after cleaning up from Hurricane Andrew), and deployed again \n     in September 1994 to Haiti--just six short months after \n     returning from their tragic encounter in Somalia.\n       Furthermore, we cannot keep asking our men and women in \n     uniform to do more with less. It is nothing short of \n     scandalous when American enlisted soldiers have to work \n     second jobs or receive food stamps to meet the needs of their \n     families. And we cannot keep undermining our military force \n     posture for ``humanitarian operations'' that do nothing to \n     enhance American security.\n       America must take both a short-term and a long-term view of \n     its military readiness. Not only must we have the ability to \n     fight and win today, we must constantly prepare to fight and \n     win future wars. The Clinton cuts to the defense budget \n     create the grave risk that we will not make the investment \n     necessary to re-equip and reorient our forces toward \n     tomorrow's challenges. During the Cold War, we concentrated \n     on blocking a Warsaw Pact invasion of Europe and deterring a \n     nuclear attack on America, which meant that our doctrine, \n     training, and equipment all were based on those threats.\n       In the future we will face new threats in places and under \n     circumstances we cannot easily predict. To deal with them we \n     will need unprecedented flexibility, agility, and mobility: \n     no more gearing up for the central front in Europe with \n     lavish prepositioning of equipment and a large permanent \n     troop presence. In the future we will have to get to remote \n     theaters of conflict quickly and with the most effective \n     systems our technological prowess will enable us to field.\n       But the transition to a smaller, quicker, and more \n     effective force will require a solid industrial base and will \n     cost money: for a robust and well-targeted research and \n     development program; for new weapons systems capable of \n     breathtaking accuracy; for the capability to ``stand off'' \n     and fire from safe distances, beyond the reach of enemy \n     forces; and for training American troops to be the most \n     powerful and best protected in history. If the money is not \n     there, we will be forced to make do with what remains of our \n     old Cold War force, even though it is the wrong force for the \n     future.\n       Finally, we need to rely on our capabilities and not place \n     our trust solely in multilateral regimes to ensure our \n     security. For example, effective ballistic missile defenses \n     would do more to enhance American and allied security by \n     providing real protection against limited and accidental \n     strikes than would nonproliferation policies, which rely on \n     the goodwill and cooperation of others to halt the spread of \n     nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction to rogue \n     states.\n\n\n      Americans Lives Should Be Risked Only for American Interests\n\n       Placing American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in \n     harm's way is the gravest decision a president can make. \n     After the disaster in Mogadishu on October 3-4, 1993, some \n     observers concluded the American public will no longer \n     tolerate casualties. In fact, the ``Somalia syndrome'' stems \n     from the shock of seeing American bodies dragged through the \n     dust when the American people thought that Operation Restore \n     Hope was about feeding the hungry--not about nation-building \n     or enforcing U.N. arrest warrants. American lives should not \n     be risked--and lost--in places like Somalia, Haiti, and \n     Rwanda with marginal or no American interests at stake. Such \n     actions make it more difficult to convince American mothers \n     and fathers to send their sons and daughters to battle when \n     vital interests are at stake. The American people will not \n     tolerate American casualties for irresponsible \n     internationalism. And like overreliance on the United \n     Nations, such adventures ironically end up reinforcing \n     isolationism and retreat.\n\n\n          Be Creative: Do Not Cling to the Conventional Wisdom\n\n       In June 1991, I went to Andrews Air Force base to meet a \n     Russian opposition politician arriving for an informal visit. \n     The only ``official'' representative of the U.S. government \n     there was a mid-level State Department official. The view of \n     the foreign policy establishment and the Bush administration \n     was that Mikhail Gorbachev was the ``only game in town.'' \n     That Russian politician, Boris Yeltsin, later told me that he \n     never forgot my willingness to see him.\n       Especially now that the certainties of the Cold War are \n     gone, traditional views about foreign policy should be \n     reexamined; some will remain valid while others may not. The \n     conventional view of\n      foreign aid, for example, is that it must be maintained in \n     about \n     [[Page S3325]] the same amounts in about the same programs to \n     demonstrate that America is not retreating from the world. \n     But it is hard to see how the billions of dollars of \n     international aid spent in Rwanda or Somalia before their \n     civil wars, for example, advanced any U.S. interest. Support \n     for the peace process in the Middle East has paid great \n     dividends, but much of the rest of the foreign aid program \n     simply feathers the nests of old-boy contractors and further \n     discredits ``development'' theories. Foreign aid should be \n     transitional, to help an ally through a crisis or to help a \n     developing country develop; it should not lead to a permanent \n     state of dependency. Reform and reductions in the U.S. aid \n     program are the overseas equivalent of welfare reform at \n     home.\n       The world of 1995 and beyond is still a dangerous place. \n     There are many new and emerging threats as we approach the \n     millennium. A resurgent Russia filling a vacuum in Central \n     Europe or looking for a foreign diversion from internal \n     secessionist struggles; a revitalized Iraq threatening the \n     oil fields of Saudi Arabia; a fundamentalist Iran seeking to \n     dominate the Persian Gulf; a nuclear-armed North Korea \n     threatening South Korea and Japan with ballistic missiles--\n     all are scenarios that the United States could face in the \n     near and medium terms. Islamic fundamentalism sweeping across \n     North Africa could overwhelm the successes to date in \n     achieving peace in the Middle East. A fourth conflict between \n     India and Pakistan could escalate into the world's first \n     nuclear war. Nuclear-armed terrorist states like Libya or \n     Iran, emboldened by the North Korean example and armed with \n     missiles from Pyongyang, could threaten allies in the Middle \n     East or Europe. Economic competition between Japan and China \n     could take a military turn. Radical ``ethno-nationalists,'' \n     religious militants, terrorists, narcotics traffickers, and \n     international organized crime networks all pose threats to \n     states in regions of the world where America has core \n     interests. While the collapse of Somalia or Rwanda may not \n     affect those interests, the disintegration of states like \n     Egypt, Indonesia, Mexico, or Pakistan would.\n       American leadership, however, can overcome the challenges \n     of building a just and durable peace after the Cold War. The \n     words of President Dwight Eisenhower's first inaugural \n     address are as true today as they were in 1953:\n       To meet the challenge of our time, destiny has laid upon \n     our country the responsibility of the free world's \n     leadership. So it is proper that we assure our friends once \n     again that, in the discharge of this responsibility, we \n     Americans know and we observe the difference between world \n     leadership and imperialism; between firmness and truculence; \n     between a thoughtfully calculated goal and spasmodic reaction \n     to the stimulus of emergencies.\n       As the United States approaches the next century, two \n     principles should remain constant: protecting American \n     interests and providing American leadership. The end of the \n     Cold War has provided us with a historic opportunity. Such an \n     opportunity should not be forfeited in favor of the pursuit \n     of utopian multilateralism or abandoned through intentional \n     isolationism. We have seen the danger to America's interests, \n     prestige, and influence posed by both of these approaches. \n     Instead, we must look to the lessons of the Cold War to guide \n     our future foreign policy: Put American interests first and \n     lead the way. The future will not wait for America, but it \n     can be shaped by an America second to none.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3320-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3325-S3366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n\n       protection from big spenders? the people lost by one vote\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, there are two disappointing things to \nmention today. The first is my regular daily report on the latest \navailable disclosure of the total Federal debt, this time as of the \nclose of business yesterday, Wednesday, March 1, stood at \n$4,848,389,816.26.\n  If this debt were to be paid off today, with every man, woman, and \nchild in the country paying his or her proportionate share, each of us \nwould have to fork over $18,404.57. Of course, since millions of \nAmericans pay no taxes at all, the average share of the Federal debt \nwould be far greater than the per capita amount referred to above.\n  The other sad thing? It is, of course, the Senate's failure today to \napprove a constitutional amendment requiring Congress to balance the \nFederal budget. If just one more Senator had voted today in favor of \nthe amendment, it would have been approved by 67 Senators, exactly \nenough to pass the amendment and send it to the 50 States for \nratification.\n  Don't look for a balanced Federal budget anytime soon. But one day it \nwill come. The American people will demand it.\n          REDUCE THE DEFICIT WITHOUT AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, over the course of the last 3 weeks, we \nhave heard many arguments for and against the proposed balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. Those arguments were made in good faith, \nand I know they reflect a broad commitment by those on both sides of \nthis question to bringing the deficit down to reasonable levels. But \nthe balanced budget amendment is an empty promise, not a policy. It has \nlittle immediate political cost and very high poll ratings--hence its \npopularity. But enacting it would be a serious mistake. We should \nreject it in favor of a real, long-term deficit reduction program.\n  Since 1936, when Minnesota's own Harold Knutson revived the idea of a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment that has been originally \nrejected by the Constitution's Framers, Congress has debated various \nversions. The real question before us today, as it was 50 years ago, is \nwhether we should weld onto the Founding document of our democracy, the \nU.S. Constitution, a budget gimmick that would do more harm than good \nto the economic well-being of our Nation, and our citizens.\n  As I have consistently argued, in my judgment we do not need to amend \nthe U.S. Constitution to balance the Federal budget. Instead, we must \ncontinue to make tough choices on actual legislative proposals, as I \nhave done, to cut wasteful and unnecessary post-cold-war defense \nspending, to continue to reduce low priority domestic spending, to \ncompletely restructure the way we finance and deliver health care in \nthis country--in both the public and private sector--and to scale back \nspecial tax breaks for very wealthy interests in our society who have \nfor a long time not been required to pay their fair share. That \napproach is the only responsible, fair way to bring our annual Federal \ndeficits, and the much larger Federal debt, under control.\n  For the last 15 years or so, that is what the Congress has been \nunwilling to do, and that is the source of a lot of frustration in the \ncountry. Congress has been unable to muster and sustain a majority to \nmake difficult budget choices. We have seen illustrated here in the \nSenate over and over again a central problem: The political gap between \nthe promise to cut spending, and actual followthrough on that promise. \nI make this point because I want to underscore that many of those who \nhave been beating their chests the hardest about a balanced budget \namendment have often been among those who have consistently voted \nagainst these actual deficit reduction proposals. We cannot give over \nour budget-balancing responsibilities to a machine, a mechanism. That \nresponsibility is ours.\n  Of course, I support balancing the Federal budget in a responsible, \nfair way. Despite all of the rhetoric today, we all at least agree on \nthat basic goal. That's why some of us have voted consistently to\n reduce actual Federal spending when we've had the chance over the last \nfew years on this floor. Not gimmicks, not smoke and mirrors, not \ndeficit reduction formulas that never identify precise cuts, but actual \nreductions in Federal spending contained in actual amendments to \nappropriations bills. Votes on those proposed cuts have been important \nindicators of our willingness to make tough choices. This is where the \nbudget rubber has met the road.\n\n  The President's $500 billion deficit reduction package in the 103d \nCongress, which I supported and which was approved without a single \nRepublican vote, was a major downpayment toward balancing the budget. \nBut Democrats had to do it alone. When we cut, the Republicans ran. \nWhile we acted, they talked. Still, much more must be done.\n  But now, instead of real budget choices we are presented with a \ngimmick that I do not believe will work to balance the budget, and that \nif it does work as it's designed, could do serious harm to the U.S. \neconomy. It will also serve to reduce pressure in the next few years to \nactually reduce the deficit further, allowing Members of Congress to \ndeclare a temporary victory without cutting significantly from the \nFederal deficit. And then the reckoning will come, when we are up \nagainst the wall at the end of this century and have to balance the \nbudget in just a few short years with massive spending cuts in all \nFederal spending, including Social Security and Medicare.\n  [[Page S3326]] If that's true, then why is the amendment so popular, \nat least in the abstract? In recent years, the borrow-and-spend \npolicies of the 1980's and early 1990's have come home to roost, \nrekindling public support for drastic measures. But just so that we \ndon't lose our historical perspective in this debate, I think it's \nimportant to recognize that the problem of huge Federal budget deficits \nis a relatively recent one, going back only to the early 1980's. It's \njust not true, as some amendment proponents imply, that the Federal \nGovernment has been spending way beyond its means for decades.\n  The Reagan and Bush administrations gave America by far its 10 \nlargest budget deficits in our history. The huge tax cuts and large \ndefense increases of that era are still costing us. Whatever your party \naffiliation or perspective on enacting this amendment, that is \nindisputable. If it were not for the interest costs on the debt \naccumulated during the 1981-92 period, the Federal budget would be in \nbalance in 1996 and headed toward surplus thereafter.\n  I am not trying to explain away large deficits over the last decade \nor so, but simply to point out that they are, more than anything else, \na direct result of the misguided and now thoroughly discredited fiscal \npolicy called supply side economics. Despite the urgings of some of our \ncolleagues in the new House leadership, and some of the provisions of \nthe Republican Contract for America, we must not turn down that supply-\nside road again.\n  Opposing the amendment has not been easy, or politically popular. But \nsince I have spoken several times on various amendments that have been \nproposed over the course of the last few weeks, let me try to\n summarize one last time my major reasons for voting against this \namendment.\n\n\n   americans have a right to know how the amendment will affect them\n\n  Throughout this debate, I've argued that the people of Minnesota--and \nall Americans--have an enormous stake in the outcome of this debate, \nand that they have a right to know how the spending cuts required by \nthe amendment could affect them and their families. I offered an \namendment to one of the first bills before the Senate this year urging \nproponents of the constitutional amendment to detail the over a \ntrillion dollars in cuts they would make to balance the budget by 2002, \nbefore it is sent to the States for ratification. This is simple \n``truth-in-budgeting;'' it's the least we could have expected from \nproponents.\n  Indeed, the Minnesota State Legislature and Governor Carlson agree. \nAnd they sent a Minnesota mandate to Washington to prove the point. The \nlegislature recently passed overwhelmingly a resolution, signed by the \nGovernor, urging those of us here in Congress to continue our efforts \nto reduce the Federal budget deficit, and requesting financial \ninformation on the impact the balanced budget amendment would have on \nour State. By rejecting the amendment, which I introduced to provide \nthe information to all the States that the Minnesota Legislature was \nseeking, the Senate sent States a chilling message.\n  Another major right-to-know amendment, offered by Senator Daschle, \nwas also defeated. Despite the straightforward logic of this approach, \nthese amendments were rejected on virtual party-line votes.\n  And so if we pass this constitutional amendment today, we would be \nsending it to the State legislatures for ratification without giving \nthem, or the millions of American families whom they represent in each \nState, any idea of how we intend to cut over a trillion dollars from \nthe Federal budget between now and the year 2002, or how it will affect \ntheir lives and the lives of their children and grandchildren. Families \nwill not be told how deep the Medicare, Medicaid, school lunch, higher \neducation, or Social Security cuts will be; at least not before we vote \non the amendment.\n  That is, I think, a gross abdication of our sworn responsibility to \nserve those we represent, and a slap in the face to those who count on \nus for truth-in-budgeting. Recent polls show that over 80 percent of \nAmericans believe we should be straight with them about how we intend \nto balance the budget under this amendment before we act on it. Even \nso, balanced budget proponents have rejected the right-to-know and \ninstead offered Americans a ruse, an exercise in budget deception. In \nso doing, they have seriously breached the standard of public \naccountability that Americans should be able to expect from their \nleaders. In addition, there are a number of sound fiscal policy \narguments against the amendment; I will raise just two examples.\n    amendment would deepen economic recessions and worsen disasters\n  Consider the potential risk that the spending cuts required by the \namendment could push soft economy into a recession, or in a worse case, \ndeepen an existing recession and push us into a depression. Now when \nthe economy slips into recession, Federal spending helps to cushion the \nfall by increasing unemployment insurance and other assistance programs \nfor low- and moderate-income people. At the same time, income tax \ncollections drop because people and businesses are making less money in \na recession.\n  But under the amendment, Congress would be forced, perversely, to do \nthe opposite: raise taxes, cut spending, and push the economy into an \neconomic freefall. The so-called automatic economic stabilizers like \nunemployment insurance that have proven so useful in recent decades \nwould be gone, and we would instead effectively enshrine in the \nconstitution the economic policies of Herbert Hoover. With fiscal \npolicy enjoined by the amendment, sole responsibility for stabilizing \nthe economy would rest with the Federal Reserve. And with their almost \nexclusive focus on fighting inflation these days, more often than not \nthey end up protecting Wall Street investors--not average working \nfamilies.\n  As I have suggested, the amendment is an attempt to enshrine an \neconomic dogma which would cripple our ability to offer pragmatic \nresponses to changing economic conditions. Because our efforts to \nchange the balanced budget amendment to take this problem into account \nalso failed, this serious flaw remains.\n  Coupled with the absence of any exception for emergency disaster \nspending, that was included in a proposed amendment defeated last week, \nthe lack of economic foresight this reflects is almost breathtaking to \nme. In just a few days, we will consider an emergency spending bill to \nhelp pay the Federal share of the California earthquake last year. The \ncost of this disaster is now up to $15 billion.\n  In the last two decades, the Federal Government has spent $134 \nbillion in Federal disaster relief, including $33 billion in the last 5 \nyears alone. Under a balanced budget requirement, what would we do in \nthe face of a huge flood, earthquake, or other disaster that cost \nscores of billions of dollars in relief aid? How long would it take to \ngarner the three-fifths votes necessary in both Houses to pay for it? \nAnd what special legislative prizes would opponents require for their \nvotes? Those are all open to questions.\n\n\n         amendment could put federal deposit insurance at risk\n\n  Another open question is the impact of the amendment on bank \ndeposits. I am sure balanced budget amendment supporters don't intend \nto put the life savings of American families at risk, or to threaten \nthe stability of the banking system. And yet that is precisely what \nthis amendment would do. Since the Depression, the FDIC has insured \ndepositors against bank failures. That limit is now up to $100,000 per \naccount. And right now those guarantees cover private savings of about \n$2.7 trillion--that's a whole lot of money that's guaranteed by\n the U.S. Government. Some have observed that the balanced budget \namendment could put the full faith and credit of the United States \nembodied in such guarantees at risk.\n\n\n    amendment does not separate day-to-day expenses from investments\n\n  Most Americans believe that a balanced budget, like a balanced \ncheckbook, is a good idea. They argue that America, like a family, \nshould always balance its budget. But this overlooks a key fact: The \nhousehold budgets of most middle class Americans have substantial debt, \neither for a car, a home, or a college education for their kids.\n  This reflects a central problem with the amendment. It ignores the \ndifference between two different types of spending: investments for the \nfuture, \n[[Page S3327]] and ``operating,'' or day-to-day, spending. Taking out a \nmortgage on a home is investing in your family's future; taking one out \nto pay for next year's vacation is not. This is acknowledged by most \nState governments, many of whom are required to balance their operating \nbudgets--but not their investment budgets.\n  American business agrees; incurring debt to invest and expand a \nbusiness has long been a hallmark of business strategies for sustained \ngrowth. With governments, as with families or businesses, borrowing \nisn't inherently bad; it depends what you're borrowing for. With \nfamilies, businesses or State governments, the central question is: \nWill the debt we incur improve our long-term economic prospects? If \nthis principle applies to household or business budgets, why shouldn't \nit apply to the Federal budget? Nonetheless, an amendment to address \nthis problem was rejected.\n\n\n           No protections for the social security trust funds\n\n  This balanced budget amendment fails to protect the Social Security \ntrust funds from being raided to balance the Federal budget. We tried \nto make sure that for the purpose of calculating the deficit under the \nbalanced budget amendment, the huge surpluses in the Social Security \ntrust fund would not be counted. In that effort, too, we failed; our \nproposed Social Security amendment was defeated. Make no mistake what \nthis means: Despite the promises of the proponents that they will not \nbalance the budget on the backs of Social Security recipients, they \nhave refused to explicitly protect this program in the language of the \nconstitutional amendment itself. In fact, they fought hard to defeat \nour Social Security amendment. That is as good an indication of their \nfuture intentions regarding Social Security as anything we have seen.\n\n\n          A shell game that will require states to raise taxes\n\n  There is another problem with this constitutional amendment. For many \nin Minnesota, it will likely mean an increase in personal income, \nsales, and property taxes needed to offset the loss in Federal aid from \ncrime control to higher education, roads and bridges to farm programs, \nrural economic development to Medicare. This shell game, in\n which costs are simply shifted from the Federal Government onto the \nStates, would force Minnesota to fund these efforts on its own. A \nrecent Treasury Department study concluded that an increase of between \n9 and 13 percent in Minnesota taxes would be required to make up the \ndifference. In reality, a vote for the balanced budget amendment is \nreally a vote for a trickle-down tax increase.\n\n\n                         a standard of fairness\n  I think it's a simple question of fairness. If this constitutional \namendment passes, in the next 7 years we are going to have to make \n$1.48 trillion in spending cuts and other policy changes--assuming that \nwe enact Republican-proposed tax cuts for the wealthy and defense \nincreases. If we don't, we'll still have to make about $1.2 trillion in \ncuts. If we make these cuts to meet the balanced budget amendment \nrequirement and timetable, then we should make sure that wealthy \ninterests in our society, those who have political clout, those who \nhire lobbyists to make their case every day here in Washington, will be \nasked to pay their fair share. At least they should bear as much of the \nburden as regular middle class folks that we represent, who receive \nSocial Security or Medicare or Veterans benefits, or who receive \nstudent loans to send their kids to college and offer them a better \nfuture.\n  That's just common sense, and I had hoped that during this debate we \nwould signal that we would apply such a standard of fairness. For \nexample, too often in discussions about low-priority Federal spending \nwhich ought to be cut, one set of expenditures has been notoriously \nabsent. That is tax breaks for wealthy and well-positioned special \ninterests. But that, too, was rejected by the constitutional \namendment's proponents when I offered an amendment urging simply that \nwe make sure such special tax breaks are on the table as we move \nforward in our deficit reduction efforts. Tax subsidies are heavily \nskewed to corporations and the relatively few people with very high \nincomes, while Government benefits and services go in far larger \nproportions to the middle class and the poor.\n  In the last few weeks, this issue of fairness has emerged more and \nmore clearly to me, more by its absence than by its presence. It looks \nto me as though the current standard, at least as it has been applied \nso far in the published plans of balanced budget proponents, will not \nrequire much, if any, sacrifice from special interests in our society \nwho have enjoyed certain tax breaks, benefits, preferences, deductions \nand credits that most regular middle-class taxpayers don't enjoy.\n\n\n          efforts to scrutinize tax breaks for wealthy blocked\n\n  But while the constitutional amendment's proponents don't seem to \nmind that it could require States to raise State taxes by large \nmargins, they are adamantly opposed to making sure that wealthy \ncorporations and others pay their fair share of the deficit reduction \nburden.\n  It is a fact, often overlooked, that we can spend money just as \neasily through the Tax Code, through what are called ``tax \nexpenditures,'' as we can through the normal appropriations process. \nSpending is spending, whether it comes in the form of a government \ncheck or in the form of a tax break for some special purpose, like a \nsubsidy, a credit, a deduction, or accelerated depreciation for this \ntype of investment or that. These tax expenditures--in some cases they \nare tax loopholes--allow some taxpayers to escape paying their fair \nshare, and thus make everyone else pay at higher rates. These arcane \ntax breaks are simply special exceptions to the normal rules, rules \nthat oblige all of us to share the burdens of citizenship by paying our \ntaxes.\n  The General Accounting Office issued a report last year titled, ``Tax \nPolicy: Tax Expenditures Deserve More Scrutiny.'' It makes a compelling \ncase for subjecting these tax expenditures to greater congressional and \nadministration scrutiny, just as direct spending is scrutinized. The \nGAO noted that most of these tax expenditures currently in the Tax Code \nare not subject to any annual reauthorization or other kind of \nsystematic periodic review. They observed that many of these special \ntax breaks were enacted in response to economic conditions that no \nlonger exist. In fact, they found that of the 124 tax expenditures \nidentified by the committee in 1993, about half were enacted before \n1950. Now that does not automatically call them into question. It just \nillustrates the problem of their not being very carefully looked at in \nany systematic way over very long periods of time. Many of these \nindustry-specific breaks get embedded in the Tax Code, and are not \nlooked at again for years. And yet we refused by roll call vote to even \ncommit to consider them as we move forward in our efforts to balance \nthe Federal books.\n  When we begin to weigh, for example, scaling back the special \ntreatment for percentage depletion allowances for the oil and gas \nindustry against cutting food and nutrition programs for hungry \nchildren, we may come out with quite different answers than we have in \nthe past about whether we can still afford to subsidize this industry. \nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that eliminating \nthis particular tax break would save $4.9 billion in Federal revenues \nover 5 years.\n  And this is not an isolated example. The Congressional Joint Tax \nCommittee has estimated that tax expenditures cost the U.S. Treasury \nover $420 billion every single year. And they estimate that if we don't \nhold them in check, that amount will grow by $60 billion to over $485 \nbillion by 1999. Now some tax expenditures serve important public \npurposes, like supporting charitable organizations, and should be \nretained. But many of these must be on the table along with other \nspending as we look for places to cut the deficit.\n  I could not find any hint of interest in cutting corporate tax breaks \nin the Republican contract, I think because many of the benefits of \nthese tax breaks go to very high-income people with wealth and power \nand clout in our society, and to corporations with high-powered\n lobbyists. They're the ones for whom the contract provides an \nestimated $169 billion windfall that would resurrect the tax-shelter \nindustry and effectively slash corporate rates.\n\n  At a time when we are talking about potentially huge spending cuts in \nmeat inspections designed to insure against \n[[Page S3328]] outbreaks of disease; or in higher education aid for \nmiddle class families; or in protection for our air, our lakes, and our \nland; or in highways; or in community development programs for States \nand localities; or in sewer and water projects for our big cities; or \nin safety net programs for vulnerable children, we should be willing to \nweigh these cuts against special tax loopholes on which we spend \nbillions each year. And yet we could not even agree to put these on the \ntable along with everything else as we move forward in our efforts to \nreduce the deficit.\n\n\n                        ENSHRINES MINORITY RULE\n\n  Constitutional and congressional scholars have observed that the \nbalanced budget amendment gives a veto power to a small minority of \neither the House or the Senate in key budget decisions, a profoundly \nantidemocratic shift away from our proud, 200-year-old tradition of \nmajority rule. The need to win approval from three-fifths of both \nHouses to waive the balanced budget requirement in a recession would \ngive added power to members whose votes might be needed to avoid \nplunging the country into a deeper downturn.\n  Thus, the price of an agreement to let the Government run even a \nmodest deficit during a recession, and to provide recession-related \nunemployment benefits, might be a capital gains cut or other tax break \ntouted by its backers as a ``growth incentive.'' As we saw in the \n1980's, these tax breaks usually prove to lose revenues and increase \nthe deficit over the long term, which in turn could lead to additional \nprogram cuts in subsequent years to bring the budget back into balance.\n\n\n                     WEAKENS OUR ABILITY TO INVEST\n\n  As I have observed, the balanced budget amendment would largely deny \nto the Federal government a basic practice that most businesses, \nfamilies, and States and local governments use--borrowing to finance \ninvestments with a long-term payoff. Borrowing to finance new \ninvestments is standard business practice. A business that failed to \nmodernize because it could not borrow would soon be left behind.\n  We must continue to invest in our people. Our economy is creating new \njobs at a near-record pace--over 5 million in the last 2 years alone--\nyet it doesn't give much help to those ordinary working families who \nare at the bottom, or in the struggling middle class. As one Iron \nRanger in Minnesota recently told me, ``All these jobs being created \ndoesn't do me much good if I have to hold three of them to keep my \nfamily together.'' His comment reflects the anger and economic \ninsecurity many Americans feel because their personal economic \nexperience doesn't jibe with what Government statistics tell them--that \nunemployment is down, inflation is in check, and economic growth\n and productivity are booming. Despite these statistics, standards of \nliving and real wages of workers remain flat, or in slight decline; \nmany are just one downsizing away from layoff, and feel less secure. We \nmust invest in the skills and futures of our people if we are going to \nturn this situation around.\n\n  The amendment would force a scaling back of Government investment in \nareas where economists stress more investment is needed: \ninfrastructure, education and training, early intervention programs for \nchildren, research and development. There is growing evidence we invest \ntoo little in these areas and that such under-investment has \ncontributed to our Nation's weak economic performance in recent years.\n  It is true that for too long the Federal Government has been \nundisciplined in its borrowing, and that is what threatens our fiscal \nfuture. We have a responsibility to future generations to get our \nfiscal house in order, and to do it the Federal Government has to \nreprioritize spending in relation to this central question of \ninvestment, by re-examining programs across the board and eliminating \nor scaling back those that are wasteful and unnecessary. We must \nredesign cumbersome Federal structures to meet the challenges of the \ninformation age, of rapidly changing demographics, of our decaying \ninner cities. We should do this in a way that's fair, open and \naccountable, without the budget smoke and mirrors that have too often \nfogged the real choices facing voters.\n  Let me say a word about the impact that systematic disinvestment \nwould have on working families, children and the elderly in my State, \nbecause ultimately that is what this whole debate is about.\n\n\n           the impact of the amendment on minnesota families\n\n  Throughout this debate, I have tried to ask myself basic questions \nabout the impact of this balanced budget amendment on the families in \nMinnesota whom I represent. I think it would inflict on Minnesotans \nserious harm, and that is why I cannot in good conscience support it. \nThat is ultimately the deciding factor for me.\n  I've already talked about the shell game that this amendment would \nrequire by shifting the costs of government from the Federal to the \nState level, and forcing States to raise income, property and sales \ntaxes--in Minnesota's case by about 13 percent, according to the \nTreasury Department. But what about the actual spending cuts? How would \nthey be distributed? Who would have to sacrifice, and who would \nbenefit?\n  Over 7 years, under the balanced budget amendment and accompanying \nRepublican proposals, Minnesota would lose nearly $5.9 billion in \nFederal Medicare funds, Medicaid cuts would total nearly $3.7 billion, \nelementary and secondary education would lose $1.5 billion, and Federal \nlaw enforcement would lose $143.7 million. Minnesota farmers also would \nlikely lose billions in farm payments, causing a serious decrease in \nfamily farm income. And it's not just rural areas\n that would be hit. The two largest urban counties in my State, \nHennepin and Ramsey Counties, would alone lose about $10.3 billion in \ntotal Federal aid over 7 years.\n\n  In addition, despite Republican promises to temporarily protect this \nprogram, large cuts in Social Security benefits to Minnesotans--an \nestimated $2,000 annually per beneficiary--should also be expected if \nthis program is slated for across-the-board cuts.\n  These are very large cuts, and they will have a major impact on the \npeople of my State. I have heard from elderly couples in Minnesota on \nfixed incomes, terrified about the impact of the amendment on their \nMedicare funding. And they have reason to be fearful. I have sat with \nhomeless men and women, Medicaid recipients, who are threatened with \ngoing without even the most basic health care under the amendment. \nInstead of this approach, we owe it to these people to do real \ncomprehensive health care reform.\n  Despite the claims of some that opponents of the amendment are \nexaggerating the threat posed by these huge spending cuts, this is for \nreal. I am not making this up. In fact, just the other day, Finance \nCommittee Chairman Packwood said that he thought we would have to make \nup to $550 billion in cuts in Medicare alone to meet its requirements--\nnot to mention the huge cuts in Medicaid he acknowledged would be \nnecessary. And it could go much higher than that, depending on budget \ndecisions made in other areas.\n  Finally, let me say a word about the process by which this amendment \nhas been considered. In recent weeks, balanced budget amendment \nproponents have rejected virtually every single good faith effort to \nimprove the constitutional amendment. Amendments to prevent a raid of \nthe Social Security trust funds, to exempt earned veteran's benefits, \nto strike the majority requirements, to prevent harm to hungry and \nhomeless children, to separate investment from day-to-day operating \nbudgets, to provide for exceptions for major disasters and economic \nrecessions--and many others--were defeated.\n  I believe that if the Senate passes this amendment today, as we look \nback on this debate from the midst of a serious recession, major \ndisaster, or even undeclared national security emergency, this \nunwillingness by proponents to accept even modest, reasonable changes \nin the amendment will prove seriously misguided.\n  While at first look this amendment appears to make sense and is \nwidely popular, amending our Constitution in this way would be a \nmistake with potentially serious fiscal, economic, and social \nconsequences and would seriously alter our democratic process. We can \nand should balance the budget without gimmicks and without changing the \nConstitution. I intend to continue to vote to do that. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in that effort, and to \n[[Page S3329]] vote no on the balanced budget amendment. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want deficit reduction and I am willing \nto work for it. That is why I supported the President's deficit \nreduction package in the last Congress. But while I have stood up for \nreal deficit reduction, what I am not prepared to do is to write into \nthe Constitution language that is more likely to lead to \ndisillusionment and constitutional crisis than to a balanced budget.\n  I see five flaws in the proposed amendment. First, the proposed \namendment would not balance the budget, it would just say that a future \nCongress has to pass a law to enforce a balanced budget. Why wait? \nUnless and until we make the tough choices needed to cut spending or \nraise revenues, we will not have a balanced budget, whether or not we \npass the proposed constitutional amendment and whether or not the \nStates ratify it. We will instead have passed what could turn out to be \na cynicism-deepening illusion.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment says that starting no earlier \nthan 2002, Congress has to have a law enacted which enforces a balanced \nbudget. Why wait? Why wait to do the hard work of passing implementing \nlaws and doing the actual budgeting? That's a dodge which allows some \nto say we are cured before we have taken the medicine. It puts a giant \nloophole in the Constitution to cover over congressional weakness.\n  In May 1992, Robert Reischauer, the Director of the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, testified before the House Budget \nCommittee that a balanced budget amendment is not a solution; it is \n``only a repetition in an even louder voice of an intention that has \nbeen stated over and over again during the course of the last 50 \nyears.'' Dr. Reischauer stated:\n\n       It would be a cruel hoax to suggest to the American public \n     that one more procedural promise in the form of a \n     constitutional amendment is going to get the job done. The \n     deficit cannot be brought down without making painful \n     decisions to cut specific programs and raise particular \n     taxes. A balanced budget amendment in and of itself will \n     neither produce a plan nor allocate responsibility for \n     producing one.\n\nDr. Reischauer further stated:\n\n       Without credible legislation for the transition that \n     embodies an effective mechanism for enforcement, government \n     borrowing is not going to be cut. But the transitional \n     legislation and the enforcement mechanism are 95 percent of \n     the battle. If we could get agreement on those, we would not \n     need a constitutional amendment.\n\n  The public understands this. They know the difference between \npromises and action. Let me tell you what some of the commentators are \nsaying about the balanced budget amendment back in my home State. Here \nis what the Detroit Free Press said on January 15:\n\n       You wouldn't take seriously any politician who promised to \n     be faithful to his spouse, beginning in 2002, so why do so \n     many people take seriously the proposed balanced-budget \n     amendment?\n       It's the same kind of empty promise to be good--not now, \n     but later. Putting it in the Constitution isn't likely to \n     confer on Congress the spine or the wisdom to fulfill it.\n       * * * [T]he way to cut the budget is to cut the budget, not \n     to promise to do it sometime in the future. * * * Gluing a \n     balanced budget amendment onto the Constitution only \n     postpones the moment of truth.\n\nAnd here is what the Battle Creek Enquirer said on January 29:\n\n       If a balanced budget is such a good idea, we say to \n     Congress: ``Just do it!'' After all, waiting until a \n     constitutional amendment mandates it will just delay a \n     balanced budget--perhaps by years.\n       This Congress isn't likely to give the nation a balanced \n     budget, that's for certain. But, by touting the need for this \n     amendment, it sure can talk like a Congress that already has \n     * * *  [I]t's all an illusion.\n\n  ``Just do it!'' That's what the American people want, Mr. President. \nThey know the difference between promises and action, and they want the \nlatter. A constitutional amendment can promise a balanced budget, but \nit cannot deliver a balanced budget. Only concrete action by the \nCongress can do that.\n  Put another way, Mr. President, the proposed constitutional amendment \nhas no effective enforcement mechanism. The amendment relies on a \nfuture Congress to act to implement and enforce it. That is the bottom \nline. This is the same reed that proved so weak in the 1980's when the \nPresident and the Congress quadrupled the national debt from $1 \ntrillion to $4 trillion.\n  The argument has been made that we have tried everything else, why \nnot a constitutional amendment. We can't depend on legislation, the \nargument goes, so let's try a constitutional amendment.\n  So what does this amendment do? It depends on the same kind of \nlegislation to be enacted which its sponsors say has not previously \nbeen effective.\n  When we were debating this amendment in 1986, Senator Hatch \nacknowledged the following:\n\n       [T]here is no question that Congress would have to pass \n     implementing legislation to make it effective. * * * It would \n     be the obligation of Congress, after the amendment is passed \n     by both Houses and ratified by three-quarters of the states \n     to * * * enact legislation that would cause this to come \n     about.\n\n  And again, CBO Director Reischauer pointed out that:\n\n       Without credible legislation for the transition that \n     embodies an effective mechanism for enforcement, government \n     borrowing is not going to be cut. But the transitional \n     legislation and the enforcement mechanism are 95 percent of \n     the battle. If we could get agreement on those, we would not \n     need a constitutional amendment.\n\n  Just a few weeks ago, on January 30, Senator Hatch stated:\n\n       ``* * * [U]nder section 6 of the amendment, Congress must--\n     and I emphasize must--mandate exactly what type of \n     enforcement mechanism it wants, whether it be sequestration, \n     rescission, or the establishment of a contingency fund.\n\n  In fact, the committee report accompanying this constitutional \namendment itself states that it ``* * * must be supplemented with \nimplementing legislation''.\n  Mr. President, I have offered an amendment to the constitutional \namendment to require this Congress to address this issue by adopting \nlegislation to implement and enforce a balanced budget requirement now. \nWithout my amendment, there are no real teeth in the promise of a \nbalanced budget contained in the proposed amendment.\n  Alexander Hamilton states in Federalist Paper No. 15, ``If there be \nno penalty annexed to disobedience, the resolutions or commands which \npretend to be laws will, in fact, amount to nothing more than advice or \nrecommendation.''\n  If congressional weakness is the reason for this amendment--and it \nis--then Congress will use the loopholes in this amendment to evade the \nresponsibility which it sets forth. My fear is that this amendment will \ngive us an excuse to duck the hard choices, as Congress has often \nchosen to do, until it would become effective in 2002--at the earliest. \nI am afraid that upcoming Congresses will say ``the balanced budget \namendment will take care of our problems, so we don't need to address \nthem now.''\n  Dr. Reischauer, in his 1992 testimony, listed a number of loopholes \nthat Congress could use to get around an apparently rigid balanced \nbudget rule:\n  Using timing mechanisms and other budget gimmicks to achieve short-\nrun budget targets, including such actions as shifting pay dates \nbetween fiscal years, accelerating or delaying tax collections, \ndelaying needed spending until future fiscal years, and selling \ngovernment assets;\n  Basing the budget on overly optimistic economic and technical \nassumptions; and\n  Creating off-budget agencies that would have authority to borrow and \nspend but whose transactions would not be directly recorded in the \nbudget.\n  That is what we did in the 1980's. We used optimistic estimates or \n``rosy scenarios''. Here are some of those estimates. In 1981, our \nestimates were off by $58 billion. In 1982, our estimates were off by \n$73 billion. In 1983, our estimates were off by $91 billion, and on and \non. In 1991, they were off by $119 billion--$119 billion in 1 year. You \ntalk about a loophole. This one is big enough to drive a $119 billion \ndeficit through. That is how big this loophole is.\n  The sponsors of the amendment say that the real enforcement mechanism \nis in section 2. That section provides that it will take 60 percent of \nthe votes, a supermajority, to increase the debt ceiling. So if our \nestimates are too rosy--if, for instance, we follow the 1980's model of \nestimates in order to evade the constitutional requirement, then, we \nare told, we can fall back on \n[[Page S3330]] the requirement that the debt limit can only be \nincreased by a 60 percent vote in each House.\n  As Senator Graham of Florida has pointed out, however, the so-called \ndebt limitation provision in the proposed amendment would allow us to \nrun deficits in the first decade and a half of the next century of as \nmuch as $120 billion a year, masked by taking that money from the \nSocial Security trust fund, without that counting toward the deficit. \nThe proposed amendment applies the 60-vote requirement to ``the limit \non the debt of the United States held by the public''. So the debt held \nby the Social Security Administration isn't covered and the usual \nmajority rule would apply to raising that debt limit.\n  In any case, history has proven the debt limit is a weak reed to rely \non, because when you vote on whether or not to increase the debt limit, \nyou are voting whether or not to bring down the Government of the \nUnited States. We have to pay our legitimate debts, however many votes \nit may take. If we don't do that, we are finished economically. To make \nthat point, let me quote from a July 8, 1987 letter from Secretary of \nthe Treasury James A. Baker III to the Chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee:\n\n       I cannot overemphasize the damage that would be done to the \n     United States' credit standing in the world if the Government \n     were to default on its obligations, nor the unprecedented and \n     catastrophic repercussions that would ensue. Market chaos, \n     financial institution failures, higher interest rates, flight \n     from the dollar and loss of confidence in the certainty of \n     all United States Government obligations would produce a \n     global economic and financial calamity. Future generations of \n     Americans would have to pay dearly for this grave breach of a \n     200-year-old trust.\n\n  Mr. President, we are not going to achieve a balanced budget by \nthreatening not to raise the debt ceiling, because that is a nuclear \nweapon aimed at the economy of this country. You don't balance the \nbudget by threatening suicide, and that is what a failure to pay our \ndebts would be. If we do not pay our debts, this country's economy is \nfinished. So whether it takes the usual majority or 61 votes, it \ndoesn't matter. We will have to increase the debt ceiling, because \nafter the debts have been incurred, we won't have any choice.\n  Mr. President, my second problem with the amendment is that if a \nlater Congress does adopt effective enforcement legislation, it would \nbe putting in the hands of a minority of Senators, representing as \nlittle as 15 percent of the population, critical decision-making power \nover the economy of this Nation. Under the proposed amendment, it is \nintended that outlays not exceed receipts, and the debt limit not be \nincreased, unless three-fifths of both Houses of the Congress agreed. \nThe economic future of our country should not be put in the hands of a \nminority by a constitutional amendment which would be so difficult to \nchange if it went awry.\n  My third problem with the amendment is that it would put the Social \nSecurity trust fund at risk. By my count, during this debate the Senate \nhas rejected at least three amendments to protect the Social Security \ntrust fund. As the senior Senator from Florida explained, Mr. \nPresident, that means that we will continue running deficits of at \nleast $120 billion a year for more than a decade after this amendment \nwould go into effect, and will conceal these deficits by taking the \nmoney from the Social Security trust fund. The money in that trust fund \nis exactly that--money that we have collected in trust. I cannot vote \nfor a constitutional amendment which allows the use of that money to \ncover up huge deficit spending. That's simply wrong.\n  My fourth problem with the amendment is that, if effectively \nimplemented, it would preclude the use of deficit spending to cushion \nthe impact of a recession. A balanced budget amendment would force the \nFederal Government to raise taxes and cut spending in recessions, to \noffset the loss of revenue caused by declining income. These policies \nwould deepen the impact of a recession and could even turn a mild \nrecession into a depression.\n  Indeed, the Treasury Department has done a study showing that, were \nit not for countercyclical deficit spending, roughly one and a half \nmillion more people would have been unemployed in the 1991-92 \nrecession. Mr. President, we should not ignore the real world hardships \ncaused by recessions and we should not act in a way which could cause \nmillions of Americans to lose their jobs.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am troubled by the fact that the proposed \namendment is intentionally ambiguous on the role of the President in \ncarrying out the amendment. The resolution of this crucial issue will \ndetermine how the amendment will affect the checks and balances placed \nin the Constitution by our Founding Fathers.\n  With regard to Presidential impoundment, the Senator from Utah, \nSenator Hatch, says the President would have no power to impound funds \nunless expressly granted by Congress, but the sponsors refuse to make \nthis explicit in the amendment itself.\n  There are some, including Members of this Senate, who already believe \nthat the President has inherent impoundment powers under article II of \nthe Constitution. Would not that argument be reinforced by a \nconstitutional amendment prohibiting outlays from exceeding receipts, \nin view of the President's duty to preserve, protect, and defend the \nConstitution?\n  Former Reagan administration Solicitor General Charles Fried has \ntestified that such a power would exist. He stated:\n\n       Now, the command of section 1 is very unqualified. Total \n     outlays shall not exceed total receipts unless you have the \n     three-fifths vote. It seems to me that command\n      would give the President--any President--a far better claim \n     to impound funds than that which was asserted some years \n     ago by President Nixon, because the President's warrant \n     would not be drawn from, as President Nixon said it was, \n     inherent powers of the Presidency. He could point to the \n     Constitution itself. He would say that they shall not \n     exceed, and he swears an oath to see that the laws are \n     faithfully executed, and I would think his claim to \n     impound would be very strong. Not only his claim, but he \n     would argue with considerable plausibility his duty to do \n     so.\n\n  So again, the record is, at best, unclear.\n  The question whether the President could enforce the amendment by \nimpoundment would not be an insurmountable problem, had the majority \nnot chosen to make it so. For instance, when we approved a balanced \nbudget amendment in the Senate in 1982, we included language proposed \nby the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, to ensure that the \namendment could not be construed to grant the President impoundment \npowers.\n  This year, however, the sponsors of the amendment decided to remain \nsilent on this issue. That is not the way we should address the \nquestion of amending the Constitution. This is the Constitution we are \ntalking about, and we need to know what the amendment we are \nconsidering means in this critical area.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the proposed amendment provides too \neasy an excuse for Congress not to act now to reduce the deficit and it \ndoesn't force congressional action later either.\n  It lets us off the hook now, and there is no hook later.\n  It's based on the argument that a constitutional amendment is needed \nbecause previous laws calling for a balanced budget didn't work. But \nits success, by its own terms in section 6, is dependent upon a future \nCongress enacting a similar law.\n  The amendment before us, in other words, is unlikely to reduce the \ndeficit, but is likely to increase public cynicism about the willpower \nof Congress to act.\n  We can and we should adopt enforcement legislation to achieve a \nbalanced budget now, with or without a constitutional amendment.\n  There is only one way to balance the budget now, or in 2002--and that \nis with the willpower to make the tough choices. I hope we will defeat \nthis constitutional amendment and instead show the will power to make \nthe tough choices and enact enforcement legislation actually needed to \nbalance the budget.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I voted against House Joint Resolution 1, \nthe so-called balanced budget amendment.\n  I voted no because this amendment is a 10-second political sound bite \nwith decades of economic implications. It will handcuff future \ngenerations to an \n[[Page S3331]] economic blueprint this Congress dictates in 1995. And, \nworst of all, it makes a mockery of the most important document this \ncountry has ever produced.\n  I am a member of the Budget Committee. When I came to the Congress 2 \nyears ago, I faced the largest debt ever amassed by any country in the \nhistory of civilization. More debt was created during the 12 years of \nRepublican administrations in the 1980's and early 1990's than in the \nentire 200 years preceding them.\n  I strongly support putting this country's economic house in order. \nMr. President, I support a balanced Federal budget. The people of this \nNation deserve nothing less. But this amendment does not get us there. \nWords on a piece of paper cannot balance the budget, only legislators \nlike you and I can.\n  We have to make tough choices as we correct the fiscal mismanagement \nof the 1980's. We have to balance the budget with surgical cuts; with a \nscalpel, not a meat cleaver.\n  Mr. President, we have made some very tough decisions. I was one \nMember of this body who voted for a plan--a plan with specific cuts and \ncommon sense--which reduces the deficit by $505 billion over 5 years. \nProgram-by-program, cut-by-cut. Most of the Members of the Senate who \nvoted against the deficit reduction plan now support this \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, where are the specifics? What will they cut? Which \ntaxes will they raise? Who will be hurt? The American people have a \nright to know. Under this amendment, we have no idea.\n  For example, will they cut out funding for the Federal Government's \nobligation to clean-up the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in my home State \nof Washington? Will they eliminate the home mortgage deduction? Will \nthey cut Head Start, or WIC, or Ryan White? Will they stop guaranteeing \nstudent loans? Will they block further assistance to our depressed \ntimber communities, or job training for laid-off aerospace workers?\n  Mr. President, just this week, we have seen some examples of how \ncareless cuts can be when they are made with a meat cleaver. The \nrescissions package coming before the Senate soon is a mean-spirited \nand irrational piece of legislation. As nasty as those cuts are, they \nstill do not get us to a balanced budget. Instead, they damage those we \ncan least afford to harm: our children.\n  If this body is serious about deficit reduction, we should resume the \ndebate on health care reform. Even cutting every discretionary program \nwill not get us to a balanced budget. We must control the growth of \nhealth care costs. I find it ironic that many of the same Senators who \nopposed the health care reform bill last year now support this \nconstitutional amendment.\n  This so-called balanced budget amendment is dangerous. It will remove \nall our flexibility in dealing with emergencies--economic troubles like \nrecessions, or even natural disasters like volcanic eruptions, \nearthquakes, flooding, hurricanes, and massive fires. My home State has \nexperienced many such disasters recently. If this amendment had been \npart of the Constitution, how would my friends and neighbors have \ncoped?\n  Mr. President, I believe many of our colleagues would want to help in \nthese emergency situations. That is why the Congress is the proper \nvenue for deciding these issues--our Founding Fathers thought so, too.\n  This constitutional amendment throws our responsibility to the \ncourts. The courts will decide if funding is appropriate. Supreme Court \njustices are not responsible to the people of my home State; they are \nnot elected by anyone. They are not sent to the Nation's capital to \ntend to the needs of my constituents.\n  Mr. President, we have amended the Constitution only 17 times since \nwe adopted the Bill of Rights. We have never changed the Constitution \nlightly. With each previous amendment, the American people voted to \nexpand rights and outline responsibilities--we have never inserted an \neconomic plan into the Constitution. This amendment sets a terrible \nprecedent.\n  I voted in favor of several amendments to the House Joint Resolution \n1. I could see that the resolution had considerable support, and I \nwanted to make sure that if it did indeed pass, we protected our most \nvulnerable populations; that we maintained the integrity of the Social \nSecurity trust fund; that we continued our fight against violent crime; \nthat we respected our veterans; and that we exempt natural disasters \nfrom cuts.\n  I also believe that we should display common sense and work to reduce \nthe massive deficit before we enacted sweeping, across-the-board tax \ncuts.\n  These safeguards all failed--every one of them. All attempts at \ntempering the resolution, or placing some sensible priorities into the \nlegislation, were killed.\n  Mr. President, this is bad policy, and I cannot support any measure \nthat will handcuff our country's economic policy. When I stand in this \nChamber, I remember that I am not only a U.S. Senator but also a \nmother.\n  It might be popular to vote yes, but I won't worry about my own \npersonal popularity until I know my children's economic future is safe. \nI do not believe we should trivialize our Constitution in order to give \npoliticians a reason to make the kind of choices they should be making \nanyway.\n  This resolution will hurt our country and handcuff future \ngenerations. Amending the U.S. Constitution is not worth the gamble. \nFor these reasons, Mr. President, I did not support House Joint \nResolution 1.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, since 1981, there have been eight \nbalanced budget amendment measures that have been approved by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and reported to the Senate. Three of these \nmeasures have received floor consideration.\n  In 1982, the Senate passed Senate Joint Resolution 58 by a 69-to-31 \nvote. This marked the first time either House of Congress had approved \nsuch a measure. Although a substantial majority of the House of \nRepresentatives voted in favor of a counterpart of Senate Joint \nResolution 58, the 236-to-187 margin fell short of the necessary two-\nthirds vote.\n  In 1986, the Senate rejected a balanced budget amendment (S.J. Res. \n225) by a vote of 66-to-34, thus failing to achieve the necessary two-\nthirds majority by a single vote.\n  Then during 1994, the Senate defeated Senate Joint Resolution 41 by a \nvote of 63-to-37, 4 votes short of the two-thirds necessary for \nadoption.\n  Since coming to the Senate in 1979, I consistently have cosponsored \nand supported balanced budget amendment measures, and have voted for \nadoption of these measures at each and every opportunity. I strongly \nsupport the proposed amendment before us which was approved by the \nHouse of Representatives. With our vote today, the Senate will choose \nbetween a failed status quo or a new road toward true fiscal \naccountability.\n  Mr. President, there is compelling need for a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. The Federal Government has run deficits \nfor 23 years in a row and for 54 of the last 62 years. As a result, our \nnational debt has spiraled to more than $4.8 trillion. The gross annual \ninterest on the debt exceeds $300 billion.\n  Moreover, if we maintain the status quo--as reflected in the \nPresident's budget request for fiscal year 1996--the national debt \nwould increase to more than $6.7 trillion in 2000. Mr. President, is \nthis the kind of legacy we want to impose upon our children and \ngrandchildren?\n  The harsh fact is that up until now we have tried every legislative \nmeans possible to lower deficit spending and achieve tax revenues in \nexcess of outlays. In the past 10 years, we have seen Gramm-Rudman, \nGramm-Rudman II, the 1990 budget amendment, and the failed 1993 budget \nplan. These well-intended measures have failed to move us closer to a \nbalanced budget. Even if it were to succeed for one budgetary cycle, \nwhat assurances are there for continued balanced budgets and surpluses \nsufficient to eliminate our national debt?\n  There must be a measure beyond Federal statute and outside the \npresent legislative process that would require continued balanced \nFederal budgets. That is why a constitutional measure is necessary.\n  The constitutional amendment before the Senate today would prohibit \ndeficit spending except during any fiscal year in which a declaration \nof war \n[[Page S3332]] is in effect or when the country is engaged in an urgent \nnational security crisis. Also, the limit on deficit spending and the \nlimit on the national debt may be waived by a recorded vote of three-\nfifths of the whole number of each House.\n  It seems that if the limits on deficit spending and the national debt \ncould be waived by a simple majority vote of the House and the Senate, \nthe purpose of the constitutional amendment would be nullified. It is \nclear more than a majority should be required to waive the amendment. \nYear after year huge deficits have been incurred by simple majority \nvotes.\n  Requiring a supermajority vote is not unique. The Constitution \ncurrently has nine supermajority requirements on specific actions or \nmeasures. These supermajorities include: ratification of treaties; veto \noverrides; expulsion of a Member of the Senate or the House; \nimpeachment of the President, Vice President, and other Federal civil \nofficers and judges; waiver of disability of certain persons who \nengaged in rebellion against the United States; election of a Vice \nPresident by the Senate; and amendment of the Constitution. Also, \nsupermajorities are provided for in each House under its constitutional \nright to determine the rules of its proceedings.\n  Measures such as a declaration of war or an amendment to the \nConstitution were rightly considered by the framers to be the most \nserious of policy commitments. They believed a broader consensus was \nneeded for these beyond a simple majority. The framers also imposed \nsupermajority requirements to ensure that the fundamental rights of \nindividuals were not overrun by the tyranny of a majority. Mr. \nPresident, we have reached a point in our history that any serious \nthought of further mortgaging the future of our children and \ngrandchildren should require a broader consensus than a simple \nmajority. It is for them that we must get our fiscal house in order. It \nis for them that we must pass this balanced budget amendment.\n  The proposed amendment would take effect within 2 years after \nratification by three-fourths of the States, or by 2002, whichever \ncomes later. It is significant that 48 States, including my home State \nof South Dakota, have constitutional provisions limiting their ability \nto incur budget deficits. Such constraints have proven workable in the \nStates.\n  It is not surprising that a large majority of persons throughout the \ncountry who have been polled on this issue support a balanced budget \namendment. Certainly, a large majority of South Dakotans from whom I \nhave heard and with whom I have met urge that this resolution be \nadopted. They know it is the only way to achieve balanced Federal \nbudgets and reduction of the national debt. I hope, Mr. President, our \ncolleagues will bring that about.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, during the past few days, I have been \ndismayed at the attempts of the proponents of this constitutional \namendment to find a fix to pick up a vote or two in order to obtain \npassage. It may make for high drama, but it also makes for bad law. \nThis is the United States Constitution that they are seeking to amend \nand its provisions should be carefully crafted, studied and considered. \nBack rooms and political dealmaking have no place in amending the \nConstitution.\n  At the center of these desperate negotiations has apparently been a \nbelated effort to jerryrig some type of budget resolution or \nimplementing legislation to protect the Social Security trust fund from \nbeing used to balance the budget under this so-called balanced budget \namendment. This is absurd.\n  The language of House Joint Resolution 1 is very clear. Section 1 \nstates: ``Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \nreceipts for that fiscal year.* * *'' And section 7 states: ``Total \nreceipts shall include all receipts of the U.S. Government except those \nderived from borrowing. Total outlays shall include all outlays of the \nU.S. Government except for those for repayment of debt principal.'' The \nundisputed reading of this language is that the Social Security trust \nfund will be covered by this constitutional amendment.\n  In addition to the unambiguous language of the constitutional \namendment itself, the legislative history of House Joint Resolution 1 \nmakes it clear that the Social Security trust fund is not protected. In \nfact, the proponents have fought back all efforts in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to amend the same language in Senate Joint \nResolution 1 and all amendments offered here on the Senate floor over \nthe past month.\n  During Senate Judiciary Committee consideration of this \nconstitutional amendment, Senator Feinstein offered an amendment to \nexclude funds going in and out of the Social Security trust fund from \nthe definition of total receipts and total outlays. Unfortunately, a \nmajority of members of the Senate Judiciary Committee tabled Senator \nFeinstein's amendment by a vote of 10 to 8 on January 18, 1995.\n  During the Senate debate on House Joint Resolution 1, Democrats \noffered two separate amendments to take Social Security off the table. \nSenator Reid offered an amendment to this constitutional amendment that \nwould have legally protected the\n Social Security trust fund by excluding it from the definitions of \ntotal outlays and total receipts in section 7 of House Joint Resolution \n1. But that amendment was tabled by a vote of 57 to 41 on February 14, \n1995.\n\n  Just a few days ago, Senator Feinstein offered a substitute balanced \nbudget amendment that again would have legally protected the Social \nSecurity trust fund by excluding it from the definitions of total \noutlays and total receipts in the substitute amendment. Again, the \nproponents of this constitutional amendment tabled the Feinstein \nsubstitute amendment by a vote of 60 to 39. Whether the Tennessee \nValley Authority is exempted and placed ``off budget'' may be in doubt, \nbut there is no doubt that the Social Security trust fund is included \nby the proponents of this constitutional amendment.\n  Trying to craft some type of subsequent, legislative fix is folly. No \ncourt in the country would enforce a statute that tries to overrule the \nclear language of a constitutional amendment and the clear legislative \nhistory supporting that language. The only way to protect the Social \nSecurity trust fund from this so-called balanced budget amendment is to \nwrite that protection into the text of House Joint Resolution 1 itself. \nThere is no other legally sound or enforceable way.\n  Moreover, any follow-up legislative effort to protect Social Security \ncould be changed at any time by subsequent legislation and would offer \nno permanent protection. Unlike an amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States, a simple majority of Senators, or in the case of \nlegislation changing the Budget Act 61 Senators, could change \nlegislation trying to take Social Security off the tale. The \nlegislation would fall far short of the protection of having something \nenshrined in the Constitution, which the Founding Fathers purposely \nmade difficult to amend.\n  If proponents are finally willing to offer real protection for Social \nSecurity, why do it with only a budget resolution or statute? And if \nthat is good enough for Social Security, why not cut the deficit \nthrough the same mechanism?\n  Let us be honest with the American people. The real reason the \nproponents of this so-called balanced budget amendment refuse to \nprotect Social Security in the constitutional amendment itself is that \nthey have no intention of protecting Social Security. Proponents of \nthis constitutional amendment plan to use the annual surpluses in the \nSocial Security trust fund to mask the true deficit. To make it easier \nto thump their chests that the budget is balanced, the supporters of \nthis constitutional amendment hope to raid the $705 billion in annual \nsurpluses in the Social Security trust fund that will accumulate \nbetween now and 2002.\n  It was most revealing that their recent offer to compromise with \nSenators Conrad and Dorgan on this point was to stop counting the \nsurpluses in the Social Security trust fund in 2012, or about the time \nthat those surpluses are projected to dry up.\n  Let us put an end to this foolishness. Either protect Social Security \nin the language of House Joint Resolution 1 or not, but quit playing \ngames with the Constitution of the United States. I have argued since \nthis measure began \n[[Page S3333]] being considered that we needed to tackle the important \nquestions of implementing legislation first. But the proponents of this \nmeasure have refused. They remain prepared to leave every concern and \nserious problem for later.\n  But their mantra, that fundamental flaws in the constitutional \namendment itself can be fixed in implementing legislation, rings \nhollow. Even if we believed their sudden change of heart on these \nmattes signalled a real change in philosophy, some problems created by \nthe amendment cannot be corrected in mere implementing legislation. The \nConstitution defines the ground rules, and the Constitution overrules \nany contradictory implementing legislation.\n  Let us bring this sorry spectacle to an end. Let us vote to defeat \nthe so-called balanced budget amendment. Maybe then the Senate could \nget past this slogan of an amendment and let us get on with real \nbusiness, making the tough choices needed to take real action to reduce \nthe deficit.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last week I announced my decision to \nsupport the balanced budget amendment.\n  I rise today to explain my choice.\n  Considering amendments to our Constitution is one of the Senate's \nmost profound responsibilities. Our Nation has made only 17 such \nchanges since the Bill of Rights was ratified over 200 years ago.\n  But in recent decades a structural imbalance has occurred in the way \nthe Federal Government finances its operations. Each year, we find \nourselves deeper and deeper in debt, with no reasonable prospect for \nconstraining either the deficit or the debt.\n  We cannot balance our budget. Or, more precisely, we will not.\n  As I considered the balanced budget amendment as a possible solution \nto this problem, I had to first answer an important question--Is this \nan issue worthy of constitutional consideration?\n  From the point over 10 years ago when I offered my own constitutional \namendment to balance the Federal budget, up to my vote for Senator \nReid's balanced budget amendment last year, I have held that this is an \nissue worthy of constitutional consideration.\n  The decision to encumber future generations with financial \nobligations is one that can rightly be considered among the fundamental \nchoices addressed in the Constitution.\n  If this issue meets the test of constitutional significance, Mr. \nPresident, then is House Joint Resolution 1 the way to address it?\n  Mr. President, many of my colleagues, whose very valid concerns I \nhave shared, have honored this Chamber with an eloquent presentation of \nthe problems this particular amendment could cause.\n  I will respond to some of those arguments later.\n  But none of their arguments has overcome my concern for the future of \nour Nation's economy--for the country we will pass on to our children.\n  After so many years of seeking alternative solutions, I can see no \nother reasonable prospect for sharply curtailing the debt than the \nadoption of this amendment into our Constitution.\n  Mr. President, it is one thing to have deficits of $20 to $40 billion \nper year, which we could live with for the foreseeable future. But it \nis quite another thing to have deficits of $200 to $400 billion. And \njust 6 years from now, Mr. President, $400 billion is just what our \ndeficit will be, not counting the surplus in the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  Under these extraordinary circumstances, it seems reasonable to me to \nrequire an extraordinary majority of Congress to continue deficit \nspending.\n  Even if this amendment passes and is ratified by the States, I know \nthat we will continue to have some deficits. It is the potential size \nof deficits that bothers me; there is nothing sacred about a balanced \nbudget.\n  But if we do decide to add to our national debt, it should be for \nimportant reasons, such as managing recessions or natural disasters--or \nsecuring the future well-being of our children--for reasons that can \ncommand the support of three-fifths of both Houses.\n  Over a decade ago, Mr. President, we strayed from the course that \nhad, since the end of World War II, shrunk the national debt as a share \nof our economy. Since the early 1980's, we have foolishly, and \nsignificantly, increased our national debt year after year.\n  In 1980, Federal debt held by the public totalled $710 billion, and \nthe interest we paid on the debt was $52 billion. This year, that debt \nhas reached $3.6 trillion, and our interest payments will be $234 \nbillion.\n  Recognizing the folly of this course, in 1984 I proposed a freeze on \nevery program of the Federal Government--across the board. Although I \nwrote the plan with two Republican Senators, we received little support \nfor the proposal, from either side of the aisle.\n  By the way, I am convinced, Mr. President, that had we acted then, \nthe harm to many of the programs that I hold dear, responsibilities \nthat moved me to enter public life, would have been softened.\n  As it is, without the freeze--that we were warned would harm so-\ncalled liberal programs--I have had to watch as those programs have \ngone through the wringer.\n  In 1981, when we lost control of the deficit, human services programs \nwere 8.6 percent of Federal outlays. A decade later, they were 6.9 \npercent, a 20-percent reduction in their share of spending.\n  In 1981, education, training, employment and social services were 3.7 \npercent of Federal outlays. Over the next decade, as deficits and \ninterest payments grew, they shrank to 2.3 percent, a 40-percent cut in \ntheir share of Federal spending.\n  After failing to pass the freeze, in the hope of restoring some \ndiscipline to our finances and reducing the deficit, I supported the \nGramm-Rudman process, that put caps on the amount of deficit allowed, \nand required a balanced budget.\n  But the requirements changed every year; the only constant in the \nprocess was the annual increase in the national debt, and the guarantee \nof annual deficits.\n  And in 1993, we passed an historic budget agreement at the beginning \nof the Clinton administration, that will cut $500 billion from our \ndeficits over 5 years. The healthy economy that followed passage of \nthat plan has meant even more deficit savings.\n  If I thought that we could sustain this trend, Mr. President, I would \nwithhold my support for this amendment.\n  But, what was the political response to that serious deficit \nreduction plan? It was denounced by those who now claim they want to \nattack the deficit.\n  That plan was passed by a single vote in both Houses, without one \nRepublican vote. Moreover, that plan has been used by so-called deficit \nhawks to defeat the very Members of Congress who had the courage to \nvote for it.\n  And now we see again a plan by the new majority for tax cuts, defense \nincreases--including star wars--and, of course, the promise of a \nbalanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I've read this story before. We are all living out the \nconsequences of the first time we tried that program.\n  It is clear now that there are no options left before us to turn the \nshort-term success of the 1993 budget plan into a longer-term program \nto bring down future deficits.\n  And there are no other options to force those who voted against \ndeficit reduction back then to face the consequences--requiring them to \nlook at everything including revenues rather than continue the charade \nthat the only thing we need to do to balance the budget is to cut \nforeign aid and AFDC.\n  Because they--and we--have been so successful in misleading the \nAmerican people about the problem, those aspects of the Government's \nresponsibilities that I entered public life to support have already \nbeen badly harmed as a consequence of these gigantic deficits: \nchildren, education, fighting crime and drugs, supporting organizations \nthat promote international stability.\n  And those areas of the budget that need help the least--tax loopholes \nfor the privileged, exotic weapons systems, people who aren't middle \nclass or poor but who make money off of their programs--those have done \nthe best.\n  I offer as evidence the recent votes in the House. Now, without the \nbalanced budget amendment, our fiscal disarray is the pretext for cuts \nin school \n[[Page S3334]] lunches, infant nutrition, the successful and effective \nHead Start Program, and educational programs that our future depends \non. Do my friends who share my values--who share my indignation at this \ndisregard for those least able to help themselves, this short-sighted \nslighting of the future--do they really believe that if we were to vote \ndown the balanced budget amendment that those legislative priorities \nwould change?\n  I am convinced--reluctantly--that unless we use this opportunity to \ntry to restore control over our finances, we will not be able to re-\nestablish our priorities.\n  Our fight is not--or should not be--against making deficit spending a \nmore difficult choice.\n  Our fight, with or without a balanced budget amendment, is against \nthose who would walk away from Government's responsibilities and who \nwill sacrifice the future for short-term political advantage.\n  Despite the shrinkage in those programs in recent years, we still \nface a future of increasing national debt, and rising annual deficits, \nand those programs and responsibilities I feel most strongly about will \ncontinue to take the hits.\n  This year alone, we will pay $234 billion in interest on the debt. By \n1997, interest will be $270 billion--more than either our defense or \ndomestic spending.\n  If this trend is unsustainable--and it is--and if the hard choices we \nmake are turned against us--and they are--What, then can we do?\n  I have concluded, Mr. President, that there is nothing left to try \nexcept the balanced budget amendment, forcing everything onto the \ntable, and requiring us to justify why some areas have escaped the \nbudget ax so far.\n  But what of the many arguments against this amendment--concerns that \nI have shared in the past. Let me explain my thoughts on some of those \nconcerns today.\n  Mr. President, one of the strongest practical arguments raised \nagainst the balanced budget amendment is that it will cost us our \nability to respond to recessions.\n  There are two points that I want to make in regard to that serious \ncharge. First, the sad fact is that we have already lost that \nflexibility--by making deficits the norm in good times and in \nrecessions. Until we regain control of our finances, deficits will \nremain an unintended consequence of our budget process, not a selective \npolicy choice.\n  Second, Mr. President, even under the constraints of this amendment, \nit is possible to provide that flexibility. In Delaware, we have built \na two percent surplus into each year's budget, to assure that we can \ncover unforeseen events that could raise spending or reduce revenues.\n  We could do that with the Federal budget, and restore its important \nstabilizing role, a role that is now lost in the annual red ink. This \nis not something that appears to be a realistic option in the near \nterm, but if that is the only way to restore the effect of automatic \nstabilizers in the Federal budget, we will be able to choose that \noption.\n  This amendment will make automatic stabilization more difficult, but \nit will remain our choice to restore that function of the Federal \nbudget to its former effectiveness.\n  There are other concerns that I share with my colleagues who oppose \nthis amendment.\n  Together, we tried to make this a better proposal. I believe that \nthis amendment could be improved by changes I have supported here on \nthe floor and in the Judiciary Committee.\n  We tried to keep the Social Security trust fund off budget, where it \nis now, and where it should stay. We failed to pass that amendment, and \nthis will allow us to continue to mask the current deficit with funds \nthat are needed to meet future obligations.\n  I believe that this failure takes us further from the truth about our \nreal deficit problems, and further from the truth about the very real \nproblems in the Social Security system itself.\n  But let me stress for those who are concerned about the effect of \nthis amendment on the Social Security system--this change in our \nConstitution does not, by itself, cut a dime from current benefits.\n  Under current rules, Social Security is now off budget, but by law \nits surpluses still go to purchase the accumulating pile Treasury bonds \nthat we will have to pay off in the future.\n  Taking Social Security out of the balanced budget amendment would not \nchange that aspect of the system, or prevent tampering with the \ncommitments we have made in the past.\n  My concern, in addition to the ways in which that accumulating \nsurplus will distort our definition of the budget, is that this \namendment will increase the temptation to use the Social Security \nsystem to make the rest of the budget appear more balanced.\n  This is a valid reason to try to insulate Social Security from that \ntemptation--but not reason to renounce what I have concluded is our \nlast chance to restore control over our country's financial future.\n  We also tried, Mr. President, to assure that the real costs of a \nbalanced budget amendment, and not just its surface allure, are \napparent to the citizens who will be asked to ratify it in the coming \nmonths.\n  And we tried to provide a capital budget--to treat public investments \nthe way families, businesses, and States treat their investments. And \nwe failed.\n  But I want the record to show that we are not prohibited by this \namendment from devising a capital budget. I predict that events and \nexperience will show us that a capital budget is essential to setting \npriorities, and that we will find a way to fit such a process into our \nbudget system.\n  We tried to avoid a potential shift in the constitutional balance of \npowers by ensuring that only the Congress would enforce a balanced \nbudget, Mr. President, and we tried to avoid tying up the courts with \nconstitutional questions about the President's role in enforcing a \nbalanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I believe that these constitutional issues remain the \ngreatest risk we will take when we add this amendment to our \nConstitution.\n  Now, with the acceptance of Senator Nunn's amendment, Mr. President, \nsome of my concern on that issue has been relieved.\n  So where do we stand?\n  We can vote for this less than perfect amendment, that requires 60 \npercent majorities to permit deficits--and I predict that we will \nchoose to permit those deficits, but smaller deficits, and less \nfrequently, than before.\n  Or, Mr. President, we can continue to add every year to the debt \nburden of future generations.\n  We will steal today from the next generation, squeezing out the \nsavings and investment that could increase future wealth.\n  We will continue to tie our own hands, to restrict our own ability--\nindeed, our responsibility--to set priorities in our annual budget \nprocess.\n  This year, interest on the national debt will cost the United States \n$234 billion; the entire domestic discretionary budget will be $253 \nbillion.\n  By the time this amendment is intended to become law, in the year \n2002, interest on the debt will be $344 billion, larger than every \nother category in the budget except for Social Security.\n  Given that prospect, Mr. President, I choose to take a chance on the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I hope that reverence for the Constitution and the procedural \nroadblocks in the amendment will establish an ethic of budget balance \nand a new, responsible, tradition will grow from the action we take \nhere today.\n  But only history will tell.\n  But I have sufficient confidence in our citizens and in our political \ninstitutions that we will learn from any flaws that remain in this \namendment, and will make the best of its virtues.\n  Two hundred years of American history tells me it is right to have \nthat confidence.\n  But at the end of the day, Mr. President, I am willing to take the \nfirst step today down this new path. I will vote for the balanced \nbudget amendment, but I will do so with my eyes open.\n  It is not the panacea some of its proponents have advertised, but \nneither is it the plague its opponents have portrayed.\n  For me, it as a reluctantly chosen opportunity to regain responsible \ncontrol over our affairs.\n  And I hope that the record of my words and actions on this amendment \nwill help my fellow citizens, both in my \n[[Page S3335]] State of Delaware and in the other States, as they \nconsider its ratification.\n  I hope that they consider fully the record of debate we have worked \nto establish here in the Congress. That record should make us all, on \nboth sides of this profound issue, proud.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on Wednesday, March 1, a story in the \nWashington Post discussing my judicial review amendment to the balanced \nbudget amendment referred to the views of Prof. Kathleen Sullivan of \nthe Stanford Law School. The views of Professor Sullivan, as reported \nin the Post, could be viewed as critical of my amendment limiting \njudicial review. That would not be an accurate reflection of Professor \nSullivan's views.\n  I received a letter from Professor Sullivan yesterday in which she \nnotes:\n\n       I have had the opportunity to read your remarks in the \n     floor proceedings yesterday, and agree with you completely \n     that it would be imprudent to pass the [Balanced Budget] \n     Amendment in the mere unfounded hope that courts would not \n     entertain lawsuits arising under it. Addressing the judicial \n     review issue squarely, as you did, is plainly a step in the \n     right direction.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter from Professor \nSullivan and the article in the Post be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate overwhelmingly adopted \nthe amendment to limit judicial review under the balanced budget \namendment. My amendment will ensure that no court interjects itself \ninto the balanced budget process except as specifically authorized by \nCongress.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, in drafting implementing legislation, \nincluding implementing legislation on the subject of judicial review. \nTo the extent that Congress exercises the authority in the amendment to \nregulate the judicial role, there are ample precedents for statutory \nprovisions to ensure that judicial review does not interfere with the \ntaxing and spending powers of Congress. These could include, for \nexample, providing exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal courts or in a \ndesignated Federal court; removal to Federal court of any case filed in \na State court; and restriction of the remedies, if any, that a court \ncould grant.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Stanford Law School,\n\n                                                    March 1, 1995.\n     Senator Sam Nunn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: Congratulations on your success \n     yesterday in persuading your colleagues of the danger that \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment, in its unamended form, would \n     unwisely transfer constitutional authority from the Congress \n     to the courts. I have had the opportunity to read your \n     remarks in the floor proceedings yesterday, and agree with \n     you completely that it would be imprudent to pass the \n     Amendment in the mere unfounded hope that courts would not \n     entertain lawsuits arising under it. Addressing the judicial \n     review issue squarely, as you did, is plainly a step in the \n     right direction. I am glad that you found my letter useful in \n     addressing this issue.\n       You may have read me quoted in the Washington Post this \n     morning as saying that your amendment renders the Balanced \n     Budget Amendment more an ``exhoration'' than an ``enforceable \n     requirement'' along the lines of many other constitutional \n     provisions. While this quote is accurate, it leaves out my \n     further comment to the reporter that the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment is, for that very reason, better with the Nunn \n     Amendment than without it. While I continue to believe that \n     there are strong reasons not to tamper with the existing \n     constitutional machinery in this area at all, I believe that \n     any measure that reduces the net transfer of power from the \n     legislative to the judicial and executive branches is \n     desirable.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Kathleen M. Sullivan.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 1, 1995]\n\n                   Dole Delays Budget Amendment Vote\n\n\n     one supporter short of passage, gop pressed holdout democrats\n\n                    (By Eric Pianin and Helen Dewar)\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.) last night \n     abruptly put off a final vote on the proposed balanced budget \n     amendment after GOP leaders failed in a desperate daylong bid \n     to pluck the critical 67th vote from among wavering \n     Democrats.\n       Faced with almost certain defeat, Dole delayed the vote--\n     until today or perhaps later in the week--to buy time while \n     Republicans stepped up efforts to win over one of a handful \n     of Democrats, particularly North Dakota Sens. Kent Conrad and \n     Byron L. Dorgan, who have demanded changes in the measure to \n     protect Social Security as well as other safeguards.\n       Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), a leading opponent of the \n     measure and a senior figure in the Senate, lashed out at Dole \n     for postponing the vote, charging that Republicans appeared \n     to be engaging in ``a sleazy, tawdry effort to win a victory \n     at the cost of amending the Constitution of the United \n     States.'' Byrd charged that Dole's action flouted a unanimous \n     agreement to hold the critical vote yesterday, following more \n     than a month of intense debate.\n       ``This is a sad spectacle,'' Byrd said.\n       ``I think the sad spectacle is that we may lose this \n     vote,'' Dole retorted.\n       Dole refused to back down, saying there was still a chance \n     Republicans could recruit at least one more senator to help \n     pass the amendment by the two-thirds majority required. He \n     said that in the wake of last fall's elections, when \n     Republicans swept to control of Congress pledging to balance \n     the budget and make dramatic changes in the face of \n     government, the Senate owed it to the American people to make \n     one more try.\n       ``We still think there's some chance of getting this \n     resolved by tomorrow and getting 67 votes,'' Dole said. ``If \n     we fail, we fail.''\n       Dole's decision came after an extraordinary day of back-\n     room dealing in which Dole, Senate Judiciary Committee \n     Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and other leaders pleaded \n     with and cajoled every Democrat they could collar.\n       Republican leaders had assumed until early yesterday that \n     the key to winning passage of the amendment was appeasing \n     Sen. Sam Nunn (Ga.), a highly influential Democrat who had \n     threatened to oppose the measure unless it was changed to \n     prohibit the courts from intervening in future congressional \n     tax and budget matters.\n       But even after Dole and other GOP leaders relented and the \n     amendment was revised to satisfy Nunn and one other waffling \n     Democrat, Sen. John Breaux (La.), Republican vote counters \n     still came up one vote shy of the two-thirds majority.\n       In the end, it came down to whether Republicans could win \n     the support of one or both of the Democrats from North \n     Dakota. While the packed Senate chamber buzzed with \n     anticipation during a half hour quorum call last evening, \n     Conrad moved back and forth between the Republican and \n     Democratic cloakrooms, conferring with each side.\n       Conrad had vowed to oppose the constitutional amendment \n     unless it were rewritten to guarantee that the budget would \n     not be balanced by using the Social Security trust fund. He \n     also has advocated other changes, including language to \n     ensure that Congress has some flexibility in responding to \n     economic crises.\n       At one point, Conrad, Dorgan, Sen. Wendell H. Ford (Ky.) \n     and other Democratic holdouts rejected a pledge from Dole and \n     House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) that Congress would pass \n     the Social Security guarantee in later legislation. But \n     Republicans said they were still discussing ways of trying to \n     guarantee passage of the bill protecting Social Security.\n       Hatch said last night that for a while it appeared \n     Republicans could reach agreement with Conrad on the Social \n     Security issue, but talks broke down when Conrad said he also \n     wanted an exclusion for economic emergencies. Republicans \n     said they hoped to pick up Dorgan's support if Conrad agreed \n     to back the amendment.\n       Last night's dramatic developments capped five weeks of \n     heated debate and political maneuvering over the amendment, \n     which requires a three-fifths majority of both houses before \n     Congress could spend in excess of projected revenue, except \n     in times of war.\n       The House approved the amendment in late January, 300 to \n     132. While the overwhelming support in the House reflected \n     the broad popular appeal of the measure in the abstract, \n     Senate Democrats, who hold the balance of power in passing or \n     defeating it, have played on voter concerns that Social \n     Security, Medicare and other politically sensitive programs \n     would become vulnerable if the amendment were adopted.\n       Others warned that it would dangerously alter the balance \n     of power in Washington, hamstringing Congress in times of \n     economic crisis and giving the president the upper hand in \n     controlling spending.\n       ``The amendment is so full of flaws, so reflective of \n     flabby thinking, so arrogant in its disregard for the \n     traditional checks and balances and separation of powers that \n     its consequences could be nothing short of calamity,'' Byrd \n     said. Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) \n     described it as a ``shoot-now, ask-later approach'' that \n     Congress will regret.\n       Nunn's provision was the only change that Democrats \n     succeeded in making in the amendment; Republicans said they \n     agreed to it after getting assurances that the House will \n     accept it.\n       The provision would be unique in the Constitution. By \n     removing the balanced budget requirement from the \n     jurisdiction of federal courts, it would enable only Congress \n     to enforce the amendment's provisions.\n       ``This is like tying yourself to the mast but ensuring that \n     you can untie yourself any time,'' said Stanford University \n     law professor Kathleen M. Sullivan. Laws ``only work when \n     there is pressure. [The Nunn amendment] renders the balanced \n     budget amendment an exhortation to the Congress to be \n     [[Page S3336]] good, rather than an enforceable \n     requirement.''\n       The tension-filled day began with an early morning meeting \n     in which Hatch and Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), a major \n     proponent of the measure, told Nunn they would accept his \n     proposal, reflecting a decision reached by Dole the night \n     before that this was the only way to win passage of the \n     amendment.\n       On the floor, Breaux, another of the Democrats who had been \n     uncommitted, announced he would vote for the constitutional \n     amendment as long as it was changed to include Nunn's \n     proposal. In a soft voice, Hatch then said he would be \n     willing to accept Nunn's proposal. The night before, Hatch \n     had fervently vowed to oppose any change in the amendment's \n     language, even if that meant its defeat. Nunn thanked Hatch \n     and said he would now vote for the amendment.\n       But Nunn had hardly sat down before Dorgan was on the \n     floor, saying he could not vote for the amendment unless \n     Congress made clear in advance that it was not going to tap \n     the Social Security trust fund for revenue to balance the \n     budget.\n       While Democrats were resisting Republican entreaties, \n     Senate GOP freshmen trooped into the chamber, sitting in a \n     group in the back two rows, a visible reminder of the \n     political earthquake that brought them to Congress and the \n     balanced budget amendment to the forefront of the agenda of \n     the new GOP majority.\n       Sen. Rick Santorium (R-Pa.) got right to the heart of their \n     political message: ``The people who will stand in the way of \n     this balanced budget amendment today will not be around long \n     to stand in the way next time. It will pass. It is just a \n     matter of when.''\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of House Joint Resolution \n1, the bipartisan, bicameral, consensus balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution.\n  There are many individuals who deserve special recognition for their \nefforts on behalf of this amendment--more than it is possible to \ninclude here at one time.\n  I want to begin by commending the former chairman of the Judiciary \nSubcommittee on the Constitution, the senior Senator from Illinois [Mr. \nSimon]. He has toiled for many years in this vineyard. In this area, \nand in many others, Congress will miss his courage and leadership--and \nwe all will miss his warmth--when he retires at the end of the 104th \nCongress. His staff, particularly Aaron Rappaport on the Judiciary \nCommittee, have always been professional, hardworking, and invaluable \nto this effort.\n  It would not have been a debate on the balanced budget amendment \nwithout the able leadership of the President pro tempore of the Senate, \nSenator Thurmond of South Carolina. He has always been ahead of his \ntime, as he was some 40 years ago when he first arrived in this body \nand became a principal sponsor of the balanced budget amendment.\n  I also want to recognized the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Hatch of Utah, and his skilled and helpful staff. Senator Hatch \nis an estimable constitutional lawyer, a skilled floor manager, and a \nlong-time leader in this effort.\n  On the committee, on the floor, and at every step, the Senators from \nAlabama [Mr. Heflin] and Illinois [Mrs. Moseley-Braun] have poured much \ntime and dedication into this effort for years.\n  Many more Senators deserve recognition. I think almost every one who \nvotes ``aye'' today on final passage has done a lot of additional work \non behalf of this amendment. I don't know when I've seen so many give \nso much for so worthy a cause.\n  Finally, I must recognize our distinguished majority leader, Senator \nDole of Kansas, the principal sponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 1, \nthis measure as introduced and reported in this body. Without his \nguidance and leadership, the movement to pass this amendment would have \nfaded long ago. I also appreciate the long hours and capable work put \nin by this staff over these recent, arduous weeks.\n  This extraordinary accomplishment, a bicameral, bipartisan, consensus \nversion of the most important legislation, never could have come this \nfar without the leadership and courage of my former colleagues in the \nother body, Representatives Charlie Stenholm of Texas and Dan Schaefer \nof Colorado. When the House made history last month by passing this \namendment for the first time in its history, it could not have happened \nwithout the blood, sweat, and dedication of these two statesmen.\n  Representative Stenholm was my cofounder, 11 years ago, of CLUBB--\nCongressional Leaders United for a Balanced Budget, an informal \nbicameral group formed to keep this amendment alive after a decisive \nHouse defeat in 1982. Pete Wilson of California was our first Senate \ncochair. Former House CLUBB cochair Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma is now a \nMember of this body, as are other veteran House leaders, including \nSenators Snowe of Maine and Kyl of Arizona.\n  In language as well as congressional support, the language before us \ntoday has a long and distinguished pedigree.\n  Outside Congress, this amendment is supported by a great groundswell \nof public support and grass roots activism.\n  Otherwise the balanced budget amendment would not have come back \nafter losing in the House in 1982 and the Senate in 1986. Otherwise it \nwould not have come to the floor of one Chamber or the other a combined \ntotal of seven times in the last 5 years--in 1990 in the House, in 1992 \nin both bodies, in 1994 in both bodies, and this year in both.\n  While a great many citizens, taxpayer groups, public interest \norganizations, and trade associations have supported this movement over \nthe years, particular emphasis should be given to the work of the \nNational Taxpayers Union and, particularly, within that organization, \nto Mr. Al Cors, the chairman of the nationwide Balanced Budget \nAmendment Coalition.\n  I ask unanimous consent that, Mr. President, that at the end of my \nstatement I may include correspondence from that Coalition supporting \nHouse Joint Resolution 1, as well as from other organizations.\n         this is the vote that counts; do we trust the people?\n\n  Mr. President, when the 55 delegates to the Philadelphia Convention \nof 1787 convened at Independence Hall, they came with 55 perfect \nConstitutions for the young republic. They emerged with one version \nthat, from any one of their points of view, was less than perfect.\n  But more than 200 years of history have shown that imperfect version, \nfull of compromise and an occasional complication, has been eminently \nworkable, has endured, and has remained a model for the world.\n  No matter how any of my colleagues may have voted on any amendment \nearlier, you now have a chance to pass an amendment that unites the \nunderlying principle of virtually all versions of the balanced budget \namendment.\n  No matter what any one of my colleagues would have wanted in your \nperfect version of such an amendment, we now have just one balanced \nbudget amendment remaining before us.\n  The only effective balanced budget amendment is the one that passes.\n  Your constituents will understand, and I know you understand: Vote \nno, and you kill the only chance for an amendment, here and now.\n  Vote yes, and you will carry forward one of the great debates of our \nage. This amendment will go back to the House of Representatives, and \nfrom there to every State capital.\n  That's what this vote is really about--engaging the American people \nin the most sweeping public debate about the appropriate size, scope, \nand role of the Federal Government since the original Bill of Rights \nwas sent to the States by the First Congress.\n  The question is clear: Do we trust the people with that debate? Do we \ntrust the 80 percent of the people who demand this amendment? Do we \ntrust the voters who demanded last November that the Federal Government \nchange its ways?\n  This Senator does trust the American People.\n  That's why we have this process of amending the Constitution--because \nthe Constitution is the people's law, not the government's law, and \nbecause the people have a right to take part in such a momentous \ndebate.\n\n\n                fundamental rights, limits on government\n\n  Before I start responding to points made in debate over the last few \ndays, I want to refocus us on why we are here considering this \namendment, in the first place.\n  A constitution is a document that enumerates and limits the powers of \nthe government to protect the basic \n[[Page S3337]] rights of the people. Within that framework, it sets \nforth just enough procedures to safeguard its essential operations. It \ndeals with the most fundamental responsibilities of the government and \nthe broadest principles of governance.\n  Our balanced budget amendment, House Joint Resolution 1, fits \nsquarely within that constitutional tradition.\n  The case for the balanced budget amendment can be summed up best as \nfollows:\n  The ability of the Federal Government to borrow money from future \ngenerations involves decisions of such magnitude that they should not \nbe left to the judgements of transient majorities.\n  The right at stake is the right of the people--today and in future \ngenerations--to be protected from the burdens and harms created when a \nprofligate government amasses an intolerable debt.\n  The Framers of the Constitution recognized that fundamental right. I \nreturn once more to the words of Thomas Jefferson, who explicitly \nelevated balanced budgets to this level of morality and fundamental \nrights when he said:\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.\n\n  Woodrow Wilson said, ``Money being spent without new taxation . . . \nis as bad as taxation without representation.''\n  Mr. President, deficit spending is taxation without representation. \nAmericans are told that deficit are Uncle Sam's way of giving them a \nfree lunch, providing $1.18 worth of government for just $1.00 in \ntaxes. In reality, taking gross interest into account, the government \nhas to spend $1.19 for every $1.00 of benefits, goods, services, and \noverhead in the budget.\n                         THE DEBT IS THE THREAT\n\n  Even as we speak, we are adding to the Federal debt: $829,440,000 a \nday, 34,560,000 an hour, 576,000 a minute, and 9,600 a second.\n  In its January baseline, the Congressional Budget Office projects \nthat annual Federal deficits will grow from $176 billion this year to \nmore than double that amount, $351 billion, in fiscal year 2003, and to \n$421 billion by fiscal year 2005.\n  Deficits are really the cruellest tax of all, since they never stop \ntaking the taxpayers' money. Americans are paying now, with a sluggish \neconomy, for the Government's past addiction to debt. According to the \nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, the deficits of the 1980's already \nhave depressed our standard of living by 5 percent. Unless things \nchange, the next generation will pay even more dearly.\n  According to the National Taxpayers Union, for each year with a $200 \nbillion deficit, a child born today will pay $5,000 in additional taxes \nover his or her lifetime.\n  The President's own fiscal year 1995 Budget, in its ``Analytical \nPerspectives'' volume, projects that future generations will pay as \nmuch as 82 percent of their lifetime incomes in taxes, under the \ncurrent policies of borrow-and-spend.\n  In 1992, the nonpartisan General Accounting Office issued its report, \n``Budget Policy: Prompt Action Necessary to Avert Long-Term Damage to \nthe Economy.'' At that time, GAO projected that failure to take action \non the deficit and the growing debt would produce a stagnant--even \nslightly declining--standard of living for Americans in the year 2020. \nIn contrast, GAO said that simply balancing the Federal budget by 2001, \nand keeping it balanced, would raise our children's standard of living \nby 36 percent.\n  GAO and the Congressional Budget Office now project lower deficits, \nas a result of their scoring of last year's budget plan. However, the \nintermediate- and long-term deficit outlook has done no better than \ndecline form cataclysmic to intolerable.\n  The current CBO baseline looks a great deal like--indeed, a little \nworse than--GAO's muddling through scenario report, in which the \ndeficit is held at 3 percent of gross domestic product.\n  Under this muddling through scenario, our children's standard of \nliving in 2020 would be 7 percent lower and the Federal debt would be 3 \ntimes larger than if the budget is balanced by 2001.\n  Our national economic policy should not be one of muddling through.\n  Even that scenario is based on somewhat optimistic assumptions. \nInterest rates are now near a 30-year low. If they bounce back upward \nsome, the cost of interest payments on the debt will explode. Senator \nMurkowski had a chart out here on the floor during this debate that \ndisplayed that graphically.\n  So, we must keep in mind that small changes for the worse in our \neconomic picture over the next few years will make the deficit picture \nfar worse.\n  Today, Federal budget deficits are the single biggest threat to our \neconomic security. The Federal debt now totals $4.8 trillion, or about \n$18,500 for every man, woman, and child in America, and is growing.\n  As deficits grow, as the national debt mounts, so do the interest \npayments made to service that debt. Besides crowding out other fiscal \npriorities, these amount to a highly regressive transfer of wealth. \nAbout 20 percent of these payments go overseas.\n  Interest on the Federal debt is largely a transfer from middle-income \ntaxpayers to large institutions, banks, corporations, wealthy \nindividuals and foreign investors.\n  In fact, interest payments to wealthy foreigners make up the largest \nforeign aid program in history. According to the President's budget, in \nfiscal year 1994, the U.S. Government sent $44.5 billion overseas in \ninterest payments. That's more than twice as much as all spending on \nactual international programs, including foreign aid and operating our \nembassies abroad, which totalled about $21 billion. Also in fiscal year \n1994, 33.9 percent--$62.6 billion--of the dollars borrowed from the \npublic came from overseas.\n  Annual gross interest on the debt now runs about $300 billion, making \nit now the second largest item of Federal spending, and equal to about \nhalf of all personal income taxes.\n                        the framers' assumptions\n\n  The Framers thought that the limited size and enumerated powers of \nGovernment, the limits on the money supply created by a gold standard, \nthe moral imperative of the unwritten constitution, and the House's \nexclusive power to originate bills raising revenue all would protect \nthis right. Jefferson would have preferred to put this protection in \nthe Constitution. But others at the time viewed the idea that a \nrestraint on indebtedness would be needed as being beyond belief.\n  Times have changed, as have the nature of government, monetary \npolicy, and politics. The original constraints that protected the \npeople from a profligate government, all of which had constitutional \nstatus, have all but dissolved. It's now about 60 years past time to \nreplace them.\n\n\n                             political will\n\n  Critics of the balanced budget amendment argue that all we need is \nthe political will, the leadership to balance the budget. That argument \nignores the reality that the way the Federal Government makes its \neconomic and political decisions has changed fundamentally over the \nlast two generations.\n  The system is broken. The Government has spent more than it has taken \nin for 57 of the last 65 years. The budget was last balanced in 1969, \nand in 1960 before that. We are not talking here about some short-term \nfailure of will that was cured with the last election or will be cured \nwith the next one.\n  The impetus to borrow and spend has become a structural one in our \nsystem of government. It is a constitution-class crisis that demands a \nconstitution-class solution.\n\n\n              not narrow policy, but perfecting democracy\n\n  The balanced budget is not narrow economic or fiscal policy. It is \nstructural, systemic change that would help perfect representative \ndemocracy.\n  Over the last two generations, the political and budget processes \nhave evolved in such a way that virtually all of the political rewards \nare for spending more and borrowing more. Narrow, highly organized, \ninterest groups mobilize to reward spending increases for specific \nconstituencies. The more general, public interest in restraining the \nsize and fiscal appetite of government \n[[Page S3338]] has been put at a systematic disadvantage.\n  The only way to put the general public interest back on a level \nplaying field with the special interests is to make it harder to borrow \nand spend.\n  That's what our amendment does. For the first time, it creates \naccountability by requiring that deficits occur only when Members of \nCongress cast an identifiable vote to run a deficit.\n  By providing for accountability and by restoring the general public \ninterest to a stronger representative voice, our amendment actually \nperfects our democratic process.\n  The essence of this reform is that we finally restore the principle \nthat the government should grow no larger than the people are willing \nto pay for and we should pay for all the government we demand.\n  It's often said that Congress underestimates the wisdom of the \npeople. Well, the people have spoken once again, and it's time for \nSenators to realize that, today, as is usually the case, good policy is \ngood politics. The American people understand the balanced budget \namendment, they want Congress to pass it, and they are right.\n                             majority rule\n\n  One of the curious objections raised against the balanced budget \namendment is that it would threaten majority rule.\n  Those that dwell on the difficulty of getting three-fifths majorities \nto unbalance the budget or raise the debt limit are missing the point: \nThey are still thinking, ``What do we need to do in order to keep \ndeficit spending?''\n  That's why we put supermajorities in the amendment--not just to make \nit harder to deficit spend and increase the debt, but to deter Congress \nfrom deficit spending in all but legitimate and extraordinary \ncircumstances. Under our amendment, when you balance the budget, you \ndon't have to worry about mustering a supermajority.\n  Such a requirement is consistent with other provisions in the \nConstitution. Freedom of speech is protected by a supermajority \nrequirement. So is freedom of religion. So is the right to keep and \nbear arms and every other right in the Constitution.\n  Because it takes supermajorities to amend the Constitution, every \nright protected in the Constitution by limiting the power of government \nis protected by supermajorities.\n  In addition, as has been noted by both sides in this debate, specific \nsupermajorities are written into several procedures in the \nConstitution, including treaty ratification and overriding vetoes.\n  In our amendment, we create procedural restraints on the Federal \nGovernment to protect the right of the people to be free from excessive \ngovernment debt. We use 60 percent supermajorities instead of two-\nthirds or absolute prohibitions because we foresee that the process \nwill need to be flexible on occasion.\n  The Framers wanted to protect majority rule for the transaction of \nmost of the Government's business. But sometimes, to protect \nfundamental rights or the integrity of specific process, they employed \nsupermajority requirements to protect against, in the words of the \nFederalist Papers, a tyranny of the majority.\n  Let's look at the will of the majority from one more angle.\n  Two-thirds to four-fifths of the American people want the balanced \nbudget amendment. Clear majorities of Congress want it. If it doesn't \npass today, if it doesn't go the American people for a full public \ndebate, it will be because a minority has blocked it here.\n\n\n                          disaster assistance\n\n  Some are concerned about whether requiring a three-fifths vote to \ndeficit spend would thwart efforts to deal with natural disasters. From \n1978-94, supplemental disaster appropriations topped $7 billion in only \n1 year, 1992. We generally are talking about a very small portion of \nthe Federal budget.\n  As Senator Simon and others have suggested, creating a small disaster \nrevolving fund, or for that matter, just planning to run small \nsurpluses, would be sufficient to meet such needs.\n  On the other hand, Congress also has a history of dealing promptly \nand compassionately in such situations. Only one time over the last 15 \nyears did a disaster bill fail to clear either body with less than a 60 \npercent majority. That was in 1992, in the House, amid much contention \nover the Budget Enforcement Act firewalls, the balanced budget \namendment and other issues. And that bill fell only one vote short of \n60 percent.\n  Congress is not going to turn its back on natural disaster victims \nunder this amendment. To suggest it will is to ignore reality and \nhistory.\n\n\n                          separation of powers\n\n  Perhaps the most curious concern I have heard raised about the Simon-\nHatch-Craig amendment is that it would transfer powers from the \nlegislative branch to the Executive or the courts.\n  Let's look at the amendment. That doesn't occur in section 6, which \nbegins with the words, ``The Congress shall enforce and implement this \narticle * * *.''\n  This transfer doesn't appear later in section 6, which recognizes the \nneed of Congress to use estimates in implementing legislation, \nobviously foreclosing some of the more inventive scenarios that might \ntempt Executive or court action.\n  It certainly doesn't appear in the clarifying language that the \namendment's authors have added to section 6 to make sure that no one \nthinks the courts can raise taxes or construct equitable remedies.\n  There's no lint-item veto in here. There's no delegation of Congress' \nlegislative power, implied or explicit, to anyone else.\n  In the same way that the first amendment begins with the words, \n``Congress shall make no law * * *,'' this amendment restricts the \npower of the entire Government by making it harder to enact something \ninto law.\n  The balanced budget amendment does not change in any way the balance \nof power among the branches of government. It is absolutely consistent \nwith the spirit, the style, and the operations of the rest of the \nConstitution.\n\n\n             slash-and-burn scenarios for priority programs\n\n  During the course of this debate, as seems to happen every time a \nbalanced budget amendment comes to the floor, the Treasury Department \nand various special interest groups did a disservice to serious public \ndebate by releasing so-called studies that they tried to make look \nlegitimate by attaching tables of numbers.\n  In reality, they were scare tactics, using dubious assumptions, and \nfilled with manufactured numbers.\n  Such studies rely on sometimes questionable economic assumptions. But \nin every case, they did not look to the long-range benefits of balanced \nbudgets. And in every case, they assumed a mindless, across-the-board, \nmeat-ax approach to budget changes.\n  One of the chief benefits of the balanced budget amendment is that it \nwill make Congress and the President set priorities. You don't have to \nset priorities when you don't have a credit limit. In an effort to \nscare as many people as possible, and attract as much attention as \npossible, these studies, including one issued by the Treasury \nDepartment, imply that the President and Congress have no priorities \nand would not select or change priorities under the amendment.\n  To this Senator, what their arguments really say is, these opponents \nare afraid that the amendment will work and that, when the Government \nmust set priorities, the American people may not agree with their \npriorities.\n  Balanced budgets will produce a stronger economy, better able to \nsustain its defense capabilities while meeting its other needs. And I \nam confident that the people will demand, and willing to risk that \nCongress will deliver, an adequate defense budget.\n  DRI/McGraw-Hill, which is one of the world's leading nonpartisan \neconomic analysis and forecasting firm has called on Congress to \napprove the balanced budget amendment.\n  DRI believes BBA is the path to the benefits of a balanced Federal \nbudget. Their report, released just a few weeks ago, said, in part:\n\n       A major argument for the Constitutional amendment is the \n     credibility it may lend to the process. This credibility may \n     permit a sharper drop in bond yields and thus an earlier \n     boost in the economy.\n\n  The firm strongly endorsed the balanced budget amendment during a \nrecent news conference on Capitol Hill.\n  They predicted that 2.5 million new jobs could be created by 2002 as \nmore \n[[Page S3339]] resources are freed up for private investment, interest \nrates drop, and businesses can afford to expand, buying more equipment \nand training.\n  The firm says the amendment should lower borrowing costs for \nbusinesses, encouraging private investment. Real nonresidential \ninvestment could grow by 4 to 5 percent by 2002, absent the $200 \nbillion in Federal deficits which currently soak up capital.\n  The balanced budget amendment is the best friend of those who rely on \nessential Government programs, and of all other Americans. Interest \npayments on the Federal debt are already crowding out discretionary \nspending. As DRI said:\n\n       The current generation does not need to sacrifice its \n     living standard to protect that of future generations from an\n      unbearable federal debt. Budget balance demands neither \n     recessions nor the dismantling of the federal government.\n\n  The amendment would relieve, rather then intensify, budget pressures \nin part through lower interest rates, according to DRI:\n\n       A ``virtuous cycle'' of lower structural deficits, lower \n     federal debt, and lower interest rates can create half the \n     required long-term deficit reduction through lower federal \n     interest payments.\n       The lower interest rates and reduced borrowing would cut \n     interest costs for the federal government; in fact, by 2002 \n     half the savings in our budget simulations come from lower \n     interest costs.\n\n  Lower interest rates mean the real glide path to a balanced budget \nwill involve less short-term pain than some have warned. Even the \nTreasury Department, for example, in its study, which did not take into \naccount the positive economic impact of balancing the budget, assumed \ninterest cuts would provide less than a quarter of total savings in \nfiscal year 2002.\n  DRI/McGraw-Hill predicts that in the course of creating 2.5 million \nnew jobs following passage of the BBA, increased business activity will \nallow the Federal budget to be balanced 2 years ahead of schedule. This \ncould also provide the opportunity for an even more gradual glide path \nto a balanced budget, moderating spending slow-downs.\n\n       Cutting federal spending and balancing the budget will \n     greatly benefit the U.S. economy in the long run. Shifting \n     spending from personal and government consumption toward \n     private investment raises the national capital stock, our \n     proportionate domestic (rather than foreign) ownership of \n     wealth, and thus our standard of living. (Source: DRI/McGraw-\n     Hill Special Report, February 1995).\n\n  Finally, DRI/McGraw-Hill is convinced that balancing the Federal \nbudget is in the best economic interest of the United States. They put \nit in concrete terms:\n\n       Balancing the budget clearly helps the U.S. economy. By the \n     end of the 10 year forecast, real DGP is up $170 billion, or \n     2.5% from its baseline level. This is far from trivial and \n     translates to about $1000 per household at today's prices.\n\n\n                      Thomas Jefferson--Revisited\n\n  I turn one more time to the words and works of Thomas Jefferson.\n  Jefferson balanced the budget in all 8 of his years in the White \nHouse. He reduced the national debt by half during his first term and \nset policies in motion that resulted in a national debt of a mere \n$38,000--that's 38 thousand--in 1834 and 1855.\n  Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase has been tossed about as an example of \nhow going into debt can be beneficial. But let's look at what we can \nlearn from his experience.\n  It's true that the Louisiana Purchase was twice the size of the \nFederal budget in 1803, as noted by the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. \nByrd]. But the Federal budget was only 1.63 percent of gross national \nproduct at the time.\n  Relative to the size of the gross domestic product, the Louisiana \nPurchase would translate into just under $225 billion in today's \ndollars probably because the Federal deficit last year was $203 \nbillion.\n  Jefferson and his successors sold the land acquired from France and \nmade a profit for the Federal Government.\n  Every year the Federal Government is borrowing the equivalent of a \nLouisiana Purchase. And what are we getting for it? Nothing except a \nhigher bill for interest costs and a legacy of crushing debt to leave \nbehind for our children.\n                        other issues, conclusion\n\n  There are many other issues relating to this amendment, too numerous \nto discuss in the time allotted. To address those as a matter of \nlegislative history, I ask unanimous consent to insert various other \nmaterials in the Record.\n  As for those additional facets of the debate, I want to note that, \nwith our approximately 4,000 pages of legislative history over the last \n15 years, every question has been answered, every objection has been \ndealt with.\n  This amendment has a history, it has a pedigree. It is the \nbipartisan, bicameral, consensus that has been looked at by \nconstitutional scholars, economists, public interest groups, and \nmembers of both bodies.\n  This is our one chance to vote, up or down, to send a balanced budget \namendment to the House and then to the people.\n  I'll turn one last time to the words of Thomas Jefferson, when he \nwrote, in a 1798 letter to John Taylor:\n\n       * * * constitution. I would be willing to depend on that \n     alone for the reduction of the administration of our \n     government to the genuine principles of its constitution; I \n     mean an additional article, taking from the federal \n     government the power of borrowing.\n\n  And again, in 1798, he wrote:\n\n       If there is one omission I fear in the document called the \n     Constitution, it is that we did not restrict the power of \n     government to borrow money.\n\n  Just 3 years ago, 38 states ratified the 27th amendment, concerning \nvariations in congressional pay, as proposed by James Madison 200 years \nago.\n  It just goes to prove that occasionally it's time to turn to a new \nidea, and sometimes the answer is to turn to a classic.\n  Today, Mr. President, my colleagues, it's time to add Mr. Jefferson's \namendment to the Constitution, right behind that of his friend, Mr. \nMadison. We could hardly be in better company, we could hardly seek \nwiser guidance, in contemplating this addition to our Constitution.\n  Thomas Jefferson also said:\n\n       I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and \n     constitutions. But laws and institutions must go hand in hand \n     with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more \n     developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new \n     truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the \n     change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to \n     keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to \n     wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized \n     society to remain ever under the regimen of the their \n     barbarous ancestors.\n\n  If you want to ignore the lessons of the last 35 years of excessive \ndebt, vote no on this amendment.\n  If you are willing to leave our children a stagnant or declining \nstandard of living, vote no on this amendment.\n  If you want to continue the failed status quo, vote no on this \namendment.\n  If you agree with Jefferson that, ``as new discoveries are then vote \nyes on the balanced budget amendment.\n  If you trust the American People, and understand their demand that \ngovernment change its ways, then vote yes on the balanced budget \namendment.\n  If you want today to be the first day of new hope and opportunity for \nour Nation, our economy, and our children, then vote yes on the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may have printed in the Record \nnumerous supporting materials, including letters and statements of \nendorsement from citizens' groups, information on public support of the \nbalanced budget amendment, substantive analyses prepared by outside \ngroups, and supporters here within Congress, fact sheets, and newspaper \narticles.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n\n                                                    Coalition,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned organizations strongly urge \n     you to vote for and support the Balanced Budget Amendment, \n     S.J. Res. 1, introduced by Senators Dole, Hatch, Simon, \n     Thurmond, Heflin, Craig, Moseley-Braun and others. This \n     bipartisan proposal (over 40 total Senate cosponsors) has \n     already passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 15 to 3 \n     vote and is now being considered on the Senate floor.\n       The framers of the U.S. Constitution assumed each \n     generation of Americans would pay its own bills--and that the \n     federal budget would, over time, remain roughly in balance. \n     According to Thomas Jefferson, ``we should consider ourselves \n     unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts, and morally \n     bound to pay them ourselves.''\n       In today's era of mass media, special interest politics, \n     and expensive and sophisticated election campaigns, the \n     checks and balances established 200 years ago are not up to \n     the job of controlling the federal deficit. Recent \n     [[Page S3340]] Congresses and presidents have proven \n     themselves incapable of acting in the broader national \n     interest on fiscal matters. Whenever Congress considers \n     spending cuts that could help balance the budget, only a few \n     Americans are aware of it, and fewer still express their \n     views about it. By contrast, those who stand to lose from \n     budget restraint--typically the beneficiaries and \n     administrators of spending programs--are well aware of what \n     they stand to lose. They mount intensive lobbying campaigns \n     to stop fiscal restraint.\n       This pro-spending and pro-debt bias has led to 25 straight \n     unbalanced budgets. It took our nation 205 years--from 1776 \n     to 1981--to reach a $1 trillion debt. Now, just 14 years \n     later, the debt is $4.8 trillion. Each year, interest \n     payments rise as the overall debt grows. These payments have \n     been one of the fastest-rising items in the federal budget--\n     they now account for the entire deficit, all by themselves. A \n     succession of statutory remedies has failed to stem this \n     historic and highly dangerous turn of events.\n       S.J. Res. 1 is a sound amendment that has evolved through \n     years of work by the principal sponsors. It provides the \n     constitutional discipline needed to make balanced federal \n     budgets the norm, rather than the rare exception (once in the \n     past 34 years), and it offers the proper flexibility to deal \n     with national emergencies.\n       In addition to requiring a three-fifths majority vote to \n     deficit spend or increase the federal debt limit, S.J. Res. 1 \n     is designed to make raising federal taxes more difficult. It \n     would require the approval of a majority of the whole number \n     of both the House and Senate--by roll call votes--in order to \n     pass any tax increase. This adds much-needed accountability.\n       Unless action is taken now, higher federal spending and \n     debt will continue to cripple our economy and mortgage our \n     children's future. We urge you to support S.J. Res. 1, the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n         National Taxpayers Union; International Food Service \n           Distributors Association; National Association of \n           Wholesale-Distributors; American Legislative Exchange \n           Council; National Association of Manufacturers; \n           National Association of Home Builders; The Seniors \n           Coalition; Financial Executives Institute; Concerned \n           Women for America; The Business Roundtable; American \n           Farm Bureau Federation; American Furniture \n           Manufacturers Association; United We Stand America; \n           United Seniors Association, Inc.; Howard Jarvis \n           Taxpayers Association; Independent Bakers Association; \n           Citizens for a Sound Economy; Council for Citizens \n           Against Government Waste; Traditional Values Coalition; \n           Automotive Service Association; National Retail \n           Federation; National Truck Equipment Association; Truck \n           Renting and Leasing Association.\n         National-American Wholesale Grocer's Association; U.S. \n           Chamber of Commerce; National Cattlemen's Association; \n           Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc.; National \n           Ready Mixed Concrete Association; U.S. Business and \n           Industrial Council; National Federation of Independent \n           Business; National Association of Realtors; Small \n           Business Survival Committee; Christian Coalition; The \n           Concord Coalition; Printing Industries of America; \n           International Council of Shopping Centers; Motorcycle \n           Industry Council, Inc.; American Tax Reduction \n           Movement; International Mass Retail Association; \n           Texaco, Inc.; U.S. Federation of Small Business; \n           American Machine Tool Distributors Assn.; Union \n           Pacific; Common Sense for America; Americans for Tax \n           Reform; American Bakers Association.\n                                                                    ____\n\n             [IRET--Congressional Advisory, Feb. 27, 1995]\n\n              Keynes is Alive, But not Well, in Washington\n\n                     (By Norman B. Ture, President)\n\n       Opponents of a Balanced Budget Amendment assert that \n     recessions will be deeper and more prolonged if the amendment \n     prohibits the federal government from running budget \n     deficits. According to this Keynesian article of faith, \n     increases in federal spending relative to federal tax \n     revenues expand total--government, household, and business--\n     spending and thereby produce increases in total production, \n     employment, and income.\n       Much of this increase in government spending and decrease \n     in government tax revenues occurs automatically as the \n     economy moves into recession. With falling output, \n     employment, and income, payroll and income taxes decrease, \n     while government outlays for such things as unemployment \n     compensation and food stamps go up. These so-called \n     ``automatic stabilizers'' allegedly cushion the decline in \n     households' and businesses' disposable incomes, allowing them \n     to maintain higher spending levels than they otherwise would \n     be able to undertake. Moreover, according to this argument, \n     the federal government should take action to increase other \n     spending and/or to reduce taxes to fortify the automatic \n     bolstering of disposable income.\n       The argument is wrong analytically. It is also rejected by \n     history. It should be rejected by the Senate as the basis for \n     deciding the fate of the Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       It is certainly true that the government's revenues \n     automatically decline and certain of its outlays \n     automatically increase during a recession. These automatic \n     fiscal changes, however, don't--can't--increase total real \n     spending. The resulting gap between government spending and \n     government revenues has to be financed, either by the \n     government's borrowing the difference or by resorting to the \n     monetary printing press. If the government borrows the money \n     to finance the deficit, the lenders' disposable incomes--the \n     amount of their current after-tax incomes available to \n     purchase consumption products or business assets--is reduced \n     by the amount they lend the government--the same amount as \n     the increase in the disposable incomes of other people. No \n     net increase in income available for spending occurs.\n       The same thing is true if the government takes \n     discretionary actions to increase its spending and/or to cut \n     taxes. The government's borrowing to make up the difference \n     between its additional outlays and reduced revenues cancels \n     any increase in disposable income that allegedly would be \n     produced by running a deficit.\n       Of course, the government might resort to the money \n     printing press to finance the deficit. This might lead to an \n     increase in nominal aggregate demand but only at the cost of \n     pushing up the price level. Real disposable income and \n     spending would increase only if people were fooled and failed \n     to spot the inflationary erosion of their actual incomes and \n     purchasing power.\n       Public policy makers should not disregard Abe Lincoln's \n     famous homily in making their policy decisions. They should, \n     instead, rely on some homely, basic truths. Increases in the \n     nation's income can't be produced by fiscal sleight of hand. \n     Increases in real income depend on increases in real output. \n     Increases in real output depend on increases in production \n     inputs and/or in the efficiency of their use. Increases in \n     production inputs depend on increases in the real rewards for \n     supplying them.\n       Budget deficits will not maintain, let alone increase, real \n     disposable income unless they result from fiscal actions that \n     increase incentives for people to work, save, invest, \n     innovate, start new businesses or expand existing \n     enterprises.\n       History is no kinder to the Keynesian fiscalism than \n     analysis. The record of the economy's aggregate performance \n     reveals no evidence that budget deficits, per se, allay or \n     moderate recessionary developments, or, indeed, that they \n     exert any expansionary influence. Even the least demanding \n     statistical tests of a relationship between federal budget \n     outcomes and gross domestic product reject the notion that \n     budget deficits are significant in moderating recessionary \n     forces.\n       In this era of heightened concern about the federal \n     government's preempting too much of the nation's production \n     capability and misdirecting its use, opposition to curbing \n     the growth in government spending and federal deficits by \n     imposing a budget-balancing constitutional requirement is \n     truly bizarre. Basing that opposition on the Keynesian fiscal \n     mythology is even weirder. It is to be hoped that the U.S. \n     Senate will base its decision about a Balanced Budget \n     Amendment on consideration of the really relevant concern \n     about how most effectively to discipline fiscal and budget \n     policy decision making.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         [American Legislative Exchange Council, Feb. 24, 1995]\n\n  More Than 200 Economists Publicly Support Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n                   (By Kerry Jackson and Ian Calkins)\n\n       Washington, DC., February 24, 1995--By endorsing a letter \n     outlining their support for the Balanced Budget Amendment \n     (BBA), 219 economists from across the country have publicly \n     recognized the threat federal deficit spending poses to \n     America's future.\n       Included in the list are such prominent economists as Dr. \n     Richard Vedder of Ohio University, Dr. William Niskanen of \n     the CATO Institute, and Dr. Gordon Tullock of the University \n     of Arizona. The list was solicited by the American \n     Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) in response to news \n     reports that many economists are opposed to the BBA. ALEC, \n     the nation's largest bipartisan membership organization of \n     state legislators, instead believes economists recognize the \n     harm in an annual spending deficit that has hit $200 billion \n     and is growing. With support from roughly 3,000 member state \n     legislators, ALEC has been at the forefront of the Balanced \n     Budget Amendment issue for 20 years.\n       ``This list represents the most respected and brilliant \n     minds in the field of economics'' said ALEC Executive \n     Director Samuel A. Brunelli. ``What that tells us is simply \n     this: the Balanced Budget Amendment is sound economic \n     policy.''\n       Brunelli presented the letter and list Monday morning to \n     Senator Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) during a BBA Coalition \n     meeting, where he reported the list was still growing as he \n     left his office.\n       ``There is a strong intellectual foundation in support of \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment,'' Brunelli told Coverdell. \n     ``This is just a representative group of scholars who realize \n     the danger reckless deficit spending has on our present and \n     future economy.''\n       By endorsing the letter, the economists are saying ``there \n     is no rational argument against the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment. Simple observation of the fiscal record of recent \n     years tell us that the procedures through which fiscal \n     choices are made are \n     [[Page S3341]] not working.'' And they understand the \n     ``immorality of the intergenerational transfer that deficit \n     financing represents cries out for correction.''\n       They also acknowledge the BBA would produce an ``increase \n     in investor and business confidence, both domestic and \n     foreign.''\n       One of the primary arguments against the BBA is the \n     prospect that states will be forced to bear an inequitable \n     financial burden if costs are shifted in balancing the \n     budget, making them unwilling to ratify the measure. ALEC, \n     however, has addressed that problem in its recently published \n     Issue Analysis: Up to the Challenge: Why State and Local \n     Governments Can Flourish Under the Balanced Budget Amendment. \n     The paper exposes the cost-shifting argument as groundless \n     and goes on to outline a number of ways states can actually \n     save money if the BBA were enacted. As a membership \n     organization that is closely associated with state lawmakers, \n     ALEC believes there is enough support among the states to \n     ratify the BBA.\n       ``Already 29 states have passed a resolution calling for a \n     limited Constitutional Convention to write a BBA,'' Brunelli \n     said. ``That's more politically difficult legislation to pass \n     than ratification, and it's only nine states shy of the \n     number of states required to amend the Constitution.''\n  Balanced Budget Amendment--An Open Letter To Congress, February 1995\n\n       It is time to acknowledge that mere statutes that purport \n     to control federal spending or deficits have failed. It is \n     time to adopt constitutional control through a Balanced \n     Budget Amendment. In supporting such an amendment, Congress \n     can control its spending proclivities by setting up control \n     machinery external to its own internal operations, machinery \n     that will not be so easily neglected and abandoned.\n       Why do we need the Balanced Budget Amendment now, when no \n     such constitutional provision existed for two centuries? The \n     answer is clear. Up until recent decades, the principle that \n     government should balance its budget in peacetime was, \n     indeed, a part of our effective constitution, even if not \n     formally written down. Before the Keynesian-inspired shift in \n     thinking about fiscal matters, it was universally considered \n     immoral to incur debts, except in periods of emergency (wars \n     or major depressions). We have lost the moral sense of fiscal \n     responsibility that served to make formal constitutional \n     constraints unnecessary. We cannot legislate a change in \n     political morality, we can put formal constitutional \n     constraints into place.\n       The effects of the Balanced Budget Amendment would be both \n     real and symbolic. Elected policitians would be required to \n     make fiscal choices within meaningfully-constructed \n     boundaries; they would be required to weigh predicted \n     benefits against predicted tax costs. They would be forced to \n     behave ``responsibly,'' as this word is understood by the \n     citizenry, and knowledge of this fact would do much to \n     restore the confidence of citizens in governmental processes.\n       It is important to recognize that the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment imposes procedural constraints on the making of \n     budgetary choices. It does not take away the power of the \n     Congress to spend or tax. The amendment requires only that \n     the Congress and the Executive spend no more than what they \n     collect in taxes. In its simplest terms, such an amendment \n     amounts to little more than ``honesty in budgeting.''\n       Of course, we always pay for what we spend through \n     government, as anywhere else. But those who pay for the \n     government spending that is financed by borrowing are \n     taxpayers in future years, those who must pay taxes to meet \n     the ever-mounting interest obligations that are already far \n     too large an item in the federal budget. The immorality of \n     the intergenerational transfer that deficit financing \n     represents cries out for correction.\n       Some opponents of the Balanced Budget Amendment argue that \n     the interest burden should be measured in terms of percentage \n     of national product, and, so long as this ratio does not \n     increase, all is well. This argument is totally untenable \n     because it ignores the effects of both inflation and real \n     economic growth. So long as government debt is denominated in \n     dollars, sufficiently rapid inflation can, for a short \n     period, reduce the interest burden substantially, in terms of \n     the ratio to product. But surely default by way of inflation \n     is the worst of all possible ways of dealing with the fiscal \n     crisis that the deficit regime represents.\n       Opponents also often suggest that Congress and the \n     Executive must maintain the budgetary flexibility to respond \n     to emergency needs for expanding rates of spending. This \n     prospect is fully recognized, and the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment includes a provision that allows for approval of \n     debt or deficits by a three-fifths vote of those elected to \n     each house of Congress.\n       When all is said and done, there is no rational argument \n     against the Balanced Budget Amendment. Simple observation of \n     the fiscal record of recent years tells us that the \n     procedures through which fiscal choices are made are not \n     working. The problem is not one that involves the wrong \n     political leaders or the wrong parties. The problem is one \n     where those whom we elect are required to function under the \n     wrong set of rules, the wrong procedures. It is high time to \n     get our fiscal house in order.\n       We can only imagine the increase in investor and business \n     confidence, both domestic and foreign, that enactment of a \n     Balanced Budget Amendment would produce. Perhaps even more \n     importantly, we could all regain confidence in ourselves, as \n     a free people under responsible constitutional government.\n       Dr. Burton A.

Interest payments have increased from 6% of the \n     budget in 1960 to more than 14% of the \n     [[Page S3343]] budget today. After adjusting for inflation, \n     gross interest payments have increased by 97% since 1980. \n     This explosion in debt payments has forced a corresponding \n     reduction in the goods and services the government can \n     provide. Until we bring the budget under control, interest \n     payments will continue to devour a increasingly larger \n     portion of the budget.\n       Interest payments will cripple the ability of future \n     generations to make necessary investments in health care, \n     education, and other programs. Interest payments will \n     continue to crowd out funding for discretionary programs. GAO \n     has estimated that interest payments will reach $400 billion \n     dollars by the year 2020 if we fail to bring the deficit \n     under control. The growth of interest payments and \n     entitlement spending will force a half a trillion dollars of \n     deficit reduction each year just to maintain a deficit path \n     of three percent of GDP by the year 2020. All government \n     programs would be subject to severe cuts every year under \n     this scenario.\n       Interest payments already are crowding out worthy programs. \n     Net interest will be over $235 billion this year. This money \n     will not be available for federal investment, social programs \n     or defense.

Interest is paid to individuals who own \n     Treasury Bills--primary the wealthiest 10% of citizens and \n     institutional investors.

In 1995, the year in which the \n     deficit is the lowest, the deficit will equal 2.5 percent of \n     Gross Domestic Product. The deficit will rise as a percentage \n     of GDP, reaching 3.1 percent of GDP in 2000 and continuing to \n     increase to 3.6 percent of GDP by 2005.\n       In June of 1992, the General Accounting Office released a \n     study entitled Prompt Action Necessary to Avert Long-Term \n     Damage to the Economy, which set out several scenarios for \n     budget policy, including one that is remarkably similar to \n     current budget projections--reducing the deficit enough to \n     hold annual deficits to approximately 3 percent of GDP. The \n     GAO found that this scenario, which it called the ``muddling \n     through option'' would not be sufficient to avoid the severe \n     economic consequences of deficit spending. Among the \n     conclusions that GAO reached:\n       A failure to reverse current trends in fiscal policy ``will \n     doom future generations to a stagnating standard of living, \n     damage U.S. competitiveness and influence in the world, and \n     hamper our ability to address pressing national needs.''\n       Simply maintaining a deficit at three percent of GDP \n     ``offers no escape either from progressively harder decisions \n     or from an unacceptable economic future. It only postpones \n     the date of a full confrontation with the underlying \n     problem.''\n       If we continue on the current ``muddling through'' path, by \n     2005 ``the amount of deficit reduction that will be required \n     to limit the deficit to three percent of GDP will increase \n     exponentially. By the year 2020, it will require a half a \n     trillion dollars of additional deficit reduction each year \n     just to maintain a deficit path of three percent of GDP.''\n       ``The muddling through path requires one to make harder and \n     harder decisions just to stay in place, partly just to offset \n     the growing interest costs that compound with the deficit. . \n     . . To select this path is to fend off the disaster of \n     inaction, but it would lock the nation into many years of \n     unpleasant and relatively unproductive deficit debates rather \n     than debates about what government ought to do and should be \n     done.

We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, morally bound to pay them \n     ourselves.''\n       That statement, as relevant as today's headlines, was made \n     almost 200 years ago by Thomas Jefferson. This perspective, \n     once at the very foundation of our political system, urgently \n     needs to be reasserted.\n       It should be, as early as February, when Congress takes up \n     our Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, S.J. Res. \n     41.\n       Our nation's founders saw a balanced budget and prompt \n     repayment of debt not merely as issues of fiscal policy, but \n     as a moral imperative. Failure to meet these goals was \n     considered not simply economic folly, but a violation of the \n     basic right of the people to be free from a profligate \n     government.\n       Yet today, federal budget deficits are the single biggest \n     threat to our economic security. The government has spent \n     more than it has taken in for 55 of the last 63 years. The \n     budget was last balanced in 1969. The result is a federal \n     debt totaling $4.4 trillion, or more than $17,000 for every \n     man, woman, and child in America, and growing.\n\n\n                 What are the Harms of Budget Deficits?\n\n       Like every family and business, when the government \n     borrows, it must make interest payments. Annual gross \n     interest on the debt now runs about $300 billion, making it \n     the second largest item of federal spending next to Social \n     Security. This equals an incredible 57 percent of all \n     personal income taxes.\n       Now in a sluggish economy, Americans are paying for the \n     government's past addiction to debt. Unless things change, \n     the next generation will pay even more dearly.\n       Last year, Congress's nonpartisan General Accounting Office \n     (GAO) said that, under current trends, our children's \n     standard of living in the year 2020 would stagnate at today's \n     levels--extinguishing the prospect that each generation of \n     Americans would be able to leave the next a legacy of greater \n     opportunity. In contrast, GAO found that balancing the budget \n     by 2001 would produce a 36 percent improvement in the \n     nation's standard of living by 2020.\n       An added danger exists because the national government has \n     a power that families and business don't: It can put the \n     Treasury's printing presses in high gear, devalue the \n     currency, and monetize the debt. Of course, the resulting \n     inflation would depress the worth of people's incomes and \n     assets and produce the same outcome: a lower standard of \n     living.\n\n\n             why has it been so hard to balance the budget?\n\n       Our system of government has changed fundamentally: While \n     almost all Americans want a balanced budget, there's no way \n     to put this general public interest on a level playing field \n     with the specific demands of mobilized, organized interest \n     groups.\n       The unlimited ability to borrow naturally leads to \n     unlimited demands to spend beyond our means. Every American \n     belongs to at least one group that benefits from federal \n     spending. And everyone would like to see his or her taxes \n     held down. If they don't have to say ``no,'' many elected \n     officials see political peril in doing so.\n       That is, there's no way to make it a fair fight until we \n     put a rule in place that the government can't break or amend \n     with impunity, that guarantees we get no more government than \n     we are willing to pay for, and calls on us to pay for all the \n     government we demand.\n\n[[Page S3344]]\n\n                HOW THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT WORKS\n\n       The amendment would prohibit federal outlays from exceeding \n     receipts unless three-fifths of both houses of Congress \n     specifically vote to run a deficit. Similarly, the limit on \n     the national debt could be increased only with a 60-percent \n     super majority vote. A ``constitutional,'' or absolute \n     majority on a roll call vote would be required to raise \n     taxes, contrasted with the current requirement for only a \n     simple majority of those present and voting--or even just a \n     voice vote. The president would be required to balance the \n     budget he or she submits to Congress.\n       By making it more difficult to continue deficit spending \n     and by requiring specific recorded votes, the amendment would \n     make Congress more accountable to the public. The difficulty \n     in obtaining ``super majorities'' to increase borrowing or \n     raise taxes would force the president and congressional \n     leaders to find ways to live within the confines of the \n     amendment.\n\n\n             WHAT DO THE AMENDMENT'S OPPONENTS HAVE TO SAY?\n\n       We have spent years working with colleagues, legal \n     scholars, economists, and public policy groups like the \n     Council for Citizens Against Government Waste to refine our \n     amendment and find out how it would work. We have become more \n     committed to passing the amendment, more certain of the need \n     for it, and more confident of its appropriateness to become \n     part of the Constitution, as we have seen every question \n     answered and every criticism solidly rebutted. For example:\n\n\n                            IT'S NOT NEEDED\n\n       Opponents argue that ``political will'' and budget process \n     reforms should be sufficient to balance the budget. Perhaps \n     they should be; in reality, they haven't been.\n       In 1978, 1979, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1990, Congress enacted \n     and presidents signed laws requiring balanced budgets. Every \n     one was amended or ignored when push came to shove. After \n     all, it is as easy to amend a law or waive a rule as it is to \n     pass it. Amending the Constitution requires two-thirds \n     majorities in Congress and ratification by three-fourths (38) \n     of the states, formidable hurdles that have allowed the \n     enactment of only 17 amendments since the original Bill of \n     Rights in 1789.\n                             it won't work\n\n       Skeptics contend that presidents and congresses would evade \n     the amendment by using accounting gimmicks, such as putting \n     items off-budget. Our amendment is carefully drafted to avoid \n     this kind of danger. For example, precise definitions ensure \n     that no category of outlays or receipts can be placed outside \n     the scope of the amendment.\n\n\n                         it would work too well\n\n       Forgetting that they also said the amendment wouldn't work \n     at all, opponents argue that it would put a ``straitjacket'' \n     on the economy by preventing Congress from using fiscal \n     policy to counteract economic downturns.\n       Our amendment anticipates the need for flexibility that \n     could arise in the long term. During a true emergency, \n     Congress should be able to muster the three-fifths vote \n     needed to stimulate the economy through temporary deficit \n     spending. Our amendment would ensure that such spending is \n     the exception rather than the rule.\n       Years of unbalanced budgets, in good times and bad, have \n     made deficits the greatest danger to our economic well-being. \n     Keep in mind that most of the deficit spending this year went \n     simply to pay interest on the debt. To the extent that \n     deficits can stimulate the economy, today there's almost \n     nothing left over to do so after making interest payments.\n\n\n                it would thwart the will of the majority\n\n       The Constitution's framers wrote that one of the purposes \n     of a constitution is to protect certain rights deserved by \n     all Americans by placing these rights beyond the reach of a \n     ``tyranny of the majority.''\n       The rights enshrined in the Constitution, such as freedom \n     of speech and religion, represent absolute prohibitions on \n     government action. Jefferson favored an absolute prohibition \n     on government borrowing. Our amendment does not go that far. \n     But it does recognize that to protect our children from a \n     tyranny of debt, deficit spending should require more than a \n     simply majority vote.\n       Moreover, our amendment requires a 60-percent majority in \n     exactly one circumstance: when spending in the budget would \n     exceed revenues. The amendment in no way affects the \n     majority's ability to set budget priorities within a balanced \n     budget. Therefore, the amendment would restore our system to \n     working the way the framers of the Constitution intended.\n\n\n                      good programs might get cut\n\n       Every dollar borrowed incurs interest costs which already \n     result in significantly fewer dollars for high-priority \n     programs and in higher taxes. In fact, if no federal debt \n     ever had been accumulated in the first place, the government \n     would run a $200 billion surplus over the 1995-1999 period.\n       Some worry, if the budget must be balanced, it will be done \n     fairly. However, the government's escalating interest \n     payments--with gross interest totaling $294 billion in 1993--\n     are blatantly regressive. These represent a transfer of funds \n     from the working middle class--who pay the bulk of federal \n     taxes--to the large banks, corporations, and wealthy \n     individuals who hold Treasury securities. About 15 percent of \n     these payments go to rich investors of governments overseas.\n       The greatest unfairness is for the government to live off a \n     giant credit card today and send the bill to the next \n     generation amounting to a massive taxation without \n     representation.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The best way to ensure the continued soundness of essential \n     programs, stabilize the economy and pass on a legacy of \n     economic opportunity to our children is to reverse the growth \n     in the federal debt. Without a balanced budget amendment to \n     the Constitution, it is unlikely we will ever find the \n     discipline to restore this rationality to our budget \n     decisions.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Times, October 1993]\n\n                    Economic Security in the Balance\n\n                    (By Larry Craig and Paul Simon)\n\n       ``Once the budget is balanced and the debts paid off, our \n     population will be relieved from a considerable portion of \n     its present burdens and will find out new motives to \n     patriotic affection, (and) additional means for the display \n     of individual enterprise.''\n       That statement, as relevant as today's news, was made more \n     than 150 years ago by President Andrew Jackson. This \n     perspective on the federal government and the economic well-\n     being of the people, once at the very foundation of our \n     political system, urgently needs to be reasserted.\n       It should be, early in November when Congress takes up our \n     Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, S.J. Res. 41.\n       Federal budget deficits are not an abstract problem; they \n     are now the single biggest threat to our nation's economic \n     security. When the economy is unstable, seniors on fixed \n     incomes suffer the most.\n       The government has spend more than it has taken in for 55 \n     of the last 63 years; the budget was last balanced in 1969. \n     The result is a federal debt totaling $4.3 trillion, or about \n     $17,000 for every man, woman and child in America, and \n     growing.\n       Like every family and business, when the government \n     borrows, it must make interest payments. Annual gross \n     interest on the debt now runs about $300 billion, making it \n     the second-largest item of federal spending, next to Social \n     Security. This amount equals an incredible 57 percent of all \n     personal income taxes.\n       Every dollar borrowed incurs interest costs that result in \n     significantly fewer dollars for high-priority programs and in \n     higher taxes. With a growing population depending on Social \n     Security, the best way to ensure its continued soundness is \n     to stabilize the economy and reverse the growth in interest \n     costs--which compete with Social Security for dollars--by \n     balancing the budget.\n       The fiscal costs and economic drag of the federal debt \n     imperil both seniors today and their children. Last year, \n     Congress' nonpartisan General Accounting Office said that, if \n     nothing changes, our children's standard of living in the \n     year 2020 will stagnate at today's levels--putting an end to \n     the American dream of each generation leaving the next a \n     legacy of opportunity. In contrast, balancing the budget by \n     2001 would produce a 36 percent improvement in the nation's \n     standard of living by 2020.\n       Who collects interest payments on the federal debt? About \n     15 percent goes overseas. Almost all of the rest goes to \n     large banks, corporations, state and local governments, and \n     wealthy investors. Thomas Jefferson objected to any federal \n     indebtedness, fearing that taxes on farmers, laborers, \n     merchants and their families would escalate forever to pay \n     the interest on a growing debt.\n       Why has it been so hard to balance the budget? The \n     unlimited ability to borrow leads naturally to unlimited \n     demands to spend. Every American belongs to at least one \n     group that benefits from federal spending. And everyone would \n     like to see his or her taxes held down. If you don't have to \n     say ``no,'' then many elected officials see only political \n     peril in doing so.\n       Our system of government has changed fundamentally: While \n     almost all Americans want a balanced budget, there's no way \n     to put this general, public interest on a level playing field \n     with the specific demands of mobilized, organized interest \n     groups.\n       That is, there's no way to make it a fair fight until we \n     add to the Constitution a rule the government can't break, \n     that guarantees we get no more government than we are willing \n     to pay for and calls on us to pay for all the government we \n     demand.\n       Fifty years before Jackson, Jefferson said, ``We should \n     consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our \n     debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves.... I wish it \n     were possible to obtain a single amendment to our \n     Constitution...an additional article, taking from the \n     government the power of borrowing.''\n       It's time to live up to Mr. Jefferson's vision.\n                                                                    ____\n\n   [From CLUBB--Congressional Leaders United for a Balanced Budget, \n                       Revised January 30, 1995]\n\n      Factsheet: Alarmist Attacks on the Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n       Yesterday, the Treasury Department released a study \n     projecting several ``horror story'' scenarios of the kinds of \n     policy decisions the Administration foresees might be \n     [[Page S3345]] necessary if the Balanced Budget Amendment, is \n     added to the Constitution. The ``results'' of these studies \n     were broken down by state. Other studies have been released \n     by other organizations purporting to demonstrate the impact \n     that a balanced budget amendment will have.\n       These studies actually send four messages: (1) Opponents \n     fear the amendment will work; (2) The case against the \n     amendment is so weak that opponents must resort to scare \n     tactics; (3) The methodology used assumes arbitrary, across-\n     the-board approaches; and (4) The study represents a failure \n     to face up to long-term responsibilities and consequences.\n       (1) Opponents fear the amendment will work: Critics raise \n     the specter of what budget policy options might be considered \n     if Congress and the President must comply with a Balanced \n     Budget Amendment. However, their arguments are directed \n     against the deficit reduction that will be required to \n     balance the budget.\n       The study ignores the impact on government services, \n     program beneficiaries, and taxpayers from remaining on a \n     course that will result in the federal debt increasing 90% \n     over the next ten years, and annual spending on interest \n     payments increasing by two-thirds. As Senator Paul Simon has \n     pointed out, every dollar spent on interest payments is a \n     dollar that can not go to valued programs.\n       Forcing the government to live within its means will \n     require setting priorities and making some difficult \n     decisions. This will not happen without the Amendment and it \n     must happen to safeguard our future economic security.\n       (2) Scare tactics: As Rep. Olympia Snowe said in a 1994 \n     Budget Committee hearing, people start pounding the table \n     when they're losing the argument. Arguments like those in the \n     Treasury and Wharton studies rely on alarming individuals and \n     groups about how severely they might be impacted. However, \n     even if federal spending continued to increase 3.1% a year, \n     it would fall into balance with revenues (as projected in \n     CBO's January baseline) by the year 2002. Currently, spending \n     is projected to grow an average of 5% a year through 2001.\n       If we act promptly, reasonable restraint, not massive \n     spending cuts or tax increases, will take us to a balanced \n     budget. However, CBO projects deficits again increasing \n     rapidly after 1996. The longer we wait, the greater the pain \n     of deficit reduction will become.\n       (3) Arbitrary, unrealistic methodology: The study assumes \n     that Congress will abdicate its responsibility to set \n     priorities and that the deficit reduction will occur in an \n     across-the-board manner. This approach, which is common in \n     such ``horror story'' reports regarding a BBA, implies that \n     the President and Congress have no priorities and assumes \n     they would not set priorities within a balanced budget \n     framework. The Treasury Department study manufactures per-\n     program and per-state numbers that likely bear no resemblance \n     to the decisions Congress and the President eventually will \n     make.\n       This very lack of priority-setting is at the root of the \n     $4.7 trillion national debt; today, marginal programs are \n     funded because they never have to compete with essential \n     programs. Under the amendment, Congress and the President \n     would be faced with a fiscal and political imperative to set \n     priorities. Government could promise no more than the people \n     were willing to pay for and we would pay for all the \n     government we demand.\n       Treasury acknowledges that its ``estimates are static in \n     nature and reflect no macroeconomic feedback.'' Thus, the \n     study does not discuss the long-term economic security, \n     growth, and higher living standards that will result from \n     balanced budgets and are at the core of the case for the \n     amendment. In 1992, the non-partisan General Accounting \n     Office compared the economic effects of balancing the budget \n     by the year 2002 with a ``muddling through'' scenario that \n     assumed policies to maintain deficits of 3% of GDP. GAO found \n     that balancing the budget by the year 2000 would promote \n     significantly greater economic growth than the muddling \n     through option.\n       (4) Failure to take responsibility for the long term: CBO's \n     preliminary budget projections found that the deficit will \n     leap back upward to $421 billion by FY 2005. The deficit as a \n     share of gross domestic product (GDP) would pass the 3% mark \n     before the next century.\n       The preliminary CBO baseline resembles the ``Muddling \n     Through'' scenario set out in GAO's 1992 report, Budget \n     Policy: Prompt Action Necessary to Avert Long-Term Damage to \n     the Economy. Under that scenario, by 2020, per capita GDP \n     would be 7% lower and the federal debt three times larger \n     than if the budget were balanced from the year 2001 on. \n     Moreover, the annual deficit reduction required to maintain \n     the deficit at 3% of GDP (``muddling through'') would give \n     rise to more than $500 billion a year by FY 2020.\n       Approaches like those taken by Treasury imply that \n     Americans will find each and every federal program so \n     indispensable, so sacred, that protecting every single \n     program, every interest today, outweighs our children's \n     standard of living and the government's ability to continue \n     providing priority services and benefits in the coming years.\n       (Prepared by the Offices of Senator Larry Craig (202) 224-\n     2752 Congressman Nathan Deal (202) 225-5211.)\n                                                                    ____\n\n      [CLUBB--Congressional Leaders United for a Balanced Budget]\n\n         Factsheet: Balanced Budget Requirements in the States\n\n       Debate on a proposed Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S. \n     Constitution highlights the status of the states as \n     ``laboratories of democracy.'' While the supporters of H.J. \n     Res. 1 do not argue that the federal Constitution should have \n     a balanced budget requirement because the states have such \n     restraints, the experiences of the states are instructive.\n       While they vary widely in form, 49 of the 50 states have \n     significant balanced budget requirements.\n       It is also true that, while, standing alone, many of the \n     state provisions appear to be less restrictive than H.J. 1 \n     for the federal government, there are important institutional \n     differences which dictate the terms of the federal proposal.\n       In 35 of the states, balanced budget requirements are \n     written into constitutions. In 13 others they are statutory. \n     Nine of those have constitutional debt limits that are \n     usually interpreted as constitutional balanced budget \n     requirements. In one (Wyoming), the unwritten imperative is \n     strong enough that it is regarded as having ``constitutional \n     status.''\n       But that's only a glimpse into the rich diversity through \n     which states control indebtedness.\n       In 43 or more states, balanced budget requirements are \n     supplemented by special executive branch budget powers. \n     Twenty-one states have spending limits, 7 have revenue \n     limits, and 3 have both. Fifteen require more than a simple \n     majority to pass any budget.\n       Noteworthy differences include whether capital, trust fund, \n     or other budgets are included under state balanced budget \n     requirements.\n       There's a lot we can learn from specific state balanced \n     budget initiatives and apply to the federal proposal.\n       The states can afford to exempt portions of their budgets \n     because state bond ratings--generally applying to capital \n     investments--serve as the ultimate disciplinarian. There are \n     no bond rating services for the federal government in part \n     because foreigners and others line up to bank on the full \n     faith and credit of the U.S. government. In addition, some \n     bond issues are subject to public referenda.\n       States sometimes mislead when defining a ``deficit.'' That \n     led to the language before Congress now, ``Total outlays for \n     any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that \n     fiscal year . . .''\n       The processes of defining and amortizing ``capital \n     investments'' can be abused. For example, New York City, \n     prior to its financial crisis in the s, wrote off spending \n     for school textbooks by declaring their ``useful life'' to be \n     30 years.\n       Some states can use revenue and borrowing to meet balanced \n     budget requirements. Under H.J. Res. 1, raising the debt \n     limit requires a \\3/5\\ majority to counter this state-proven \n     tendency.\n       The imposition of budget discipline on states whether from \n     balanced budget requirements or bond ratings has led to \n     establishment of ``rainy day'' funds. Many states now set \n     aside excess revenues in good times requiring less \n     indebtedness during recessions.\n       Despite such diversity, the experience of the states shows \n     that balanced budget requirements have had a salutary effect.\n       From 1980 to 1992, the states' outstanding long-term debt \n     rose from $120 billion to $369 billion, a 208 percent \n     increase; total state spending growth was about 4 percent \n     greater than revenue growth. During the same period, federal \n     debt grew from $905 billion to $4.002 trillion, a 340 percent \n     increase; federal spending growth was about 38 percent \n     greater than revenue growth.\n       The similarities between state and federal budget \n     experiences support adoption of a federal balanced budget \n     amendment; the differences demonstrate why H.J. Res. 1 is the \n     approach best suited to the federal level.\n       That variance and relative complexity of state provisions \n     contributed to the development of the one-page simplicity of \n     the Stenholm/Smith federal amendment. An amendment to the \n     U.S. Constitution should state a broad, fundamental principle \n     and provide the bare bones of process necessary to enforce \n     that principle.\n       The states' experiences demonstrate that exempting any \n     portion of federal spending from a balanced budget amendment \n     would create potential loopholes. The ``higher authorities'' \n     that generally check abuses at the state level do not exist \n     at the federal level. ``Pet programs'' could easily be pushed \n     into whatever funding category was not covered by a BBA. Debt \n     would continue to soar, and the Constitution would be \n     affronted.\n       The federal government has no line item veto and a \n     relatively weak rescission process. The lack of such \n     supplementary means for imposing discipline is among the \n     reasons why the federal BBA needs to be more restrictive than \n     state counterparts. At the same time, a BBA is the single \n     most important mechanism, and the most constitutionally \n     elegant, for enforcing the fundamental principle that the \n     people should be protected from the abuses of profiligate \n     government borrowing.\n\n[[Page S3346]]\n\n                             Silver Spring, MD, February 15, 1994.\n     Hon. Paul Simon,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simon: I am pleased to have this opportunity \n     to express my support for the Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       For 37 years I worked for the Social Security \n     Administration, serving as Chief Actuary in 1947-70, and as \n     Deputy Commissioner in 1981-82. In 1982-83, I served as \n     Executive Director of the National Commission on Social \n     Security Reform. And I continue to do all that I can to \n     assure that Social Security continues to fulfill its \n     promises.\n       The Social Security trust funds are one of the great social \n     successes of this century. The program is fully self-\n     sustaining, and is currently running significant excesses of \n     income over outgo. The trust funds will continue to help the \n     elderly for generations to come--so long as the rest of the \n     federal government acts with fiscal prudence. Unfortunately, \n     that is a big ``if.''\n       In my opinion, the most serious threat to Social Security \n     is the federal government's fiscal irresponsibility. If we \n     continue to run federal deficits year after year, and if \n     interest payments continue to rise at an alarming rate, we \n     will face two dangerous possibilities. Either we will raid \n     the trust funds to pay for our current profligacy, or we will \n     print money, dishonestly inflating our way out of \n     indebtedness. Both cases would devastate the real value of \n     the Social Security trust funds.\n       Regaining control of our fiscal affairs is the most \n     important step that we can take to protect the soundness of \n     the Social Security trust funds. I urge the Congress to make \n     that goal a reality--and to pass the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment without delay.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert J.

That is an \n     astonishing statement.''\n       Paul Tsongas, talking about Social Security and the BBA:\n       ``It is embarrassing to be a Democrat and watch a \n     Democratic President raise the scare tactics of Social \n     Security.''\n       ``It pains me that the Democratic party should be the party \n     that turns its back on the young.''\n       Paul Tsongas talked about those who've supported BBA in the \n     past, but who now say they will vote against a BBA without a \n     Social Security exemption.\n       ``It's flushing out those who never meant it, those whose \n     cynicism I think is now going to be on display.''\n       ``The calculation is quite explicit, how do I somehow kill \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment without having my fingerprints \n     on the deed. And the use of Social Security is the chosen \n     weapon.''\n       ``The question is, where is the cover? And the cover is the \n     Social Security subterfuge.''\n       ``Those who vote to exclude Social Security are voting to \n     kill the Balanced Budget Amendment. It is that simple, it is \n     that clean and should be stated.''\n       Senator Paul Simon (D-IL):\n       ``Every time we have a deficit, we're borrowing from your \n     six year-old.

Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: I wanted to take just a moment to thank \n     you for your dedication and extraordinary effort to get a \n     Balanced Budget Amendment passed. We believe very strongly \n     that a bankrupted country cannot care for its elderly, its \n     young or its poor, and that a Balanced Budget Amendment is \n     desperately needed at this time.\n       The Seniors Coalition commissioned The Luntz Research \n     Companies to conduct a poll late last week to determine if \n     public support for the Balanced Budget Amendment was still as \n     strong as it had been at the end of January. I would like to \n     share some of the results with you.\n       As far as we have been able to determine, this nationwide \n     poll contains the most recent data available on the public's \n     opinion of the Balanced Budget Amendment. The questions were \n     asked as part of an omnibus national survey conducted of \n     1,000 registered voters from February 22nd to 23rd. The \n     survey has a margin of error of 3.1% at the 95% \n     confidence level.\n       When people were asked if they supported the Senate passing \n     the same Balanced Budget Amendment passed by the House of \n     Representatives, an overwhelming 79% of respondents supported \n     Senate passage of this measure. This figure is identical to \n     the results of a Wirthlin poll conducted January 25th to \n     28th. Public support for the Balanced Budget Amendment has \n     not fallen over this past month.\n       Of those supporting the Balanced Budget Amendment, 61% were \n     strongly supporting the BBA and 18% were somewhat supportive \n     of the BBA. Compared to the Wirthlin poll: 52% strongly \n     favored and 27% somewhat favored a BBA at the end\n      of January. This suggests that not only do people still \n     support a BBA, but they do so with a stronger conviction.\n       When senior citizens were asked how they felt about the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment, 80% of those age 55-64 and a \n     strong 71% of those age 65+ supported the BBA. By geographic \n     region, people in the Northeast support the BBA at 80%, those \n     in the South by 79%, those in the Midwest by 76%, in the West \n     by 78% and along the Pacific by 81%.\n       We were also curious to know how people would feel about \n     their Senator if the Balanced Budget Amendment failed. \n     Respondents were asked if they would vote for or against \n     their Senator in the next election if he or she were the one \n     to cause the BBA to fail by one vote. Nearly half, 46%, said \n     they would vote against their Senator if this were the case. \n     These were evenly split, 23% each, along the lines of \n     definitely against or probably against. Comparatively, of the \n     34% who answered they would vote for their Senator, only 11% \n     were firm in their conviction.\n       Senior citizens were consistent with this trend and 45% of \n     those age 55-64 and 41% of those age 65+ indicated they would \n     vote against their Senator if they blocked passage of the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment. Of interest in these numbers is \n     that seniors were lower than the general average of 34% in \n     stating they would vote for their Senator under this \n     scenario. Of those age 55-64, only 30% would vote in the \n     affirmative and 31% of those age 65+ would vote to re-elect \n     their Senator.\n       By geographic region, those that would vote against their \n     Senator if they were responsible for the failure of the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment was as follows: Northeast--43%; \n     South--50%; Midwest--46%; West--45%; and Pacific--48%.\n       The respondents were also asked if they felt that those \n     Senators who have claimed they want to learn more about the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment were correct in opposing the BBA, \n     or were they putting politics ahead of the national interest. \n     An astounding 60% of the voters surveyed thought that \n     politics was being put ahead of the national interest. This \n     number held strong among seniors of all ages at 59% in both \n     the 55-64 and 65+ categories.\n       In geographic regions, 58% of those in the Northeast, 65% \n     of those in the South, 56% of those in the Midwest, 60% of \n     the West and 58% of the Pacific thought that politics were \n     taking precedence over the national interest.\n       The results of this poll clearly show that despite all the \n     rhetoric and debate over the past month on what a Balanced \n     Budget Amendment would mean for America, seniors--and voters \n     in general--are still strongly committed to forcing Congress \n     to balance its budget, and they want their Senators to do the \n     right thing.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jake Hansen,\n     Vice President for Government Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        The Seniors Coalition,\n\n                                       Fairfax, VA, March 2, 1995.\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     Re The American Association of Retired Persons and the \n       Balanced Budget Amendment.\n     To: All Interested Parties.\n     From: Kimberly Schuld, Legislative Analyst.\n       The AARP commissioned The Wirthlin Group to conduct a \n     survey for them January 25-28, 1995 on a variety of questions \n     pertaining to the BBA. Since then, the AARP and the National \n     Council of Senior Citizens have been twisting the poll's \n     results and methodology to claim that public support for a \n     BBA is low--once Americans are told what the BBA will mean to \n     them.\n       The key word here is TOLD. The poll utilizes a series of \n     questions designed to lead people to a mis-informed and \n     generally incorrect impression of what the BBA will do. \n     Namely, the line of questioning implies that Social Security \n     and Medicare will face drastic cuts, and state and local \n     taxes will skyrocket as the federal faucet is turned off.\n       An AARP Press Release announcing the poll results states, \n     ``. . . most Americans do not understand the potential impact \n     of the Balanced Budget Amendment and are adamantly opposed to \n     using Social Security and Medicare to reduce the federal \n     deficit.''\n       Quite bluntly, the AARP has effectively provided a \n     political scare campaign for those members of Congress \n     wishing to avoid facing \n     [[Page S3347]] their constituents with the news that they \n     want to vote against the BBA. We all know the arguments \n     against excluding Social Security from the constitutional \n     amendment, but the AARP has electrified the ``third rail'' to \n     the political benefit (is it really?) of the White House.\n\n\n                   analysis of the aarp/wirthlin poll\n\n       The poll consisted of sixteen questions to 1,000 adults, \n     with a 200 oversample to adults 50 and older. The margin of \n     error is 2.8% at a 95% confidence level. A copy \n     of the questions is attached.\n       The poll starts off with a question about the direction of \n     the country and then asks: ``Do you favor or oppose a \n     balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would \n     require the federal government to balance its budget by the \n     year 2002?'' Favor: 79%. Oppose: 16%.\n       The next question tests how people perceive the budget can \n     be balanced: spending cuts, taxes or both. This is followed \n     by a question on equal percentage across-the-board cuts in \n     every federal program.\n       The next two questions ask specifically if Social Security \n     and Medicare should be included in across-the-board cuts. As \n     could be expected, the respondents would favor exemptions for \n     both programs. A key element to these two questions (#5 and \n     #6) is the use of the word ``exempt''. The word ``exempt'' is \n     not used anywhere in the poll except in relation to Social \n     Security and/or Medicare. This sets up a connection in \n     people's minds that these programs may be in graver danger \n     than other government programs.\n       Question #7 sets up the respondent for the ``truth in \n     budgeting'' excuse the Administration has been spinning. When \n     offering people the choice between passing the BBA first, or \n     identifying cuts first, the poll throws in ``consequences'' \n     associated with cuts. The connotation is that there are going \n     to be dire ``consequences'' to balancing the budget. This \n     sets up the respondent to answer question #15 (open-ended) \n     with a negative response on how they think the BBA will \n     affect them personally.\n       Questions #8, #9 and #10 ask about whether respondents \n     think it is necessary to cut Defense. Social Security and \n     Medicare to balance the budget, or whether the budget could \n     be balanced without these programs. As could be expected, the \n     response for cutting Defense is overwhelming compared to SS \n     and Medicare. The group of questions sets up a ``good cop/bad \n     cop'' scenario in the mind of the respondent whereby they \n     identify Defense as the ``bad guy'' as well as being reminded \n     which party tends to support Defense. It is also important to \n     remember that at the time this poll was taken the newspapers \n     and network news broadcasts were full of stories about the \n     Republicans wanting to increase Defense spending in the \n     Contract With America.\n       Questions #11 and #12 address taxes; their role in the \n     budget balancing process and reform ideas. This also serves \n     to set up negative responses to question #15. In #11, 48% of \n     the people believe there will have to be tax increases to \n     balance the budget. Then the next question, they are asked to \n     declare a preference for one of a variety of tax cuts. This \n     conflict sets up a negative impression that tax cuts are good \n     and the BBA is bad because there must be tax increases to \n     accomplish its goal.\n       Question #13 throws together ``programs for the poor, \n     foreign aid, and congressional salaries and pensions''. \n     Respondents are asked how far these programs COMBINED would \n     go toward balancing the budget if they were cut. By throwing \n     these widely divergent programs together, the pollsters are \n     setting up the respondent to believe that balancing the \n     budget will mean higher taxes and cuts in taxpayer-financed \n     programs.\n       Question #14 is the keeper. Respondents are asked if they \n     still support a BBA with the following choices: Social \n     Security should be kept separate from the rest of the budget \n     and exempted from a BBA because it is a self-financed by a \n     payroll tax or Social Security is part of the overall \n     government spending and taxing scenario, thus should be \n     subject to cuts along with the rest of the budget.\n       The results of this questions dramatically flip the BBA \n     support from question #2: BBA with SS Exempt: 85%. BBA that \n     cuts SS: 13%.\n       Question #16 now asks: ``Do you favor or oppose the \n     balanced budget amendment, even if it means that your state \n     income taxes and local property taxes would have to be raised \n     to make up for monies the federal government no longer \n     transfers to your state?'' Favor: 38%. Oppose: 60%.\n       This question ends the phone call on a gross mis-\n     interpretation that dire consequences of doom and gloom are \n     on the horizon, all at the voter's expense. This is exactly \n     the type of question that re-reinforces the ``angry voter'' \n     complex of the middle class family.\n       These anti-BBA results are achieved by planting the seed of \n     doubt slowly but surely that:\n       1. It is the intention of BBA supporters to cut Social \n     Security and Medicare.\n       2. It is the intention of BBA supporters to beef up Defense \n     spending at the expense of everything else.\n       3. Taxes will inevitably go up with a BBA.\n       4. A BBA will have a negative direct impact on families \n     ``beyond the beltway.''\n       Any time a Senator, Congressman, reporter or lobbyist \n     starts to talk about poll results showing 85% of Americans \n     oppose a BBA unless it exempts Social Security, bear in mind \n     that the spin-meisters achieved this number by forcing the \n     assumption that draconian Social Security cuts are a foregone \n     conclusion.\n       Leaders from the Republican party, the Democratic party, \n     the Administration and the President himself have all gone to \n     great lengths to state that social security benefits are off \n     the table.\n       Any member of congress who contends NOW that the new \n     Republican leadership cannot be trusted to keep their hands \n     off Social Security is also implicating their own party \n     leaders and the President of the same un-trustworthiness.\n                                                                    ____\n\n Testimony of Jake Hansen, Director of Government Affairs, the Seniors \n      Coalition for the Joint Economic Committee, January 23, 1995\n\n\n        Balanced Budget Amendment: Imperative to Social Security\n\n       Mr. Chairman, this is not a new issue to The Seniors \n     Coalition. Since our inception we have fought for a Balanced \n     Budget Amendment. We have had experts on Social Security and \n     an expert economist look at the issue, as well as hearing \n     from thousands of our members. Their conclusion: give us a \n     Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       During the elections and in recent debate, we have heard \n     from many politicians that a Balanced Budget Amendment will \n     destroy Social Security. However, the question is not ``Will \n     a Balanced Budget Amendment destroy Social Security'', but \n     rather ``Can Social Security survive without a Balanced \n     Budget Amendment?''\n       As you know, up until 1983, the Social Security system ran \n     on a pay-as-you-go basis. That is, the amount of money going \n     into the Trust Funds from payroll deductions was basically \n     equal to the amount of money being paid to beneficiaries of \n     the day.\n       In the late seventies, the economy was a disaster. \n     Inflation was up, leading to higher cost of living payments \n     than had been anticipated. Unemployment was up, meaning that \n     less money was being paid into the system than had been \n     anticipated. The result: Social Security was headed for \n     bankruptcy at break-neck speed.\n       In 1983, a bi-partisan effort saved Social Security by \n     changing the benefit structure and raising Social Security \n     payroll taxes. This effort created a new--and potentially \n     worse--problem: a rising fund balance in the Social Security \n     Trust Funds. For the past ten years, more money has been \n     pouring into the Trust Funds than is needed to meet today's \n     obligations.\n       This balance has been ``borrowed'' by the federal \n     government. Today, the federal government owes the Trust \n     Funds about $430 billion. By the year 2018, according to the \n     Social Security Board of Trustees, that figure will be a \n     shade over three trillion dollars. At that time, the entire \n     federal debt will be--who knows, eight, ten, twelve trillion \n     dollars?\n       The point is, how will the government ever pay back the \n     Trust Funds? They could: turn on the printing presses and \n     monetize the debt, so that a Social Security check would buy \n     a loaf of bread; borrow the money--hurting both the economy \n     and the Federal Budget; make massive cuts in benefits; raise \n     taxes, and thus, destroy the economy for everyone; or simply \n     renege on the debt.\n       Mr. Chairman, The Seniors Coalition doesn't find any of \n     these alternatives acceptable.\n       The Chairman of our advisory board, Robert J. Myers (often \n     referred to as the father of Social Security) wrote of his \n     support of a Balanced Budget Amendment last year and said: \n     ``In my opinion, the most serious threat to Social Security \n     is the federal government's fiscal irresponsibility. If we \n     continue to run federal defects year after year, and if \n     interest payments continue to rise at an alarming rate, we \n     will face two dangerous possibilities. Either we will raid \n     the trust funds to pay for our current prolificacy, or we \n     will print money, dishonestly inflating our way out of \n     indebtedness. Both cases would devastate the real value of \n     the Social Security Trust Funds.''\n       The bottom line, is that if we want to protect the \n     integrity of Social Security the only way is through a \n     Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       With that said, the question becomes will just any old \n     Balanced Budget Amendment do? The answer is, some are better \n     than others, and some are absolutely not acceptable.\n       First, some people are suggesting that Social Security \n     should be exempted. That should be something that an \n     organization like ours would leap at. The fact is, we are \n     concerned that such an Amendment would end up destroying \n     Social Security as more and more government programs would be \n     moved to Social Security to circumvent the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment. We believe this would destroy Social Security, and \n     will not support such an Amendment.\n       Our first choice would be a Balanced Budget Amendment that \n     controls taxes as well as spending--such as the Amendment \n     that has been presented by Congressman Barton. We support tax \n     limitation and would like to see this Amendment voted on. We \n     would urge every Member of Congress to vote for this \n     Amendment.\n       If, this Amendment does not pass, then we willingly support \n     a Balanced Budget Amendment such as the one offered by \n     Senators Hatch and Craig. While I am concerned about taxes, I \n     believe that last year's elections \n     [[Page S3348]] showed us that we, the people, do have the \n     ultimate power. And, I believe that had we been forced to pay \n     for all the government we were being given, we would have \n     made massive changes much sooner.\n       Mr. Chairman, we believe that what is most important is \n     that America be given a serious Balanced Budget Amendment as \n     soon as possible. We will work with you and your colleagues \n     in every way possible to make that happen. Thank you.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        The Seniors Coalition,\n\n                                    Fairfax, VA, January 24, 1995.\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     Re Balanced Budget Amendment.\n     To: Senator Craig.\n     From: Jake Hansen, Vice President for Government Relations.\n       The Seniors Coalition has supported a balanced budget \n     amendment for several years. On behalf of our one million \n     members nationwide. I am requesting your support of S.J. Res. \n     1 in the next few weeks.\n       It is vital that Congress pass a measure that would require \n     the federal budget to be balanced. Our members feel that if \n     the government were forced to evaluate its spending the way \n     every family in America evaluates their own, this country \n     would not be ``heading down the wrong path.'' While there are \n     a great many factors that contribute to this public \n     perception, the bottom line for many Americans is that the \n     government takes too much from them and spends too much on \n     programs that do not work. The time to end the cycle of \n     taxing and spending has come.\n       I also want to touch briefly on the role of Social Security \n     in the balanced budget amendment. We feel that there is no \n     reason to exempt Social Security from a balanced budget. In \n     fact, such an exemption would create a serious policy and \n     political crisis for Congress, and would lead to the \n     destruction of the Social Security system.\n       If Social Security is exempted, the total force of \n     balancing the budget will find its way to Social Security. \n     There will be an overwhelming temptation to either redefine \n     government programs as Social Security programs, or pull \n     money out of the Trust Fund to balance the budget by cutting \n     Social Security taxes to offset tax increases elsewhere. In \n     fact, there would be nothing to stop Congress from \n     ``borrowing'' as much money as it wanted from the Trust Funds \n     to finance any other government program.\n       We feel confident that the political climate surrounding \n     Social Security is enough to protect it, thus engaging in \n     destructive policy in the name of protection will only lead \n     us down the path of truly committing damage to the Social \n     Security system.\n       What is most important is that America be given a serious \n     balanced budget amendment as soon as possible.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nBalanced Budget Amendment Alert From the Seniors Coalition, January 26, \n                                 1995.\n\n       This morning the opponent of a BBA launched a full scale \n     attack on the Balanced Budget Amendment with Social Security \n     bombs. Seniors across the country are watching C-SPAN with \n     renewed and unjustified fear. It is vital that their scare \n     campaign be stopped.\n       Exempting Social Security from the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment will destroy the Social Security system--NOT \n     protect it.\n       Balancing the budget will create tremendous pressure and \n     that pressure will blow through any available escape hatch. \n     Whatever is exempted from the balanced budget requirement \n     becomes that escape hatch!\n       As the total force of balancing the budget falls on Social \n     Security, there will be overwhelming pressure to redefine \n     many government programs as Social Security programs. This \n     endangers its original purpose. There would be nothing to \n     stop Congress from ``borrowing'' as much money as it wanted \n     from the trust fund to finance any government program if \n     Social Security is exempted from the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment.\n       Exempting Social Security from the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment would open a loophole in the requirement that would \n     completely gut its effectiveness by allowing all social \n     welfare and other programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid) to \n     be financed off-budget, in deficit, as the ``New Covenant \n     Social Security.''\n       Failure to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment will destroy \n     Social Security.\n       Eventually, $400 billion plus will have to be returned to \n     the Social Security trust fund to pay benefits to retired \n     baby-boomers. Without starting a balanced budget process now, \n     the battle over Social Security will be like nothing Congress \n     has ever seen thirty years from now.\n       Without balancing the budget, Social Security benefits will \n     always be subject to cuts, new taxes and means-testing. This \n     permanently erodes any confidence in discussions of systemic \n     reforms for future generations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      60 Plus,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, February 9, 1995.\n     Hon.

Craig,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: I am writing to you to express the \n     strong support of the 60/Plus Association for the Balanced \n     Budget Amendment to the Constitution, which is now being \n     considered by the U.S. Senate.\n       The 60/Plus Association is a two-year-old, nonpartisan, \n     seniors advocacy group with more than 225,000 members. For \n     the 103rd Congress, we presented the Guardian of Seniors' \n     Rights award to 226 House and Senate Members.\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment is the best friend the Social \n     Security system and our nation's seniors could have. The \n     Senate should pass H.J. Res. 1, as passed by the House of \n     Representatives in a strong bipartisan vote, and submit it \n     immediately to the States for ratification.\n       Continuted, growing deficit spending is the greatest threat \n     to the integrity of the Social Security system and to the \n     present and future benefits paid from Social Security trust \n     funds. Past deficits have created a national debt of $4.8 \n     trillion--an alarming 70 percent of our Gross Domestic \n     Product. Gross interest payments now consume nearly one-fifth \n     of total federal spending and will surpass Social Security as \n     the largest item of spending by the end of the decade.\n       This national debt already has depressed the economy and \n     lowered seniors' standard of living. As the costs of \n     servicing that debt continue to climb and to squeeze all \n     other budget priorities, they threaten the very existence of \n     Social Security. Today's Social Security surpluses represent \n     a commitment to seniors tomorrow. But a debtor bankrupted by \n     an excessive debt load is not able to meet any of its \n     commitments. Bitter experience has shown that only the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment can save our nation from that fate.\n       While well-intentioned, these attempts to exempt Social \n     Security from the discipline of the Balanced Budget Amendment \n     are completely misguided. Instead of protecting seniors, \n     exemptions like that in the Reid Amendment would allow the \n     Social Security trust funds to run unlimited deficits. This \n     would create an irresistible temptation to pay for all sorts \n     of unrelated programs out of the trust funds, completely \n     destroying the unique purpose for which they were created and \n     rendering them insolvent.\n       The debt is the threat to Social Security and America's \n     seniors. A ``clean'' balanced budget amendment, such as H.J. \n     Res. 1. is their best protector. The 60/Plus Association \n     urges you and your colleagues to pass their urgently needed \n     legislation and resist the scare tactics of those who create \n     any loopholes that would compromise either balancing the \n     budget or protecting Social Security.\n       Former Senator Paul Tsongas summed it up best when he said \n     he was ``embarrassed as a Democrat to watch a Democratic \n     President raise the scare tactics of Social Security.''\n       In other words, it's `scare us old folks time again' as \n     opponents drag a 30-year-old red herring across the trail.\n       Many seniors--including this one--vividly remember the \n     scare tactics then--the LBJ TV ad--a giant pair of scissors \n     cutting through a Social Security card--with the clear \n     implication that a vote for Barry Goldwater and Republicans \n     would mean the end of Social Security.\n       Seniors didn't buy that canard then, nor do they now, 30 \n     years later, judging by the response we get from a vast \n     majority of seniors.\n           Sincerely.\n                                                  James L. Martin,\n     Chairman, 60+.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                     National Taxpayers Union,\n\n                                                 February 6, 1995.\n\n                           [Legislative memo]\n\n     Re Balanced Budget Amendment--Critique of Amendment To Exempt \n         Social Security and Scoring in NTU Annual Rating of \n         Congress.\n     To: U.S. Senators.\n     From: David Keating, Executive Vice President.\n       An amendment to SJR 1 by Senators Reid, Feinstein, and \n     others will propose to exempt Social Security trust funds \n     (OASDI) from a balanced budget rule. A vote against this \n     proposal will be heavily counted as a pro-taxpayer vote in \n     our annual Rating of Congress.\n       NTU strongly supports prompt passage, early this year, of \n     the best Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) that can get the \n     needed two-thirds vote. This means a genuine, effective BBA, \n     not the dishonest ``cover'' substitutes offered by BBA \n     opponents.\n\n\n  key reasons why congress should not exempt social security from the \n                       balanced budget amendment\n\n       Exempting Social Security would render a Balanced Budget \n     Amendment meaningless and endanger Social Security. It would \n     give Congress an excuse to delay action on huge Social \n     Security deficits that will occur as today's younger workers \n     retire. Although the Social Security system currently \n     collects more in taxes than it spends on benefits, this will \n     change early in the next century and eliminate the \n     effectiveness of the balanced-budget rule. At that time, \n     other federal funds should be in a surplus position to \n     prevent large government budget deficits that would harm the \n     economy. But the Reid Amendment would only require a \n     balancing of non-Social Security receipts and outlays, \n     resulting in huge legal federal budget deficits at that time.\n       1. It would create a huge loophole in the Amendment and \n     encourage Congress to raid trust fund revenues.--A future \n     Congress that wished to circumvent the Amendment could, by a \n     simply majority vote, authorize deficits by reducing trust \n     fund taxes and revenues and increasing ``operating'' fund \n     taxes and revenues by an equal amount. Trust funds could pay \n     for Social Security benefits by \n     [[Page S3349]] running a deficit. This has the potential to \n     be more than a $300 billion loophole.\n       2. Congress could also create deficits by channeling other \n     programs aimed at aiding the elderly through the trust \n     funds.--Candidates include veterans' benefits and pensions, \n     which total over $20 billion a year. Supplemental Security \n     Income at over $25 billion a year is another likely \n     candidate, as is Medicare (over $110 billion) and the \n     approximately three-fourths of Medicaid spending (or over $65 \n     billion) that benefits the aged. A portion of funds spent on \n     the retired poor by the Food Stamp, low-income home energy \n     assistance, housing subsidy, and other social service \n     programs might be transferred to newly exempt trust funds. \n     Some or all of federal employee or military retirement \n     programs may also become part of Social Security.\n       3. It would legalize an ANNUAL total budget deficit of over \n     $2,000,000,000,000 ($2 trillion) in the year 2050!--Even if \n     the Social Security exemption was faithfully observed, it \n     would allow huge deficits in the Social Security trust funds \n     in the next century that will occur under current policies as \n     today's children retire.\n       4. Such loopholes could result in spending money from trust \n     funds for other programs.--A future Congress and president \n     that wished to circumvent the balanced-budget rule could do \n     so simply by funding non-Social Security programs from trust \n     fund accounts. There is nothing in the proposed exemption \n     that would prohibit spending money from trust funds for non-\n     retirement or non-disability programs. A simple majority of \n     Congress could thus effectively circumvent any debt limit.\n       5. It would endanger Social Security.--Net interest on the \n     national debt has grown from a mere 7.7 percent of federal \n     spending in 1978 to 14 percent in 1995. Not only will \n     interest begin to crowd out Social Security, but the \n     continued buildup of debt will impair the ability of future \n     taxpayers to refund moneys borrowed from the trust fund. Only \n     an all-inclusive Balanced Budget Amendment will force \n     Congress to balance the budget and create a sound environment \n     for the future of Social Security.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  IRET Congressional Advisory,\n\n                                                 February 8, 1995.\n\n      A Balanced Budget Amendment Must Not Exclude Social Security\n\n       A few Senators who voted for a balanced budget amendment \n     last year are saying they may oppose the amendment this year \n     unless a special exemption for Social Security is attached to \n     it. This may be a gambit to kill the amendment. Granting \n     Social Security special constitutional status is not morally \n     or economically justified, would greatly weaken the \n     amendment, and ironically would add new burdens to the Social \n     Security System in the long run.\n       The purpose of a balanced budget constitutional amendment \n     is to compel Congress and the President to balance the \n     federal budget. That means holding overall government \n     expenditures at or below total government revenues. It does \n     not mean holding some spending to no more than some \n     revenues--with exemptions for national defense or the highway \n     trust fund or medicaid or Social Security or any other \n     program that might have a legitimate national purpose or \n     powerful constituency.\n       Carving out Social Security benefits and taxes from the \n     budget calculations would leave an especially large hole \n     because Social Security benefits are the federal government's \n     largest expenditure and second largest tax. Social Security \n     benefits already exceed total national defense spending, \n     formerly the largest expenditure category, and are growing \n     much more rapidly; by the end of the decade federal payments \n     of Social Security benefits will be about 60 percent greater \n     than what the nation spends on national defense. On the tax \n     side, the Social Security payroll tax is exceeded in size \n     only by the individual income tax. Millions of individuals \n     owe more in Social Security taxes than they do in income \n     taxes. The employer share of the Social Security tax is, by \n     itself, a bigger revenue source than the corporate income \n     tax. A balanced budget amendment that leaves out Social \n     Security would be seriously incomplete on both the \n     expenditure and tax sides.\n       A Social Security exclusion would jeopardize passage of a \n     balanced budget amendment in two ways. First, the exclusion \n     would complicate the task of balancing the (redefined) budget \n     in the near term. The Social Security trust fund is running a \n     surplus for the time being. If Social Security were \n     artificially removed from budget calculations, the deficit \n     would suddenly appear bigger and reducing it to zero over the \n     next several years would require extra large spending cuts or \n     tax increases. That would make a balanced budget amendment \n     appear more painful, which could scare away some potential \n     supporters. Second, the version of the amendment with the \n     exclusion gives political cover to opponents of a balanced \n     budget amendment. Because a balanced budget amendment has \n     strong public support, resisting it openly is politically \n     risky. By putting forward the flawed version, which has no \n     chance of passing Congress, opponents can to claim to voters \n     that they back a balanced budget amendment even as they fight \n     versions that would be more acceptable and effective. That is \n     known as having your cake and eating it too.\n       In addition, as Senator Dole and others have cautioned, a \n     Social Security exemption would create a giant loophole in \n     the amendment. The contents of Social Security are defined by \n     statute and can be modified by statute. If Social Security \n     were excluded from the amendment while other spending were \n     not, Congress could shield other programs from tough budget \n     choices by passing statutes to shift them into Social \n     Security. Under the pressure of dodging a constitutional \n     amendment, some of the government programs that might be \n     reclassified as part of Social Security are unemployment \n     compensation, worker retraining, and spending on the earned \n     income tax credit. And because Congress is inventive, this is \n     just for starters.\n       At present, the Social Security trust fund is running a \n     surplus. That would allow many other programs to be shifted \n     into Social Security without busting its trust fund in the \n     short run. When the baby boom generation starts retiring, \n     however, Social Security will experience unsustainably large \n     deficits under present benefit formulas. That looming crisis \n     has nothing to do with a balanced budget amendment. It will \n     be caused by the expanding number of retirees and other \n     taxpayers. If the Social Security System has become a \n     repository for myriad government programs when the \n     demographic crunch arrives, the squeeze on the core program, \n     benefits for the elderly, will come sooner and be harsher \n     because of the extraneous spending that has become embedded \n     in the Social Security System and is also making demands on \n     its revenues.\n       Social Security projections under current budget formulas \n     point to an enormously adverse impact on the availability of \n     saving for private sector uses. Federal ``entitlements'', of \n     which Social Security is the largest, already preempt much \n     private saving, and, if nothing is done, entitlement spending \n     will before very long consume all private saving. The core \n     economic objective of a balanced budget amendment is to \n     prevent federal budget developments from commandeering \n     private saving. The Social Security System is projected to go \n     into deficit early in the next century and thereafter fall \n     deeper and deeper into debt, becoming the biggest federal \n     government consumer of private saving. It makes no sense to \n     enact a balanced budget amendment but allow Social Security \n     to escape balanced budget discipline. To protect private \n     saving from the inroads of federal deficits, a balanced \n     budget amendment must apply to all government programs, \n     including Social Security and other ``entitlements''.\n       A balanced budget amendment would force hard choices to be \n     made regarding federal spending programs. Some defenders of a \n     special exemption for Social Security assert that Social \n     Security deserves privileged treatment. Although Social \n     Security is politically popular (which in itself affords much \n     protection), it is not clear on economic or moral grounds why \n     Social Security should receive higher priority than other \n     federal spending. For instance, is paying Social Security \n     benefits a more noble or urgent federal government function \n     than providing for the national defense, enforcing federal \n     laws, or undertaking basic scientific research?\n       Treating Social Security benefits and taxes differently \n     from all other government outflows and inflows would have \n     some economic justification if Social Security were analogous \n     to private saving, but it is not. Unlike private saving, \n     Social Security payments are not voluntary choices reflecting \n     individuals' preferences. As with other taxes, people can \n     face fines and prison if they refuse to pay Social Security \n     taxes.\n       With private saving, the funds are invested productively \n     and the eventual payouts to savers come from the returns on \n     those investments. Whereas many advocates of the Social \n     Security program describe it as an efficient government-run \n     saving program, it is, in reality, the largest Ponzi scheme \n     in the history of the world. Social Security payroll taxes go \n     to the U.S. Treasury, and the Treasury, after issuing IOUs to \n     the Social Security trust fund, uses the taxes to help pay \n     the government's current bills. That is not real saving. It \n     is akin to a person earning income, writing himself a bunch \n     of IOUs, putting those IOUs in a piggy bank, and then \n     spending all the money. No matter how full of IOUs the piggy \n     bank becomes, it will not hold even a dime of saving. In \n     other words, the government no more directs Social Security \n     revenues into productive investments than it does other tax \n     revenues.\n       If a balanced budget amendment to the constitution is to be \n     meaningful in subjecting federal budget policy to financial \n     discipline, it must apply to all federal spending and \n     revenues. It should not exempt the largest spending item and \n     the second largest tax. The national issues the amendment \n     addresses are too important to fall victim to a parliamentary \n     ploy.\n                                              Michael S. Schuyler,\n     Senior Economist.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      Congressional Leaders United\n\n\n                                        for a Balanced Budget,\n\n                                                 January 24, 1995.\n\n Fact Sheet--How the Balanced Budget Amendment Protects Social Security\n\n\nThe BBA would put an end to the rapid growth in interest payments that \n             threaten to crowd out Social Security spending\n\n       Interest payments on the federal debt have nearly \n     quadrupled since 1980. Net interest payments in 1993 were \n     $200 billion and are expected to exceed $300 billion annually \n     by the \n     [[Page S3350]] end of the decade. Until we balance the \n     budget, spiralling interest payments will continue to crowd \n     out other spending, including Social Security.\n\n\n    balancing the budget would avert the threat of runaway inflation\n\n       No industrialized nation has reached the level of debt we \n     will face next century without monetizing the debt by \n     printing more dollars. Monetizing the debt would lead to \n     explosive inflation. Huge debt burdens contributed to ruinous \n     inflation in Germany in the 1920's and several Third World \n     nations in the 1980's. Runaway inflation would have a \n     particularly severe impact on senior citizens living on a \n     fixed income. It would not do any good to get a $1,000 \n     retirement check if bread costs $100 a loaf.\n\n\nthe bba would force congress to deal with deficits in time to prevent a \n    budget crisis forcing draconian cuts each year just to ``muddle \n                               through''\n\n       The General Accounting Office has warned that if the amount \n     of deficit reduction required just to limit the deficit to \n     three percent of GDP would increase exponentially by the year \n     2005. By the year 2020, Congress would be required to enact a \n     half a trillion dollars of additional deficit reduction each \n     year just to retrain the deficit to three percent of GDP. No \n     program--including Social Security--would be able to escape \n     deep spending cuts under this scenario.\n\n\n  balancing the budget would promote the economic growth necessary to \n                sustain the social security trust funds\n\n       GAO, CBO and most economists warn that continued growth in \n     deficit spending would\n      result in lower productivity and deteriorating living \n     standards. As real wages for taxpaying workers decline, \n     there will be increasing resistance to the taxes necessary \n     to meet the growing commitments of the Social Security \n     program. GAO found that balancing the budget by the year \n     2001 would lead to the higher productivity and growth in \n     real wages that would be necessary to support our \n     commitments to the growing elderly population.\n\n\n the amendment would help ensure that Congress takes action before the \n       Social Security trust funds begin running yearly deficits\n\n       Although the Social Security trust funds currently run a \n     surplus, within a generation, they will face cash shortfalls. \n     A balanced budget amendment would provide Congress and the \n     President with the necessary incentive to take corrective \n     action to deal with this threat and provide for the long-term \n     solvency of the trust funds.\n\n\nthe amendment preserves statutory provisions protecting Social Security\n       The current statutory protections for Social Security would \n     not be eliminated by the BBA. For example, under current law, \n     any legislation that would change the actuarial balance of \n     the social security trust funds are subject to a point of \n     order which requires a 3/5 vote to waive in the Senate. Under \n     the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act and the 1990 Budget \n     Enforcement Act, Social Security was completely protected \n     from all sequesters. Social Security is not subject to the \n     spending caps in the 1990 budget agreement. Given political \n     realities, Congress would be likely set budget priorities in \n     such a way that protections for Social Security are \n     maintained or even enhanced.\n\n\nExempting Social Security would open up a loophole in the BBA and tempt \nCongress to defund the trust funds, threatening retirement benefits and \n                       the trust fund surplusses\n\n       Exempting the Social Security trust funds from the \n     amendment would create a perverse incentive for Congress to \n     use them as a source to fund new or totally unrelated \n     programs, threatening the ability of the trust funds to \n     fulfill their current obligations to retirees. For example, \n     Congress could pay for current and new non-Social Security \n     spending by simply depositing FICA taxes into general \n     Treasury revenues, instead of into the trust funds. Congress \n     also could pass legislation to shift spending for Medicare, \n     other retirement programs, or any number of programs to the \n     Social Security trust funds to avoid a 3/5 vote to unbalance \n     the budget. Thus, non-Social Security outlays and receipts \n     could be ``balanced'' simply changing program definitions and \n     draining the Social Security trust funds.\n\n\n       The Constitution is not the place to set budget priorities\n\n       A constitutional amendment should be timeless and reflect a \n     broad consensus, not make narrow policy decisions. As noted \n     above, the financial status of Social Security will change \n     drastically, and perhaps quite unpredictably, in the next \n     century. We should not place technical language or overly \n     complicated mechanisms in the Constitution and undercut the \n     simplicity and universality of the amendment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      Congressional Leaders United\n\n\n                                        for a Balanced Budget,\n\n                                                 January 18, 1995.\n\nFact Sheet--A Balanced Budget Amendment Exemption Would Imperil Social \n                                Security\n\n\n A BBA exemption would threaten the reve- nues for the Social Security \n                               Trust Fund\n\n       Placing the OASDI/Social Security trust funds outside the \n     Amendment's deficit restrictions would provide a perverse \n     incentive for a future Congress to shift FICA (and related \n     income) taxes out of the trust funds. Portions of those taxes \n     could be transferred to general Treasury accounts to balance \n     the ``operating'' budget covered by the BBA, but at the cost \n     of gutting the OASDI trust funds. The current stable revenue \n     stream for Social Security could be critically diverted in \n     small steps which would add up to disaster for the system. A \n     precedent for this already exists: The income taxes on Social \n     Security benefits in the 1983 ``bailout'' go directly into \n     the trust funds, but higher income taxes imposed on Social \n     Security retirees in 1993 are diverted to general Treasury \n     revenues.\n\n\n  social security could easily be overwhelmed by non-social security \n programs moved to social security's ledger in an attempt to hide them \n                 behind the cloak of its exempt status\n\n       It's easy to predict well-meaning efforts to protect a \n     whole range of social programs by arguing they fall under the \n     general intent of Social Security to provide a safety net. \n     Contrary to the claims of those who want an exemption, \n     funding for current Social Security would not be set aside \n     for protection, but would be pilfered by reclassifying more \n     and more programs as Social Security. This is an even greater \n     threat than simply providing a loophole for deficit spending. \n     As other programs intrude on Social Security, its stability \n     will steadily erode.\n\n\na social security exemption defeats the intent of the BBA by providing \n                the greatest deficit loophole in history\n\n       As if the direct threat to Social Security isn't enough, \n     exempting it would create an enclave for additional federal \n     debt while at the same time, government could proudly \n     proclaim a ``balanced budget.'' Projects which risk being \n     assigned a low priority under the BBA could avoid facing \n     scrutiny and be paid for by draining the Trust Funds. The \n     Social Security deficit tomorrow could be bigger than the \n     total deficit today.\n\n\n                         the debt is the threat\n\n       The greatest threat to Social Security is the federal debt \n     itself. Gross interest payments on the debt already are \n     nipping at the heels of Social Security as the second largest \n     single item in the federal budget. Social Security is in no \n     way immune to the increasing pressure interest payments place \n     on every single federal spending item as the growing debt \n     forces ever larger debt service costs.\n\n\n  every current statutory protection for social security can continue \n                               under bba\n\n       Social Security is the best statutorily protected program \n     in the federal budget. Those laws are perfectly compatible \n     with a BBA and can remain in force, continuing to protect the \n     system. The BBA takes away the major threats to Social \n     Security so existing statutes can do their jobs. But if the \n     federal budget does not have the spending restraint imposed \n     on it by a Constitutional Amendment, we cannot guarantee that \n     the statutes which protect Social Security now can be \n     maintained.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      Congressional Leaders United\n\n\n                                        for a Balanced Budget,\n\n                                                 January 30, 1995.\n\nThe Balanced Budget Amendment--A Necessary and Appropriate Addition to \n                            the Constitution\n\n\n  the amendment corrects an institutional bias toward deficit spending\n\n       Representatives may know that chronic deficits threaten the \n     nation's long-term prosperity, but they also know that their \n     short-term interest lies in spending more on the demands of \n     various special interests. When faced from all sides with \n     demands for more spending and less taxes, Congresses and \n     Presidents have taken the easy way out by borrowing more \n     money. A Balanced Budget Amendment corrects this bias by \n     creating immediate political and economic consequences for \n     running a deficit.\n\n\n   the amendment protects rights deserving constitutional protection\n\n       The ability to borrow money from future generations is a \n     power of such magnitude that should not be left to the \n     judgments transient majorities. Thomas Jefferson favored a \n     Constitutional prohibition of federal indebtedness, fearing \n     that taxes on farmers, laborers, merchants and their families \n     would escalate forever to pay the interest on a growing debt. \n     The threat of economic and political harm from deficit \n     spending is the type of governmental abuse appropriately \n     proscribed by the Constitution.\n       Even Professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard, a leading \n     opponent of the amendment, told the Senate Budget Committee \n     in 1992 that ``The Jeffersonian notion that today's populace \n     should not be able to burden future generations with \n     excessive debt, does seem to be the kind of fundamental value \n     that is worthy of enshrinement in the Constitution. In a \n     sense, it represents a structure protection for the rights of \n     our children and grandchildren.''\n\n\n the amendment is consistent with the American principle of protecting \n  the interests of politically under-represented groups from majority \n                                 abuse\n\n       The Constitution has always served to protect unrepresented \n     minorities from the abuses of government. The framers of the \n     Constitution were extremely concerned that the rights of the \n     public would be trampled by the tyranny of the majority and \n     crafted a Constitution that balanced the protection of \n     minority rights against the principal of majority rule. \n     Senator Byrd made an eloquent \n     [[Page S3351]] statement on behalf of this principal during a \n     debate regarding the Senate filibuster, stating that ``There \n     have come times when the protection of minority is highly \n     beneficial to a nation. Many of the great causes in the \n     history of the world were at first only supported by a \n     minority. and it has been shown time and time again that the \n     minority can be right. So this is one of the things that's so \n     important to the liberties of the people.''\n       Living off a giant credit card and sending the bill to the \n     next generation is a form of taxation without representation \n     in a very real sense. Requiring a higher threshold of support \n     for deficit spending will protect the rights of future \n     generations who are not represented in our political system \n     but will bear the burden of our decisions today.\n       Requiring a higher threshold of support for deficit \n     spending will protect the rights of future generations who \n     are not represented in our political system but will bear the \n     burden of our decisions today. The ability to borrow money \n     from future generations is a power of such magnitude that it \n     should not be left to the judgments of transient majorities.\n       Thomas Jefferson agreed with BBA proponents that, ``The \n     question whether one generation has the right to bind another \n     by the deficit it imposes is a question of such consequence \n     as to place it among the fundamental principles of \n     government.'' With what does a constitution deal, if not with \n     ``the fundamental principles of government?''\n       The BBA is based on exactly the same principles as the rest \n     of the constitution.--It would protect the fundamental rights \n     of the people by restraining the federal government from \n     abusing its powers. Morally dubious things should be \n     difficult to do. That's the underlying principle for \n     requiring 3/5 votes in both Houses to approve deficit \n     spending.\n       Conclusion.--Thousands of pages and hundreds of hours of \n     committee testimony, floor debate, and committee reports have \n     answered every question and concern about the BBA. The only \n     reason left for voting against the BBA is if you believe that \n     it's all right to leave our children a legacy of excessive--\n     and growing--debt. The determination of BBA opponents shows \n     that they fear what BBA supporters have promised all along: \n     the amendment will work.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      Congressional Leaders United\n\n\n                                        for a Balanced Budget,\n\n                                                 January 30, 1995.\n\n Would the BBA ``End Majority Rule?'' No. It Would Protect Fundamental \n                                Rights.\n\n       A common criticism of the balanced budget amendment is that \n     it would ``end majority rule.'' Those who focus on the \n     difficulty of achieving a 3/5 majority to approve deficit \n     spending are missing the point about this amendment. They are \n     stuck in the status quo, revealing their reverence to an \n     outdated pattern of thought; that deficits are the norm. Or, \n     alternately they betray preferences FOR deficit spending. The \n     mind-set exposed is, what would we need to do under the BBA \n     to continue deficit spending?\n       Opponents of requiring super majorities to approve deficit \n     spending ignore one point, intentionally or otherwise: Under \n     a balanced budget amendment simple majorities will continue \n     to rule. The amendment does not affect the ability of a \n     majority to spend on programs it deems important and to set \n     budget priorities as it sees fit. Super majorities would come \n     into play only when deficit spending looms because the \n     majority abdicates its responsibility to produce a balanced \n     budget. They would serve as a deterrent to irresponsible \n     fiscal policy, while allowing necessary flexibility when a \n     consensus emerges to deal with a national emergency.\n       Some opponents of the amendment write as though super \n     majorities were a foreign concept to the framers of the \n     constitution. One of their explicit purposes outlined in the \n     Federalist Papers, was to put certain rights and powers \n     beyond the reach of the ``tyranny of the majority,'' and \n     protect current minorities and future majorities from abuse \n     by transient, coalescing ``factions.'' The BBA is very much \n     within that spirit.\n       Every right protected in the constitution is protected with \n     super majority requirements. That's what is necessary to \n     amend the explicit rights stated in the document.\n       Senator Byrd of West Virginia, a leading opponent of this \n     measure, might himself have made our point best when he said, \n     ``There have come times when the protection of a minority is \n     highly beneficial to a nation. Many of the great causes in \n     the history of the world were at first only supported by a \n     minority. And it has been shown time and time again that the \n     minority can be right. So this is one of the things that's so \n     important to the liberties of the people.''\n       The unfettered power to deficit spend carries with it the \n     temptation to exercise that power to the point of abuse. \n     Incurring huge debts on behalf of our children really is a \n     form of taxation without representation. Our children are a \n     minority whose economic interests demand to be represented \n     through the super majorities provided for in the balanced \n     budget amendment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington, DC]\n\n            Balanced Budget Amendment: Constitutional Issues\n\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation's largest business \n     federation, has endorsed S.J. Res. 1, the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Chamber believes that \n     this measure will help move the federal government toward \n     fiscal responsibility. This paper discusses the most \n     significant constitutional and legal questions raised by this \n     landmark legislation, along with some of the conclusions \n     reached by the U.S. Chamber.\n\n\n  Is a Balanced Budget requirement appropriate subject matter for the \n                             Constitution?\n\n       Some commentators have argued that a balanced budget \n     requirement is a mere rule of accounting, incompatible with \n     the broad principles embodied in the Constitution. It is \n     worth noting that the Constitution already contains several \n     narrowly-focused economic and fiscal provisions, including \n     the requirement of ``a regular statement and account of the \n     receipts and expenditures of all public money'' (Article I. \n     Section 9) and the requirement that ``duties, imposts and \n     excises . . . [be] uniform throughout the United States'' \n     (Article I, Section 8).\n       Moreover, the Balanced Budget Amendment embodies two \n     principle themes of the Constitution: limitation on federal \n     power, and protection of politically under-represented groups \n     against majoritarian abuse. Thomas Jefferson, who perceived \n     the inherent tendency of central government to expand, \n     supported a constitutional prohibition of federal borrowing \n     as a means of protecting individual liberty. For most of the \n     nation's history the growth of the federal government was \n     held in check by an implicit policy against deficits, except \n     during war or recession. In recent times, the erosion of this \n     principle has created persistent structural deficits, removed \n     the need to limit and prioritize programs, and led to an \n     excessively large federal sector. The BBA requirement that \n     federal operations be funded from current revenues restores \n     an important principle of fiscal responsibility and limited \n     government.\n       Likewise, the protection of groups with limited access to \n     the political process has emerged as a major theme of \n     Constitutional law.\\1\\ Limitations have been placed on \n     governmental actions which unfairly impact racial minorities, \n     aliens and other ``discreet and insular'' groups.\\2\\ Because \n     future generations who will bear much of the burden of \n     current policy lack input in to the electoral process, it may \n     be that their interests are undervalued in federal budget \n     decisions. The Balanced Budget Amendment seeks to ensure that \n     the vital interest of young and future Americans are \n     reflected in the decisions of Congress, embodying a principle \n     of fairness and political inclusion consistent with the best \n     provisions of the Constitution.\n can the deficit problem be solved short of amending the constitution?\n\n       Statutory attempts to impose fiscal discipline upon the \n     federal government have failed, largely because Congress was \n     able to change the rules in mid-game. The ambitious deficit \n     reduction targets of the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law were \n     repeatedly modified when they conflicted with Congress' \n     spending ambitious. Likewise, big-ticket items such as \n     unemployment compensation payments and disaster relief are \n     customarily designated as ``emergency'' spending, which \n     exempts them from spending caps. Between 1980 and 1990, each \n     year's actual spending exceeded the targets of that year's \n     budget resolution by an average of $30 billion (the excess \n     was $85 billion in 1990).\\3\\\n       Each statutory response to the deficit has shown the same \n     vulnerability: hard-won budget rules can be waived or \n     modified by a simple majority vote. Not surprisingly, a \n     majority can usually be assembled to support more spending. \n     The key advantage of a Constitutional amendment is that tough \n     budgetary rules can be placed beyond the reach of simple \n     Congressional majorities S.J. Res. 1 requires yearly \n     enactment of a balanced budget, unless Congress approves a \n     specific deficit for that fiscal year by a three-fifths vote \n     of each house. (A simple majority of each house can waive the \n     balanced budget requirement during a time of war.) The \n     supermajority requirement reflects the view that incurring a \n     deficit should be an exceptional event that requires clear \n     consensus. This legislation commits future Congresses to \n     avoid structural deficits, while providing them the \n     flexibility to respond to true emergencies.\n\n\n              is there any place for statutory solutions?\n\n       While the Balanced Budget Amendment mandates a zero deficit \n     by FY 2002 (or the second fiscal year after enactment), it \n     does not specify how to get there. The Chamber believes that \n     enactment of a BBA will force Congress to take a close look \n     at statutory mechanisms designed to reach that goal, and this \n     will probably begin well in advance of final ratification by \n     the states. In approving S.J. Res. 41, the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee contemplated enactment of ``legislation that will \n     better enable the Congress and the President to comply with \n     the language and intent of the amendment.''\\4\\ Additional \n     budget process reforms may include tax and spending \n     limitations, line-item veto authority, and the creation of an \n     independent commission to recommend spending cuts. The BBA \n     will thus lay the groundwork for further budget process \n     reforms at the statutory level.\n     Footnote at end of article.\n     [[Page S3352]] will congress and the president still have the \n            flexibility to respond to national emergencies?\n\n       S.J. Res. 1 does not prohibit Congress from running a \n     deficit in a given year; it merely requires that this \n     decision be approved by three fifths of each house. This \n     degree or consensus is required for many important decisions, \n     including the approval of a treaty, and override of a \n     Presidential veto. In the BBA, the three-fifths requirement \n     reflects the view that incurring a deficit should be an \n     exceptional event that is carefully scrutinized. At the same \n     time, this provision allows Congress and the President the \n     flexibility to respond to genuine emergencies. Should large-\n     scale domestic problems such as recessions or natural \n     disasters alter budget needs, it will be possible to assemble \n     a three-fifths consensus that recognizes this. In the case of \n     foreign\n      aggression, the balanced budget requirement can be suspended \n     by a simple majority vote of each house.\n\n\n  Will the amendment thrust the courts into an inappropriate role of \n                  cutting programs and raising taxes?\n\n       Some commentators have raised questions about the \n     enforcement of a Balanced Budget Amendment. A primary concern \n     is that Congressional efforts to meet the balanced budget \n     requirement would be challenged in the courts, and the \n     judiciary would be thrust into the role of weighing policy \n     demands, slashing programs and increasing taxes. On the other \n     hand, there is a legitimate and necessary role for the courts \n     in ensuring technical compliance with the amendment. The \n     Chamber believes that these concerns can be reconciled in \n     implementing legislation, which draws upon existing legal \n     principles.\n       In general, the courts have shown an unwillingness to \n     interject themselves into the fray of budgetary politics. The \n     New Jersey Supreme Court observed that ``it is a rare case . \n     . . in which the judiciary has any proper constitutional role \n     in making budget allocation decisions.''\\5\\ The judiciary has \n     remained clear of most budget controversies through doctrines \n     of ``nonjudiciability,'' including ``mootness,'' \n     ``standing,'' and the ``political question'' doctrine.\n       A case is considered moot and can be rejected by the court, \n     if the matter in controversy is no longer current (this will \n     be a factor in many budgetary controversies, such as those \n     based on unplanned expenditures or flawed revenue estimates \n     which become apparent near the end of the fiscal year). The \n     doctrine of standing limits judicial access to parties who \n     can show a direct injury over and above that incurred by the \n     general public. The logic is that the grievances of the \n     public (or substantial segments thereof) are the proper \n     domain of the legislature.\\6\\ The U.S. Supreme Court has held \n     that status as a taxpayer does not automatically confer \n     standing to challenge federal actions,\\7\\ and has barred \n     taxpayer challenges of budget and revenue policies in the \n     absence of special injuries to the plaintiffs.\\8\\ The \n     political question doctrine is a elated principle that the \n     courts should remain out of matters which the Constitution \n     has committed to another branch of government. The Supreme \n     Court has held that a ``political question'' exists when a \n     case would require ``nonjudicial discretion.''\\9\\ This would \n     be the case with many budgetary controversies, such as the \n     choice to cut particular programs, which by their nature \n     require ideological choices and the balancing of competing \n     needs.\n       In contrast, courts have asserted jurisdiction over \n     politically tinged controversies where they find \n     ``discoverable and manageable standards'' for resolving them. \n     In Baker v. Carr,\\10\\ the U.S. Supreme Court reasoned that \n     objective criteria guide judicial decisionmaking and limit \n     the opportunity for overreaching. In the balanced budget \n     context, the ``discoverable and manageable standards'' \n     principle can help demarcate lines between impermissible \n     judicial policymaking, and the needed enforcement of \n     accounting rules and budget procedures.\n       In all likelihood, a strong framework of accounting \n     guidelines will emerge from implementing legislation. The \n     Senate Judiciary Committee has interpreted Section 6 of the \n     bill to impose ``a positive obligation on the part of \n     Congress to enact appropriate legislation''\n      regarding this complex issue.\\11\\ Judiciary Committee staff \n     on both the House and Senate side have indicated their \n     intention that implementing legislation embrace stringent \n     accounting standards that will minimize the potential for \n     litigation. Should legitimate questions arise concerning \n     the methods by which Congress balances the budget, these \n     standards will also provide objective criteria which meet \n     constitutional standards for judicial intervention.\n       The implementing package is also likely to establish \n     guidelines for judicial involvement, defining what issues are \n     judiciable and which parties have standing to challenge \n     Congressional decisions. State budget officers, for example, \n     could be given standing to contest unfunded federal mandates. \n     The enforcement procedures, coupled with budget process and \n     accounting guidelines, will operate against a backdrop of \n     traditional legal principles to rationally limit judicial \n     action. The effect should be to prevent judicial overreaching \n     into legislative functions, while providing a check on \n     Congressional attempts to evade the requirements of the BBA \n     through procedural and numerical gimmickry.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\See John Hart Ely, ``Toward A Representation-Reinforcing \n     Mode of Judicial Review,'' 37 Md.

Res. 1, the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The Chamber believes that \n     this measure will help move the federal government toward \n     fiscal responsibility. This paper discusses the most \n     significant economic questions raised by this landmark \n     legislation along with some of the conclusions reached by the \n     U.S. Chamber.\n       Q. Why should we balance the federal budget?\n       A. There are several reasons why the federal budget should \n     be balanced. Most fundamentally, the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment would improve accountability in federal spending \n     decisions. Government officials are generally inclined to \n     increase government spending to improve services to their \n     constituents. This, of course, is countered by their \n     reluctance to raise taxes. But since borrowing can substitute \n     for raising taxes, legislators find they can offer high level \n     of services without the pain of raising the current level of \n     taxes. Consequently, when it's time to make tough spending \n     decisions, Congress finds it can dodge the question by just \n     borrowing the difference. The proper counterweight to higher \n     government spending--raising taxes--is circumvented by the \n     seemingly painless act of federal borrowing. This leaves us \n     with more government than taxpayers are willing to pay for. \n     Over time, such borrowing leaves us with a bloated government \n     sector and the problem of paying off the debt.\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment restores the proper balance \n     between spending and taxes, and forces government officials \n     to prioritize difficult spending choices. It improves the \n     process whereby such decisions are made, forcing Congress to \n     use much greater discipline.\n       Also, no matter whether the government finances its \n     spending through taxes or borrowing, its still spending and \n     therefore commanding economic resources. To those who believe \n     in limited government and market systems, the level of \n     federal spending is as much of a concern as how the amount is \n     financed. Limiting government borrowing blocks the path of \n     least resistance to government expansion, and so we expect \n     that a Balanced Budget Amendment would act to limit the reach \n     of government into the economy.\n       Q. Wouldn't Congress just raise taxes to close the deficit?\n       A. In a way. Congress already has. After all, the \n     difference between Government borrowing and raising taxes is \n     just a question of taxes today or taxes tomorrow. The \n     important point is that, no matter how it's financed, the \n     government is spending economic resources, and the amount of \n     spending will surely be greater when government is allowed to \n     use deficit spending.\n       And tax increases to close the deficit gap are being used \n     now anyway--witness the tax increases in 1982, 1983, 1984, \n     1985, 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1993. In other words, we're \n     already getting the tax increases. By requiring a balanced \n     budget, we expect to place additional pressure on Congress to \n     tackle the spending cuts that should be made.\n       To answer the question more directly. Congress can't just \n     raise taxes, leave spending intact, and walk away--if it \n     could, it would have done so a decade ago and spared us this \n     long debate on deficit spending. So while it may raise some \n     taxes to close the deficit, Congress will have to confront \n     its voracious spending habit. The end result will be a lower \n     level of government spending, and less government involvement \n     in the economy.\n       In addition, a couple of provisions in the BBA make it more \n     difficult to raise taxes. Under the amendment, tax increases \n     require both a roll call vote (instead of anonymous voice \n     votes) and a constitutional majority (which means 51 votes \n     would be required in the Senate and 218 votes in the House to \n     raise taxes, instead of a majority of those voting). This may \n     not sound like much of a hurdle, but note that President \n     Clinton's 1993 tax increase would have needed an additional \n     two Senate votes under such a requirement. Instead, it passed \n     after Vice President Gore's vote broke a 49-49 deadlock.\n       Finally, of course, congressmen and women would have to \n     face the political consequences of raising taxes at the \n     voting booth. Because a roll call vote would identify those \n     who voted to raise taxes, legislators would be held to a \n     higher level of accountability.\n       Q. What is the primary economic impact of running \n     government deficits?\n       A. The worst thing about government deficit spending is \n     that it distorts the economy's \n     [[Page S3353]] balance between saving and investment, \n     producing adverse long-term productivity growth. The funds \n     the government is borrowing have to come from somewhere, and \n     generally they come from private saving and private \n     investment. Throughout the 1980's and early 1990's, we've \n     seen the saving rate fall from about 8% to consistently below \n     4%--too low to fuel the kind of investment we need to keep up \n     our high productivity. Since long-term productivity growth is \n     the key to rising standards of living, it's dangerous to be \n     skimping on investment.\n       Federal borrowing is not inherently wrong or bad for the \n     economy; it depends on how the funds are used. If the funds \n     were being used exclusively to create stronger schools, \n     better highways, safer bridges, and so forth, we would be \n     increasing the productive capacity of the economy. This\n      means that we would be creating the means by which future \n     generations can create the wealth to pay back the borrowed \n     funds. But if we're using those funds to provide ourselves \n     with consumption-oriented short-term benefits that don't \n     improve our long-term productive capacity, then we're \n     raising our standard of living by lowering that of future \n     generations. To quote NationsBank economist Mickey Levy: \n     ``Deficits matter most because they distort the way \n     current national resources are allocated, generally \n     favoring current consumption at the expense of private \n     investment.''\\1\\\n     \\1\\Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Q. Are there other effects of deficit spending that harm \n     the economy?\n       A. In a complex, interlocking, international economy, you \n     can expect sustained deficit spending to cause other \n     distortions as well. First, chronic government borrowing \n     tends to put upward pressure on interest rates. Businesses \n     seeking to raise capital and households applying for \n     mortgages have to compete with the federal government in \n     securing loanable funds. This increase in demand pushes \n     interest rates up. Consequently, fewer loans are made to the \n     private sector, and those that are made carry a higher \n     interest rate. This is known as ``crowding out,'' since \n     government borrowing displaces some private borrowing.\n       Second, because our economy is increasingly linked to the \n     global market, there are important international impacts \n     related to the budget deficit.\\2\\ Higher interest rates tend \n     to raise the foreign exchange value of the dollar, meaning \n     that our trading partners face price increases on the goods \n     and services they buy from the U.S. This lowers our exports, \n     pushing up our trade deficit. Many contend that one of the \n     major forces behind the huge trade deficits of the 1980s was \n     the federal budget deficit.\n       Third, the amount we're paying to service our national debt \n     has grown almost fivefold since 1979--from $43 billion to \n     $203 billion in 1994. As a share of total government outlays, \n     interest payments on the debt have about doubled from 7.4% \n     during the 1970s to over 14% currently. That means that for \n     the same amount of revenue, there's less money for other \n     government programs, whether it's for national defense, our \n     court system, Head Start, or environmental clean-up. No \n     matter what the budget priorities are, fewer funds are \n     available.\n       To sum up, there are serious economic side-effects of \n     deficit spending that Washington tends to ignore. In addition \n     to restoring discipline to the spending decisions of \n     Congress, the Balanced Budget Amendment seeks to remove the \n     economic distortion caused by chronic deficit spending.\n       Q. Back to that notion of ``crowding out'' for a moment. If \n     increased government borrowing leads to higher interest \n     rates, as you claim, then why did interest rates fall during \n     the 1980s just as the budget deficit was expanding?\n       A. The key to this apparent paradox is the behavior of \n     inflation during the 1980s. After starting out the decade in \n     the double-digits, the inflation rate fell sharply due to \n     tighter monetary policy and, in mid-decade, the collapse of \n     oil prices. Since expectations of future inflation are \n     embedded in\n      market interest rates this decline in inflation pushed \n     interest rates down. This more than offset the impact of \n     increasing federal deficits which were working at the same \n     time to push interest rates up.\n       So while it's true that market interest rates fell \n     significantly during the 1980's it's correct to say that they \n     would have fallen even further had the federal budget been \n     brought into balance. In fact later in this document we'll \n     present results from an econometric study that show \n     significally lower interest rates as a result of moving to a \n     balanced budget.\n       Q. Doesn't government spending represent an investment in \n     the economy, with highway and transportation construction, \n     funds going to education, etc?\n       A. Some government spending can be regarded as ``investment \n     spending,'' meaning that funds spend now will generate \n     stronger economic growth later. Spending on infrastrucutre--\n     highways, bridges, dams, and mass transit, for example--and \n     other programs such as education are often thought of that \n     way, since they provide benefits over a long period of time. \n     But the bulk of government spending goes to projects and \n     programs that don't provide much of a return over time, but \n     instead represent ``current spending.'' Such programs include \n     Social Security, Medicare, federal retirement programs, \n     unemployment insurance, agricultural extension offices, and \n     so forth. While many of these programs are desirable, we need \n     to recognize that we're borrowing vast sums to pay for \n     benefits that are only short-lived. If this generation \n     believes that the current level of spending on entitlements \n     such as Social Security is appropriate, that's fine, but the \n     funding should therefore come from the current generation, \n     not the next.\n       Because an extra dollar of private investment is generally \n     more efficient that an extra dollar of government investment, \n     our productive capacity generally grows less when funds are \n     diverted away from the private sector. This means that \n     productivity and wage growth will be held back, lowering our \n     standard of living.\n       Q. Why a Balanced Budget Amendment now? After all, we've \n     gotten along without it for 200 years.\n       A. Until about 1960 or so, running a balanced over time was \n     almost an unwritten Constitutional amendment. The U.S. \n     government ran deficits during the War of 1812, the severe \n     recession of 1837-43, the Civil War, and the Spanish American \n     War, to name a few episodes. But in other periods, the \n     federal government ran surpluses to reduce its outstanding \n     debt. On the whole, only emergencies justified running a \n     deficit.\n       But since 1960, this informal rule apparently has gone by \n     the wayside. In the past 34 years, the U.S. has avoided a \n     deficit only once, when in 1969 there was a surplus of $3 \n     billion. Given the chronic deficits we've come to expect, its \n     time to make explicit through a Constitutional amendment the \n     old implicit principle of government living within its means.\n       Q. Will passing a Balanced Budget Amendment really add \n     discipline to the federal government?\n       A. Lawmakers have tried statutory measure to rein in \n     government deficit spending, but they just haven't worked. \n     For example, in 1985 Congress passed the Gramm-Rudman-\n     Hollings deficit reduction bill, which was supposed to reduce \n     the deficit to zero by fiscal year 1991 from the $293 billion \n     deficit projected at the time for fiscal year 1991.\\3\\ As it \n     turned out, even with passage of GRH, we ended up with a $196 \n     billion deficit in 1991 and a $289 billion deficit in 1992. \n     That's because hard-won budget rules can be waived or \n     modified by a simple majority vote. The Balanced Budget \n     Amendment, on the other hand, requires a three-fifths vote of \n     each house to enact a budget with a deficit (in times of war, \n     only a simply majority is required).\n       It's clear that these statutory measures haven't worked, \n     and so it's time to turn to the stronger medicine of a \n     balanced budget amendment.\n       Q. Didn't we move to balancing the budget with the passage \n     in August 1993 of President Clinton's budget package, the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation (OBRA)?\n       A. Washington made some progress in trimming the deficit in \n     1993 when it passed OBRA. The nonpartisan Congressional \n     Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA will cut \n     $433 billion of debt over the next five years from the \n     projected baseline (i.e., pre-OBRA) level of debt.\\4\\ But not \n     only is the post-OBRA deficit still at $222 billion in FY \n     1998 (CBO January 1995 estimate), but it's also on the rise. \n     By 2005, according to CBO, the deficit is projected to hit \n     $421 billion. As a percentage of total output, that means the \n     deficit rises from 2.7% of GDP in FY 1998 to 3.6% in FY \n     2004.\\5\\\n       Like the budget deals in the previous decade before it, \n     OBRA clearly does not solve the deficit problem. That's why \n     it's imperative to turn to a constitutional, rather than a \n     statutory, remedy for our chronic deficit problem.\n       Q. What's the relationship between the federal deficit and \n     federal debt?\n       A. The federal deficit is the difference between the \n     government's outlays and receipts in any one year, while \n     federal debt is the total amount of government debt \n     outstanding. The debt, in other words, is the total \n     accumulation of deficits over the years. In 1994, the federal \n     deficit was $203 billion, and the total federal debt by year-\n     end was $4.64 trillion.\\6\\\n       Q. A federal debt of $4.6 trillion sounds like a lot, but \n     is it historically high?\n       A. In absolute terms, it's the highest it's ever been. But \n     because of inflation and the growth of our economy, it's best \n     to answer this question by measuring the federal debt \n     relative to the size of the economy; that is, to look at the \n     ratio of debt to GDP. Today, the total debt held by the \n     public is 52% of current GDP.\\7\\ While that's less than half \n     of 1946's 114% of GDP, we don't have as much to show for it. \n     The debt then paid for victory in World War II, while the \n     current debt is simply\n      funding higher levels of consumption.\n       Moreover, this ratio is currently moving in the wrong \n     direction. It's grown from below 30% during the 1970s to just \n     over 40% during the mid-1980s, and now to over 50%. In \n     contrast, the federal debt ratio in the postwar period was \n     pruned from 114% to 68% by 1951, and generally kept falling \n     until the early 1970s.\n       Q. So the federal debt's higher, and it's been growing for \n     twenty years. But while some continue to feel economic \n     discomfort from structural changes unrelated to the higher \n     federal debt (such as the defense build-down and the \n     commercial real estate overhang), the U.S. seems to be doing \n     fine. What's the crisis?\n       A. The growing federal debt is not a problem that can be \n     characterized as ``a wolf at the door,'' which requires \n     immediate attention. Instead, to use the analogy introduced \n     by President Carter's top economist, Charles \n     [[Page S3354]] Schultze, it's a ``colony of termites in the \n     wall.''\\8\\ In other words, it's a serious long-term problem \n     that can be ignored in the short-term. The damage--lower \n     investment, lower productivity, slower wage growth, etc.--may \n     be hard to perceive or even hidden by other economic forces, \n     but that doesn't mean it's not occurring. The termites are \n     still chomping away and must still be dealt with, because the \n     destruction can be massive.\n       Q. Won't the Balanced Budget Amendment hamper government \n     activity in times of a national emergency, such as a war?\n       A. The Amendment will not compromise America's ability to \n     respond to national emergencies. In general, the Amendment \n     can be suspended for a specific fiscal year whenever three-\n     fifths of both Houses of Congress vote to do so. In wartime, \n     this requirement is lowered to a simple majority.\n       Q. Won't balancing the budget cause a serious disruption of \n     economic growth?\n       A. If the deficit were reduced all at once--from FY 1995's \n     projected $162 billion to zero next year, for example--there \n     indeed would be a severe disruption. Because the removal of \n     so much fiscal stimulus in one year is not advisable, the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment calls for the provision to become \n     law in FY 1999 or two years after the ratification by three-\n     quarters of the states, whichever is later. The Amendment \n     does not provide a specific path for deficit reduction in the \n     meantime, but Congress would have five years to implement the \n     needed changes.\n       While we should expect some disruption--balancing the \n     budget is not, in the short-term, an economic growth policy--\n     we will see several long-term benefits after the budget is \n     balanced. And the short-term distress can be mitigated, \n     according to economic simulations performed in a 1992 study \n     conducted by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a nonpartisan \n     and highly regarded macroeconomic consulting firm based in \n     St. Louis, Missouri. If we had started in 1993 and balanced \n     the budget by 1998, using Federal Reserve policy to cushion \n     the economy, the LHM model shows that total output would be \n     between 1% to 1.6% higher in 2003.\\9\\ Even\n      1% additional output means an economy that's $80 billion \n     larger (measured in today's dollars).\n       Q. Does it make any difference whether Congress balances \n     the budget using tax increases or spending cuts?\n       A. It makes a big difference. In the study cited above, \n     LHM found that the highest gains from deficit reduction \n     come from expenditure cuts. That is because increases in \n     taxes create disincentives for labor and investment, \n     mitigating some of the beneficial effects of deficit \n     reduction on interest rates.\n       In the following table we report the results of two policy \n     simulations conducted by LHM in which the budget is \n     balanced, and compare it to the baseline case where policy is \n     left as is.\n       The first column shows where the economy would be if no \n     action were taken.\n       The second column shows where the economy would be if \n     expenditures were cut by the entire amount necessary to \n     balance the budget (``All Spending'').\n       The final column shows the results of balancing the budget \n     by raising spending and cutting expenditures by exactly the \n     same amount (``Mix'').\n       The two balanced budget scenarios assume that the Federal \n     Reserve eases monetary policy enough to maintain the \n     unemployment rate at the baseline level of 5.2%. The \n     following table compares how the economy would look with and \n     without deficit reduction by showing some of the results for \n     the first five years.\n\n                                   THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF BALANCING THE BUDGET                                  \n                                    [The First 5 Years of Deficit Reduction]                                    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                    No deficit      Deficit reduction scenarios \n                                                                     reduction   -------------------------------\n                                                                 ----------------                               \n                                                                     Baseline      All spending         Mix     \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLevels in the fifth year:                                                                                       \n    Federal deficit ($ bill)....................................      -251               0              -1      \n    3-month T-bill rate (percent)...............................         5.5             4.7             4.6    \n    30-year Government bond yield (percent).....................         6.9             5.7             5.8    \n    AAA corporate bond yield (percent)..........................         7.1             5.8             5.9    \nAverage annual growth, first 5 years (percent):                                                                 \n    Real GDP....................................................         2.6             2.8             2.7    \n    Inflation...................................................         3.3             3.5             3.4    \n    Real personal disposable income.............................         2.3             1.7             1.5    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Notice how interest rates are significantly lower in the \n     scenarios where the deficit has been reduced. This is the \n     fuel for the higher level of business investment. In fact, \n     the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's plant and \n     equipment (what economists call the real capital stock) is 2% \n     higher after the first five years of deficit reduction, and \n     6% higher after ten years, when comparing the result of the \n     ``All Spending'' scenario to the baseline. While those \n     figures may sound small, they mean $120 billion worth of \n     additional computers and manufacturing plants within five \n     years, and $390 billion more in ten years. And it should be \n     noted that the capital stock is almost 2% higher when the \n     budget is balanced entirely through spending cuts rather than \n     an equal mix of spending cuts and tax increases.\n       While inflation is a bit higher in the deficit-reduction \n     scenarios (due to the Federal Reserve's cushioning), growth \n     in real GDP (inflation-adjusted output) is stronger, on \n     average, in the five-year period, as the deficit is reduced. \n     Real personal disposable income grows at a slower rate (1.7% \n     and 1.5% versus 2.3%) in the cases where the deficit is \n     lowered. But note that it's stronger in the case where all of \n     the deficit reduction comes from reductions in government \n     spending. This shows that moving to a balanced budget will \n     inflict some economic pain. The short-term pain is \n     unavoidable, but it helps set the stage for stronger growth \n     in the years after the deficit has been balanced.\n       Of course, the active participation of Federal Reserve is \n     an important component of LHM's simulations, and it comes \n     with the price tag of slightly higher inflation. But the \n     important point is that the model suggests a path that the \n     economy can follow to get to a balanced budget without severe \n     economic hardship.\n       Another factor that would help the transition that's hard \n     to model is the boost to consumer and business confidence we \n     would expect to find once a credible balanced-budget plan \n     were enacted. Business investment should be higher, and the \n     return of resources from the public to the private sector as \n     government spending cuts are carried out should improve \n     overall productivity in the economy.\n       Q. Most of the states have some sort of balanced budget \n     requirement. What has been their experience?\n       A. According to the National Association of State Budget \n     Officers, the application of the state experience to the \n     Federal experience is not clear-cut. The state balanced \n     budget requirements are diverse and written so generally that \n     they're subject to varying interpretations. According to \n     their 1992 statement, the tradition of balanced budgets, \n     rather than the enforcement provisions or the threat of lower \n     bond ratings, plays the most important role in developing \n     balanced budgets.\\10\\\n                               Footnotes\n\n     \\1\\Mickey D.

A primary concern is that Congressional efforts \n     to meet the balanced budget requirement would be challenged \n     in the courts, and the judiciary would be thrust into a non-\n     judicial role of weighing policy demands, slashing programs \n     and increasing taxes.\n       On the other hand, there is a legitimate and necessary role \n     for the courts in ensuring compliance with the amendment. \n     Congress could potentially circumvent balanced budget \n     requirements through unrealistic revenue estimates, emergency \n     designations, off-budget accounts, unfunded mandates, and \n     other gimmickry. Certainly, the track record of the \n     institution under the spending targets of Gramm-Rudman-\n     Hollings and other statutory provisions is no cause for \n     optimism.\n       It is our view that the need to proscribe judicial \n     policymaking can be reconciled with a \n     [[Page S3355]] constructive role for the courts in \n     maintaining the integrity of the balanced budget requirement. \n     Congress is expected to address technical issues such as \n     accounting standards, budget procedures and judicial \n     enforcement in followup implementing legislation. By drawing \n     on the existing legal principles of ``mootness,'' \n     ``standing'' and ``nonjudiciability,'' implementing \n     legislation can define an appropriate role for the courts in \n     making the amendment work. The net effect can be to prevent \n     judicial assumption of legislative functions such as \n     selecting program cuts, while allowing the courts to police a \n     framework of accounting standards and budget procedures.\n\n\n              traditional limits on judicial intervention\n\n       In general, the courts have shown an unwillingness to \n     interject themselves into the fray of budgetary politics. The \n     New Jersey Superior Court observed that ``it is a rare case * \n     * * in which the judiciary has any proper constitutional role \n     in making budget allocation decisions.''\\1\\ The judiciary has \n     remained clear of most budget controversies through the \n     principles of ``mootness'' and ``standing,'' as well as the \n     ``political question'' doctrine.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       A case is considered moot, and can be rejected by the \n     court, if the matter in controversy is no longer current. In \n     Bishop v. Governor, 281 Md. 521 (1977), taxpayers and \n     Maryland legislators claimed that the governor's proposed \n     budget violated the state's balanced budget law, because $95 \n     million was contingent upon enactment of separate federal and \n     state legislation. The Maryland Court of Appeals dismissed \n     the case as moot because by that time the separate \n     legislation had been\n      approved, and the relevant fiscal year had elapsed. Mootness \n     will be a factor in many potential challenges to \n     Congressional action under a federal Balanced Budget \n     Amendment, particularly those based on unplanned \n     expenditures or flawed revenue estimates which become \n     apparent near the end of the fiscal year.\n       The doctrine of standing limits judicial access to parties \n     who can shoe a direct injury over and above that incurred by \n     the general public. The logic is that the grievances of the \n     public (or substantial segments thereof) are the proper \n     domain of the legislature.\\2\\ The U.S. Supreme Court has \n     generally held that status as a taxpayer does not confer \n     standing to a challenge federal actions\\3\\, and has barred \n     taxpayer challenges of budget and revenue policies in the \n     absence of special injuries to the plaintiffs.\\4\\ A state \n     cannot sue the federal government on behalf of its \n     citizens,\\5\\ and it is doubtful that Members of Congress have \n     standing to challenge federal actions in court.\\6\\\n       The political question doctrine is a related principle that \n     the courts should remain out of such matters which the \n     Constitution has committed to another branch of government. \n     The U.S. Supreme Court has held that a ``political question'' \n     exists when a case would require ``nonjudicial \n     discretion.''\\7\\ This would be the case with many budgetary \n     controversies, such as the choice to cur particular programs, \n     which by their nature require ideological choices and the \n     balancing of competing needs. In theory, at least, Congress \n     brings to this task a ``full knowledge of political, social \n     and economic conditions. * * *,'' as well as the legitimacy \n     of elected representation.\\8\\ The New Jersey Supreme Court \n     recognized this in a case where local governments challenged \n     funding decisions made by the governor and legislature, \n     holding that the allocation of state funds among competing \n     constituent groups was a political question, to be decided by \n     the legislature and not the judiciary.\\9\\ The Michigan \n     Supreme Court has likewise held that program cutting \n     decisions are a non-judicial function.\\10\\\n\n\n                         a role for the courts\n\n       The courts have asserted jurisdiction over politically \n     tinged controversies where they find ``discoverable and \n     manageable standards'' for resolving them. In Baker v. Carr, \n     the U.S. Supreme Court reasoned that objective criteria guide \n     judicial decisionmaking and limit the opportunity for \n     overreaching. In the balanced budget context, the \n     ``discoverable and manageable standards'' principle can help \n     demarcate lines between impermissible judicial policymaking, \n     and the needed enforcement of accounting rules and budget \n     procedures.\n       In all likelihood, a strong framework of accounting \n     guidelines will emerge from implementing legislation. The \n     Senate Judiciary Committee has interpreted Section 6 of the \n     bill to impose ``a positive obligation on the part of \n     Congress to enact appropriate legislation'' regarding this \n     complex issue.\\11\\ Judiciary Committee staff on both the \n     House and Senate side have indicated their intention that \n     implementing legislation embrace stringent accounting \n     standards that will minimize the potential for litigation. \n     Should legitimate questions arise concerning the methods by \n     which Congress ``balances'' the budget, these standards will \n     also provide objective criteria which meet constitutional \n     standards for judicial intervention.\n       The implementing package is also likely to establish \n     guidelines for judicial involvement, defining what issues are \n     judiciable and which parties have standing to challenge \n     Congressional decisions. Where Congress has defined standing \n     within the relevant statute, the courts have generally \n     deferred to this request for judicial input, and entertained \n     suitable cases.\\12\\ This approach has the advantage of \n     defining appropriate controversies and plaintiffs more \n     precisely. In the Balanced Budget context, the right to raise \n     particular arguments could be delegated to specific public \n     officials. State budget officers, for example, could be given \n     standing to contest unfunded federal mandates.\n       We are satisfied that such enforcement procedures, coupled \n     with budget process and accounting guidelines, will operate \n     against a backdrop of traditional legal principles to \n     rationally limit judicial action. The effect should be to \n     prevent overreaching into legislative functions, while \n     providing a check on Congressional attempts to evade the \n     requirements of the BBA through procedural and numerical \n     gimmickry.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\Board of Education f.

When small firms can't afford to \n     expand and buy equipment, fewer jobs are created and less \n     revenue is sent to the Treasury.''\n       The 1994 deficit hit $223 billion, Faris said, pointing out \n     that the public debt, the accumulation of each year's \n     deficit, reached $4.7 trillion.\n       ``It's inconceivable that a business could spend or borrow \n     as irresponsibly as the federal government has,'' Faris said. \n     ``A small firm has to live within a budget. If owners spent \n     and borrowed money like the federal government, they'd be out \n     of business in a heartbeat.''\n       The NFIB Education Foundation, the organization's research \n     arm, found that federal taxes and frequent tax law changes \n     rank among the top problems of entrepreneurs.\n       [[Page S3356]] ``Small-business owners voted in November in \n     greater numbers than ever before to elect lawmakers who \n     wouldn't conduct `business as usual,' Faris said. ``and a \n     balanced-budget amendment would be a major step toward \n     controlling the size of the federal government.''\n       NFIB represents more than 600,000 small and independent \n     firms.

In a letter that outlines its \n     legislative agenda for 1995, FEI urged its 14,000 members to \n     support such ``Contract'' initiatives as deficit reduction, \n     product-liability reform, regulatory reform, and capital-\n     gains reform.\n       ``For years we've been urging Congress to put a lid on \n     spending and manage the taxpayers' money more wisely,'' says \n     P.

It's a good start.''\n       Heading FEI's agenda of ten key issues is passage of the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment, which would prohibit federal \n     outlays from exceeding total receipts. If the amendment \n     passes, it will require a three-fifths majority in both \n     houses of Congress for the federal government to incur a \n     deficit. Despite strong Republican support, passage of the \n     Amendment is not certain; passage will require a two-thirds \n     majority in each house.\n       Other FEI ``top ten'' initiatives include:\n       Line-Item Veto--give the president the authority to strike \n     any appropriation or specific tax provision from proposed \n     legislation;\n       Product-Liability Reform--create uniform product-liability \n     laws, covering state and federal actions;\n       Securities-Litigation Reform--limit the growth of lawsuits \n     filed by class-action attorneys on behalf of shareholders \n     whose stock prices have shown unusual market performance and \n     make losing litigants responsible for winners' costs;\n       Tax Reform--allow individuals to exclude 50 percent of \n     capital-gains income from taxes and reduce the corporate \n     capital-gains tax to 17.5 percent. Also, explore alternatives \n     to the current tax system, such as a flat rate with higher \n     exemptions or replacing both corporate and individual taxes \n     with value-added and/or personal-consumption taxes;\n       Regulatory Reform--eliminate regulations that stifle \n     business initiative and competitiveness; also reduce \n     paperwork and require federal agencies to calculate the costs \n     and benefits of compliance;\n       Federal Financial Management Reform--strengthen the Chief \n     Financial Officers Act, the goal of which is to get the \n     government's fiscal house in order;\n       Entitlement Reform--resolve the long-term imbalance between \n     the government's entitlement promises and its ability to pay \n     for them and ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security \n     and Medicare;\n       Health-care Reform--develop broad national agreement on a \n     specific health-care reform initiative rather than leave the \n     solution to the individual states, which could lead to \n     multiple state rules and an onerous administrative burden for \n     companies with multi-state operations;\n       Procurement Reform--Pass and implement the Federal \n     Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, which is expected to \n     save taxpayers $12.3 billion over the next 5 years by \n     reducing cumbersome regulatory burdens and needless \n     bureaucracy in the government's acquisition of products and \n     services from the private sector.\n       Financial Executives Institute, the leading advocate for \n     the views of corporate financial management, is a \n     professional association of 14,000 senior financial \n     executives from nearly 8,000 major corporations throughout \n     the United States and Canada.\n                                                                    ____\n\n[News release from Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc., Rosslyn, \n                         VA, February 9, 1995]\n\n                 ABC Supports Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n       Passage of the Balanced Budget Amendment (S.J.

The prospect of having to \n     move toward balanced budgets in the near future would have an \n     immediate positive impact on the budget process and would \n     provide a Constitutional gurantee that we will adhere to a \n     deficit reduction plan, he said.\n       ``Deficit spending should no longer be a way of life for \n     the federal government. Every American family must live \n     within its means and balance its budget.

Such an exemption would put \n     Social Security at risk by creating an incentive to link \n     other programs to the entitlement program to exempt them from \n     deficit calculations. ``The best protection for Social \n     Security is a balanced budget,'' he said.\n       Associated Builders and Contractors is a national \n     association representing more than 17,000 construction and \n     construction-related companies located in 80 chapters \n     throughout the country.\n                                                                    ____\n\n     NAW Calls on the Senate to Pass the Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n       Washington, DC February 9, 1995.--The National Association \n     of Wholesaler-Distributors (NAW) today called on the United \n     States Senate to pass S.J.

Norquist)\n\n       Americans for Tax Reform, the national clearinghouse for \n     the grassroots taxpayers movement, strongly supports the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n       In addition, as the organization which opposes all tax \n     increases as a matter of principle, we are delighted to \n     support the Constitutional amendment requiring a 60% \n     supermajority to raise taxes, to be voted in the House of \n     Representatives on April 15, 1996. We are grateful for the \n     leadership of freshman Representatives John Shadegg (R-AZ) \n     and Linda Smith (R-WA) on this issue. In addition, we are \n     pleased to see the supermajority as a likely initiative issue \n     in several new states next year. Voters will choose the next \n     President of the United States in November, 1996 as they vote \n     on these initiatives.\n       Tax increases are not the solution to reducing the budget \n     deficit: they merely feed politicians' appetite for increased \n     federal spending. However, politicians use the federal \n     deficit as a bogus rallying cry for the supposed need to \n     raise taxes. That is why a balanced budget requirement and a \n     supermajority requirement are necessary to keep taxes down \n     and control federal spending. The Balanced Budget Amendment \n     shuts off one spigot feeding federal spending by prohibiting \n     deficit spending. The supermajority amendment shuts off the \n     other spigot by making tax increases difficult. Together, \n     they shut the valve which finally chokes off runaway federal \n     spending. In the nine states which currently have a \n     supermajority requirement, spending growth has slowed \n     dramatically.\n       Taxpaying Americans have been robbed of their prosperity in \n     the last half-century by the explosion of federal spending, \n     fueled by deficit spending and dramatic increases in taxes. \n     As Congressman Joe Barton has pointed out, federal taxes went \n     from 5% of a family's income in 1934 to almost 19% in 1994. \n     It is time that we reign in the beast. It is time that \n     taxpaying Americans finally have leverage over spending \n     interests. That is why we are strongly in support of the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment and the supermajority amendment.\n            Farm Bureau Calls for Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n       Washington, Jan. 5, 1995.--Passage of a balanced budget \n     amendment should be the first step in a series of needed \n     changes in the federal government's policies on taxation, \n     spending and regulations, Farm Bureau told the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee today.\n       ``Farm Bureau has supported a balanced budget amendment to \n     the U.S. Constitution for 15 years,'' said Utah Farm Bureau \n     President Ken Ashby. ``Farmers and ranchers believe a \n     balanced budget amendment can help provide much needed budget \n     discipline that, unfortunately, seems impossible to achieve \n     in government today.''\n       Ashby, who grows alfalfa, hay and grain, said a more hands-\n     off approach of federal regulations on private economic \n     activity and on state and local governments, in combination \n     with a reduction in deficit spending, would benefit all \n     Americans. He said if a balanced budget amendment is passed, \n     Congress must not slow down on spending reform.\n       ``These changes in public policies will take months of \n     serious consideration and debate by the Congress,'' Ashby \n     said. ``You cannot do everything at once, and we do not \n     expect you to. But we also do not want you to simply pass a \n     balanced budget amendment and then go back to business as \n     usual.''\n       As part of the Farm Bureau proposal, Ashby called on the \n     senators to push for a balanced budget amendment that would \n     require a three-fifths ``super majority'' vote of both houses \n     of Congress to ignore the balanced budget requirement. He \n     said ``this provision will elevate the scrutiny of proposed \n     new spending and force Congress to go on record when it \n     decides to increase spending.''\n       He told the Judiciary panel that as a result of the 1990 \n     farm bill and the 1990 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, \n     government payments to farmers have been reduced by \n     approximately one-third. He recognized some cuts as necessary \n     to reduce the Federal debt, but said farmers are not the only \n     segment of the population that needs to pitch in.\n       ``Farmers have not been entirely happy with these \n     reductions but understand that cuts are necessary if a \n     balanced budget is to be achieved,'' Ashby said. ``Now it is \n     time for all government programs, including social security \n     and defense, to follow agriculture's example and contribute \n     to spending control.''\n       Farm Bureau, he said, also believes any amendment proposal \n     should require the president to submit a balanced budget to \n     Congress. Ashby said this provision would help spread the \n     responsibility for balancing revenue and spending among the \n     legislative as well as the executive branch.\n       Ashby told the panel that the current practice of allowing \n     passage of tax increases by a majority of the members present \n     on the floor of either house must change. He told the \n     committee that a majority of the total membership of each \n     house, recorded by a roll call vote, should be required for \n     future tax increases, making them more difficult to achieve.\n                                              Christian Coalition,\n\n\n                                          Capitol Hill Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 24, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 1.5 million members and \n     supporters of the Christian Coalition, we urge you to support \n     the balanced budget amendment [BBA] to the Constitution.\n       The mounting national debt threatens our nation's economic \n     future. Unless we act today to restore fiscal sanity, more \n     private savings will be drawn away from investments necessary \n     for lasting economic growth. Without a BBA, the nation will \n     grow deeper in debt to foreign creditors, and the interest \n     payments on the soaring debt will preclude other budget \n     priorities. This is indeed a bleak legacy to leave our \n     children and grandchildren.\n       Moreover, we do not believe that the American people are \n     taxed too little. Rather we believe that the federal \n     government spends too much. According to the Tax Foundation, \n     federal, state and local taxes claimed 39.5 percent of the \n     income earned by a median two-earner family in 1994. Every \n     additional four year delay without a balanced budget could \n     result in another trillion dollars of debt, and another $55 \n     billion in annual interest costs. According to the National \n     Taxpayers Union, these interest payments alone will cost \n     today's child over $130,000 in extra taxes, on average, over \n     his or her lifetime.\n       A balanced budget amendment is long overdue. We urge you to \n     pass it now to secure a sound fiscal future for America's \n     families.\n           Sincerely,\n     Marshall Wittmann,\n       Director, Legislative Affairs.\n     Heidi Scanlon,\n       Director, Governmental Affairs.\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 1994.\n       Dear Colleague: What did Thomas Jefferson get for $225 \n     billion? The Louisiana Purchase, which became all or part of \n     15 States.\n       What are we getting for $223 billion? Absolutely nothing, \n     except another year older and deeper in debt.\n\n              Thomas Jefferson and the Louisiana Purchase\n\n\n                        overview--february 1994\n\n       When Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) supporters have quoted \n     Thomas Jefferson's sentiments against government debt, Sen. \n     Byrd cited the Louisiana Purchase, arguing:\n       The purchase amount, $15 million, all borrowed, was almost \n     twice the size of the total annual federal budget in 1804. \n     The comparable figure would be translated into $2.8 trillion \n     today--a ``whopper'' of a transaction.\n       Jefferson talked tough against going into debt before he \n     was President, but obviously saw how the need for borrowing \n     could arise once he became President.\n       Jefferson had virtually no association with writing the \n     Constitution; Madison, who did, said that the wise incurring \n     of debt could benefit posterity.\n\n\n                               responses\n\n       To buy the Louisiana Territory, Jefferson did borrow an \n     amount equal to twice the amount the federal government was \n     spending annually at the time. However, total federal outlays \n     amounted to only about 1.6% of gross domestic product in 1804 \n     (compared to 22% in 1994). Jefferson's purchase was equal to \n     a less than 3.5% of GDP, the equivalent of about $224.5 \n     BILLION in 1993 dollars.\n       In other words, in GDP-adjusted terms, the Louisiana \n     purchase cost Jefferson about the same amount the government \n     now deficit-spends every year, and about the same amount the \n     government spends on net interest payments just to service \n     the debt every year.\n       The BBA follows both Jefferson's philosophy and his \n     example. Obviously, his ultimate position was that debt was \n     acceptable (1) for extraordinary needs and (2) if it was \n     repaid.\n       S.J. Res. 41, requiring a \\3/5\\ vote to deficit spend or \n     raise the debt limit, provides both a norm of balanced \n     budgets and the flexibility to meet extraordinary needs.\n       Jefferson reduced the federal debt by half during his first \n     term.\n       Unlike today's general indebtedness, Jefferson paid for the \n     Louisiana Purchase with a specific, dedicated note. The debt \n     so incurred was paid off fully within 20 years, by 1823.\n       When Jefferson submitted the treaty and related legislation \n     to Congress in 1803, he stated his expectations that: (1) The \n     remaining national debt would be paid off before the \n     Louisiana note came due; and (2) the then-current growth in \n     revenues would enable retirement of the Louisiana debt in a \n     relatively short time.\n       The Louisiana Purchase was a once-in-a-lifetime \n     opportunity. Certainly you would expect to obtain a \\3/5\\ \n     vote for such an extraordinary and beneficial investment. And \n     in fact, all of the relevant Congressional \n     [[Page S3358]] votes related to the Louisiana Purchase far \n     exceeded the \\3/5\\ margin required to borrow under S.J. Res. \n     41.\n       Madison, too, dedicated his Presidency to balanced budgets, \n     promising ``to liberate the public resources by an honorable \n     discharge of public debt.'' In fact, he retained Jefferson's \n     Treasury Secretary to continue Jefferson's responsible fiscal \n     policies.\n       This year the federal budget deficit will be, adjusted for \n     size of GNP, about equal to the amount that President \n     Jefferson borrowed for the Louisiana Purchase.\n       But the government is not ``investing'' this $223 billion. \n     Unlike that of 1804, 1994's borrowing is not buying us \n     306,573,740 acres of fertile prairies, navigable waterways, \n     and abundant natural resources, to resell at a profit and \n     with which to enrich the lives and well-being of our \n     children. Today's borrowing is for current consumption, \n     simply allowing government programs to spend beyond their \n     income.\n       Every year, this generation's government is incurring \n     additional debt of a magnitude that Jefferson and his \n     generation felt was appropriate only for a once-in-a-lifetime \n     endeavor.\n       The $15 million (in 1804 dollars) worth of bonds issued to \n     finance the Louisiana Purchase was paid off completely within \n     20 years. In GNP-adjusted 1993 dollars, this purchase turned \n     a $74 billion profit in land sales alone by 1823, and another \n     $132 billion profit in land sales by 1834. These proceeds \n     helped reduce the federal debt to $38,000--that's $38 \n     thousand--in 1834 and `35, its lowest level before or since.\n       In contrast, over this past 20 years, the gross federal \n     debt will have increased by 869 percent--from $484 billion in \n     fiscal year 1974 to $4.69 trillion at the end of FY 1994, as \n     projected by CBO. In fact, the red ink has flowed in 56 of \n     the last 64 years.\n       The federal government has been accumulating debt so fast \n     and in such massive amounts that American taxpayers are now \n     servicing that debt with interest payments about equal--\n     again, adjusted for size of GNP--to what Jefferson and the \n     8th Congress borrowed to double the size of the nation. (CBO-\n     projected gross interest in FY 1994: $298 billion; Net \n     interest: $201 billion.)\n       Jefferson's government invested.

Res. 1, The Jefferson Amendment\n\n       For over 140 years in this nation, balanced federal budgets \n     were part of the unwritten constitution just like the two \n     party system and the workings of the electoral college. \n     Modern necessity dictates change through a balanced budget \n     amendment to the constitution. Jefferson foresaw this some \n     200 years ago:\n       ``I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and \n     constitutions. But laws and institutions must go hand in hand \n     with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more \n     developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new \n     truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the \n     change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to \n     keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to \n     wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized \n     society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous \n     ancestors.'' (The Jefferson Memorial, Washington, D.C.)\n       Quotes from the Framers and others on the evils of public \n     debt:\n       ``It is a miserable arithmetic which makes any single \n     privation whatever so painful as a total privation of \n     everything which must necessarily follow the living so far \n     beyond our income. What is to extricate us I know not, \n     whether law, or loss of credit. If the sources of the former \n     are corrupted, so as to prevent justice the latter must \n     supply its place, leave us possessed of our infamous gains, \n     but prevent all future ones of the same character.'' \n     (Jefferson, 1787)\n       ``I place economy among the first and most important of \n     republican virtues, and public debt as the greatest of the \n     dangers to be feared.'' (Jefferson, 1816)\n       ``If we run into such debts, as that we must be taxed in \n     our meat and in our drink, in our necessaries and our \n     comforts, in our labors and our amusements, for our callings \n     and our creeds, as the people of England are, our people like \n     them, must come to labor sixteen hours in the twenty-four, \n     give the earnings of fifteen of these to the government for \n     their debts and daily expenses . . .'' (Jefferson, 1816)\n       I believe it may be regarded as a position warranted by the \n     history of mankind that, in the usual progress of things, the \n     necessities of a nation, in every stage of its existence, \n     will be found at least equal to its resources. (Alexander \n     Hamilton in the Federalist #30)\n       To liberate the public resources by an honorable discharge \n     of public debts. (President James Madison, Stating one of the \n     primary goals of his Administration)\n       Interest is now paid to capitalists out of the profits of \n     labor; not only will this labor be released from the burden, \n     but the capital, thus thrown out of an unproductive use, will \n     seek a productive employment; giving thereby a new impetus to \n     enterprise in agriculture, the arts, commerce, and \n     navigation. (Samuel Inghams, Secretary of the Treasury under \n     Andrew Jackson)\n       President Andrew Jackson, in proposing to effect \n     substantial reductions in the war debt, observed:\n       We should look at the national debt, as just as it is, not \n     as a national blessing but as a heavy burden on the industry \n     of the country to be discharged without unnecessary delay.\n       President Benjamin Harrison described unnecessary public \n     debt as ``criminal.''\n       [Even during unsatisfactory economic conditions,] * * * \n     ``the government should not be permitted to run behind its \n     debt.'' (President William McKinley)\n       The nation must make financial sacrifices accompanied by a \n     stern self denial in public expenditures until we have \n     conquered the disabilities of our public finance * * * we \n     must keep our budget balanced for each year. (President \n     Calvin Coolidge)\n       ``To preserve our independence, we must not let our rulers \n     load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election \n     between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.'' \n     (Jefferson, 1816)\n       ``There does not exist an engine so corruptive of the \n     government and so demoralizing of the nation as a public \n     debt. It will bring on us more ruin at home than all the \n     enemies from abroad against whom this army and navy are to \n     protect us.'' (Jefferson, 1821)\n       ``The payments made in discharge of the principal and \n     interest of the national debt, will show that the public \n     faith has been exactly maintained.'' (Jefferson, 1801)\n       ``The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.'' (Jefferson)\n       ``I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to \n     our constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone \n     for the reduction of the administration of our government to \n     the genuine principles of its constitution; I mean an \n     additional article, taking from the federal government the \n     power of borrowing.'' (Jefferson, 1798)\n       ``The consequences arising from the continual accumulation \n     of public debts in other countries ought to admonish us to be \n     careful to prevent their growth in our own.'' (President John \n     Adams in his Inaugural Address)\n       ``Stewards of the public money should never suffer without \n     urgent necessity to be transcended the maxim of keeping the \n     expenditures of the year within the limits of its receipts. \n     (President John Quincy Adams)\n       ``As the vicissitudes of nations begat a perpetual tendency \n     to the accumulation of debt, there ought to be a perpetual, \n     anxious, and unceasing effort to reduce that which at any \n     time exists, as fast as shall be practicable, consistent with \n     integrity and good faith.'' (Alexander Hamilton)\n       ``Once the budget is balanced and the debts paid off, our \n     population will be relieved from a considerable portion of \n     its present burdens and will find not only new motives to \n     patriotic affection, but additional means for the display of \n     individual enterprise.'' (President Andrew Jackson)\n       ``After the elimination of the public debt, the Government \n     would be left at liberty * * * to apply such portions of the \n     revenue as may not be necessary for current expenses to such \n     other objects as may be most conducive to the public security \n     and welfare.'' (President James Monroe)\n       ``Money being spent without new taxation and appropriation \n     without accompanying taxation is as bad as taxation without \n     representation.'' (President Woodrow Wilson)\n       If there is one omission I fear in the document called the \n     Constitution, it is that we did not restrict the power of \n     government to borrow money. (Thomas Jefferson, 1798)\n       A wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from \n     injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to \n     regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and \n     shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has \n     earned. This is the sum of good government, and this is \n     necessary to close the circle of our felicities. (Thomas \n     Jefferson, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1801)\n       The public debt is the greatest of dangers to be feared by \n     a republican government. (Thomas Jefferson)\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequences as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government.

There is wide disagreement among \n     policymakers about what should be included in a federal \n     capital budget. We should not place a concept such as capital \n     budgeting in the Constitution when there is no consensus on \n     what constitutes a capital budget.\n       State and local governments have a check on their use of \n     capital budgets through bond ratings. If a state government \n     were to abuse its capital budget, the states bond rating \n     would drop and the state would be unable to continue to \n     finance new capital expenditures for borrowing. In addition, \n     many states require that bond issues be approved by the \n     voters. These checks on the abuse of capital budgets would \n     not exist under a federal capital budget, making it far more \n     likely that a federal capital budget would be abused.\n       The justification that most businesses and state and local \n     governments have for capital budgeting is that they \n     occasionally need to make one-time, extraordinary \n     expenditures that are amortized over a long period of time. \n     The federal budget is so huge--$1.5 trillion in 1994--that \n     almost no conceivable, one-shot project would make even a \n     small dent in it.\n       Even the Federal Interstate Highway System, which has been \n     called the largest peacetime undertaking in all of human \n     history, was financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. President \n     Eisenhower initially proposed that the Interstate System be \n     financed through borrowing. However, Congress kept it on-\n     budget and financed it through a gas tax at the suggestion of \n     Senator Albert Gore, Sr. We are unlikely to have another \n     capital expenditure of this magnitude in the foreseeable \n     future.\n       While state capital spending is often placed off-budget, so \n     are trust fund surpluses. According to a Price-Waterhouse \n     study, state budgets would be roughly in balance if both \n     capital expenditures and trust funds were included on budget.\n       Exempting a capital budget from budget restraints ensures \n     that spending on capital investments--financed entirely by \n     debt--will increase. The debt incurred as a result of these \n     expenditures will crowd out spending on items other than \n     physical capital.\n       Less than four percent of federal outlays are for non-\n     defense physical investment. Given the relatively small and \n     constant share that capital expenditure have in the federal \n     budget, there is no need to remove capital expenditures from \n     the general budget.\n       S.J. Res. 1/H.J. Res. 28 does not prevent the creation of a \n     separate operating and capital accounts, but the total budget \n     must remain in balance. This is consistent with the \n     recommendations of GAO, which stated,\n       ``. . . the creation of explicit categories for government \n     capital and investment expenditures should not be viewed as a \n     license to run deficits to finance those categories . . . . \n     The choice between spending for investment and spending for \n     consumption should be seen as setting of priorities within an \n     overall fiscal constraint, not as a reason for relaxing that \n     constraint and permitting a larger deficit.''\n [Congressional Leaders United for a Balanced Budget--Revised January \n                               30, 1995]\n\n       Balanced Budget Amendment--Promoting Honesty in Budgeting\n\n       H.J. Res. 1/S.J. Res. 1, the bi-partisan consensus Balanced \n     Budget Amendment to the Constitution, is written to foreclose \n     loopholes or evasions in its implementation and enforcement, \n     while allowing for necessary and beneficial flexibility. It \n     also will have the salutary effect of providing incentives \n     for more honest and accurate budgeting than now or in the \n     past.\n       The general self-enforcing mechanism in the BBA: The 3/5 \n     vote on the debt limit:\n       No matter what accounting techniques are used to depict a \n     balanced budget, and regardless of any ``rosy scenario'' \n     economic assumptions, smoke and mirrors, or honest estimating \n     mistakes, if actual outlays exceed actual receipts, the \n     Treasury ultimately would need to borrow in order to meet the \n     government's obligations. This would require 3/5 votes in \n     both the Senate and House to raise the debt limit.\n       The threat of a ``train wreck'' on the debt limit provides \n     a powerful incentive for truth-in-budgeting, because Congress \n     and the President could not escape the consequences of \n     policies that increased the debt. Opponents who focus on the \n     difficulty of achieving a 3/5 majority miss the point. They \n     are still focused on what's necessary to run a deficit. The \n     possibility of a 3/5 debt vote is a deterrent. Facing it is \n     so undesirable that Congress and the President generally \n     would do anything to avoid it--even balance the budget!\n       H.J. Res. 1/S.J. Res. 1 rules out loopholes and \n     ``gimmicks;'' for example:\n       The amendment could not be evaded by moving items off-\n     budget. H.J. Res. 1 does not require that a single document, \n     a ``budget,'' be written in balance. It deals with how total \n     outlays conform to total receipts. Taking an item ``off-\n     budget'' in statute still could be used to give that item \n     priority over others or give it certain protections in the \n     budget process (as has been done with Social Security), but \n     would not affect the operation of the BBA. The amendment \n     would remove the current incentive to move items off-budget \n     for the purpose of masking a deficit. The possibility of a 3/\n     5 debt limit vote would deter moving deficit spending ``off-\n     budget.''\n       Definitions of terms could not be manipulated to evade the \n     BBA. Terms such as ``receipts,'' ``debt,'' ``revenue,'' \n     ``whole number,'' and ``war'' already appear in the \n     Constitution and have long-established meanings. Others, such \n     as ``outlays,'' ``debt held by the public,'' ``budget,'' and \n     ``declaratory judgment'' are universally and solidly \n     understood, having been long-defined and used in OMB, CBO, \n     Congressional, legal, and other documents. Committee reports \n     and floor debates since 1981 have gone to great lengths to \n     establish a legislative history for, and preventing \n     misinterpretation of, these and other terms.\n       H.J. Res. 28/S.J.Res. 1 would promote honesty and accuracy \n     in budget estimates:\n       Congress and the President can not plan for a coming fiscal \n     year without making estimates. Section 1, requiring that \n     actual outlays and receipts be in balance, and Section 6, \n     allowing for the use of estimates, operate together as \n     follows:\n       Section 6 says estimates may be used in preparing a budget \n     plan;\n       Section 1 requires that such planned budgets be in balance;\n       Following such a budget plan, so long it is reasonable to \n     do so, complies with Section 1. This means Congress and the \n     President need not re-open the budget throughout the fiscal \n     year, simply because of month-to-month fluctuations in \n     receipts or outlays. (E.g., A wave of last-minute tax \n     payments could cause actual receipts to fall short of \n     estimates in one month's and exceed them in the next.) \n     Indeed, some previous versions have been criticized as \n     inflexible because they lacked estimates language.\n       The threat of a 3/5 debt limit vote will enforce the \n     accuracy of budget estimates.\n       The experience of our compliance with the caps on \n     discretionary outlays enacted as part of the 1990 Budget \n     Enforcement Act illustrates how budgetary restraints provide \n     an incentive for sound estimates. Although Congress \n     appropriates budget authority and must rely on estimates of \n     outlays, it has complied with the outlay caps by taking care \n     to ensure that the appropriations bills enacted did not pose \n     a risk of breaching the outlay caps. A balanced budget \n     amendment would provide a similar, but far stronger, \n     incentive for improving all budget estimates.\n       To be safe, Congress should, and probably would, plan small \n     surpluses in most years.\n       The BBA would be promoting honesty and accuracy in dealing \n     with contingent liabilities:\n       Currently, there is no incentive for Congress and the \n     President to tackle the politically difficult issues \n     associated with contingent liabilities such as government \n     pensions and savings and loan insurance. For example, \n     Congress repeatedly postponed action on the S & L cleanup, \n     even though that ultimately resulted in increased costs to \n     the federal government. By restraining the government's \n     ability to borrow, H.J.Res. 28/S.J.Res. 1 will provide a \n     powerful incentive to deal with contingent liabilities \n     promptly--before they result in unnecessary costs--and \n     honestly.\n                                                                    ____\n\n   Emergency Appropriations Should Not be Exempted from the Balanced \n                            Budget Amendment\n\n       An amendment to override the balanced budget in case of \n     disaster or national emergency is unnecessary.\n       According to the Congressional Budget Office, since 1978 \n     there have been only seven years in which supplemental \n     appropriations for natural disasters have exceeded $100 \n     million. The incidence of natural disasters requiring large \n     supplemental appropriations is historically unusual.\n       The text of the balanced budget amendment provides for the \n     constitutional requirement for a balanced budget to be waived \n     with a three-fifths vote of both Houses.\n       In the past five supplemental bills put before Congress, \n     both Houses have voted with at least a three-fifths majority \n     to approve the supplemental funding.\n       Congress has consistently voted to appropriate funds by at \n     least three-fifths majority, in the case of national \n     disaster, economic emergency and war.\n       In 1991 the Senate passed a bill to offset the costs of \n     Desert Storm to various governmental agencies, as well as \n     additional appropriations for food stamps, State unemployment \n     compensation operations, veterans compensations and pensions, \n     92 to 8. It passed the House 365 to 43.\n       Later that year the Senate passed another supplemental bill \n     providing disaster assistance funds to FEMA and to meet costs \n     of Desert Storm, 75 to 17. The House passed the same bill 303 \n     to 114.\n       In 1992 the Senate passed a bill appropriating emergency \n     funds for hurricane Andrew and hurricane Iniki, 84 to 10. The \n     House had already passed this bill 297 to 124.\n       In 1993, the Senate passed a bill for emergency relief for \n     the major widespread flooding in the Midwest, by voice vote, \n     the House passed it 400 to 27.\n       In the most recent emergency supplemental bill that went in \n     large part to fund victims of the most recent Los Angeles \n     earthquake, the Senate approved the measure 85 to 10, the \n     House approved it 337 to 74.\n       [[Page S3360]] emergency supplemental votes february 1994\n\n       This is a summary of emergency supplemental appropriations \n     from FY '78 through FY '94. The statistics are based on a \n     review of funds appropriated to FEMA. There are a wide \n     variety of disaster bailout funds, but this is the best \n     measure because no broader study of federal disaster funding \n     is available.\n       The measures cited here include two non-FEMA supplemental \n     appropriations for the Small Business Administration and \n     which appear on the dollar amount list in this section.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         History of Disaster Supplementals as of February 1994\n\n       The table below from the Congressional Budget Office shows \n     that in the sixteen years since 1978 there have been only \n     seven years in which Supplemental Appropriations for Natural \n     Disasters have exceeded $100 million. The incidence of \n     natural disasters requiring large supplemental appropriations \n     is historically unusual and the use of these funds has \n     clearly not been a ``budget buster.''\n\n      CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR NATURAL DISASTERS\\1\\      \n                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                   1978    1980    1989    1990    1992    1993    1994 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nP.L. 95-255:                                                            \n  Disaster                                                              \n   relief                                                               \n   (floods).....     300  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......\nP.L. 95-284:                                                            \n  SBA disaster                                                          \n   loans                                                                \n   (floods).....     758       0       0       0       0       0       0\nP.L. 96-304:                                                            \n  FEMA (Love                                                            \n   Canal, NY)...       0     870       0       0       0       0       0\n  SBA disaster                                                          \n   loans (Mt.                                                           \n   St. Helens)..       0   1,177       0       0       0       0       0\nP.L. 101-100:                                                           \n  FEMA disaster                                                         \n   relief (HUGO)       0       0   1,108       0       0       0       0\nP.L. 101-130:                                                           \n    Loma Prieta:                                                        \n      Stafford                                                          \n       disaster                                                         \n       relief...       0       0       0   1,100       0       0       0\n      Federal-                                                          \n       aid to                                                           \n       highways.       0       0       0   1,000       0       0       0\n      SBA                                                               \n       disaster                                                         \n       loans....       0       0       0     500       0       0       0\n      Unanticipa                                                        \n       ted needs       0       0       0     250       0       0       0\nP.L. 102-229:                                                           \n  FEMA disaster                                                         \n   relief.......       0       0       0       0     943       0       0\n  Commodity                                                             \n   Credit                                                               \n   Corporation..       0       0       0       0   1,750       0       0\nP.L. 102-302:                                                           \n  FEMA disaster                                                         \n   relief.......       0       0       0       0     300       0       0\n  SBA disaster                                                          \n   loans........       0       0       0       0     195       0       0\n  Employment &                                                          \n   training.....       0       0       0       0     500       0       0\nP.L. 102-368:                                                           \n  Commodity                                                             \n   Credit                                                               \n   Corporation..       0       0       0       0     430     100       0\n  SBA disaster                                                          \n   loans........       0       0       0       0     357       0       0\n  FEMA disaster                                                         \n   relief.......       0       0       0       0   2,517       0     143\n  Assisted                                                              \n   housing......       0       0       0       0     183     100       0\nP.L. 103-76:                                                            \n  Commodity                                                             \n   Credit                                                               \n   Corporation..       0       0       0       0       0   1,050       0\n      Prior                                                             \n       contingen                                                        \n       cy;

Both \n     chambers have addressed this issue in past years, but \n     Congress has never enacted such an amendment for ratification \n     by the States. Although the Constitution does not prescribe a \n     balanced Federal budget, provisions have been enacted into \n     law on several occasions stating this as a goal or policy of \n     the Federal Government.\n       This report identifies and briefly discusses the major \n     statutory provisions that pertain to the goal or policy of a \n     balanced Federal budget. These provisions range in scope from \n     a simple, one-line statement to a lengthy set of provisions \n     involving complicated implementing procedures. Most of them \n     state that a balanced Federal budget is a national goal, or \n     require that the President include proposals or information \n     applicable to such a goal in his annual budget submission and \n     economic report to Congress, but do not establish procedures \n     to enforce compliance. While most of the provisions remain in \n     effect, some were applicable to fiscal-year periods that have \n     expired and have been repealed.\n       The most well-known statute in this category is the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, \n     commonly referred to as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (GRH) Act. \n     The 1985 GRH Act set forth annual deficit targets leading to \n     a balanced Federal budget by fiscal year 1991 and established \n     an automatic process for across-the-board spending cuts \n     (known as ``sequestration'') aimed at keeping the deficit \n     within the statutory targets. The detailed enforcement \n     mechanism distinguishes the GRH Act from other balanced-\n     budget statues.\n       [[Page S3361]] The GRH Act was amended extensively in 1987 \n     and 1990. The 1987 amendments postponed the balanced-budget \n     goal until fiscal year 1993; the most recent amendments \n     extend the sequestration process through fiscal year 1995, \n     provide for adjustable deficit targets, and change the focus \n     of the GRH Act from achieving budgetary balance to \n     controlling the growth of discretionary spending and \n     maintaining deficit neutrality regarding legislative changes \n     in mandatory spending and revenues. During the period from \n     fiscal year 1986 through fiscal year 1991 (when fixed deficit \n     targets were in effect), the actual deficit exceeded the \n     deficit target in the GRH Act by between about $6 billion \n     (fiscal year 1987) and $205 billion (fiscal year 1991).\n       Other major statutes pertaining to the goal of a balanced \n     Federal budget include: a law increasing the public debt \n     limit in 1979, the Byrd Amendment of 1978, the Humphrey-\n     Hawkins Act of 1978, the Revenue Act of 1978, the Revenue Act \n     of 1964, and the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921.\n                              introduction\n\n       During the remainder of the 102nd Congress, the House and \n     Senate are expected to consider whether the Constitution \n     should be amended to require a balanced Federal budget. Both \n     chambers have addressed this issue in past years, but \n     Congress has never enacted such an amendment for ratification \n     by the States.\\1\\ Although the Constitution does not \n     prescribe a balanced Federal budget, provisions have been \n     enacted into law on several occasions stating this as a goal \n     or policy of the Federal Government.\n     \\1\\For a discussion of House and Senate action on this issue, \n     see: (1) ``Congress and a Balanced Budget Amendment to the \n     U.S. Constitution,'' by James V.

These provisions range in scope from \n     a simple, one-line statement to a lengthy set of provisions \n     involving complicated implementing procedures. Most of them \n     state that a balanced Federal budget is a national goal, or \n     require that the President include proposals or information \n     applicable to such a goal in his annual budget submission and \n     economic report to Congress, but do not establish procedures \n     to enforce compliance. While most of the provisions remain in \n     effect, some were applicable to fiscal-year periods that have \n     expired and have been repealed.\n\n\n                   gramm-rudman-hollings act of 1985\n\n       The most well-known statute in this category is the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 \n     (Title II of P.L. 99-177, Increase in the Public Debt Limit; \n     99 Stat. 1038-1101; December 12, 1985), commonly referred to \n     as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (GRH) Act. The 1985 GRH Act set \n     forth annual deficit targets leading to a balanced Federal \n     budget by fiscal year 1991 and established an automatic \n     process for across-the-board spending cuts (known as \n     ``sequestration'') aimed at keeping the deficit within the \n     statutory targets. The detailed enforcement mechanism \n     distinguishes the GRH Act from other balanced-budget \n     statutes.\n       The Act was modified extensively in 1987 by the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act 1987 \n     (Title I of P.L. 100-119, Increase in the Public Debt Limit; \n     101 Stat. 754-784; September 29, 1987), which extended the \n     goal of a balanced budget to fiscal year 1993.\n       Most recently, the GRH Act was amended extensively by the \n     Budget Enforcement Act (BEA) of 1990 (Title XIII of P.L. 101-\n     508, Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990; 104 Stat. \n     1388-573 through 1388-630; November 5, 1990). The BEA revised \n     the deficit targets in the GRH Act, making the targets \n     adjustable rather than fixed, and extended the sequestration \n     process for two more years--through fiscal year 1995 \n     (although the budget is not required, and is not expected, to \n     be in balance by that time). Additionally, two new procedures \n     enforceable by sequestration were established: (1) adjustable \n     limitations on different categories of discretionary spending \n     funded in the annual appropriations process and (2) a ``pay-\n     as-you-go'' process to require that increases in direct \n     spending (i.e., spending controlled outside of the annual \n     appropriations process) or decreases in revenues due to \n     legislative action are offset so that there is no net \n     increase in the deficit.\n       The 1990 amendments changed the focus of the GRH Act from \n     achieving budgetary balance to controlling the growth of \n     discretionary spending and maintaining deficit neutrality \n     regarding legislative changes in mandatory spending and \n     revenues.

Additionally, the unadjusted deficit targets and \n     discretionary spending limits are set forth in Section 601(a) \n     of the 1974 Budget Act.\n       During the period that the GRH Act has been in effect, \n     sequestration has been triggered five times--once each for \n     fiscal years 1986, 1988, and 1990, and twice for fiscal year \n     1991. The sequestration reductions made for fiscal year 1986 \n     were voided by court action and later reaffirmed, the \n     reductions for fiscal year 1988 were later rescinded, the \n     reductions for fiscal year 1990 were modified substantially, \n     and the reductions for fiscal year 1991 were applied in one \n     instance to domestic discretionary programs and in another to \n     international discretionary programs (the latter reductions \n     were later rescinded). With regard to the other two fiscal \n     years, sequestration was forestalled for fiscal year 1987 by \n     the enactment of alternative deficit reduction measures and \n     was avoided for fiscal year 1989 because the estimated \n     deficit excess was less than the $10 billion margin-of-error \n     amount.\n       During the period from fiscal year 1986 through fiscal year \n     1991 (when fixed deficit targets were in effect), the actual \n     deficit exceeded the deficit target in the GRH Act (see Table \n     2). The overage ranged from about $6 billion for fiscal year \n     1987 to nearly $205 billion for fiscal year 1991.\n\nTABLE 2.--ACTUAL DEFICIT COMPARED TO MAXIMUM DEFICIT AMOUNT: FISCAL YEAR\n                                1986-1991                               \n                        [In billions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 Actual \n                                          Maximum     Actual    deficit \n              Fiscal year                 deficit    deficit      over  \n                                           amount                target \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1986...................................      171.9      221.2       49.3\n1987...................................      144.0      149.8        5.8\n1988...................................      144.0      155.2       11.2\n1989...................................      136.0      153.5       17.5\n1990...................................      100.0      220.5      120.5\n1991...................................       64.0      268.7     204.7 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Deficit amounts are presented on a consolidated basis (including  \n  the transactions of off-budget entities--the Social Security trust    \n  funds and the Postal Service).                                        \n\n       The major provisions of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act and \n     the 1974 Budget Act are codified in Titles 2 and 31 of the \n     United States Code.

The \n     provisions were intended to bring balanced budget proposals \n     for fiscal year 1981 and 1982 before Congress for \n     consideration by requiring both the Budget Committees and the \n     President to submit them. Both sections were repealed on \n     September 13, 1982, upon the enactment of P.L. 97-258, which \n     recodified Title 31 of the United States Code (``Money and \n     Finance'').\n       Budget Committee Reports.--The first provision, Section 5, \n     required the House and Senate Budget Committees to report \n     balanced budgets by April 15 of 1979, 1980, and 1981. Section \n     5 stated:\n       Congress shall balance the Federal budget. Pursuant to this \n     mandate, the Budget Committees shall report, by April 15, \n     1979, a fiscal year budget for 1981 that shall be in balance, \n     and also a fiscal year budget for 1982 that shall be in \n     balance, and by April 15, 1980, a fiscal year budget for 1981 \n     that shall be in balance and by April 15, 1981, a fiscal year \n     budget for 1982 that shall be in balance; and the Budget \n     Committees shall show the consequences of each budget on each \n     budget function and on the economy, setting forth the effects \n     on revenues, spending, employment, inflation, and national \n     security.\n       1979 Reports. In 1979, the House Budget Committee complied \n     with the requirement by issuing Toward a Balanced Budget: \n     Report Pursuant to Public Law 96-5 (House Report 96-96, April \n     13, 1979, 102 pages) and a companion committee print that \n     included majority and minority staff reports. The Committee \n     reported the budget resolution for fiscal year 1980 (H. Con. \n     Res. 107) the same day, but it did not include \n     recommendations for fiscal years 1981 or 1982 (House Report \n     96-95, April 13, 1979)\n       The Senate Budget Committee reported two budget resolutions \n     for fiscal year 1980 (Senate Report 96-68, April 12, 1979); \n     both resolutions included recommendations for fiscal years \n     1981 and 1982. The principal budget resolution, S. Con. Res \n     22, proposed a surplus of $0.5 billion for fiscal year 1981 \n     and $0.7 billion for fiscal year 1982. The second resolution, \n     S. \n     [[Page S3362]] Con. Res. 23, was referred to as the \n     ``alternative congressional budget.'' It recommended a \n     deficit of $18.2 billion for fiscal year 1981, but a surplus \n     of $12.3 billion for fiscal year 1982.\n       The House and Senate agreed to a final version of H. Con. \n     Res. 107 (the House adopted the Senate amendment of May 24, \n     1979) that recommended surpluses of $5.0 billion and $4.1 \n     billion for fiscal years 1981 and 1982, respectively.\n       1980 Reports. In 1980, the House Budget Committee reported \n     a budget resolution for fiscal year 1981 (H. Con. Res. 307, \n     House Report 96-857, March 26, 1980) that recommended \n     surpluses of $2.0 billion and $11.7 billion for fiscal years \n     1981 and 1982, respectively. The Senate Budget Committee \n     reported a budget resolution (S. Con. Res. 86, Senate Report \n     96-654, April 9, 1980) that recommended a balanced budget for \n     fiscal year 1981 (a deficit of zero) and a surplus of $10.0 \n     billion for fiscal year 1982.\n       The final version of the budget resolution (H. Con. Res. \n     307) agreed to by the House and Senate (the Senate adopted \n     the House amendment of June 12, 1980 to its amendment) \n     recommended a surplus of $0.2 billion for fiscal year 1981. \n     With respect to fiscal year 1982, the House recommended a \n     surplus of $26.8 billion and the Senate recommended a surplus \n     of $5.8 billion.\n       1981 Reports. In 1981, the House Budget Committee reported \n     a budget resolution for fiscal year 1982 (H. Con. Res. 115, \n     House Report 97-23, April 16, 1981) that recommended a \n     deficit of $25.6 billion for that fiscal year, but a surplus \n     of $25.8 billion by fiscal year 1984. The Senate Budget \n     Committee reported a budget resolution (S. Con. Res. 19, \n     Senate Report 97-49, May 1, 1981) that recommended a deficit \n     of $48.8 billion for fiscal year 1982, but a balanced budget \n     (a deficit of zero) for fiscal year 1984.\n       The House and Senate finally agreed on a budget resolution \n     (H. Con. Res. 115, House Report 97-46, May 15, 1981) that \n     recommended a deficit of $37.65 billion for fiscal year 1982, \n     but a surplus of $1.05 billion for fiscal year 1984.\n       Alternate Budget Proposals of the President.--The second \n     provision, Section 6, required the President to submit \n     alternate proposals for a balanced budget if his budget \n     submission for fiscal years 1981 or 1982 recommended a \n     deficit for either fiscal year. Section 6 stated:\n       (a) If a budget which is transmitted by the President to \n     the Congress under section 201 of the Budget and Accounting \n     Act, 1921, would, if adopted, result in a deficit in fiscal \n     year 1981 or in fiscal year 1982, the President shall also \n     transmit alternate budget proposals which, if adopted, would \n     not result in a deficit.\n       (b) Such alternate budget proposals shall be transmitted \n     with the budget and, except as provided in subsection (c), \n     shall be in such detail as the President determines necessary \n     to carry out the purposes of this section.\n       (c) Alternate budget proposals for a fiscal year \n     transmitted under subsection (a) shall include a clear and \n     understandable explanation of specific differences between \n     the budget and alternate budget proposals.\n       Fiscal Year 1981 Budget. President Carter submitted his \n     budget for fiscal year 1981 to Congress on January 28, 1980. \n     The President proposed a deficit for fiscal year 1981 of \n     $15.8 billion and a surplus for fiscal year 1982 of $4.8 \n     billion. The alternate proposals required by P.L. 96-5 were \n     set forth on pages 319-326 of the budget and explored the \n     impact of both $20 billion in revenue increases and spending \n     reductions (including such options as a six-percent surtax on \n     individual and corporate income, increased payroll taxes, the \n     elimination of Federal pay raises, no real growth in defense, \n     and holding cost-of-living increases in indexed programs to \n     three-fourths of the increase in the Consumer Price Index).\n       On March 31, 1980, President Carter sent a package of \n     budget revisions to Congress, calling for surpluses of $16.5 \n     billion for fiscal year 1981 and $41.5 billion for fiscal \n     year 1982.\n       Fiscal Year 1982 Budget. President Carter submitted his \n     budget for fiscal year 1982 to Congress on January 15, 1981, \n     shortly before leaving office. He proposed a deficit of $55.2 \n     billion in fiscal year 1981 and $27.5 billion for fiscal year \n     1982. The alternate proposals required by P.L. 96-5 were \n     included on pages 312-320 of the budget.\n       On March 10, 1981, President Reagan submitted to Congress \n     revisions to the Carter budget for fiscal year 1982. The \n     revised budget proposals recommended deficits for fiscal year \n     1981 and 1982 of $54.9 billion and $45.0 billion, \n     respectively.\n       The actual deficits (on a consolidated basis) for fiscal \n     years 1981 and 1982 were $79.0 billion and $128.0 billion, \n     respectively.\n\n\n                         byrd amendment of 1978\n\n       The ``Byrd Amendment,'' named for former Harry F. Byrd, Jr. \n     of Virginia, was included in the Bretton Woods Agreements \n     Amendments Act of 1978 (Section 7 of P.L. 95-435; 92 Stat. \n     1053; October 10, 1978). In its original form, the Byrd \n     Amendment stated: ``Beginning with fiscal year 1981, the \n     total budget outlays of the Federal Government shall not \n     exceed its receipts.''\n       Two years later, the Byrd Amendment was modified by the \n     Bretton Woods Agreements Amendment Act of 1980 (Section 3 of \n     P.L. 96-389; 94 Stat. 1553; October 7, 1980) to read as \n     follows: ``The Congress reaffirms its commitment that \n     beginning with fiscal year 1981, the total outlays of the \n     Federal Government shall not exceed its receipts.''\n       In 1982, as part of the recodification of Title 31 of the \n     United States Code (P.L. 97-258; 96 Stat. 908; September 13, \n     1982), the Byrd Amendment was restated in its current form: \n     ``Congress reaffirms its commitment that budget outlays of \n     the United States Government for a fiscal year may not be \n     more than the receipts of the Government for that year'' (see \n     31 U.S.C. 1103 (Budget Ceiling)).\n                      humphrey-hawkins act of 1978\n\n       The Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (P.L. \n     95-523), commonly known as the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, included \n     two provisions (in the form of amendments to the Employment \n     Act of 1946) that pertain to the goal of a balanced Federal \n     budget. First, Section 103(a) of the Act (92 Stat. 1892-1893) \n     amended the required elements of the President's annual \n     economic Report to Congress to include numerical goals for \n     certain measurements of economic activity consistent with, \n     among other things, a balanced Federal budget. The amended \n     provision of the Employment Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1022, \n     Economic Report of the President) states in part:\n       The President shall transmit to the Congress during the \n     first twenty days of each regular session * * * an economic \n     report (hereinafter in this chapter referred to as the \n     ``Economic Report'') together with the annual report of the \n     Council of Economic Advisers, submitted in accord with \n     section 1023(c) of this title, setting forth--\n       (2)(A) annual numerical goals for employment and \n     unemployment, production, real income, productivity, Federal \n     outlays as a proportion of gross national product, and prices \n     for the calendar year in which the Economic Report is \n     transmitted and for the following calendar year, designated \n     as short-term goals, which shall be consistent with achieving \n     as rapidly as feasible the goals of full employment and \n     production, increased real income, balanced growth, fiscal \n     policies that would establish the share of an expanding gross \n     national product accounted for by Federal outlays at the \n     lowest level consistent with national needs and priorities, a \n     balanced Federal budget, adequate productivity growth, price \n     stability, achievement of an improved trade balance, and \n     proper attention to national priorities * * * [Emphasis \n     added; other provisions relating to the Economic Report and \n     the goal of obtaining a balanced Federal budget are contained \n     in 15 U.S.C. 1022a and 1022b]\n       Second, Section 106 of the Act (92 Stat. 1895-1896) added a \n     new section to the Employment Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1022c, \n     inclusion of Priority Policies and Programs in President's \n     Budget), which states in part:\n       To contribute to the achievement of the goals under the \n     Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, the \n     President's Budget for each fiscal year beginning after \n     October 27, 1978, shall include priority policies and \n     programs, which shall include, to the extent deemed \n     appropriate by the President, consideration of the \n     following--\n       (I) proper attention to balancing the Federal budget; * * *\n                          revenue act of 1978\n\n       The Revenue Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-600) called for a balanced \n     budget in fiscal years 1982 and 1983. Section 3 of the Act \n     (Policy With Respect to Additional Tax Reductions; 26 U.S.C. \n     1 note; 92 Stat. 2767), stated:\n       As a matter of national policy the rate of growth in \n     Federal outlays, adjusted for inflation, should not exceed 1 \n     percent per year between fiscal year 1979 and 1983; Federal \n     outlays as a percentage of gross national product should \n     decline to below 21 percent in fiscal year 1980, 20.5 percent \n     in fiscal year 1981, 20 percent in fiscal year 1982 and 19.5 \n     percent in fiscal year 1983; and the Federal budget should be \n     balanced in fiscal years 1982 and 1983. If these conditions \n     are met, it is the intention that the tax-writing committees \n     of Congress will report legislation providing significant tax \n     reductions for individuals to the extent that these \n     reductions are justified in the light of prevailing and \n     expected economic conditions. [Emphasis added]\n\n\n                          revenue act of 1964\n\n       The Revenue Act of 1964 (P.L. 88-272) included a statement \n     that Congress' action on the measure was intended to bring \n     about a balanced budget, although no reference was made to a \n     specific fiscal year. Section 1 of the Act (Declaration by \n     Congress; 78 Stat. 19), stated:\n       It is the sense of Congress that the tax reduction provided \n     by this Act through stimulation of the economy, will, after a \n     brief transitional period, raise (rather than lower) revenues \n     and that such revenue increases should first be used to \n     eliminate the deficits in the administrative budgets and then \n     to reduce the public debt. To further the objective of \n     obtaining balanced budgets in the near future, Congress by \n     this action, recognizes the importance of taking all \n     reasonable means to restrain Government spending and urges \n     the President to declare his accord with this objective.\n\n\n                   budget and accounting act of 1921\n\n       Section 202 of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 (P.L. \n     67-13; 42 Stat. 21; June 10, 1921) requires the President to \n     make appropriate recommendations to Congress in the budget \n     whenever the estimates of revenues and spending in the budget \n     show a deficit or a surplus. In its original form, the \n     section directed the President to recommend ``new taxes, \n     loans, or other appropriate action'' to meet a projected \n     deficit. When the section was restated in the 1982 \n     recodification of \n     [[Page S3363]] Title 31 of the United States Code, the \n     specific reference to new taxes and loans was removed. In its \n     current form (31 U.S.C. 1105(c)), the section states:\n       The President shall recommend in the budget appropriate \n     action to meet an estimated deficiency when the estimated \n     receipts for the fiscal year for which the budget is \n     submitted (under laws in effect when the budget is submitted) \n     and the estimated amounts in the Treasury at the end of the \n     current fiscal year available for expenditure in the fiscal \n     year for which the budget is submitted, are less than the \n     estimated expenditures for that year. The President shall \n     make recommendations required by the public interest when the \n     estimated receipts and estimated amounts in the Treasury are \n     more than the estimated expenditures.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud of the action taken by the \nSenate today. This vote was what serving in the Senate is really \nabout--having the courage to do what is right, refusing to pass the \nbuck to the States, standing up to special interest groups and voting \nour conscience. Once it become obvious that proponents of this \nconstitutional amendment planned to use the annual surpluses in the \nSocial Security trust fund to mask the true deficit, the so-called \nbalanced budget amendment was doomed.\n  If this vote had been a secret ballot, it would have been lucky to \nget 40 votes. This is a lesson in why you don't amend the Constitution \nby taking a poll.\n  I have commended many of my colleagues for voting against the so-\ncalled balanced budget amendment. In particular, I believe that the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] and the senior Senator \nfrom Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] should be commended. They were true profiles \nin courage and the country is indebted for their courageous leadership.\n\n\n   the proposed constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this has been a historic day in the \nU.S. Congress. This afternoon, each of us casted our vote on whether to \nattach an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would require in the \nstrictest possible terms a balanced Federal budget in the next 7 years. \nAnd I joined my fellow and senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator \nByrd, who led a serious and important battle against the amendment, in \nvoting against this idea. I voted to defend West Virginians from the \nflaws and dangers of this amendment, and to help ensure that our State \nis not forced once again to pay the costs of others' political agendas, \npast mistakes, and potential for reckless harm.\n  Today's vote was another victory for the idea that promises like \nSocial Security should be kept. That Congress should focus on making \nreal choices and setting priorities in dealing with the Federal \nGovernment's budget, instead of using the Constitution to blindly do \nthe job.\n  I have no doubt this idea for a constitutional amendment will be \npushed again. For that reason, I want to outline my concerns again.\n  This proposed constitutional amendment will affect the lives of every \nsingle West Virginian, and every single American--children, parents, \nand grandparents; seniors, workers, and students; our large and small \nbusinesses, and all their workers; the poor and the disabled--everyone. \nSo it is critical that we fully understand what it proposes to do and \nhow it will work.\n  I suggest that we all have to be able to answer a few key questions: \nFirst, can the constitutional balanced budget amendment accomplish its \ngoal of bringing the deficit down to zero in 7 years? Second, how it \nwill accomplish that goal? And third, what are the consequences of \nmoving to a zero deficit over a short period of time? Who will \nsacrifice, what programs will be cut, what programs will be spared?\n  In short, who wins and who loses? That's what West Virginians tell me \nthey want to know about the balanced budget amendment. They're willing \nto participate in a national crusade to get the deficit down--they \nsupported the significant downpayment we made on reducing the deficit \nin 1993. As always, West Virginians are willing to do their fair \nshare--but they want to know what that share will be. They want to know \nup front. And so do I. Before I give you my\n best answers to those three key questions, I want to note why the \nanswers to these questions are essential.\n\n  West Virginia has been told to trust Washington's promises about \nbalancing the budget and cutting taxes in the past, as recently as the \nearly 1980's. We didn't have the say in the matter then, and we were \ndevastated. we don't want to let that happen again. We remember very \nwell what happens when the Federal Government claims it can reduce its \nown costs, and then ignores the costs it foists onto the States.\n  I remember well because I was Governor of West Virginia, when all too \nsimilar promises were made. I watched Congress promise to balance the \nbudget while cutting taxes. I saw what happened in living Color. West \nVirginia's plants shut down and threw working families into \nforeclosures and bankruptcies. Our kids were forced to drop out of \ncollege because tuition money had to go to their families' mortgage \npayments and medical expenses. Our senior citizens had to keep their \nthermostats at 58 degrees because they could not afford heating oil. \nWhen I say I want to see the hidden details of this balanced budget \namendment, it is not a political ploy or out of intellectual curiosity.\n  It is because I have a contract with West Virginia. This time around \nI am here in Congress, not working in the State House, and I insist \nthat West Virginia be told how this is going to be done. I insist on \nbehalf of the residents of West Virginia. West Virginians take their \nright to know so seriously that the West Virginia Legislature passed a \nbipartisan resolution on February 14, 1995, reaffirming the importance \nof their right to know the details of the balanced budget amendment.\n  The West Virginia resolution urged Congress to submit:\n\n       [A] Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment to the States \n     for ratification only if Congress provides a detailed \n     projection of what reductions will be made in the Federal \n     budget and how these will affect the government and people of \n     West Virginia, including, but not limited to, the effect on \n     Social Security benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, education, \n     highway moneys, including completion of the Appalachian \n     corridor system, and other programs necessary to the health \n     and well-being of the people of our State.\n\n  It's that simple. If you don't tell me how reaching a balanced budget \nis going to be achieved so I can share that information with West \nVirginia, you won't have my vote.\n  Democrats proposed just such an amendment. This amendment, the \ncitizens' right to know amendment, would have given the States and \ntheir residents the right to know how we intend to reach a zero deficit \nby 2002. This improvement was offered by Senator Daschle on behalf of \nour Democratic Senate colleagues. It was summarily rejected, mostly on \nparty lines, early in the debate on the balanced budget amendment.\n  I am both shocked and disappointed that a majority of Members serving \nin the U.S. Senate chose to deny the people whom they represent the \nright-to-know what it would take to reach a balanced budget. And I am \nforced to conclude what a number of Republican leaders have stated \npublicly is the case, they believe that if the people knew what it \nwould take to balance the budget--they might not support the \nconstitutional amendment.\n  The Senate also considered a proposed revision to this constitutional \namendment to protect Social Security's trust funds. I voted for that \nidea, and watched my colleagues in support of the amendment proceed to \nvote to not protect Social Security. How can West Virginians--working \npeople and seniors--trust their elected officials when they pay into a \ntrust fund that's supposed to be dedicated only to Social Security, and \nsee this rejection of the idea of keeping that promise. The failure of \nthis constitutional amendment to protect Social Security is a reason \nalone to reject it.\n  In fact, surveys of public opinion show over and over again that \nsupport for this amendment plummets to 32 percent when they learn that \nSocial Security could be cut. I want to be clear. The constitutional \namendment before the Senate today could lead to cuts in Social \nSecurity, and if it had prevailed, I am sure it would result in cuts in \nSocial Security.\n  Having said that, let us turn to the key questions: Can the amendment \ndo what its exponents claim and how, and what does that mean?\n  [[Page S3364]] Question 1--Can the constitutional amendment achieve a \nbalanced budget by 2002?\n  A careful reading of the actual legislative language of the balanced \nbudget amendment makes clear the amendment alone will do nothing to \nbalance our budget. It will not make us any smarter or wiser, or fairer \nwhen it comes time to proceed with the actual budget bills required to \nmake tangible progress toward deficit reduction.\n  This Congress does not need a constitutional amendment to perform its \njob of deficit reduction and fiscal prudence. Nothing in this provides \nCongress with any new authority to reduce the deficit, make tough \nbudget cuts, or increase revenues. What the amendment says is that the \nConstitution requires Congress to balance the budget--and little more. \nProvisions are included which permit waiving the balanced budget \nrequirements, but they have extraordinary hurdles attached to them in \nthe form of supermajority rollcall votes. Other unprecedented \nprovisions in this amendment would\n rewrite our Constitution's system of checks and balances, in addition \nto the provisions which upset the fundamental principles of majority \nrule.\n\n  The amendment does not lay out explicit definitions of what should or \nshould not be counted in tallying up the deficit, or reducing it. It \ndoesn't protect any program, not Social Security, not Medicare, not \ndefense, not veterans, not children's programs, not disaster aid.\n  Congress already has the power to reduce the deficit. It doesn't need \nthe algebra of fiscal policy written into the Constitution to do its \njob. And some of us in Congress, myself and my fellow West Virginian, \nthe great Senator Byrd included, have stepped up to the plate and \nhelped reduce the deficit. Congress has proven it can reduce the \ndeficit on its own. We proved that in 1993 during the budget \nreconciliation debate--and we should all learn from that lesson. That \ncongressional budget resolution, not a constitutional dictate, reduced \nthe deficit. And Congress can and should reduce the deficit again. We \nshould make our choices about how to do it prudently. We should take \ninto consideration the benefits provided by certain Government programs \nand services, from Medicare to veterans benefits to public health \nprograms to environmental protection. But continue on the path of \ndeficit reduction we can and must.\n  In 1993, when the Vice President had to cast the final Senate vote \nfor the President's budget to put us over the edge and ensure we made a \nsizeble downpayment on the deficit, Democrats voted to streamline and \ncut popular Federal programs, to ask individual Americans to contribute \nto our national effort to reduce the deficit, and to increase Federal \nrevenues where appropriate.\n  That vote was about real deficit reduction--not a popular gimmick, \nnot a quick constitutional fix that pretends to reduce the deficit, but \nis nothing more than a soundbyte so we can say we've resolved to get \nour financial house in order.\n  Should a balanced budget amendment pass this year, the national \ndeficit for 1995 will be exactly the same tomorrow as it is today, even \nif this constitutional balanced budget amendment were to pass \noverwhelmingly. That fact seems to have been obscured by much of the \ntalk surrounding this amendment.\n  The truth is that those who believe we need to start making the tough \nchoices about how to reduce the deficit won't find any tough choices in \nthe actual amendment. Indeed, I would argue that this amendment is an \neasy way out--it allows Members to declare their support for a balanced \nbudget amendment, and lets them avoid the question of how we're going \nto do it. That's a copout in my book. And it is a huge step backward \nfrom the progress we made under the administration's 1993 budget that \nput us on the path to a reduced deficit with explicit, program-by-\nprogram cuts.\n  A specific budget plan that details how we will achieve a balanced \nbudget is the only real way to reduce the deficit and balance the \nbudget--with or without this constitutional amendment. We have seen no \nsuch plan from the Republican majority during the debate of this \namendment, although the new majority leader has shared his speculation \nabout the level of some cuts which might be necessary with some news \norganizations.\n  Just this week, the new chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nPackwood, has speculated what kind of cuts would be necessary out of \nthe health care programs for the elderly and disabled, and for poor \nchildren and pregnant women--$250 billion out of Medicare and Medicaid \nover the next 5 years, and some $400 billion over the full 7-year \ntimeframe to reach balance. That's late breaking news from some of the \nRepublican leaders and it raises real questions about why we have been \nprovided with so little in terms of hard numbers to date.\n  I know West Virginia seniors, rural hospitals, the disabled, and \ndoctors who care for Medicare and Medicaid patients will be \nsignificantly affected by the unprecedented cuts described by Senator \nPackwood. But even as the new congressional leadership begins to give \nus real numbers about what will be required of certain programs--I have \nheard very little about how they are going to make those cuts--which \nproviders' rates will be cuts, how much more seniors will pay out-of-\npocket, if children can still count on receiving basic health care \nservices, and so on. The lack of details has been astounding.\n  Question 2--How will we achieve the goal of a balanced budget in 7 \nyears?\n  My answer to question 1 was that the constitutional amendment would \nnot, of and unto itself, balance the budget. It merely says we have to \ndo it. The only answer I can offer to question 2 is those in control of \nthe numbers haven't told us how they will achieve the goal. They just \nsay they will. They say ``trust us.'' That is it. Thats all the detail \nyou get from the amendment.\n  True, by thinking about the basic components of the Federal budget, \nyou can start figuring out what programs will take major hits under a \nbalanced budget amendment--the health programs, Medicare and Medicaid, \nSocial Security if Congress reneges on its ephemeral promise to protect \nit. Even the staff of the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Domenici's staff, has concluded that over $664 billion\n in cuts will be required in non-Social Security, non-defense mandatory \nentitlement programs to reach a zero deficit by the year 2002. That's \nnearly $100 billion in cuts every year if you spread it out. But they \nwill not tell you how.\n\n  I want to take a moment to explain a couple of very important \namendments to the balanced budget resolution, and my views of them. You \nwill recall that the Democratic amendment to exempt the Social Security \nProgram from the calculations of the constitutional balanced budget \namendment was rejected by a majority of Members. I voted for that \ninitial amendment to protect Social Security because I saw it as a way \nto protect Social Security--and other--people from unfair harm, from \nbroken promises, and for the sound financial reason that Social \nSecurity has not contributed to our deficit problems. It is a trust \nfund.\n  During the amendment process, I also voted for additional protections \nfor other vital programs as well, but that approach to protecting \ncertain populations from the ravages of the balanced budget amendment \nfailed.\n  Recognizing that a series of those protective amendments failed to \nwin passage, I could not vote for the substitute balanced budget \namendment offered by Senator Feinstein. The amendment has the laudable \ngoal of, once again, attempting to protect Social Security \nbeneficiaries as I voted to do earlier in this process, but it still \nwould have required a balanced budget in a 7-year timeframe. This \namendment would still put a straitjacket on the country's economic and \nbudget policy, it could still cause the devastating effects that the \nmain proposal before us poses for West Virginians and the rest of \nAmericans. It still could turn a period of high unemployment into a \nrecession. In protecting Social Security, but serving as the same \nspeeding train, the Feinstein amendment might also mow down benefits \nfor war-injured veterans, Medicare payments that rural hospitals depend \non to survive, the programs that help create jobs in our communities, \nfunds for our schools. Had the Feinstein amendment prevailed, it would \nhave forced even more draconian cuts in services and benefits where \n[[Page S3365]] they shouldn't be made. You can be sure that I will \nfight as hard as anyone to protect Social Security, but slapping a \nbalanced budget amendment onto the Constitution is not the way to do \nthat.\n  Many Members also claim they want to protect defense from cuts as a \nresult of the balanced budget, but haven't made any hard promises that \nthey will do it. Other programs like veterans compensation and health \ncare were not protected during the amendment process either--despite my \noffering what I believe to be a very surgical way to protect a special \ncategory of particularly needy and deserving veterans. It failed. \nVeterans have no guarantees that they are safe from the balanced \nbudget's requirements for cuts.\n  And that leads us to question three.\n  Question 3--What are the consequences for our families, for our \nbusinesses, and for our States, of balancing the budget in 7 years?\n  Even if one accepts the lack of specific information regarding how we \nwould actually reach a balanced budget, one of the things Congress is \nalways responsible for doing is assessing the consequences of our \nactions. That's impossible to do without the detailed plan or road map \nof how we are going to get from here to there.\n  The amendment itself has been the subject of serious debate over the \nlast few weeks in the U.S. Senate. Much of that debate has been a \ndirect result of the tremendous effort and careful analysis of the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, Robert C. Byrd--we all owe him a \ndebt of gratitude for the numerous illuminations he has provided. And I \nthank each of my colleagues for their various contributions and \ncommentary on a whole list of amendments which have been offered as \nmodifications to the amendment. I would like to be able to point to a \nsingle strengthening amendment beyond the limitation of how the courts \ncan intervene in setting our budgetary and tax policies, but cannot.\n  But I do honestly believe that the Senate has come to understand what \nis decipherable from the text of the amendment, and the intent of its \nproponents, because of this debate--even though we have not been \nprovided the critical road map which would show us how we would achieve \nthe balance of the Federal budget. What we do know about how this \namendment would work is troubling to me as well.\n  It astounds me to see Senators voting for this amendment without \nknowing how this amendment affects their States and our citizens, how \nvulnerable populations like children and seniors would fare under this \namendment. I believe the citizens of West Virginia deserve to know how \nthis amendment will affect their daily lives, the safety of the water \nthey drink, the quality of the air they breathe, the health care \nservices they need, the student loans their children need to make \ncollege affordable, and the roads which they drive on to get to and \nfrom work every day.\n  They deserve to know how this amendment will affect the basics of \ntheir daily lives--and because the majority voted down the right to \nknow amendment offered by the minority leader they will not know. They \ncannot know because Congress does not know. All Congress knows is the \namendment will constitutionally mandate us to find a way to make sure \nwe do not spend any more than we take in every year--that's the only \nassurance in the entire amendment--every other provision is a maybe.\n  The cost-shifting that the balanced budget would cause to families \nand businesses in my State of West Virginia and in every State is \nmammoth. Statistics compiled by the Treasury Department, by the \nrespected Wharton School, and by the Center for Budget and Policy \nPriorities, among others, give us a picture of how the amendment will \naffect our citizens even in the absence of detailed numbers, and \nprogram by program explanations.\n  The different analyses I have seen tell us that under the balanced \nbudget amendment, in West Virginia, 22,000 jobs will be lost, personal \nincome will drop, health care services will be limited, and State and \nlocal taxes will have to be increased by over 20 percent to compensate \nfor lost Federal dollars.\n  The studies show that the State of West Virginia would have to raise \nits State and local taxes 20.6 percent across the board to compensate \nfor the funds it would lose under the balanced budget amendment; that \n22,000 jobs are projected to be lost in West Virginia as a result of \nthe balanced budget amendment (in 2003); that personal income in West \nVirginia is projected to drop by 8 percent as a result of the balanced \nbudget amendment (in 2003); that the balanced budget amendment and the \nHouse contract's fiscal agenda would result in a loss of $96 million in \nFederal grants in 1996--which is $53 per resident.\n  West Virginia would lose $322 million in 1998, $175 per resident of \nWest Virginia.\n  West Virginia would lose $841 million in 2002, $457 per person in \nWest Virginia.\n  West Virginia Medicare benefits would be cut by $824 million per year \n(by the year 2002), and total over $3 billion cumulatively.\n  West Virginia Medicaid funding would be cut by $488 million per year \n(by the year 2002).\n  Those projections provide a pretty stark picture of the consequences \nof this amendment. They tell me I cannot support this balanced budget \namendment. And they raise a whole lot of additional questions about how \nthis amendment will affect our national economy. How will the amendment \naffect West Virginia's economic recovery, and the economic future of \nour States? How will our most vulnerable populations fare under the \namendment? How will defense be treated in the process? What kind of \ncuts, reforms, or increased revenues are necessary to take us from \ntoday's deficit, (which has steadily\n been reduced over the last 3 years for the first time since Harry \nTruman was President due to Democratic budget initiatives), to a zero \ndeficit and how will we maintain that during natural disasters, \nrecessions, or national security threats? How will we get from here to \nthere?\n\n  These are more of the kind of questions that West Virginians have \ncalled my office asking me and my staff. These are the kind of \nquestions I want hard answers to before I vote in favor of any balanced \nbudget amendment. Because this is such a serious matter, amending the \ndocument which enshrines our Nation's guiding principles and which is \nour Nation's organic law, I would like to list a series of additional \nconcerns about the amendment which the Senate debate of recent weeks \nhas only served to highlight.\n  In some cases, we have had assurances from the amendments' proponents \nthat some of these concerns will be met in implementing legislation, or \nbecause there is strong support for certain programs. But West \nVirginians have no guarantee of anything under this amendment. I cannot \ncast my vote on a constitutional amendment based on personal assurances \nof Members, even those from Members for whom I have the utmost regard. \nI have to cast my vote based on the actual language of the \nconstitutional amendment and it remains deeply troubling to me.\n  First, I reiterate, nothing in the balanced budget amendment makes \ngovernment more efficient, less wasteful, or stops unnecessary \nspending. Only specific legislation, like the President's own deficit \nreduction initiative, which passed without a solitary Republican vote, \ncan do that. The debate makes it sound like this amendment is a magic \nbullet to our perplexing budget dilemmas.\n  Second, this amendment would result in big increases in State and \nlocal taxes. One Governor concludes that without seeing the plan for \nhow balancing the budget will be accomplished, this amendment should be \nconsidered a vote to raise State and local taxes. He dubbed the \nexisting amendment a ``trickle down tax increase''.\n  Third, the balanced budget amendment is bad economic policy. Basic \neconomics tells us the size of the deficit is directly related to the \nhealth of the economy. The deficit rises when the economy weakens--but \ntemporary increases in the deficit act as automatic economic \nstabilizers. When family and business incomes decline, their tax \nliabilities decline more than proportionately. The resulting deficit \nmeans the government is paying out more than it takes in, \ncounterbalancing the fall in the economy. This is true on the spending \nside as well. For example, when workers lose their jobs, higher \noutlays \n[[Page S3366]] for unemployment, Medicaid, and other programs help fill \nthe gap in family budgets, and in overall economic activity, until the \neconomy or people's individual situations improve. If a balanced budget \nwere required every year, that cushioning effect would not be there.\n  A balanced budget amendment would force us to cut spending or raise \ntaxes to eliminate increases in the deficit caused by a slowing \neconomy. Our fiscal policies would make the natural swings in the \neconomy more pronounced--recessions will be deeper and longer.\n  The proposed super-majority vote that would permit a deficit to exist \nduring times of economic weakness is ineffective. Congress would have \nto be more prescient than private sector forecasters in order to \ndevelop the needed consensus to waive the strict balanced budget \nrequirement.\n  Fourth, the amendment does not adequately address how it will be \nenforced--making it either unenforceable or turning over enforcement to \nthe courts or the President. The amendment would fundamentally \nrestructure the balance of power set forth in the Constitution and \ncould still empower unelected judges to raise taxes or cut spending, \ndespite a restriction placed on the courts in an amendment offered by \nSenator Nunn in the closing moments of this debate. If the amendment \nwere deemed unenforceable, respect for the Constitution would be \nseverely diminished and rule of law would be undermined.\n  The question of who will enforce this amendment has not been \nadequately answered by its proponents. Will it be the courts or the \nPresident--or is it intended not to be enforceable? Placing an \nunenforceable amendment in our Nation's charter would result in \ncountless constitutional violations and make all other constitutional \nrights, by extension, violable as well.\n  Judicial involvement in the budgetary process would be unprecedented, \neven for declaratory judgments, and yet the balanced budget amendment \nsignificantly increases judicial authority. Under this amendment, \njudges may be the ones asked to make the hard choices about that the \nCongress is accountable for making today--and I strongly believe judges \nlack the institutional capacity to make those decisions. It's wholly \ninappropriate to shift that duty to them.\n  The Constitution's decision to give the ``power of the purse'' to the \nlegislature was not made lightly. This amendment could transfer some of \nthat power to the courts.\n  Fifth, rules for fiscal policy should not be written into the \nConstitution.\n The Constitution is a miraculous document precisely because it \nestablishes transcendent national ideals and freedoms and the structure \nof our Government, without micromanaging its performance. It sets \nindividual rights and creates a system of separation of powers, our \nchecks and balances, which protect against any one branch of government \nbecoming too powerful.\n\n  Fiscal policies respond to current economic conditions and the \nstructure of the economy--those conditions and structures are \nconstantly changing and should not be restricted to today's needs. \nFiscal policy should reflect a constantly changing economic \nenvironment, not written in stone in the Constitution.\n  Sixth, the amendment violates the our traditionally democratic \nprinciple of majority rule. The amendment requires a three-fifths \nsupermajority vote to pass a law that allows deficit spending or a debt \nincrease. For more than two centuries, the Constitution has only \nrequired a supermajority vote for measures vetoed by the President. \nGiving a minority the power to absolutely block legislative action \nwould be an unprecedented undermining of majority rule. The wholesale \ntransfer of power from the majority to the minority in cases where \nthere is a recession, need to respond to an international or natural \ncrisis, or to extend the Treasury's ability to borrow to pay the \ngovernment's bills should not be permitted.\n  Seventh, the balanced budget amendment will create uncertainty about \nthe reliability of government services and obligations. There is a real \npractical difficulty in insuring the government's budget is balanced \nevery year. If estimates are inaccurate (as they can very well be) and \nmid-year revised projections show a deficit by year's end--where will \nthe money to compensate for the deficit come from? Interest payments \ncan't be defaulted on, cutting entitlement programs like Medicare with \nmillions of beneficiaries count on would be extremely unpopular, \nespecially in the circumstance that there is very little notice--which \nmeans discretionary programs would probably take the mid-year hit. \nDiscretionary programs like student loans could be totally shut down.\n  In sum, this constitutional amendment is the most expansive amendment \nto our Constitution brought to a vote in both Houses in the last 206 \nyears. The amendment is almost as long as the entire Bill of Rights, \nand it would embed fiscal policy in our Constitution. It's called the \nbalanced budget amendment but does nothing more than say we should \nbalance the budget--the amendment is misnamed, it should be called the \n``Let's Use the Constitution to Promise We Will Balance the Budget \nAmendment.''\n  When the rhetoric of the virtues of financial responsibility or \nbalance has to be translated into action which will cut the deficit, it \nwill mean across the board cuts in programs which millions of Americans \nrely on for their health care and nutritional needs, to help send their \nchildren to college, to improve their highways and bridges, and to \nprotect our environment. It dodges the toughest questions of how we can \nget our national health care costs, private and public, under control--\nand that is both a fundamental flaw of this amendment and a disgrace. \nIn my judgment it will hurt West Virginians and have the harshest \neffect on the most vulnerable people in my State and in our country. I \ncannot in good conscience vote for this amendment.\n  But I can, and will, continue my efforts to reduce the deficit, and \nto make government programs more responsive to those they serve, and to \neliminate duplication and waste as we strive to make government leaner \nand more efficient, and to manage the costs of priority government \nprograms. A lion's share of that work will be in finally dealing with \nhealth care costs and access problems that we failed to address, in \npart, because the importance of comprehensive health care reform to \ngetting our national deficit under control was not sufficiently \nunderstood.\n  I will continue to be willing to stand up and cast the tough votes if \nthey are necessary to improve our Nation's overall economic health. But \nI cannot vote for this amendment because my constituents have been \ndenied the basic information about how this amendment would affect \ntheir daily lives. In the absence of real information of its \nconsequences, I have had to piece together the effects based on common \nsense assumptions of what will happen. I am dismayed that there has \nbeen a almost uniform refusal to improve this amendment to address the \nreal concerns which have been raised.\n  It seems appropriate to reflect upon the words of our Founders. I \nclose with the words of Thomas Jefferson who drafted the venerable \nConstitution which this amendment proposes to radically alter. Thomas \nJefferson said:\n\n       I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of \n     society but the people themselves; and if we think them not \n     enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome \n     discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to \n     inform their discretion.\n\n  That is a perpetual responsibility of Congress and the business we \nshould be getting about today.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3325-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3366-S3367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           THE 159TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF TEXAS\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think the relevance of what I am \ngoing to talk about today will be brought into what has just happened. \nThe historic opportunity that we had that was missed actually falls on \nthe 159th anniversary of the independence of Texas.\n  One of my predecessors in this Chamber, Sam Houston, led the Texas \narmy to victory at San Jacinto on March 2, 1836, his birthday.\n  Today, Texans everywhere celebrate that historic victory, and now \nthat we have joined ranks in the United States, we invite all to join \nus in honoring the victory at San Jacinto.\n  Texans also remember on this day the soldiers who did not live to see \nthat \n[[Page S3367]] victory, because they died a few days earlier at the \nBattle of the Alamo. One hundred eighty-four brave men held the Alamo \nfor 13 days before falling to 6,000 Mexican troops.\n  Following a tradition begun by my recent predecessor, John Tower, on \nthe birthday of our more distant predecessor, Senator Sam Houston, I \nwould like to read a letter sent by the commander of the Alamo, Col. \nWilliam Barret Travis, during the siege. I think it will serve as a \nreminder of how many people spilled blood to make our country what it \nis today:\n\n       To the people of Texas and all Americans in the world--\n     Fellow citizens and Compatriots--I am besieged by a thousand \n     or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have sustained a \n     continual Bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours and have not \n     lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, \n     otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword if the \n     fort is taken. I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, \n     and our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall \n     never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name \n     of Liberty, of patriotism and everything dear to the American \n     character to come to our aid with all dispatch. The enemy is \n     receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to \n     three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is \n     neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as \n     possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due \n     his own honor and that of his country. Victory or death. \n     William B. Travis, The Alamo, 2/24/1836.\n\n  Today is a great day in the history of Texas. I am sorry that it is a \nsad day for America. It will be remembered as the day we did not \ndeclare independence from the debt accumulated over the last 34 years. \nWe did not close the back door to become heroes of future generations, \nbut while the Alamo is just a memory in our minds, we will be back to \nfight the battle of the balanced budget amendment. We will amend our \nConstitution, and we will do the right thing some day.\n  So while I am not able to celebrate the vote that just happened on \nthis floor a few minutes ago, perhaps we will remember the lesson of \nthe Alamo and perhaps we will remember that it was those who died at \nthe Alamo, who thought they had failed to hold that bastion that paved \nthe way for the success of the Battle of San Jacinto.\n  Mr. President, our Battle of San Jacinto has yet to come on the \nbalanced budget amendment, but it will. It will come, and we will do \nwhat is right for the future generations of our country. The battle has \njust begun. Today was the Alamo and San Jacinto will follow.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to commend the able Senator from \nTexas on what she has had to say about the Alamo. I am very pleased \nthat South Carolina played a big part in that historic event. William \nBarret Travis, the commander at the Alamo, was born in Edgefield County \nin South Carolina, the county in which I was born. He was a brave \nsoldier. He fought to the end. Every person there was killed.\n  James Bonham, another man prominent to the Alamo, was also born in \nEdgefield County, SC. So we are proud that South Carolina has played a \nbig part in the history of Texas. They saw they could not win over the \nMexicans, they were overpowered. James Bonham asked for permission to \ngo out in the countryside to search for reinforcements. He had to fight \nthrough the Mexican lines to get out. He could find no help. He fought \nto get back to the Alamo.\n  He came back to the fort and fought to his death. He knew they would \ndie because they did not have enough support. Again, I want to commend \nthe able Senator from Texas for telling us about the history of the \nAlamo.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me just say that the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, as usual, is right. The people of South Carolina did \ncome and die at the Alamo. They were very much an important part of the \nindependence of Texas.\n  I want to say that there were people from Tennessee, Kentucky, and \nGeorgia who also played a major part. I would not be standing here \ntoday as the Senator from Texas but for the blood of those great men \nwho migrated from the East and came over and were a very important part \nof the history of our Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Feingold pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n83 are located in today's Record under ``Submissions of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, all of Vermont is saddened today by the \nloss of a great leader in agriculture, George Dunsmore.\n  George was a strong advocate for Vermont agriculture. He worked \ntirelessly promoting it here and abroad, and fighting for it in the \nlegislatures of Montpelier, VT and Washington, DC.\n  In addition to serving in the State legislature, he had two tenures \nas Commissioner of Agriculture. Under his leadership the high quality \nimage of Vermont food and agricultural products has flourished. George \nalways looked for ways to find new markets for Vermont products. He \nknew that it was important for Vermont and New England to look beyond \nour Nation's borders to the export market.\n  George understood Vermont agriculture so well because he was a part \nof it. A dairy farmer in Franklin County, he worked both on the farm \nand in Montpelier for many years.\n  He also understood how Washington worked. He was a leader in the \nNational Association of State Departments of Agriculture. He also \nserved as the agricultural specialist for my good friend Jim Jeffords \nwhen he was a Member of the House of Representatives.\n  George was a strong supporter of the State's dairy industry and the \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact. I think it is fitting that Senator \nJeffords and I introduce this measure, Senate Joint Resolution 28, \ntoday and do so in memory of him.\n  Whether he was defending the purity of Vermont's maple products, \nlooking for new markets for our apple growers or fighting for higher \nprices for dairy farmers, George was always a true advocate for \nagriculture.\n  My deepest sympathies go to his wife Bette Ann, and their three \nchildren.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3366-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3367-S3368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    TO MY FATHER, BY PETER TORRIERI\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to call the attention of our \ncolleagues to a very moving poem by my good friend Peter Torrieri of \nBaltimore. ``To My Father'' is a tribute not only to those of Italian-\nAmerican heritage, but also to all of those who crossed the seas to \nestablish families in this great Nation of ours. The immigrant legacy, \ndeeply rooted in our history as Americans, is a facet of our society \nthat should inspire pride and honor.\n  Peter Torrieri's father, Domenico, came to America during the wave of \nimmigration in the early 1900's. His dream of a better life for \nhimself, his wife, and their children was one that he would see slowly \ncome to fruition. The sacrifices made by the entire Torrieri family \nillustrate both the strong work ethic displayed by so many immigrant \nfamilies and the bonds of love and devotion that connect their family.\n  Domenico Torrieri, then a young man far from his home of Abruzzo, \nlabored day in and day out all for the benefit of his family. Peter's \npoem shows the highest respect and esteem for his father and for all of \nthe fathers and mothers who made this pilgrimage to the New World, \nhopeful that their journey would lead them to a bright future.\n  Peter and his wife Mary are leaders in Maryland's Italian-American \ncommunity, playing important roles in preserving and passing on their \nheritage to the next generation as well as working tirelessly on behalf \nof community, health and civic organizations. As the son of immigrants \nand as an American who remains deeply devoted to my ethnic heritage, I \ninvite all of our colleagues to read Peter's poem, which pays homage to \nhis father and to all those who sailed the seas in search of a new life \nin America.\n  I ask unanimous consent the poem be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S3368]]\n\n  There being no objection, the poem was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              To My Father\n\n     I praise you, my father, and all your brothers a million \n           strong,\n     You, dauntless ones who crossed the ocean vast at the early \n           dawn of the century,\n     Came from distant lands, and gained free access to our \n           friendly shores,\n     You, challengers of water and wind and the unknown in search \n           of bread and honest toil.\n     I praise you, Domenico, my father, who shared\n     Your scant bread with me and gave me the sweat of your brow.\n     I praise you and your brothers a million strong,\n     You, anonymous, unrecognized, unsung ones,\n     The laborers, the toilers, the workers, the builders of \n           America.\n\n     I honor you, my father, and all your brothers a million \n           strong,\n     You, amorphous neglected masses who slept on the earth bare,\n     Tamed the sooty demons in the coal mines, pushed the plows in \n           the furrows,\n     Made the deserts bloom, and the stingy soils yield copious \n           crops,\n     Hammered the spikes that held the rails that span the \n           continent,\n     And raised the skyscrapers that flirt with the sky.\n     I honor you, my father, and all your brothers a million \n           strong,\n     The laborers, the toilers, the workers, the builders of \n           America.\n\n     I acclaim you, my father, and all your brothers a million \n           strong,\n     You, red-eyed-from-soot-and-sweat, bare-chested smiths\n     Who wrought the steel that forged the spine and backbone of \n           our mighty cities\n     And powerful industries and ships that sailed the seven seas;\n     Who dug the subways and laid the roadbeds of the spacious \n           highways;\n     Who quarried the stones that raised the monuments, the \n           cathedrals, the museums,\n     And the schools that taught brawn and brain, races and creeds \n           to amalgamate.\n     I acclaim you, my father, and all your brothers a million \n           strong,\n     The laborers, the toilers, the workers, the builders of \n           America.\n\n     I bow before you, my father, in both humility and pride.\n     You were just sixteen when your mother, crying,\n     Gave you her blessings and kissed you good-bye.\n     Good-bye.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \npay tribute to a leader in the law enforcement field, Sheriff Johnny \nMack Brown from Greenville, SC.\n  Sheriff Brown's community-oriented approach to law enforcement has \nproved an effective and innovative way to help maintain law and order. \nThanks to Sheriff Brown, agencies from across the country travel to \nobserve this concept of bringing law enforcement back into the \ncommunity.\n  Mr. President, it gives me great pride to see South Carolinians hard \nat work insuring that our State remains a safe place to raise a family \nand conduct business. Sheriff Brown has taken a bold stance against \ncrime.\n  ``We must not, we cannot fall into the trap of believing we are there \nto do law enforcement work for the community. We are there to do law \nenforcement work with the community,'' advised Sheriff Brown in a 1993 \nnewsletter for the National Sheriff's Association.\n  Johnny Mack Brown has been recognized as a leader by his colleagues \nboth at the national and State level. In 1993 he served as president of \nthe National Sheriff's Association and from 1989-91 he was commissioner \nfor the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, Inc. \nAnd, under the leadership of Sheriff Brown, the Greenville County \nSheriff's Department was the first to achieve accreditation from the \ncommission in 1988. He also served as president of the South Carolina \nSheriff's Association in 1983.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to commend Sheriff Johnny Mack Brown's \ndedication to improving the community. His efforts will have a lasting \neffect not only in South Carolina but across the country.\n  Recently, the Greenville News wrote of the Greenville County \nsheriff's exemplary law enforcement methods as a model for the country. \nI ask unanimous consent that the article be made a part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                National Study Looks at Sheriff's Office\n\n                           (By Bryan Gilmer)\n\n       The Greenville County Sheriff's Office is one of 12 law \n     enforcement agencies nationwide being studied for its \n     innovative use of community law enforcement strategies, a \n     researcher said.\n       Community law enforcement includes getting law officers \n     heavily involved with communities where they work a permanent \n     beat. Then, rather than just responding to calls when trouble \n     arises, the officer can work with community members to solve \n     underlying problems that cause crime.\n       Gerald L. Williams, who teaches at Sam Houston State \n     University in Huntsville, Texas, spent Thursday and Friday \n     interviewing deputies and their commanders at the Sheriff's \n     Office and touring the county.\n       In his research project, Williams and a colleague from the \n     University of Kentucky are each examining six agencies. Their \n     research is funded by a grant from the National Institute of \n     Justice.\n       ``This was the only sheriff's department that was \n     selected,'' Williams said. ``It's difficult to be objective \n     when you come into an organization like this one and you see \n     the wonderful things they're doing. It's difficult to remain \n     distant and not become a real cheerleader.''\n       Williams said he's gathered good information during his \n     visit.\n       ``One of the things that is really key to me is that I've \n     been absolutely impressed with the amount of enthusiasm that \n     exists in the people I've talked to, and a commitment toward \n     community-oriented law enforcement here. There's a true sense \n     of, `We're going to make this work.'''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3368-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3368-S3369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COMMISSIONER TILLMAN HILL\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, on March 16, a community committee will \nhold a special event to recognize the many contributions and hard work \nof Madison County, AL District One Commissioner Tillman Hill. Proceeds \nfrom this most-deserved event honoring an outstanding public servant \nwill go to the Hazel Green Public Library Building Fund. Commissioner \nHill opened this library at its temporary location in 1991.\n  The library is Tillman Hill's pride and joy, and it is entirely \nfitting and appropriate for his community to thank him by raising funds \nfor the facility he has supported and been instrumental in \nestablishing. He has always remembered his roots and has never \nforgotten his people's needs. Today, the Hazel Green Library checks out \nmore books than any other rural branch in Madison County--over 40,000 \nvolumes in 1994. Tillman's dream is to build a permanent building for \nthe library on 2 acres of donated land. Plans for a 4,500 square foot \nfacility have already been prepared.\n  Tillman Hill has dedicated his life to serving his community. He is a \nnative son of Madison County, AL, born there, and having attended high \nschool and college there. During the Korean war he was a \nnoncommissioned officer with the 151st Engineering Battalion. Over the \nyears, he has been a member of the Alabama Housing Authority; the \nChamber of Commerce; the Jaycees; and the Lions Club. He is a past \npresident of the Alabama Association of Counties.\n  Tillman is best known as a veteran county commissioner. He was first \nelected in 1976 and has served as a commissioner for 19 years. His \nquest to bring about a county building inspection function is only the \nmost recent of \n[[Page S3369]] his efforts that characterize his expertise and talent \nas a public official. Throughout his career, he has been the driving \nforce behind many other special projects, including the Sharon Johnston \nPark; Chase Industrial Park; an expanded county water system; senior \ncitizen and nutrition centers; low-interest housing loans; the \nrestoration of historic cemeteries; and, of course, the Hazel Green \nPublic Library. Since being appointed a Madison County license \ninspector by Alabama Governor Albert Brewer in 1969, Tillman Hill has \nbeen living proof that one individual's concern and commitment can make \na tremendous and lasting difference in people's lives.\n  I am proud to commend and congratulate my good friend Tillman Hill \nfor his many years of service--service which reflects great credit upon \nhim, his community, and his State. The success of the Hazel Green \nLibrary will long serve as only one testament to his selfless \ndetermination and generosity. He truly embodies the very best of what \npublic service is all about.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3368-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       A TRIBUTE TO THE KNIGHTS OF MALTA FOR WORLDWIDE GOOD DEEDS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at a time when citizen participation and \nvolunteerism are uniquely important in addressing problems of our \nsociety, with the contemplated reduction of governmental expenditures I \nconsider it worthwhile to note the important humanitarian contributions \nof The Sovereign Order Of Malta and its American foundation, the \nAmerican Knights and Dames.\n  Some of the important activities of The Knights of Malta have been \ncalled to my attention by a longstanding friend and distinguished \nPhiladelphia lawyer, Mr. James Binns:\n\n       (1) This year the Order plans to support the Medical \n     Research Center of New York University, for finding and \n     improving the care, and prevention of Parkinson's Disease and \n     Movement Disorders, which unfortunately affects more and more \n     people every day.\n       (2) This year also, a 400-bed hospital and a byomedical \n     university is now under construction in Frosinone, Italy, for \n     all students from throughout the world.\n       (3) For Christmas 1994 the Order donated food, toys and \n     clothing to an entire orphanage in Oradea, Rumania.\n       (4) In 1992 in the State of Nueva Esparta, Venezuela, the \n     Order donated medical equipment to the Civil Defense and to \n     the Firefighter. In 1993, substantial humanitarian help was \n     sent by the Order to Fiume, Yugoslavia, through the Red \n     Cross.\n       (5) In 1988 a ``Proclamation'' was signed by Prime Minister \n     Yitzchak Shamir, with a special Ambassador of the Order, sent \n     to Israel, to encourage the spirit of ``Vatican II'', that \n     Jews and Christians are brothers and sisters under Almighty \n     God. Further, to uphold through dialogue, commerce and \n     diplomacy, the World Council of Nations to recognize the \n     State of Israel's inherent rights through Her Sovereign \n     History in perpetuity, as stated in the United Nations \n     Resolution of November 29, 1947.\n       (6) In 1984 in Rome, Italy, the Order collected over a \n     million US dollars for the Institute, ``Regina Elena'', \n     specializing in the research of the Hyperthermic Treatment or \n     Cancer.\n       (7) In 1980 the Belgium branch of the Order donated medical \n     assistance to Africa and a special machine to be utilized for \n     the search of water.\n       (8) In 1978, in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, an orphanage for \n     900 children, was founded with complete facilities, including \n     a school up to the 8th grade.\n\n  These humanitarian contributions continue activities of The Knights \nof Malta which originated with the Order of St. John of Jerusalem in \n1099 with assistance to the wounded when the first crusaders arrived at \nthe Holy City.\n  After being expelled from Jerusalem in 1291, the Knights established \na new headquarters of the Order at Limassol in Cyprus until 1309. They \nfortified the city and laid down the armaments regulations for the \nvessels carrying traders and pilgrims to the Holy Land. In doing so, \nthe maritime power of the Order was established and the Mediterranean \nSea was substantially liberated from pirates.\n  The Knights continuously played a significant role with the siege of \nthe Island of Rhodes in 1309, the defeat of the Ottomans who attempted \nto seize Rhodes in 1480 and the later battle with the Ottomans in 1522 \nresulting in the Knights leaving for Candia in 1523. After the Holy \nRoman Emperor Charles V ruler of Spain and Sicily granted the Island of \nMalta to the Order, the Knights of Malta reigned over Malta until 1798. \nAfter the surrender of the Island to Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798, many \nof the Knights returned to their own countries forming different \ncommanderies.\n  During the 19th and 20th centuries, The Knights of Malta sought to \navoid political affairs in order to pursue philanthropic activities \nwhich its 40,000 members do to this day.\n  The Knights of Malta, with its unique history over nine centuries, \nhave established a model for worldwide efforts which should inspire \nother individuals and organizations to do similar good deeds.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3369-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3369-S3370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 THE PEACE PROCESS IN NORTHERN IRELAND\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, last week, British Prime Minister Major and \nIrish Prime Minister Bruton took an important step toward lasting peace \nin Northern Ireland. The two leaders unveiled a framework document \ndesigned to serve as the basis for negotiations on Northern Ireland's \nfuture.\n  I believe it is important to note, as both Mr. Major and Mr. Bruton \nhave, that the framework document is not a done deal or final \nsettlement to be imposed, but a basis for talks among all the parties \nof Northern Ireland. This assurance should go a long way toward putting \nthe various parties on the negotiating track.\n  Both the British and Irish Governments have signaled their \nwillingness to make some difficult compromises in the name of enduring \npeace and reconciliation--compromises that cut to the heart of each \ncountry's traditional constitutional doctrines and that could cost each \ngovernment political support at home. I believe that Mr. Major and Mr. \nBruton should be commended for their courage. Similarly, Irish Foreign \nMinister Dick Spring, who was in Washington yesterday, deserves great \ncredit for his efforts--in providing continuity and credibility to the \nprocess.\n  For its part, the British Government will propose changes to its \nconstitutional legislation to ensure that the will of the majority of \nthe people of Northern Ireland is respected in determining Northern \nIreland's status. Similarly, the Irish Government will introduce and \nsupport proposals to end its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland. \nThe document also proposes to create cross-border institutions, such as \na North/South body with elected representatives from a Northern Ireland \nAssembly and the Irish Parliament.\n  The fate of the process now lies squarely in the hands of the various \nparties in Northern Ireland. I sincerely hope that they will not miss \nthis historic opportunity to create a permanent peace. An editorial in \nMonday's Washington Post makes this point rather well, and I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 27, 1995]\n\n                      Agenda for Northern Ireland\n\n       British Prime Minister John Major and his Irish \n     counterpart, John Bruton, took an important first step last \n     week in opening negotiations for the permanent resolution of \n     the Ulster crisis. The leaders released a frame work for \n     talks that offers a set of opening suggestions they hope will \n     lead to permanent reconciliation.\n       As usual, the Rev. Ian Paisley and his colleagues were not \n     impressed. Blasting the agreement as a conspiracy to force \n     Ulster Protestants into union with the Irish Republic, the \n     68-year-old hard-liner seeks to block talks before they \n     begin. But other, younger men who might have stood with him \n     in year past were more responsive. One leader of a Protestant \n     paramilitary group rejected the Paisley position and \n     announced that he is tired after 25 years of killing, and \n     ready to talk. That sentiment was echoed by a Protestant \n     member of the Senate of Northern Ireland whose own daughter \n     was killed by an IRA bomb. If that view is widespread, there \n     is reason for hope.\n       The framework announced is simply the opening move in what \n     may be a protracted series of negotiations. Devise over 18 \n     months of consultations between the British and Irish \n     governments, the document suggests steps that could be taken \n     to heal divisions in the province. The British, for example, \n     want to create a new legislative assembly in Northern \n     Ireland, with voting procedures that will protect the \n     Catholic minority. The Irish government will support changes \n     in that country's constitution that will revoke legal and \n     political claims to the countries in the North. Both \n     governments suggest the \n     [[Page S3370]] creation of a cross-border authority composed \n     of elected legislators from Ulster and the Republic, which \n     would work together on matters of common interest such as \n     tourism, economic development and environmental regulation. \n     ``These are our ideas,'' Mr. Major stressed, ``but the future \n     is up to [the people of Northern Ireland.]''\n       That last assurance is critical. No steps will be taken \n     without the consent of the governed. There will be \n     parliamentary debates ahead, counterproposals, compromise and \n     eventually referendums. But there is no rush so long as the \n     cease-fire holds, as it now has for many months. Peace has \n     given a whole generation of combatants an idea of what life \n     should be like. Young people who, until last September never \n     experienced a day free of fear that some indiscriminate \n     killer or hidden bomb would destroy then don't want to see \n     the old days return. Neither do most of their elders who have \n     borne the full brunt of the violence.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3369-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3370-S3373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n INTERNATIONALISM OR ISOLATIONISM--A CHOICE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF \n                            AMERICAN LEADERS\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, in the opening words of a major foreign \npolicy address last evening, President Clinton said that ``we live in a \nmoment of hope.''\n  Mr. President, I concur with that sentiment. With the demise of the \ncold war, with the nascent friendship between the United States and \nRussia, and with the emergence of democratic trends across the globe, \nthe world is experiencing a realignment in the fundamental relationship \nbetween states. It is, as the President suggests, a time of \nextraordinary opportunity for the United States.\n  I commend President Clinton for his rejection of an inward-looking \ncourse, and endorse his ambitious call to support international \npeacekeeping, to reduce the nuclear threat by extending indefinitely \nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and implementing other arms \ncontrol agreements, and to be an aggressive player in the global \neconomy. I also ask unanimous consent that the President's speech be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The present circumstances call to mind the watershed period after \nWorld War II. Then, as now, the United States faced a stark challenge: \nwhether to assume the mantle of international leadership and become \nengaged in the establishment of a new diplomatic order, or whether to \nretreat into isolation, comfortably sheltered by two great oceans from \nthe turbulent world of European balance of power politics.\n  Due to the courage and foresight of our political leadership--\nvisionaries such as Harry Truman, George Marshall, Dean Acheson, and \nArthur Vandenberg--America chartered a firm course of internationalism, \nguided by the principle of containment of the Soviet Union. Recognizing \nthe shortsightedness of isolationism, the United States chose not to \nrepeat the mistakes it made in ignoring the League of Nations, and \nbecame a driving force behind and host of the new United Nations. Our \ndecisions then, and in the ensuing decades, solidified our role as the \npreeminent power in world affairs.\n  The changes we have witnessed in the past 6 years are the direct \nresult of the policies we, along with our allies, conceived, refined, \nand implemented during the course of the cold war. None of these \nchanges, however, could have occurred without American leadership and \nengagement.\n  I am therefore troubled by the emerging desire, expressed both in \nCongress and in public fora across the Nation, to retreat from our \ninternational commitments and obligations. And nowhere is this \nsentiment more dangerous and ill-conceived than in the emerging \nobsession with the United Nations.\n  I am now and have been an ardent supporter of the United\n   Nations since 1945, when I was part of the International Secretariat \nof the San Francisco Conference that drew up the U.N. Charter. In the \nyears since then, I have tried to help to make the United Nations \nbecome the effective world organization--the very symbol of the \ninternational community of nations--that was envisioned in the charter.\n\n  I am not so naive as to profess that the United Nations has always \nlived up to its potential. The United States-Soviet rivalry tended at \ntimes to hamstring the Security Council, and U.N. history occasionally \nhas been interspersed with examples of waste and ineffectiveness. But \nfor every example of failure, I can think of numerous countervailing \nexamples of success--Cambodia, El Salvador, Namibia, and countless \nothers. And now that we are entering a new era of cooperation with \nRussia, the Security Council harbors even greater promise for becoming \na first-rate arbiter of international conflict and discord. U.N. \npeacekeeping has helped to serve American interests in the Middle East, \nin Africa, in Latin America, and in Asia. And I know that there will be \nsituations in the future where we will rely on the U.N. peacekeepers to \nsupport our foreign policy aims.\n  Now that we no longer are forced to dedicate such a sizable \nproportion of our resources to the containment of Russia, we can see \nbefore us an entire new range of opportunity for international \ncooperation and prosperity. But the growth industries and salient \npolitical issues of the future--be they in telecommunications, the \nexchange of information, the flow of capital, the sound use of our \nenvironmental resources, or the prevention of the proliferation of \nconventional and unconventional arms--are heading in a direction that \ntranscends national boundaries. If the United States is to keep pace, \nit cannot afford to slide back into inward-looking detachment.\n  In his address, the President set out a challenging and crucially \nimportant arms control agenda. I was quite pleased to note the high \npriority he attaches to achieving the indefinite extension of the Non-\nProliferation Treaty at the conference of the parties beginning next \nmonth. The President has decided to underscore the importance he \nattaches to the preservation of international barriers to nuclear \nproliferation by asking Vice President Gore to lead our delegation. The \nVice President will be ably supported by Ambassador Thomas Graham, Jr., \nand other experts from the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.\n  The President also reaffirmed his commitment to the quick completion \nof a complete ban on nuclear testing. Substantial progress has been \nmade in the negotiations. With a dedicated effort, the remaining \nstumbling blocks can be overcome.\n  I was pleased also that the President attaches high priority to the \nratification of the START II Treaty. The START I and START II effort is \ntruly bipartisan, spanning three administrations. Under the leadership \nof Senator Helms and Senator Lugar, the Committee on Foreign Relations \nis in the\n process of wrapping up hearings started in the last Congress under my \nchairmanship.\n\n  In addition to these priorities, the President told his audience:\n\n       There are other critical tasks we also face if we want to \n     make every American more secure, including winning Senate \n     ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention, negotiating \n     legally binding measures to strengthen the Biological and \n     Toxin Weapons Convention, clarifying the ABM Treaty so as to \n     secure its viability while permitting highly effective \n     defenses against theater missile attacks, continuing to \n     support regional arms control efforts in the Middle East and \n     elsewhere, and pushing for the ratification of conventional \n     weapons which, among other things, would help us to reduce \n     the suffering caused by the tens of millions of antipersonnel \n     mines. * * *\n\n  The President understands that this agenda is both far-reaching and \nimperative. He said:\n\n       Now, in this year of decision, our ambition for the future \n     must be even more ambitious. If our people are to know real \n     lasting security, we have to redouble our arms control, \n     nonproliferation and antiterrorism efforts. We have to do \n     everything we can to avoid living with the 21st century \n     version of fallout shelters and duck-and-cover exercises to \n     prevent another World Trade Center tragedy.\n\n  Mr. President, it is very important to understand that many aspects \nof arms control and nonproliferation are truly bipartisan. To be sure, \nSenators have and have had disagreements. Nonetheless, working together \nin a bipartisan fashion, we have moved steadily forward. During my \nchairmanship of the Committee on Foreign Relations, we were able to \ncraft bipartisan bills, with the strong involvement of Senator Glenn \nand other Members, imposing effective sanctions against both nations \nand individuals engaged in reprehensible activities involving chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear weapons-related activities.\n  [[Page S3371]] It is indicative of the bipartisan nature of our arms \ncontrol efforts that every treaty the committee and the Senate approved \nwhile I was privileged to be chairman won overwhelming support in the \nend. We were careful in every instance to resolve all legitimate \nconcerns along the way to committee and floor consideration, and there \nwas never a question with any of the arms control treaties voted out--\nincluding the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the \nConventional Forces in Europe Treaty, the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, \nthe Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty, and the START II Treaty--that \nthe approval would be well beyond the required two-thirds support.\n  Mr. President, I am gratified that President Clinton has embraced an \nambitious agenda that will merit continued bipartisan support. He will \nthus be able to bring to fruition major initiatives of the Bush \nadministration, as well as his own. The end result will assuredly be a \nsafer, more stable world.\n  It is important to understand that these efforts represent a \ncontinuum in arms control that covers much of the post-World War II \nperiod. Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy initiated the first efforts \nto curb nuclear testing, and each succeeding administration has built \non the successes of its predecessors.\n  Mr. President, I wish that I could say that the major challenges of \narms control and nonproliferation are behind us. Despite the many \nsuccesses, the challenges ahead are formidable. I am extremely pleased \nthat the President is able and willing to face these challenges. I \ntrust that the Congress will continue a truly bipartisan effort to \ncontrol, reduce, and even eliminate weapons of mass destruction.\n  Mr. President, we stand at the cross-roads of history. The tenor of \ncurrent political discourse--focused as it is on disengagement, \nwithdrawal, and neoisolationism--suggests we are heading toward a \ncolossal error in judgment. Those who seek to retreat into a Fortress \nAmerica offer no constructive suggestion for filling the vacuum to be \nleft by America's withdrawal. We would lose our political and moral \nauthority, our ability to exercise influence in matters vital to our \ninterests, and do grave harm to our standing as one of the greatest \npowers in history.\n  In his speech last night, President Clinton mentioned one of the most \ndistinguished members ever to have served in this body--Arthur \nVandenberg--who advanced the principle that politics should stop at the \nwaters edge. But many of our interests, Mr. President, only begin \nthere. I stand behind President Clinton's conviction that America can \nprosper in the next century only through international engagement and \nthe assertion of leadership.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  [From the White House, Office of the Press Secretary, Mar. 1, 1995]\n\n  Remarks by the President to the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom \n                           Policy Conference\n\n       The President. To Tricia and John Taylor, and all the \n     people from the Nixon Center; our distinguished guests from \n     Germany and from Russia; of course, to Henry Kissinger--I was \n     thinking when he said we both spoke with accents, judging \n     from the results of the last election, his native country is \n     still claiming him more than mine is claiming me. (Laughter.) \n     But I'm a big one for reconciliation. (Laughter.) And there's \n     plenty of time to achieve it.\n       I am honored to be here tonight. Just a month before he \n     passed away, President Nixon wrote me the last letter I \n     received from him about his last trip to Russia. I told some \n     people at the time that it was the best piece of foreign \n     policy writing I had received, which angered my staff but \n     happened to be the truth. (Laughter.) And as with all of our \n     correspondence and conversations, I was struck by the rigor \n     of his analysis, the energy of his convictions, and the \n     wisdom of the practical suggestions that he made to me.\n       But more than the specifics of the letter, which basically \n     argued for the imperative of the United States continuing to \n     support political and economic reform in Russia, I was moved \n     by the letter's larger message--a message that ran throughout \n     Richard Nixon's entire public life and all of his prolific \n     writings. President Nixon believed deeply that the United \n     States simply could not be strong at home unless we were \n     strong and prepared to lead abroad.\n       And that made a big impression on me. When I was running \n     for President in 1992, even though there was this little \n     sticker up on the wall of my campaign headquarters that said, \n     ``It's the economy, stupid,'' I always said in every speech \n     that we had to have two objectives. We had to restore the \n     American Dream for all of our people, but we also had to make \n     sure that we move into\n      the next century still the strongest nation in the world, \n     and the world's greatest force for peace and freedom and \n     democracy.\n       Tonight I want to talk about the vital tradition of \n     American leadership and our responsibilities, those which \n     Henry Kissinger mentioned and those which President Nixon \n     recognized so well. Our mission especially I want to \n     discuss--to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons.\n       Today if we are going to be strong at home and lead abroad, \n     we have to overcome what we all recognize I think is a \n     dangerous and growing temptation here in our own land to \n     focus solely on the problems we face here in America. I want \n     to focus on the problems we face here in America. I've tried \n     to do it for the last two years. I look forward to working \n     with this new Republican-led Congress in the next two. But \n     not solely.\n       There is a struggle now going on between those of us who \n     want to carry on the tradition of American leadership and \n     those who would advocate a new form of American isolationism. \n     A struggle which cuts curiously across both party and \n     ideological lines. If we're going to continue to improve the \n     security and prosperity of all our people, then the tradition \n     of American leadership must prevail.\n       We live in a moment of hope. We all know that. The \n     implosion of communism and the explosion of the global \n     economy have brought new freedoms to countries on every \n     continent. Free markets are on the rise. Democracy is \n     ascendant. The slogan says, ``after victory.'' Today, more \n     than ever before, people across the globe do have the \n     opportunity to reach their God-given potential. And because \n     they do, Americans have new opportunities to reach theirs as \n     well.\n       At the same time, the post-Cold War world has revealed a \n     whole web of problems that defy quick or painless solutions--\n     aggression of rogue states, transnational threats like \n     overpopulation and environmental degradation, terrible ethnic \n     conflicts and economic dislocation. But at the heart of all \n     these complex challenges, I believe, lies an age-old battle--\n     for power over human lives. The battle between the forces of \n     freedom and tyranny, tolerance and repression, hope and fear. \n     The same idea that was under attack by fascism and then by \n     communism remains under attack today in different ways all \n     across the world--the idea of the open society of free \n     people.\n       American leadership is necessary for the tide of history to \n     keep running our way, and for our children to have the future \n     they deserve. Yet, there are some who would choose escapism \n     over engagement. The new isolationists oppose our efforts to \n     expand free trade through GATT or NAFTA through APEC and the \n     Summit of the Americas. They reject our conviction that \n     democracy must be nurtured with investment and support, a \n     conviction that we are acting on from the former Soviet Union \n     to South Africa. And some of them, being hypocritical, saying \n     that we must trumpet the rhetoric of American strength; and \n     then at the same time, they argue against the resources we \n     need to bring stability to the Persian Gulf or to restore \n     democracy to Haiti, or to control the spread of drugs and \n     organized crime around the world, or even to meet our most \n     elemental obligations to the United Nations and its \n     peacekeeping work.\n       The new isolationists both on the left and the right would \n     radically revise the fundamentals of our foreign policy that \n     have earned bipartisan support since the end of World War II. \n     They would eliminate any meaningful role for the United \n     Nations which has achieved, for all of its problems, real \n     progress around the world, from the Middle East to Africa. \n     They would deny resources to our peacekeepers and even to our \n     troops, and, instead, squander them on Star Wars. And they \n     would refuse aid to the fledgling democracies and to all \n     those fighting poverty and environmental problems that can \n     literally destroy hopes for a more democratic, more \n     prosperous, more safe world.\n       The new isolationists are wrong. They would have us face \n     the future alone. Their approach would weaken this country, \n     and generated build into a tidal wave. (Applause.)\n       If we withdraw from the world today, mark my words, we'll \n     have to contend with the consequences of our neglect tomorrow \n     and tomorrow and tomorrow. This is a moment of decision for \n     all of us without regard to our party, our background or our \n     accent. This is a moment of decision.\n       The extraordinary trend toward democracy and free markets \n     is not inevitable. And as we have seen recently, it will not \n     proceed easily in an even, uninterrupted course. This is hard \n     work. And at the very time when more and more countries than \n     ever before are working to establish or shore up their own \n     freedom in their fragile democracies, they look to us for \n     support. At this time, the new isolationists must not be \n     allowed to pull America out of the game after just a few \n     hours of debate because there is a modest price attached to \n     our leadership. (Applause.)\n       We know now, as President Nixon recognized, that there must \n     also be limits to \n     [[Page S3372]] America's involvement in the world's \n     problems--limits imposed by clear-headed evaluation of our \n     fundamental interests. We cannot be the world's policeman; we \n     cannot become involved in every problem we really care about. \n     But the choice we make must be rooted in the conviction that \n     America cannot walk away from its interests or its \n     responsibilities.\n       That's why, from our first day in office, this \n     administration has chosen to reach out, not retreat. From our \n     efforts to open markets for America to support democracy \n     around the world, to reduce the threat posed by devastating \n     weapons and terrorists, to maintaining the most effective \n     fighting force in the world, we have worked to seize the \n     opportunities and meet the obligations of this moment.\n       None of this could have happened without a coalition of \n     realists--people in both Houses of Congress and, importantly, \n     people from both parties; people from coast to coast in our \n     towns and cities and communities who know that the wealth and \n     well-being of the United States depends upon our leadership \n     abroad. Even the early leaders of our republic who went to \n     great pains to avoid involvement in great power conflicts \n     recognize not only the potential benefits, but the absolute \n     necessity of engaging with the world.\n       Before Abraham Lincoln was elected President, our farmers \n     were selling their crops overseas, we had dispatched the \n     trade mission all the way to Japan trying to open new \n     markets--some problems don't go away--(laughter)--and our \n     Navy had already sailed every ocean. By the dawn of this \n     century, our growing political and economic power already \n     imposed a special duty on America to lead; a duty that was \n     crystallized in our involvement in World War I. But after \n     that war, we and the other great powers abandoned our \n     responsibilities and the forces of tyranny and hatred filled \n     the vacuum, as is well-known.\n       After the second world war, our wise leaders did not repeat \n     that mistake. With the dawn of the Nuclear Age and the Cold \n     War, and with the economies of Europe and Japan in shambles, \n     President Truman persuaded an uncertain and weary nation, \n     yearning to shift its energies from the front lines to the \n     home front, to lead the world again.\n       A remarkable generation of Americans created and sustained \n     alliances and institutions--the Marshall Plan, NATO, the \n     United Nations, the World Bank, the IMF--the things that \n     brought half a century of security and prosperity to America, \n     to Europe, to Japan and to other countries all around the \n     world. Those efforts and the special resolve and military \n     strength of our own nation held tyranny in check until the \n     power of democracy, the failures of communism, and the heroic \n     determination of people to be free, consigned the Cold War to \n     history.\n       Those successes would not have been possible without a \n     strong, bipartisan commitment to American's leadership.\n       Senator Arthur Vandenburg's call to unite our official \n     voice at the water's edge joined Republicans to Truman's \n     doctrine. His impact was all the more powerful for his own \n     past as an isolationist. But as Vandenburg himself said, \n     Pearl Harbor ended isolationism for any realist.\n       Today, it is Vandenburg's spirit that should drive our \n     foreign policy and our politics. The practical determination \n     of Senators Nunn and Lugar to help Russia reduce its nuclear \n     arsenal safely and securely; the support from Speaker \n     Gingrich and Leader Gephardt, from Chairman Livingston and \n     Representative Obey for aid to Russia and the newly-\n     independent states; the work of Senators Hatfield, Leahy and \n     McConnell, and Chairman Gilman, and Representative Hamilton \n     for peace in the Middle East; the efforts of Senator Warner \n     to restructure our intelligence--all these provide strong \n     evidence of the continuing benefits and vitality of \n     leadership with bipartisanship.\n       If we continue to lead abroad and work together at home, we \n     can take advantage of these turbulent times. But if we \n     retreat, we risk squandering all these opportunity and \n     abandoning our obligations which others have entrusted to us \n     and paid a very dear price to bring to us in this moment in \n     history.\n       I know that the choice to go forward in a lot of these \n     areas is not easy in democracies at this time. Many of the \n     decisions that America's leaders have to make are not popular \n     when they're made. But imagine the alternative. Imagine, for \n     example, the tariffs and barriers that would still cripple \n     the world trading system for years into the future if \n     internationalists coming together across party lines had not \n     passed GATT and NAFTA. Imagine what the Persian Gulf region \n     would look like today if the United States had not stepped up \n     with its allies to stop Iraqi aggression. Imagine the ongoing \n     reign of terror and the flood of refugees at our borders had \n     we not helped to give democracy a second chance in Haiti. \n     Imagine the chaos that might have ensued if we had not moved \n     to help stabilize Mexico's economy. In each case, there was \n     substantial and sometimes overwhelming majority opinion \n     against what needed to be done at the moment. But because we \n     did it, the world has a better chance at peace and freedom. \n     (Applause.)\n       But above all now, I ask you to imagine the dangers that \n     our children and grandchildren, even after the Cold War is \n     over, still can face if we do not do everything we can to \n     reduce the threat of nuclear arms, to curb the terrible \n     chemical and biological weapons spreading around the world, \n     to counter the terrorists and criminals who would put these \n     weapons into the service of evil.\n       As Arthur Vandenburg asked at the dawn of the Nuclear Age, \n     after a German V-1 attack had left London in flames and its\n      people in fear, ``How can there be isolation when men can \n     devise weapons like that?''\n       President Nixon understood the wisdom of those words. His \n     life spanned an era of stunning increases in humankind's \n     destructive capacity, from the biplane to ballistic missiles, \n     from mustard gas to mushroom clouds. He knew that the Atomic \n     Age could never be won, but could be lost. On any list of his \n     foreign policy accomplishments, the giant steps he took \n     toward reducing the nuclear threat must stand among his \n     greatest achievement. As President, I have acted on that same \n     imperative.\n       Over the past two years, the United States has made real \n     progress in lifting the threat of nuclear weapons. Now, in \n     1995, we face a year of particular decision in this era--a \n     year in which the United States will pursue the most \n     ambitious agenda to dismantle and fight the spread of weapons \n     of mass destruction since the atom was split.\n       We know that ours is an enormously complex and difficult \n     challenge. There is no single policy, no silver bullet, that \n     will prevent or reverse the spread of weapons of mass \n     destruction. But we have no more important task. Arms control \n     makes us not only safer, it makes us stronger. It is a source \n     of strength. It is one of the most effective insurance \n     policies we can write for the future of our children.\n       Our administration has focused on two distinct, but closely \n     connected areas--decreasing and dismantling existing weapons, \n     and preventing nations or groups from acquiring weapons of \n     mass destruction, and the means to deliver them. We've made \n     progress on both fronts.\n       As the result of an agreement President Yeltsin and I \n     reached, for the first time in a generation Russian missiles \n     are not pointed at our cities or our citizens. We've greatly \n     reduced the lingering fear of an accidental nuclear launch. \n     We put into force the START I Treaty with Russia that will \n     eliminate from both our countries delivery systems that carry \n     more than 9,000 nuclear warheads--each with the capacity to \n     incinerate a city the size of Atlanta.\n       START I, negotiated by two Republican administrations and \n     put into force by this Democratic administration, is the \n     first treaty that requires the nuclear powers actually to \n     reduce their strategic arsenal. Both our countries are \n     dismantling the weapons as fast as we can. And thanks to a \n     far-reaching verification system, including on-site \n     inspections which began in Russia and the United States \n     today, each of us knows exactly what the other is doing. \n     (Applause.)\n       And, again, through the far-sighted program devised by \n     Senators Nunn and Lugar, we are helping Russia and the other \n     newly-independent states to eliminate nuclear forces in \n     transport, safeguard and destroy nuclear weapons and \n     materiel.\n       Ironically, some of the changes that have allowed us to \n     reduce the world's stockpile of nuclear weapons have made our \n     nonproliferation efforts harder. The breakup of the Soviet \n     Union left nuclear materials dispersed throughout the newly-\n     independent states. The potential for theft of nuclear \n     materials, therefore, increased. We face the prospect of \n     organized criminals entering the nuclear smuggling business. \n     Add to this the volatile mix, the fact that a lump of \n     plutonium the size of a soda can is enough to build a bomb, \n     and the urgency of the effort to stop the spread of nuclear \n     materials should be clear to all of us.\n       That's why from our first day in office we have launched an \n     aggressive, coordinated campaign against international \n     terrorism and nuclear smuggling. We are cooperating closely \n     with our allies, working with Russia and the other newly-\n     independent states, improving security at nuclear facilities, \n     and strengthening multilateral export controls.\n       One striking example of our success is Operation Sapphire, \n     the airlift of nearly 600 kilograms of highly-enriched \n     uranium--enough to make dozens of bombs from Kazakhstan to \n     the United States for disposal. We've also secured agreements \n     with Russia to reduce the uranium and plutonium available for \n     nuclear weapons, and we're seeking a global treaty banning \n     the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons.\n       Our patient, determined diplomacy also succeeded in \n     convincing Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine to sign the Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty and give up the nuclear weapons left on \n     their territory when the Soviet Union dissolved. One of our \n     administration's top priorities was to assure that these new \n     countries would become non-nuclear nations, and now we are \n     also achieving that goal. (Applause.)\n       Because of these efforts, four potential suppliers of \n     ballistic missiles--Russia, Ukraine, China and South Africa--\n     have been agreed to control the transfer of these missiles \n     and related technology, pulling back from the nuclear \n     precipice has allowed us to cut United States defense \n     expenditures for strategic weapons by almost two-thirds, a \n     savings of about $20 billion a year, savings which can be \n     shifted to vital needs such as boosting the readiness of our \n     Armed Forces, reducing the deficit, putting more police on \n     our own streets. By spending millions to keep or take weapons \n     out of the hands of our potential adversaries, we are saving \n     billions in arms costs and putting it to better use.\n\n[[Page S3373]]\n\n       Now, in this year of decision, our ambition for the future \n     must be even more ambitious. If our people are to know real \n     lasting security, we have to redouble our arms control, \n     nonproliferation and antiterrorism efforts. We have to do \n     everything we can to avoid living with the 21st century \n     version of fallout shelters and duck-and-cover exercises to \n     prevent another World Trade Center tragedy.\n       In just four days we mark the 25th anniversary of the Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty. Nothing is more important to prevent \n     the spread of nuclear weapons than extending the treaty \n     indefinitely and unconditionally. And that's why I've asked \n     the Vice President to lead our delegation to the NPT \n     conference this April and to work as hard as we can to make \n     sure we succeed in getting that indefinite extension.\n       The NPT is the principal reason why scores of nations do \n     not now possess nuclear weapons; why the doomsayers were \n     wrong. One hundred and seventy-two nations have made NPT the \n     most widely subscribed arms limitation treaty in history for \n     one overriding reason--it's in their self-interest to do so. \n     Non-nuclear weapon states that sign on to the treaty pledge \n     never to acquire them. Nuclear weapons states vow not to help \n     others obtain nuclear weapons, to facilitate the peaceful \n     uses of atomic energy and to pursue nuclear arms control and \n     disarmament--commitments I strongly reaffirm, along with our \n     determination to attain universal membership in the treaty.\n       Failure to extend NPT indefinitely could open the door to a \n     world of nuclear trouble. Pariah nations with rigid \n     ideologies and expansionist ambitions would have an easier \n     time acquiring terrible weapons, and countries that have \n     chosen to forego the nuclear option would then rethink their \n     position; they would certainly be tempted to reconsider that \n     decision.\n       To further demonstrate our commitment to the goals of the \n     treaty, today I have ordered that 200 tons of fissile \n     material, enough for thousands of nuclear weapons, be \n     permanently withdrawn from the United States nuclear \n     stockpile. (Applause.) Two hundred tons of fissile material \n     that will never again be used to build a nuclear weapon.\n       A second key goal of ours is ratifying START II. Once in \n     effect, that treaty will eliminate delivery systems from \n     Russian and American arsenals that carry more than 5,000 \n     weapons. The major reductions under START I, together with \n     START II, will enable us to reduce by two-thirds the number \n     of strategic warheads deployed at the height of the Cold War. \n     At my urging, the Senate has already begun hearings on START \n     II, and I am encouraged by the interest of the senators from \n     both parties in seeking quick action. I commend the Senate \n     for the action taken\n      so far, and I urge again the approval of the treaty as soon \n     as possible.\n       President Yeltsin and I have already instructed our experts \n     to begin considering the possibility after START II is \n     ratified of additional reductions and limitations on \n     remaining nuclear forces. We have a chance to further lift \n     the nuclear cloud, and we dare not miss it.\n       To stop the development of new generations of nuclear \n     weapons, we must also quickly complete negotiations on a \n     comprehensive test ban treaty. Last month I extended a \n     nuclear testing moratorium that I put into effect when I took \n     office. And we revised our negotiating position to speed the \n     conclusion of the treaty while reaffirming our determination \n     to maintain a safe and reliable nuclear stockpile.\n       We will also continue to work with our allies to fully \n     implement the agreement we reached with North Korea, first to \n     freeze, then do dismantle its nuclear program, all under \n     international monitoring. The critics of this agreement, I \n     believe, are wrong. The deal does stop North Korea's nuclear \n     program, and it does commit Pyongyang to roll it back in the \n     years to come.\n       I have not heard another alternative proposal that isn't \n     either unworkable or foolhardy, or one that our allies in the \n     Republic of Korea and Japan, the nation's most directly \n     affected, would fail to support.\n       If North Korea fulfills its commitment, the Korean \n     Peninsula and the entire world will clearly be less \n     threatened and more secure. The NPT, START II, the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the North Korean Agreement, \n     they top our agenda for the year ahead. [There are other \n     critical tasks we also face if we want to make every American \n     more secure, including winning Senate ratification of the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention, negotiating legally binding \n     measures to strengthen the Biological and Toxin Weapons \n     Convention, clarifying the ABM Treaty so as to secure its \n     viability while permitting highly effective defenses against \n     theater missile attacks, continuing to support regional arms \n     control efforts in the Middle East and elsewhere, and pushing \n     for the ratification of conventional weapons which, among \n     other things, would help us to reduce the suffering caused by \n     the tens of millions of anti-personnel mines which are \n     plaguing millions of people all across this world.] \n     (Applause.)\n       My friends, this is a full and challenging agenda. There \n     are many obstacles ahead. We cannot achieve it if we give \n     into a new isolationism. But I believe we can do no less than \n     make every effort to complete it.\n       Tonight, let us remember what President Nixon told the \n     joint session of Congress when he returned from his historic \n     trip to Moscow in 1972. He said, ``We have begun to check the \n     wasteful and dangerous spiral of nuclear arms. Let us seize \n     the moment so that our children and the world's children can \n     live free of the fears and free of the hatreds that have been \n     the lot of mankind through the centuries.''\n       Now it is within our power to realize the dream that \n     Richard Nixon described over 20 years ago. We cannot let \n     history record that our generation of Americans refused to \n     rise to this challenge, that we withdrew from the world and \n     abandoned our responsibilities when we knew better than to do \n     it, that we lacked the energy, the vision and the will to \n     carry this struggle forward--the age-old struggle between \n     hope and fear.\n       So let us find inspiration in the great tradition of Harry \n     Truman and Arthur Vandenburg--a tradition that builds bridges \n     of cooperation, not walls of isolation; that opens the arms \n     of Americans to change instead of throwing up our hands in \n     despair; that casts aside partisanship and brings together \n     Republicans and Democrats for the good of the American people \n     and the world. That is the tradition that made the most of \n     this land, won the great battles of this century against \n     tyranny and secured our freedom and our prosperity.\n       Above all, let's not forget that these efforts begin and \n     end with the American people. Every time we reduce the threat \n     that has hung over our heads since the dawn of the Nuclear \n     Age, we help to ensure that from the far stretches of the \n     Aleutians to the tip of the Florida Keys, the American people \n     are more secure. That is our most serious task and our most \n     solemn obligation.\n       The challenge of this moment is matched only by its \n     possibility. So let us do our duty.\n       Thank you very much.

Mr. President, last year, during the ceremony for United \nNations Day on October 24, 1994, United Secretary-General Joseph Verner \nReed delivered a message at U.N. headquarters on behalf of Secretary-\nGeneral Boutros Boutros Ghali. That occasion launched the Golden \nAnniversary celebration of the United Nations and was the first in a \nseries of planned events that will continue well into this year.\n  As Ambassador Reed--whom, by the way, many of my colleagues will \nrecall from his distinguished service in the U.S. Government--noted in \nhis introductory remarks to the Secretary General's message.\n\n       Forty-nine years ago in San Francisco, the United Nations \n     was launched as our world organization and began its long \n     journey for a better world. The signators of the charter were \n     fifty-one sovereign states, and today the United Nations \n     comprises 184 member-states; the organization represents the \n     world with all its problems and all its aspirations.\n\n  I had the honor of serving on the International Secretariat of the \nSan Francisco Conference which drew up the U.N. Charter. I have since \nthen held the hope that the United Nations would fulfill the noble \nthoughts expressed in the charter and have tried to promote ways to \nmake the United Nations become a functional and effective alternative \nto international conflict and discord.\n  Because of my longstanding interest in and support for the United \nNations, it is a particular pleasure for me to witness and participate \nin the events to celebrate its 50-year anniversary. I also sure the \nsentiment expressed by the Secretary General in his message that * * * \nwith the active commitment of people, the United Nations can continue \nto play its indispensible role for peace and security, social and \neconomic progress, and global human development.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ambassador Reed's remarks \nand the Secretary-General's message be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Message of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Dr. Boutros \n        Boutros-Ghali on the Occasion of United Nations Day 1994\n\n       Excellencies, Friends of the United Nations, Ladies and \n     Gentlemen, it is an honour to represent the Secretary-General \n     of the United Nations, Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, at United \n     Nations Day 1994 as we launch the year of the golden \n     anniversary of our world organization here at headquarters, \n     in this great world city--New York. Forty-nine years ago in \n     San Francisco, the United Nations was launched as our world \n     organization and began its long journey for a better world. \n     The signators of the charter were fifty-one sovereign States, \n     and today the United Nations comprises 184 member-States;\n      the organization represents the world with all its problems \n     and all its aspirations.\n       [[Page S3374]] In this spirit, ladies and gentlemen, may I \n     bring you the message from the Secretary-General:\n       United Nations Day has become a universally recognized time \n     for celebration and reflection on the state of the world.\n       Today we all live in a global context. Societies which once \n     felt able to stand alone, now see themselves interlocked with \n     others. The great goals of peace, development and democracy \n     increasingly are understood to require greater multilateral \n     effort.\n       Without peace, nothing is possible. Without development, \n     societies cannot look forward to the future. Without \n     democracy, progress will not rest securely on a foundation of \n     popular participation and commitment.\n       In the coming year, the United Nations calls upon the \n     peoples and governments of the world to take charge of the \n     development effort. This year, we shall review progress on \n     the agreements reached at the United Nations Conference on \n     environment and development held at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. \n     We shall also continue to implement the decisions reached at \n     the World Conference on Human Rights, held at Vienna in 1993.\n       At the World Summit for Social Development, to be held in \n     Copenhagen 1995, we meet to find solutions to the development \n     crisis faced by all nations, rich and poor. At the Fourth \n     International Conference on Women, to be held in Beijing in \n     September 1995, we meet to discuss the special role of women \n     in development.\n       This year, as we prepare for the fiftieth anniversary of \n     the United Nations, let us recall the opening words of the \n     charter: ``We the peoples of the United Nations * * *.'' We--\n     all of us--are the United Nations. The United Nations is now, \n     and increasingly will be, what we choose to make of it.\n       Knowledge about the United Nations is thus ever-more \n     important for people everywhere. With the active commitment \n     of people, the United Nations can continue to play its \n     indispensable role for peace and security, social and \n     economic progress, and global human development.\n       Let us take up the challenge of the next fifty years. It is \n     in our power to use the United Nations as a force for \n     fundamental transformation to a world of peace and enduring \n     prosperity.\n       Let this day be the starting point for taking your United \n     Nations on the road to the future.\n       This concludes the message from the Secretary-General.\n       I believe it is in the spirit of United Nations Day 1994 to \n     say that fostering harmony through understanding among the \n     peoples of the world continues to be the principal mission of \n     the United Nations; that is so today even more than in the \n     past. The year of the fiftieth anniversary of the United \n     Nations offers a unique opportunity for governments, peoples \n     and institutions around the world to set aside social, \n     racial, political and religious differences and initiate a \n     real and productive dialogue on the burning problems of the \n     world as we move towards a new century. On this day, United \n     Nations Day 1994, let us rededicate our energies and join our \n     forces towards this goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this has not been a good day for the \nUnited States. I cannot imagine any piece of legislation that could \nhave been offered in the Senate which would do this country more good \nthan this balanced budget amendment which was defeated today, defeated \nby one vote.\n  Mr. President, we cannot keep on as we are. We have not balanced this \nbudget but one time in 32 years--eight times in 64 years. How are we \ngoing to change it? We are putting a burden on our children and our \ngrandchildren that is unbearable. It is not fair to this generation or \nthe next generation that we permit this to happen.\n  The best way we can stop this spending--and the Congress is intent on \nspending--is to adopt a balanced budget amendment. We passed a statute \nyears ago, and before the end of that year--Harry Byrd was the author \nof it--the Congress had gone beyond and spent more than that statute \npermitted. The only way under the Sun you are going to stop this \nspending--the only way, I repeat--is to pass a constitutional amendment \nto mandate--to mandate, to make--the Congress balance the budget. That \nis the only way you are going to stop it.\n  We refused to pass that today. We turned it down. I hope the American \npeople will study this question and see what happened and bring \npressure on this Congress to do what it ought to do, and that is to \npass this amendment when it comes up again. And it will come up again. \nIt will come up again probably this session. It may not pass again this \nsession. It will come up again next session. But I predict it will pass \neither this session or next session. It has to pass if we are going to \nstop this spending. It has to pass if we are going to save this country \nfrom financial ruin. I hope people rise up and demand that such action \nbe taken.\n  Mr. President, let me pay tribute before I yield the floor to Senator \nDole, the majority leader, and Senator Lott, the assistant majority \nleader, for their leadership throughout this fight.\n  I also wish to commend Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, for the fine job he did, and Senator Simon, who joined him \nas one of the principal authors, and Senator Craig, from Idaho, who did \nsuch a herculean job in trying to get this amendment passed, and \nSenator Heflin from Alabama, who was prominent in pushing this \namendment. They all deserve to be commended. I thank all Senators who \nvoted for it, but I especially wish to thank the leaders whose names I \njust mentioned. I also want to commend the staff of Senator Hatch for \ntheir exemplary and dedicated work on this legislation, Sharon Prost, \nShawn Bentley, and Larry Block. Additionally, Damon Tobias of Senator \nCraig's office was tireless in his efforts to assist during \nconsideration of this measure and too I commend Thad Strom, my chief \ncounsel on the Judiciary Committee for his able assistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I rise today with much sorrow to lament the passing of my \ngreat friend Bill Gardiner, who passed away on February 21, 1995 at the \nage of 68. William F. Gardiner, Sr., was my chief of staff in charge of \nmy Alabama offices.\n  The U.S. Marine Corps has as its motto the latin words ``Semper \nFidelis,'' which mean ``Always Faithful.'' These words are descriptive \nand indicative of the spirit and life of Bill Gardiner. He was always \nfaithful to his principles and to his friends. He also possessed the \nunfailing values of hard work, patriotism, and spirituality.\n  He loved politics. He relished being in the political arena as much \nas anyone I have ever known. He enjoyed the bonding that brings people \nwith common likes, dislikes, feelings, philosophies, and goals \ntogether. He thrived on the excitement of politics. He especially \ndelighted in political gatherings. On many occasions, he would stay up \nall night cooking meat for a barbecue or some other event where \npoliticians would gather.\n  He believed politics and public service were ways to bring about \nimprovements in the quality of life of all people; a way to increase \nthe standards of living for our citizens; a means of rectifying wrongs \nand injustices; and a way of improving the future for generations that \nwould follow. These principles were his guideposts in his own public \nservice.\n  As mayor of the city of Tuscumbia, AL he took a leadership role in \nimproving its educational system. He used Federal money and programs to \nbenefit the citizens of his community in many different ways, such as \nsubstituting decent and good housing for shacks in blighted areas and \nproviding homes for the elderly. He expanded and improve the \ninfrastructure of the city. Every municipal service, including police \nprotection and fire-fighting, improved under his leadership.\n  He loved to be kidded about ``Gardiner's Lake.'' A short time after \nhe became mayor, a body of water was named for him. For generation \nafter generation in Tuscumbia, every time a big rain came, a deep dip \nin Cave Street near the football stadium would become flooded with \nwater that made traffic impassable for several days. Many of his \nfriends kidded him about this body of water and jokingly named it \n``Gardiner's Lake.'' He vowed to eliminate this, and he soon did with \nsuperb drainage engineering. He made many other vast improvements to \nhis city during his years as mayor.\n  He made mistakes like all of us do. At one point, he was persuaded to \ncarry out an urban renewal program in the center of the city. Parking \nwas substantially reduced, water fountains and pools were established, \nand a beautification project was created with a fish pond and series of \nflag poles at the Palace drugstore corner. Some wag soon labeled this \nproject ``Three Flags \n[[Page S3375]] Over Palace.'' There were so many complaints about the \nloss of parking, the program was soon abandoned. Bill wasn't alone, \nhowever, because many mayors had the same unpleasant experience with \nurban renewal projects.\n  His year and a half as president of the Alabama League of \nMunicipalities was a period he really cherished. He had sincere \naffection for mayors and councilmen from all over the State and they \nloved him in return. When he become my chief of staff, he renewed his \ncloseness with the Alabama League of Municipalities and would come to \nWashington with Municipal groups for conferences with the National \nLeague of Cities. He was always in attendance at the State conventions \nof the Alabama League of Municipalities.\n  Bill and I went through many campaigns together. He was my campaign \nmanager in my election for chief justice and my three elections for \nU.S. Senate. No one could ever hope to have a greater friend. In the \nwords of the 66th Psalm, ``We went through fire and through water.'' He \nwas like a brother to me. His service as my chief of staff was superb. \nHe was my eyes and ears in Alabama. I will indeed miss his outstanding \njudgment and motivation.\n  Bill spent approximately 35 years in public service, either as a \npublic official or as my chief of staff.\n  He loved his friends and was always loyal to them. We know that loyal \npeople themselves inspire loyalty among others, and Bill leaves behind \nmany who were loyal to him. A great many of them were present at his \nfuneral on February 23, 1995 at the First United Methodist Church in \nTuscumbia. Those who attended, as well as many others who could not, \nwere a testament to the kind of man that he was and to the kind of \npersons which he surrounded himself and depended on.\n  At the visitation the night before the funeral thousands of people \ncame to the funeral home to express their affection to his family and \npay their respects to him. People were lined up for blocks to get into \nthe funeral home. Members of my staff who were there told me they \nwaited in line for 2 hours in order to speak to his family. In the line \nwere people from every walk of life, including farmers, garbage truck \ndrivers, street cleaners, policemen, bankers, and government officials.\n  He was a fine family man. He loved to attend family reunions. He \nwould tell me well in advance of a family reunion, ``Now mark that \nperiod down because I will be gone.'' He would gather at family \nreunions with members of his family who had grown up in Farley, AL and \nreflect upon their younger days, imparting to the younger members of \nthe family a spirit of unity and a desire to be of help to everyone.\n  He was completely devoted to his wonderful wife Betsy and their \nchildren, and he always put them first and foremost in his thoughts. \nBetsy's understanding always helped Bill in so many ways. She seemed to \nalways know the right thing to say and do at the right time. She knew \nhow to bring out the best in him. I firmly believe that his wonderful \ntrait of loyalty was reinforced by her own loyalty to him. As his \ngrandchildren grow and learn more about their ``Big Daddy,'' they will \nbe very proud of him.\n  At his funeral, as we said goodbye to Bill Gardiner, many of us were \nwondering silently how we would get along without him. We will really \nnever find anyone to take his place. But we must persevere and be \nguided by his spirit of being always faithful. After all, that funeral \nwas just as much a celebration of the life of a wonderful friend and \nfamily man who was an inspiration to all who knew him. We are all \nbetter because Bill Gardiner came our way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senate made a mistake today in \nrejecting the balanced budget amendment. But make no mistake, that \nissue will be before the Senate before very long again. In failing by a \nsingle vote, the Senate rejected the overwhelming demand of the \nAmerican people, as expressed in last November's election, that we need \nto exercise restraint in a constitutional context to live within our \nmeans. Today, on the motion for reconsideration entered by the majority \nleader, the procedural posture is now established so that the Senate \ncan take up the issue again at any time.\n  It is my prediction that the American people will respond to today's \nvote by a forceful declaration to the 34 Senators who voted against the \nbalanced budget amendment that the American people want the balanced \nbudget amendment passed. The procedure of the Senate is such that, if \nany one of those 34 Senators changes his or her mind, the amendment may \nbe brought again to the floor of the Senate on short notice, giving \nSenators an opportunity to be present so all may express themselves, \nand the amendment could be passed.\n  So my request, my plea to the American people, is to let your \nrepresentatives, your U.S. Senators, the Senators who represent you in \nthe U.S. Senate, know what your feelings are. A number of the Senators \nhad been expected to vote in favor of the balanced budget amendment \nbased upon prior votes or upon prior statements. I do not challenge in \nany way, shape, or form the good faith of any Senator who voted, in any \nrespect, in any way. But there were six Senators who had previously \nvoted in favor of the amendment and today voted against it. Those six \nSenators previously expressed themselves forcefully in favor of the \nprinciples of the balanced budget amendment, suggesting at least some \nindication of a favorable disposition. It is my thought that if their \nconstituents express themselves, that there may well be a change of \nheart. Beyond that, there are 20 other U.S. Senators who might be \npersuaded to have a shift of position, based upon the will of the \nAmerican people.\n  I do believe the principle behind the balanced budget amendment is \nsound. I do not say so lightly, because changing the Constitution of \nthe United States is a very major act. But it has been demonstrated \nthat not only the Congress of the United States, but the people of the \nUnited States, need a discipline to have a framework which requires us \nto live within our means. Every State has to live within its means--\nevery county, every city, and every individual. If you and I do not \nlive within our means, we wind up in a bankruptcy court. Within the \ncontext of the need for economy, constituents now come to us--and I am \nsure you, Mr. President, have had the same response in your State of \nOklahoma as I have in my State of Pennsylvania--people are no longer \nasking for increases or even cost-of-living adjustments. But in many \ncases, they are saying, ``Do not make the cut too big.'' In other \ncases, they are saying, ``Do not zero out the program all the way in \nthis year.''\n  I think that mental attitude is very important.

Mr. President, during the time that I was privileged to \nsit in the chair, some comments were made that I think should be \nresponded to.\n  A comment was made that we are doing something constructively about \nthe deficit today. Reference was made that President Clinton's budget \nwas dramatically cutting the deficit.\n  I was reminded of an article that anyone can find, if they wanted to \nget last December's Reader's Digest. It was called ``Budget Baloney.'' \nIn this article, they talked about how politicians refer to cutting \ndeficits as if somehow they are going to bring the deficit and the debt \nunder control. They used this example. They said if a guy has $5,000 \nbut he wants a $10,000 car, all he does is say, ``Well, I really want a \n$15,000 car, and I have effectively taken a $10,000 car and, therefore, \ncut the deficit by $5,000.''\n   [[Page S3376]] If we take to the conclusion of 5 years the budget \nthat the President has submitted to us for the fiscal year coming up, \nit would increase the debt by $200 billion a year for the next 5 years. \nThat is an increase in the debt at the end of that time by $1 trillion. \nI think the American people are aware of this. I think a few years ago \nthey got tired of the smoke and mirrors that we were doing here in \nWashington and they became aware of what is really happening.\n  The second thing that was mentioned was the cuts--all of these \ndraconian cuts that would be necessary, if we had been successful in \npassing the balanced budget amendment. I would suggest to you that \nthere are ways of balancing the budget without having any cuts; that \nis, just limit the growth. There was a study made using the figures \nthat were supplied by the Federal Government that, if we could put \nmerely a 2-percent growth cap on Government spending, we would be able \nto bring the deficit down to zero at end of 6 years. This can be done. \nBut Congress in both Houses has had historically an insatiable appetite \nto spend money that they do not have, and without the discipline that \nwould be imposed upon them by a constitutional amendment for a balanced \nbudget, it has been demonstrated that for 40 years they are incapable \nof that discipline.\n  The third thing that was talked about was the awareness of what is \ngoing on around the country. I suggest that there is not one Senator \nwho would go home and misrepresent his or her position to his or her \nconstituents. However, it has been quite evident that there are many \npeople in some of the States who really believed that their Senator was \nin favor of a balanced budget amendment. Now, I think the good news in \ntoday's vote is they all know, and they know which Senators voted yes \nand which Senators voted no.\n  Last, during the debate, I put together a profile of those \nindividuals who were in support of the so-called ``right-to-know \namendment'' to the balanced budget amendment. That was the amendment \nthat says show us exactly where the cuts are going to be for the next 7 \nyears. I found that all 41 of those cosponsors had either a D or an F \nrating by the National Taxpayers Union. All 41 had voted for the \nstimulus bill, which was the largest spending bill increase that we \nhave had in contemporary history.\n  And so the bottom line is, is it just a coincidence that those 41 who \nsupported that amendment also were the big tax and spenders here in the \nU.S. Senate? No, I do not think so. In fact, I am having my staff, \nright now, look at the 34 who voted against it this time. And I suspect \nthat we are going to find the same thing; that is, those 34, each one \nof whom was responsible for killing the balanced budget amendment \ntoday,\n I suspect, was a big tax and spender. When we find out, we will give \nthis report tomorrow.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to that of my \ncolleagues who have made remarks commemorating the 50th anniversary of \nthe heroic Battle of Iwo Jima, which began on February 19, 1945.\n  I made some impromptu remarks on this subject last week when my \ncolleague from Arkansas delivered his remarks. It was one of the most \nmoving moments on the floor of the U.S. Senate that I have participated \nin. We had the Senators here who had been marines at one time in their \nlives, and it was a very moving moment. Each of the other former \nmarines in the Senate have stood on the Senate floor over the last \nseveral days to pay tribute to the extraordinary bravery of the men who \nfought so ferociously in the Battle of Iwo Jima. It was this grueling \n36-day battle that gave rise to Admiral Nimitz' famous description that \n``Among the Americans who served on Iwo, uncommon valor was a common \nvirtue.''\n  This battle also exacted one of the greatest casualty tolls in the \nhistory of the Marine Corps. For that uncommon valor, more medals of \nhonor--27 in all--were awarded for that action than for any other \naction in World War II. Out of those 27, 14 were awarded posthumously.\n  I was in World War II. I went in a few days after Pearl Harbor and \nstarted training. Fifty years ago, I had just returned to the United \nStates from combat in the Pacific in the Marshall Islands, just when \nthe Marine assault on the island of Iwo Jima began. Having participated \nin combat at that time in the Marshall Islands, we took our losses \nthere, too, but nothing like Iwo, of course. But I understood the \nstrategic importance this battle was to play in our island-hopping \ncampaign in the Pacific. We watched that very closely, because I was in \ntraining, along with other members of the squadron I was in, to go back \nout again for the assault on Japan. Lying between Japan and our bomber \nbases in the Marianas was Iwo Jima, which would provide a critical base \nfrom which fighter escorts could protect our B-29's en route to the \nJapanese home islands.\n  Our B-29's had the range to make their way from the Marianas, but \nwithout fighter escorts, they went unprotected and too often fell \nvictim to attacks by Japanese fighters.\n  Iwo Jima also would provide a haven for battle damaged bombers \nreturning from their assaults on Japan. And taking Iwo Jima's three \nairfields would deprive the Japanese of a base from which they could \nintercept our bombers.\n  This was part of the overall strategy, the strategy of saying we \nneeded bases that bring the Japanese to their senses to bomb, to bomb, \nto bomb, and hope that we could end that war before we would need to \nmake an invasion. Estimates of that invasion were that if the Japanese \nfought with the tenacity they had throughout that war, we could lose as \nmany as a million people in that conquest of Japan. So it was in that \nstrategy that Iwo was of critical importance.\n  The challenge that 75,000 marines of the 3d, 4th, and 5th Marine \nDivisions faced was an awesome one. Iwo Jima, despite the heavy bombing \nit had endured in the hours leading up to the Marine assault, remained \nheavily defended by Japanese in caves and pill boxes and bunkers.\n  Just picture yourself coming to shore in a bobbing landing craft, \ncoming in with shells landing and people being hit in the landing craft \nbefore it got there, and seeing other craft ahead of you that had \nalready been hit. It was a very tough moment. The island provided no \nnatural cover for attackers, and Marines were slowed by Iwo Jima's \nblack sand beaches. It was a sand of large grain, where you would step \nup on the beach and try and go uphill, and you made two steps forward \nand went one step backward.\n  As I mentioned the other night, Mr. President, I did not participate \nin the Battle of Iwo Jima. But after the war, following assignment to \nChina, my squadron flew through Iwo. We were there for several days and \nwe walked that territory. I stood on those beaches and on the cliffs \nand was up on Mount Suribachi. I tried to imagine what it must have \nbeen like in those days.\n  Having seen the terrain, it is hard to imagine how anybody could have \never made it up those beaches. They were the only landing areas on the \nisland, but above the beaches, the cliffs were literally honeycombed \nwith caves, back in the rocks, interconnected so the defenders could go \nfrom one cave opening to another. From the caves, machine guns would \ncome out and fire, and unless naval supporting gunfire was able to make \nan unlikely very direct hit on a tiny cave opening, the guns kept \ncoming out and kept mowing people down, and mowing them down, and \nmowing them down.\n  As far as that gunfire, I remember one large Japanese gun that had \nbeen shooting at ships, and it accidentally had been hit directly by a \nshell while coming in from the sea. The whole end of that gun barrel \nwas splayed out just like a banana that you would peel down, or like a \nflower petal spread out in different directions. It was a savage, \nsavage battle. We were there, and my squadron mates and I walked in the \ncaves and walked on the beaches just as the Japanese gunners were able \nto during that combat. How anybody ever got ashore with that kind of \nwithering fire coming right down their throats, on top of them, is \nsomething hard to fathom. It was an experience being \n[[Page S3377]] there even after the battle. The experience was vividly \nimpressed on my memory to this very day. As they came ashore, the usual \nthing would be to hunker down in a fox hole or a crater. But here was \nMount Suribachi looking down. There was no such thing as a fox hole. \nThey were being fired upon out on the beach. It is no wonder there were \nso many casualties.\n  My visit to Iwo makes me appreciate just what is meant when it is \nsaid that the progress of the marines of the V Corps was measured in \nyards, as Japanese defenders resisted to the death.\n  The Japanese were of a mood and psyche at that time, as they were \nthrough all of World War II, that they would rather be killed than give \nup. It was a Kamikaze mentality. We expected the assault on Japan, \nwhich we were training for, would be the same, and that, once again, \nemphasizes the importance of Iwo.\n  Yet, by February 24, 1945, 4 days after the onslaught began, the \nAmerican flag waived from the summit of Mount Suribachi, the proud \nimage that to this day symbolizes the unwavering resolve of the Marine \nCorps, of our Nation, and of the staggering sacrifices that were made \nby the marines in their relentless advance on Iwo Jima.\n  Uncommon valor was indeed a common virtue.\n  Just imagine you are there, and just think of the determination. You \nhave flamethrowers, tanks, bulldozers, landing craft hit and on the \nbeach and shot up and out of commission, and still you have to advance \nand neutralize and silence the fire from those hundreds and hundreds of \nenemy caves.\n  Well, by early March, the three Marine divisions had compressed the \nremaining enemy into isolated pockets of resistance. An awesome foe, \nthe Japanese defenders fought with courage and determination, with the \nvast majority in their fanaticism, preferring death to surrender. The \nfinal pockets of resistance were finally eliminated, and the capture of \nthe island was announced on March 26.\n  The casualty statistics are harrowing. Almost 7,000 Americans were \nkilled, and more than 17,000 were wounded. But the assault and capture \nof Iwo Jima was of critical importance to final victory in the Pacific, \nand the island proved to be an important base from which to deliver \nmore and heavier blows against the enemy.\n It also became the emergency landing field it had been envisioned to \nbe.\n\n  And by the end of the war a total of 2,251 B-29 bombers, carrying \n24,761 crewmen landed on Iwo Jima. A large number of these brave pilots \nand crewmen undoubtedly would have been lost if the land had not been \ntaken.\n  Once again, you can imagine those planes coming in, shot up, battle \ndamaged, wounded being taken out, planes repaired, wounded being given \nhelp, back to Guam or Saipan, and out again to pound Japan after being \nrepaired.\n  Mr. President, I conclude my remarks by repeating the words of then \nSecretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal, who was present on the island \nduring the campaign, when he expressed his ``tremendous admiration and \nreverence for the guy who walks up beaches and takes enemy positions \nwith a rifle and grenades or his bare hands.''\n  We have had a lot of battles, Mr. President, battles we read about. \nThe battle of Iwo Jima, like Bunker Hill, Gettysburg, Belleau Wood, and \nNormandy, was won literally not just by machines but by young Americans \nwho wanted to live but were not afraid to die for their country.\n  People go off to war with the flags flying and bands playing and we \nthink about liberty and the pursuit of justice and world community and \nall of these things we like to talk about, loyalty to country. But to \nthe people on a beach, it is a matter of them and their fellow marines \nthat they are trying to survive alongside. And it is that Marine \ntraining, which makes them more afraid of letting their fellow marines \ndown than they are of getting hurt, that wins those battles. Sometimes \nthey are killed. Sometimes it is hard to explain that kind of \npsychology, that kind of mentality that wins battles, particularly a \nbattle as vicious and as tough as was Iwo Jima. But that Marine gung ho \nspirit of being more afraid of letting each other down in a battle than \nthey are of getting hurt or killed themselves, while hard to explain, \nis what is so important in winning battles. It means that a person will \ntake grenades over to somebody and expose himself to fire because his \nfellow marines need that kind of help. It is what you have seen in the \nsquadron where people dive back in on a target a second time to split \nup antiaircraft fire. You would think that would be the most stupid \nthing anybody can do, but it is done because they see somebody in \ntrouble.\n  So, Mr. President, to those brave Americans who paid the ultimate \nsacrifice on the black sand beaches of Iwo Jima and the rocky slopes of \nMount Suribachi, ``Semper Fi,'' and may God's blessings rest on our \nCorps, on our military, and on this United States of America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I enjoyed very much hearing the Senator from \nOhio, Senator Glenn, who is a stalwart member of the Armed Services \nCommittee and has been a stalwart defender of the United States his \nentire life, either as a member of the Marine Corps or in the space \nprogram or in his splendid service here in the U.S. Senate.\n  I heard him talk about Iwo Jima. All of us, I believe, are the \nbeneficiaries of that reminder of the heroism that took place on Iwo \nJima. And I might add that no one is better qualified to speak of \nheroism and patriotism and dedication than the Senator from Ohio, \nSenator Glenn, his plane having been shot five times when he was flying \nin the Marshall Islands, and I believe seven times his plane was shot \nwhen he was in Korea fighting for our country.\n  So I thank the Senator from Ohio for that beautiful tribute to those \nwho were so brave and gave so much of themselves for their country on \nIwo Jima and other places in the Pacific.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3376-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3377-S3382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n            DEFENSE BASE CLOSURE AND REALIGNMENT COMMISSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session to consider Executive Calendar Order Nos. 12 \nthrough 17, and No. 34, en bloc, nominations to the Defense Base \nClosure and Realignment Commission.\n  The clerk will report the nominations.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Alton W. Cornella, of \nSouth Dakota; Rebecca G. Cox, of California; General James B. Davis, \nU.S. Air Force, Retired, of Florida; S. Lee Kling, of Maryland; \nBenjamin F. Montoya, of New Mexico; Wendi Louise Steele, of Texas; and \nJosue Robles, Jr., of Texas, to be members of the Defense Base Closure \nand Realignment Commission.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Debate on the nominations is limited to 30 \nminutes, equally divided between the President pro tempore and the \nSenator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn].\n  The Chair recognizes the President pro tempore.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I previously expressed my support for \nthe confirmation of Mrs. Cox, General Davis, Admiral Montoya, Mr. \nKling, Mr. Cornella, and Mrs. Steele to be members of the Base Closure \nand Realignment Commission. I want to reiterate that support and add to \nit my support of General Robles.\n  Mr. President, I have no doubt that our former colleague, Senator \nAlan Dixon, can complete this process by himself, However, I believe \nboth he and the Senate would rather see a group of individuals make \ndecisions on the future of the Nation's military bases and our local \neconomies. Therefore, I urge the Senate to confirm these nominations \nand let the 1995 Base Closure Commission proceed with its work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Thurmond in \nurging my colleagues to support the seven nominees to be members on \nDefense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.\n  I agree with Senator Thurmond that each of these individuals are \nwell-qualified to serve as members of the Commission.\n  [[Page S3378]] Mr. President, I am certain that all of my colleagues \nare aware that the 1995 base closure process is well underway, as the \nSecretary of Defense presented his list of closure and realignment \nrecommendations to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission \non February 28. In fact, the Commission has conducted two hearings on \nthe 1995 process with the Commission's chairman,\n Alan Dixon, conducting the hearings alone. And, as Senator Thurmond \njust reminded the Senate, former Senator Dixon, now Chairman Dixon, \ncould act alone, if necessary, but that is not the way this process was \nset up. That is not the way we intended it. It is not the way the \noverall Congress intended it because we wanted all the commissioners. \nAnd so we are here today to try to confirm the other commissioners.\n\n  During those hearings that former Senator Dixon, now Chairman Dixon, \njust held, he stated more than once that he urged the Senate to act on \nthe outstanding nominations at the earliest moment possible.\n  The 1995 commission has much work to do in the next few months, and \nthe Senate should not impede on the commission's progress by further \ndelaying action on these seven nominations. I do not doubt that \nChairman Dixon could handle it alone, but I do not think he wants that, \nand I do not think any of us want that. I believe it is in the interest \nof the Nation that the Senate favorably act on the nominations before \nus today.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve the nominations.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I do not think it is any secret that I \nhad some grave reservations about going forth with the nominations of \nthe BRAC commissioners. I have withdrawn any objection I had. I do not \nintend to ask for a recorded vote.\n  Let me tell you how it is and why it is that I was concerned.\n  Two years ago, my State, New York, was a victim of one of the most \noutrageous, self-serving, manipulative, politically mean-spirited and \ninspired acts under the former BRAC commission. Not the kind of thing \nthat would engender confidence in a process that was to be fair, that \nwas to be open, that was to take into consideration everyone's concern. \nA process that would not lend itself to the political process as we \nknow it. A process of putting forth your best case, seeing to it that \npeople have an opportunity to be heard, recognizing that this was not \neasy and that, regardless of the wisdom of the decision, there were \ngoing to be areas in this country that would suffer.\n  Let me tell Members that what the process did was close Plattsburgh \nAir Force Base and build up McGuire Air Force Base, and that one of the \nmoving forces behind this travesty was none other than the Chairman of \nthe BRAC Commission. That does not inspire confidence.\n  In the 1993 round of closures, the Air Force proposed establishing an \nair mobility wing at Plattsburgh. They were going to put in an air \nmobility wing there. Their recommendation. It was not this Senator's. \nIt was not anybody's in the community. They reasoned that the long \nrunways and the vast apron at Plattsburgh were ideal for the large \nairlift aircraft.\n  Facilities at the base were new--new. Tens and tens of millions of \ndollars had been spent and the base was well laid out. To all observers \nit was the perfect match. But somehow the BRAC Commission saw it \ndifferently. They bullied the FAA into not objecting at the \nintroduction to McGuire AFB of 70 to 80 large aircraft in the busiest \nair corridor in the world.\n  Now, Mr. President, it does not take one long to figure out that when \nwe have one of the busiest commercial air corridors in the world, that \nis not the place where we put 70 to 80 large transports and say that \nthat is going to be the mobility airbase. Not to mention the antiquated \nfacilities. Not to mention the cost would be hundreds of millions of \ndollars in new construction.\n  The FAA did not object. After having created a tissue of false rumors \nand lies regarding Plattsburgh's crash zone and fuel delivery costs, \nthe BRAC decided that, lo and behold, McGuire, the oldest, the most \nantiquated of the facilities, located in the middle of one of the \nheaviest traffic air corridors in the world, that that would be where \nthe Air Force would move these planes.\n  They decided that McGuire, which the Air Force had initially \nrecommended be downgraded to a reserve facility, obviously because of \nthe traffic congestion in the air, that it be chosen as the new \nmobility hub.\n  Want to talk about politics in its rawest, nastiest, rottenest sense, \nthat is it. That is the kind of thing that all Members have an \nobligation to avoid. The infamous proposal--by the way, because it took \nsomebody with some ingenuity to suggest this--came from none other than \none of the commissioners. That was H.T. Johnson, a former Air Force \ngeneral. He harbored a grudge--well-known, well-known--and my \ndistinguished colleagues on the floor, if they care to check into this \nwill find out because there are no secrets in this business. H.T. \nJohnson did not like the then Air Force Chief of Staff Tony McPeak.\n  Can you imagine, here we now have these personalities, one former \ngeneral is on the commission, does not like the then Air Force chief, \nand he knew that the Air Force and General McPeak were solidly behind \nthe Plattsburgh proposal. So when H.T. Johnson came up with this plan, \nhe did not have any trouble getting the Chairman of the Commission to \nquickly second it, to follow through on this deed, the commissioner \nhimself having been a former Congressman from New Jersey, representing \nthat district in which this move was made.\n  Now, that is not what this process is to be about. We understand that \nthere will be difficult decisions. We understand that. There has not \nbeen anyone here who has not seen them, and we understand, and we lick \nour wounds and we go on and do the best we can, and we try to get a \ncommunity to pick up the pieces.\n  I have to say, this outrage was buried in a host of other \nrecommendations to Congress. Senator Moynihan and myself raised our \nvoices. If there was any solace in what took place, it was that New \nYork retained Rome Lab, which was located at Griffiss Air Force Base. \nIt was the premier command and control research and development \nfacility in the country.\n  The Air Force said, ``Well, we will keep this going for another 5 \nyears.'' Now, even that, in this last round, is gone. So, having been \nvictimized once, the Pentagon is now recommending the closure of that \nlab, when they said ``Do not worry.'' And now they come back and put it \non the list. And to add insult to injury, where do you think they call \nfor realigning some of its work? Fort Monmouth, NJ.\n  Now, look, there is a moral obligation and a commitment that this lab \nwas going to be kept and the State went forward--the State of New \nYork-- putting forth millions of dollars. We built a comprehensive \nscientific foundation linked with all of the universities: Rensselaer, \nSyracuse, Poly Institute, Rochester Institute, University of Rochester, \nCornell. And now, instead of being an integral part of the Air Force's \n5-year plan, nothing. Based on those assurances, New York gave millions \nof dollars to ease the operating costs and further facilitate the \ntransfer of lab products to the private sector--and we can do it, and \nwe can eventually take over the entire Government cost. Give us those 5 \nyears and it will not cost the Federal Government anything.\n  But, no, no, let me tell members how serious our State is. We are \ncutting spending. We have a deficit of $5 billion. For the first time \nin 40 years the State is actually reducing spending. We will spend less \nthis year than we did the previous year. Three percent less. I do not \nthink there is another State in the country that is doing that, yet the \nGovernor increased the budget allotments and saw to it that the funds \nfor Rome lab would be continued.\n  The fact is that the Air Force deceived the Rome community into \nmaking investments in that lab, and now under their plan the hope for \neconomic recovery is removed. It is morally wrong to do that to any \ncommunity. If I saw that taking place in another community and my \ncolleague addressed that and said, ``Take a look and see what took \nplace,'' where one general, former general, because of his dislike of \nanother, moves to crush the plan which called for the location of \n[[Page S3379]] the air mobility center at a major installation, only to \nhave that major installation--which was the best--decimated, closed \ndown, with the remaining lab over at Griffiss. It was promised we will \nkeep this and now we come back 2 years later and we will take that out \nas well.\n  That does not inspire confidence in the integrity of the process. \nHaving said that, I say I am tremendously encouraged at the \nqualifications, the candor, the ability, and the credibility first of \nall of the Chairman of the Commission, our former colleague Senator \nDixon, and after having seen the quality of the other commission \nMembers.\n  Now, it is not easy for a commission to then restore a base once the \nAir Force or any of the services have put it on the list and said they \nare targeted. They do not generally do that. Not as a rule. But I \ncertainly hope that we can make a case based upon the situation that \nexists today, and based upon what was morally indefensible, and what \nwas done to the community by the BRAC Commission of 1993. It is a sorry \nsaga, but one I believe that has to be told. I would not have come \nforth and made this public at this time were it not for what took place \nthis year, following the commitments that were made, and the \nexpectations that we had to save this facility. That is why I do so. It \nis a sordid, dirty, little story.\n  But if anything, hopefully we can learn by that. I think we have a \nmoral obligation to see to it that this facility is continued. The \nGovernor has assured me that he will do everything in his power to give \nwhatever aid in reducing costs to this facility and helping to move it \ninto the private sector and in helping to keep it the premier lab that \nit is.\n  So, Mr. President, it is on that basis that I have withdrawn my \nobjection because, obviously, I understand there are decisions that \nhave to be made. The taxpayers and the Members of this Congress have an \nobligation to see that our money is wisely spent and husbanded. This is \nnot easy. But I thought that it was important to lay these facts out \nand, hopefully, we can avoid a repetition of that kind of thing. Nobody \nand no community should ever be subjected to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I wish to thank the able Senator from New York.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I did not intend to speak on this \nparticular matter, but I heard the Senator from New York making some \npoints. I do not know the particular situation in New York, but I know \nthat the Senator and I share one thing in common, and that is the \nPentagon's base closing nominations should not be considered as sacred \nby the Commissioners that we are about to confirm.\n  I have no intention of speaking at length or trying to block any of \ntheir nominations. As far as I know, they are all very honorable \npeople, and I come not to resist them, not even to admonish them, but \nto make a point which I hope they will seriously consider, and that is \nthat the Pentagon's decisions are not perfect. They are not made in the \ncosmos. They are made by human beings who are subject to error.\n  Needless to say, that I am upset about what they are doing in my \nState would be a gross understatement.\n  In 1991, I daresay that my State was one of the two or three hardest \nhit States on the loss of jobs as a percentage of our people. We lost \nEaker Air Force Base, a strategic bomber base, and we lost what we call \nthe Joint Readiness Training Center in Fort Chaffee, AR, which was \nmoved to Fort Polk, LA.\n  Eaker Air Force Base was in Mississippi County, which is in the First \nCongressional District of my State, which happens to be one of the 10 \npoorest districts in the United States. I do not have to tell you what \nclosing a very significant air base in that county did to that county \nand the surrounding area. But if you look at it in pure terms of \ndollars and cents, you could not argue with it. When Senator Pryor, and \nsome of the rest of us, went before the Base Closure Commission and \npleaded for them to take into consideration the economic consequences, \nthey said, ``That is not a part of our mandate.''\n  That county had always had, even with the air base there, a very much \nhigher unemployment rate than the rest of our State. We cannot consider \nthe economic consequences, which is the same thing as saying we are not \ninterested in human beings; we are not interested in the trauma and the \ntragedy that people experience when they lose their jobs and wonder how \nthey are going to put bread on the table for their children.\n  But it was closed. We might as well have been shouting in the rain \nbarrel for all the attention we got from the Base Closure Commission.\n  As far as Fort Chaffee was concerned, we showed conclusively, we \ncrunched the numbers time and time and time again, and presented them \nto the Base Closure Commission and said, ``You are supposed to be \nsaving money. You will save a lot of money by closing Eaker Air Force \nBase, even though you are creating unspeakable, horrible consequences \nfor a lot of people who are going to be thrown into the streets, but in \nChaffee's case you cannot even justify the savings.'' The figures we \ngave them which, in my opinion, were absolutely unassailable and are \nunassailable to this day, went unheard, unheeded. We might as well, \nagain, have been shouting in a rain barrel.\n  Now we have this new list of bases for closing that have been \nnominated by some faceless group in the Pentagon. After we took that \nkind of a hit in our State in 1991, I daresay that with this base \nclosure list we are again one of the two or three hardest hit of any \nState as a percentage of our population. Red River Army Depot and the \nDefense Logistics Agency Depot, sit side by side a few miles from \nTexarkana, which my colleagues know includes parts of Arkansas and \nTexas, as is near Louisiana; a city of 77,000 to 80,000 people, about \n30,000 of whom are on the Arkansas side of the line.\n  Mr. President, since I have been in politics, I have stood with one \nleg in Texas and one leg in Arkansas 30 times. The line runs right \nthrough the Federal Building, half in Arkansas and half in Texas. Of \nthe 4,100 people who work at the 3,600-acre Red River complex, 1,000 or \nso live in Arkansas. I know, as Deputy Secretary Deutch told me the \nother day, they do not consider economics, they do not consider red-\nblooded human beings who lose their jobs. Theirs is not to ameliorate \nthat. Theirs is to look at hard, cold dollars-and-cents figures.\n  They did not cut these facilities in half, which would have been \ntraumatic enough. They didn't try to figure out how can we eliminate \nthis human drama, this tragic human drama unfolding by cutting their \nworkload in half and leaving at least 2,000 people working there, or \n3,000, or whatever.\n  I do not even know where they are going to transfer the work. I know \nthere are two bases that do the same thing the Red River Depot does \nthat are being left open that have never won the awards that Red River \nhas won, such as the 1995 Presidential Quality Award. Red River is one \nof only six government facilities in the whole country to win that.\n  I listened to the Base Closure Commission hearings yesterday \nafternoon in my office, and the chairman, our former colleague, Senator \nDixon from Illinois, asked did they take into consideration all of the \nachievement awards and the meritorious awards that Red River Depot had \nwon? No, they did not. I regret the chairman said he had a tendency to \nagree with that.\n  Tell me, Mr. President, what is the purpose of people who have worked \nfor the Federal Government trying to excel and be recognized for their \nexcellent service if nobody is going to take it into consideration? \nWhat is that all about?\n  One other thing, Mr. President. What is it about these people who \nmake these nominations that make them perfect and infallible, and their \njudgments and their decisions unquestioned? Do you think somebody on \nthe Army or Navy or Air Force groups that made these recommendations \ndoes not have a brother-in-law working someplace? Do you think the fact \nthat he has a brother-in-law working someplace does not play a role in \nhis thinking about whether that base is going to be closed or this base \nis going to be closed?\n  That may be putting it a little strongly, but after all, we are all \nhuman beings, are we not? You may have a friend who gave your opponent \nmoney the last time, and it may have \n[[Page S3380]] shocked you and you are not ever going to feel as kindly \ntoward that guy again. That happens in the Pentagon too. Decisions are \nnot always based on what is best according to the facts.\n  Fort Chaffee, AK, is also on the list. It stands to lose 350 jobs. It \nis near Fort Smith, which is a city of about 80,000 people. They can \nwithstand it. But I can tell you, the 350 people who are going to lose \ntheir jobs cannot stand it. Think of a city, all of you. I hope all of \nmy colleagues will think of a city in their States with 77,000 people, \nlike the entire city of Texarkana, in Texas and Arkansas. And take away \n4,100 jobs. That is 5 percent of the total population. Each one of \nthose jobs represents a family. Compute that. It is devastating, and it \nis unnecessary. And if it does cost a few more bucks to keep the place \nopen, say, at half strength, or something of that kind, maybe the \nPentagon should have decided to do that. But nobody in the Pentagon \ntried to work anything out. The Pentagon simply said, ``Close that \nsucker.''\n  Mr. President, I am emotional about it because I have been here 20 \nyears and have not fired very many people. The people I really had to \nlet go in my office had to be let go. But I know that when you take \nsomebody's livelihood away from them, you are taking away everything. \nSo I am really bothered when people lose their jobs.\n  The reason I am talking now, and I will close on this, is because I \nwant this Commission--whom we are about to confirm--to bear in mind \nthat everybody who made these closure recommendations has something in \nthe back of their minds that caused them to make them, other than just \nthose cold dollars-and-cents figures that were coming out of a \ncomputer.\n  Do you think there is no politics in any of this? Do you think these \nare sacrosanct things that people with noble purposes and no other goal \nconjured up?\n  So, members of the Commission, I just want to say, do not think for a \nminute that you do not have a responsibility to look at these things--\nnot rubberstamp them, look at them--count the figures over and over \nagain, take into consideration whose lives are being affected and whose \nchildren are not going to be educated as a result of the loss of their \njobs.\n  I hope this Commission will look especially look at the Pentagon's \nrecommendation to close Red River Army Depot and Fort Chaffee. I know \nthere are other Senators--Senator D'Amato has already spoken, and \nothers will. A lot of people feel put upon. But let me reemphasize, \nArkansas took the biggest hit in 1991 of all but two other States, and \nwe are being asked to take one of the biggest hits in this one. What is \ngoing on?\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n                    nomination of alton w. cornella\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today \ntaking up the confirmation of this important group of nominees to serve \non the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.\n  In my home State of Montana, there have been some concerns expressed \nabout one of these nominees, Mr. Alton W. Cornella of Rapid City, SD. \nMr. Cornella has spent a number of years advocating for Rapid City's \nEllsworth Air Force Base. And there has been concern that this may \ncreate a conflict with the interests of Malmstrom Air Force Base in \nGreat Falls.\n  Frankly, when I first learned about this potential conflict, I was \ndeeply concerned. The base closing process must be above politics and \nparochialism. And I would strongly oppose any nominee that I believe \nwould not give Malmstrom and Montana an absolutely fair hearing.\n  That is why, last week, I called Mr. Cornella and spoke with him \ndirectly. He assured me that he would be impartial. Moreover, he agreed \nto recuse himself any decisions involving Ellsworth or any base deemed \nto be in competition with Ellsworth. These assurances are reflected in \na letter Mr. Cornella recently sent to me. I ask unanimous consent that \nMr. Cornella's letter be printed in the Record immediately following \nthese remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In closing, let me say that I found Mr. Cornella to be a \nman of integrity. I believe he aspires to serve on the Commission \nbecause he wants to render a public service for the entire Nation. And \nI wish him well in that endeavor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                            Al Cornella Refrigeration Service,\n\n                                Rapid City, SD, February 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Baucus: Thank you for allowing me the \n     opportunity to discuss with you your concerns about my \n     potential role as a Commissioner on the Defense Base Closure \n     and Realignment Commission.\n       It is my understanding that I must recuse myself from any \n     matter that would have a direct and predictable effect on any \n     of my financial interests. Alternatively, I could divest \n     myself of any asset that gives rise to a financial conflict \n     or seek a statutory waiver. I have had discussions with the \n     Commission General Counsel about such potential financial \n     conflicts of interests. Based on these discussions, I have \n     announced my decision to recuse myself from any matters \n     affecting Ellsworth Air Force Base, if I am confirmed. This \n     would include recusal from any other base that is determined \n     to be a competitor with Ellsworth. For example, if the \n     recommendations of the Secretary of Defense place Malmstrom \n     Air Force Base in competition with Ellsworth, either in \n     closure or realignment of missions, then Malmstrom would come \n     within the scope of such a recusal.\n       In accordance with the procedures established by the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee, my financial interests will be \n     reviewed at the time the Secretary's recommendations are \n     published, and throughout the proceedings, to determine what \n     conflicts exist and what action is appropriate to address any \n     conflict. The Commission General Counsel, in conjunction with \n     the Department of Defense General Counsel and the Office of \n     Government Ethics, will conduct such reviews.\n       I have attached the statements that I provided to the \n     Senate Armed Services Committee during the confirmation \n     process.\n       Please let me know if I can provide any additional \n     information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Alton W. Cornella.\n Responses of Alton W. Cornella to Questions for Defense Base Closure \n   and Realignment Nominees From the Senate Armed Services Committee\n\n\n                     Possible Conflicts of Interest\n\n       Are you aware of any circumstances that might require you \n     to rescue yourself from participating in the consideration of \n     the proposed closure or realignment of a particular base or \n     type of base? If so, please describe.\n       Yes. I served as the Chairman of Military Affairs for the \n     Rapid City Area Chamber of Commerce. This included chairing a \n     subcommittee called the Ellsworth Task Force or Defense \n     Initiative. The purpose of the subcommittee was to provide a \n     proactive approach to the perservation of Ellsworth Air Force \n     Base, SD. I also own real estate in the area, and my firm has \n     done business at Ellsworth Air Force Base. I will recuse \n     myself on this base and any others determined as competitors \n     by the General Counsel of the Defense Base Closure and \n     Realignment Commission.\n       Have you ever participated on a compensated or \n     uncompensated basis in any activity directed at precluding, \n     modifying, or obtaining the closure or realignment of any \n     base during the BRAC process? If so, please describe.\n       Yes. I served as Chairman of the Ellsworth Task Force on a \n     uncompensated basis. The activity was directed at precluding \n     the closure of Ellsworth AFB, SD. The base was not considered \n     for closure in past rounds.\n       Have you been stationed at or resident in the vicinity of \n     any base while the base was under considration for closure or \n     realignment during the BRAC process? If so, please describe.\n       Yes. I was a resident in the vicinity of Ellsworth AFB, SD \n     when the base received additional missions and personnel from \n     realignment under the 1993 BRAC process.\n       Do you or, to the best of your knowledge, does any member \n     of your immediate family have any specific reason for wanting \n     a particular base to be closed, realigned, or remain \n     unchanged during the BRAC process?\n       My wife or I could suffer the same financial loss as any \n     other member of the community if Ellsworth AFB, SD would be \n     closed. For this reason. I will recuse myself on Ellsworth \n     AFB and any other bases determined to be competitors by the \n     General Counsel of the BRAC.\n\n\n               Conflict of Interest for Alton W. Cornella\n\n       This is in response to Senator McCain's request that each \n     nominee review their own situation and provide a response for \n     the record on his or her plans to deal with recusal or other \n     conflict-related issues.\n       I will follow the procedure developed by the Committee and \n     Executive Branch which was used by the 1991 and 1993 \n     Commissions. At the time that the Secretary's March 1 \n     proposed list is announced, the Commission's General Counsel, \n     working with the DoD General Counsel and the Office of \n     Government Ethics, will review my financial interests and \n     advise me if any recusal or other remedial action, such as \n     divestiture or waiver, is \n     [[Page S3381]] necessary. The Commission's General Counsel \n     will then advise the Committee of the results of this review \n     and any subsequent actions that I would take to remove myself \n     from any potential conflict. The Commission's General Counsel \n     will also establish a procedure providing for similar review \n     of my financial interests and transmittal of this information \n     to the Committee when the Commission considers action on \n     installations that are not on the Secretary's March 1 list.\n       If I am advised that a conflict of interest exists and that \n     a statutory waiver is not available, I will either divest \n     myself of the interest or recuse myself from that particular \n     installation affected by the holding. If the number of \n     recusals impairs my ability to effectively participate in a \n     significant number of Commission proceedings, I agree to \n     resign my position as Commissioner.\n       At the present time, the Commission's General Counsel and I \n     have determined that I have a financial interest in Ellsworth \n     Air Force Base, South Dakota. I served as the Chairman of \n     Military Affairs for the Rapid City Area Chamber of Commerce. \n     I also served as Chairman of one of its subcommittees, the \n     Ellsworth Task Force or Defense Initiative, which worked to \n     preserve Ellsworth AFB. My firm has done business with \n     Ellsworth AFB and I also own real estate in the area. My wife \n     or I could suffer the same financial loss as any other member \n     of the community should Ellsworth AFB be closed. For these \n     reasons, I will recuse myself on Ellsworth AFB and any other \n     bases determined to be competitors by the Commission's \n     General Counsel.\n                  A call for fairness in base closing\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, my friend and colleague from New York \nhas elucidated the travesty that befell Plattsburgh and our State 2 \nyears ago. It was the most parochial of decisions made by that \nCommission, and one for which they will long be remembered. I still \nrecall the findings of the BRAC staff on a screen overhead, showing \nclearly that Plattsburgh had greater military value than McGuire. But \nthat did not trouble much of anyone on the dais.\n  This year the Commissioners have the opportunity, and the obligation, \nto improve on the record of the 1993 group. The Air Force has proposed \nto move the finest laboratory in the Defense research establishment, \nRome Laboratory, to Hanscom Air Force Base near Boston and to the \nArmy's electronics laboratory in Fort Monmouth, NJ. Rome Laboratory has \nproduced three generations of scientists in its 45-year connection with \ncentral New York. According to the Air Force, moving half of it one \nState east and half of it one State south is expected to save $12 \nmillion per year. I have asked for an explanation of that claim, but \nsay it is correct. For $12 million annually we are to give up the \nestablished relationships between the lab and the ellipse of \nuniversities and industry in the region that have helped Rome to its \nnumerous successes. For $12 million annually we are to lose probably \nhalf the civilian staff of scientists who, by measure of similar \nsituations with other labs, will leave the laboratory rather than move \nwith it. This is shortsightedness of the highest order.\n  The return for moving Rome Laboratory is small. Only one other \ninstallation on the 1995 list, of all bases that will lose over 500 \ncivilians, will get less of an annual and total return on the money \nsaved per civilian lost. That is an Army ocean terminal. Closing it \ndoes not bring the immense loss of intangibles and productivity that \nmoving a preeminent scientific institution does. This is not like \nmoving the base laundry.\n  Most egregious about the Air Force recommendation is that 2 years ago \nthe assistant secretary for installations put in writing that ``the Air \nForce has no plans to close or relocate Rome Laboratory within the next \nfive years.'' The people of Rome believed him. They trusted him. That \nwas a mistake. They have spent 2 years planning the reuse of Griffiss \nAir Force Base, all of which was closed except for the laboratory, with \nthe laboratory as the linchpin of their plans. They have lost 2 years \nin the redevelopment effort unless the commission sees the folly of the \nAir Force proposal.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues from New York and Arkansas have raised \nconcerns I share about this process and the new Commission. I will be \nin touch with the new Commissioners shortly, and I hope they are aware \nof the standards they must restore.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Department of Defense's \nrecommendations on base closings would have a very serious impact on \nMaryland. Up to 1,700 jobs could be lost--and an additional 4,000 \npotential new jobs are at stake. The effect of these job losses on \nfamilies and communities would be devastating. I won't forget these \nfamilies as I fight for Maryland's bases.\n  But I will fight for Maryland's facilities based on their military \nvalue. There are three basic criteria that must be considered. These \nare the mission, merit, and value to the Nation of each base. In \nMaryland, my colleague Paul Sarbanes and I are working on a bipartisan \nbasis with the rest of the congressional delegation. We are also \nworking together with task forces in our local communities to make our \nbest case based on those principles. When the BRAC examines the \nrecommendations in Maryland, those are the principles on which we \nexpect to compete. And we expect to prevail.\n  I am shocked that some of the recommendations that the Commission \nwill be examining do not appear to be based on merit, mission, or value \nto the Nation. The Navy's new plan to move the Naval Sea Systems \nCommand [NAVSEA] to Washington, DC--overturning the last Commission's \ninstructions to move to White Oak, MD--is incomprehensible.\n  In 1993, the Department of Defense found that we would save tax \ndollars by relocating many of the White Oak personnel to make room for \nthe Naval Sea Systems Command, which has been in leased space. Nothing \nhas changed in the last 2 years to change that assessment. The \nstrategic and budgetary reasons for the move have not changed. Already, \nmany people have been transferred. Lives have been disrupted and new \nplans made. Now, the Navy's recommendation says that it was all just a \nbig bait and switch game.\n  We are now beginning a new round of defense base closures by \nreexamining the decisions of the last round. The Navy is asking us to \noverturn decisions made by the 1993 BRAC, approved by the President and \naccepted by Congress. This is a perfect example of why people are \nfrustrated with their government.\n  No one questions the merit of White Oak. Just yesterday, General \nShalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the \nloss of White Oak's hypervelocity wind tunnel ``could eliminate a \nunique national capability, a capability that serves military research \nand development needs and that is used by other agencies such as \nNASA.'' That wind tunnel, along with a 1.75 million gallon testing \ntank, are irreplaceable one-of-a-kind facilities.\n  This time, the burden of proof must be on the Navy. They must show \nthat the merit of their new proposal significantly outweighs the \nfindings of previous BRAC commissions. They must show that their \nmission can be performed butter, quicker, and cheaper in Washington \ninstead of in White Oak. And they must show that the Nation will \nachieve real savings from this new proposal. Those are tough standards \n* * * but in 1993, those are the standards White Oak met. We will hold \nthe Navy's new proposal to the same standards--and we don't think their \nnumbers can add up or hold up.\n  The recommendation to close the Naval Surface Warfare Center in \nAnnapolis is also a serious blow to Maryland and to the military. And \nit is another attempt to revisit decisions that were made during the \n1993 BRAC.\n  Some of the Navy's most important research and development is done at \nthe Annapolis site. We have one-of-a kind facilities, and a world class \nworkforce in place and working at peak capacity. Their mission is more \nimportant now than ever before--it is focused on the kinds of ship \nsystems our Navy will need in the 21st century. And once again, the \nreasons and numbers haven't changed. So Paul Sarbanes and I will once \nagain be leading the charge to maintain this vital facility.\n  The Army's recommendations, too, must be examined by the same \nprinciples and standards. I am deeply concerned that the recommendation \nto close Fort Ritchie was made without fully examining all of the \nmissions performed at this post, and has not taken a full accounting of \nthe value to the Nation of those missions. This post is almost 100 \nyears old--but has proven to be one of the Army's most versatile \nfacilities. It has constantly adapted and upgraded its facilities to \nfit changing communications needs. Its facilities \n[[Page S3382]] and workforce are unique--and must be maintained.\n  And nowhere does the concept of a full accounting become more \nimportant than at the Army Publications Distribution Center in Middle \nRiver. This center is competitive with the most technologically \nadvanced private sector operations, yet the recommendation to close was \nflatout wrong when it said that they are not automated. I will push to \nmake sure that one of the BRAC Commissioners visits this site, so that \nthey can see this state-of-the-art facility first hand. With the facts \nin hand, I am confident that the Commission will recommend to the DOD \nthat they revisit their recommendation entirely.\n  There are some silver linings for Maryland. The far-reaching and \nforward-thinking consolidation at the Naval Air Warfare Center, \nPatuxent River will continue. Pax River is the only Navy base in the \ncountry that can do aircraft acquisition, research, development, and \ntraining. This ``one-stop-shop'' is a crown jewel in the Navy. I will \nstand sentry during this BRAC process to ensure that the next century \nmission of Pax is not overlooked or undermined. And across southern \nMaryland, I am pleased that the value to the Nation of NESEA and the \nNaval Surface Warfare Center at Indian Head was acknowledged and \nmaintained.\n  Another piece of good news is that additional jobs will be coming to \nboth Aberdeen Proving Ground and Fort Meade. Each of these posts has a \nproud history of service and stand ready to make significant \ncontributions as the military continues to reexamine the roles and \nmissions they must perform in the new millenium.\n  Mr. President, before a serious consideration of the fate of \nMaryland's bases can begin, we must first confirm the nominations to \nthe Base Closure and Realignment Commission. I fully support these \nnominees. They will be seeing a lot of me, because I will be fighting \ntooth and nail for Maryland's unique facilities and capabilities.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield back time on our side.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes forty-four seconds.\n  Mr. NUNN. I yield back the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nominations on \nthe Executive Calendar, Nos. 12 through 17 and No. 34, en bloc, Alton \nW.

Mr. President, I had thought that I might wait until \ntomorrow to speak on the vote that occurred this afternoon, but I think \nperhaps now is as good a time as any simply to reflect on what happened \ntoday, what has happened in the past and what is likely to happen in \nthe future.\n  First of all, taking Social Security out of the amendment was a \nperfectly legitimate issue and I supported the Reid amendment and I \nsupported the efforts of the Senator from North Dakota to take it out, \nbut that is not the real reason I voted against this amendment. I voted \nagainst it because I have a reverence for the Constitution of the \nUnited States. I do not want it trivialized. I do not want to put \neconomic theory in it. I do not want to put an unenforceable \nrequirement in it. I do not want to put a requirement in there which \ncan be taken away by 60 votes. And I do not want to have the people \nexpecting to see the budget balanced in the year 2002 when that is \nhighly unlikely in any case and utterly impossible under the other \nprovisions of the Contract With America. That would raise the cynicism \nlevel about Congress still higher.\n  What I want to do is put this Nation on a glidepath toward a balanced \nbudget and stick with it. We could reduce the deficit $20 billion a \nyear and not disrupt the economy. The economy could handle it. And if \nthe American people saw us doing that, year after year, they would be \nhappy, they would see that we are solving the problem.\n  It is true the polls show that about 70 to 80 percent of the people \nof the country favor the so-called constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget, but I promise you they favor it because they are frustrated \nand they think it is the last best hope. And, second, they think there \nis some magic machine in the amendment that will balance the budget if \nthey just put it in the Constitution as the 28th amendment.\n  Unhappily, nothing could be further from the truth. This afternoon \nthe argument was made, why not submit it to the people? It is a \npowerful argument. The people like that argument. But for just a moment \nlet me give a couple of extra thoughts on that. Since this great \nRepublic of ours was founded in 1789, there have been over 11,400 \nproposals by Members of Congress to change that document--11,400. And \nwe have adopted 18 of them, counting the Bill of Rights as one--that is \nthe first 10 amendments to the Constitution all adopted at the same \ntime.\n  Since then, 17 amendments have been ratified out of 11,400 proposed. \nWhat if we took the argument that every time a constitutional amendment \ncame up on the floor we had a duty to submit it to the people? The \npeople would not have time to work. They would be so busy voting on \nconstitutional amendments they would not have time to hold a job.\n  Why do the Members of this body think that James Madison and Ben \nFranklin and all the rest of the Framers, in 1787, when they crafted \nthis document--why do they think they gave Congress the first \nresponsibility? And more important, why do they think they insisted \nthat 67 percent of the Congress vote for it before it is submitted to \nthe people? They did not say lay down in the aisle of the Senate and \nvote aye. They said we should deliberate. If they expected a two-thirds \nmajority of both Houses to approve this thing before it went to the \npeople of the country, surely to God they intended us to have a \nsensible debate on it. And we had one.\n  Mr. President, when you start tinkering with the Constitution of the \nUnited States, I belong to the ``wait just a minute'' club. I do not \ncare how meritorious a proposal sounds. The Constitution has given this \nNation 205 years of unfettered freedom the likes of which no other \nnation on Earth has enjoyed. And when you start trivializing the \nConstitution with amendments that are wholly unenforceable, people will \nlose their reverence for that sacred document. You see, I do not want \njust a balance-the-budget amendment that merely says we will balance \nthe budget. I want actually to balance the budget. The people in my \nState and your \n[[Page S3383]] State, they think that opposing a balance-the-budget \namendment is like saying ``I oppose a balanced budget.''\n  Who in this body does not favor a balanced budget? No one, but there \nare some who are not quite as committed to it as others. But in 1993, \nin August, the President and the Democrats in the Congress proposed a \n$500 billion deficit reduction. We stood up and we said exactly what \nthe people in the pool hall say, ``I wouldn't mind paying taxes if they \ncut spending.'' So we raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2 percent of the \npeople in this country. You had to have an income of $180,000 to \naffected by it. I wish I were in that category, I would be tickled to \ndeath to pay those taxes. We raised taxes on 1.2 percent of the \nwealthiest people in the country to the tune of $250 billion over 5 \nyears and we cut spending, dollar for dollar, $250 billion, for a total \nof $500 billion in deficit reduction. And, yes, we said in that same \nbill, in the future couples who make $44,000 a year and are on Social \nSecurity will pay taxes on 85 percent of that amount that exceeds \n$44,000.\n  Who thinks I enjoyed voting for that? I hated it. But you are not \ngoing to solve the deficit problem on people flipping hamburgers down \nat McDonald's. Justice Holmes said taxes are what you pay in order to \nlive in a civilized society. So we passed that deficit reduction bill \nand we have now lowered the deficit for three straight years for the \nfirst time since Harry Truman was in the White House.\n  Mr. President, it has been said time and time again, and it is worth \nrepeating: not one single Republican favored deficit reduction that \nday--not one. They said, ``We hate taxes.'' I do, too, but I hate \ndeficits as well.\n And on October 1, 1994, the deficit was $100 billion less than it \nwould have otherwise been if we had not passed the deficit reduction \npackage. You think about it. We cut the deficit $100 billion last year. \nAnd it will be down $110 to $120 billion this year from what it would \nhave otherwise been.\n\n  The distinguished majority leader, whom I respect and admire and \nconsider to be my friend, this afternoon said that the Senate walked \naway from the American people today. In August 1993, the Republicans \nran away from the people of this country. Not one vote.\n  Mr. President, we have never put anything into the Constitution in \n205 years that you can suspend with 60 votes in the U.S. Senate. You \nthink about it. Anytime this amendment is adopted and subsequent \nthereto, 60 people in this body can say we vote for an unbalanced \nbudget and those words will mean nothing. What if I came on this floor \nand said: Here is an amendment that says, the fourth amendment, which \nprotects us against unlawful searches and seizures--can be suspended by \n60 percent of the Congress? You would be home calling the carpenter to \nput some more locks on your door, never knowing when Congress might \ncast 60 votes to suspend your right to be protected from police who \nmight want to knock your door down on any flimsy excuse they can find, \nor ne excuse at all.\n  Women are now permitted to vote as a result of the 19th amendment \nadopted in 1921. Can you believe the women have only had the right to \nvote in this country since 1921? Suppose we passed an amendment saying, \nwith 60 votes of both Houses, we could suspend the right of women to \nvote. With 60 votes, we can suspend the right of due process. With 60 \nvotes, we can suspend religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom \nof speech. With 60 votes, we will put the poll tax back in. With 60 \nvotes, we will take any right in the Constitution out of it. The people \nwould be marching in the streets.\n  So where does that leave us on this amendment? We say, ``Well, here \nis an amendment that requires us to balance the budget by the year \n2002.'' How? I do not know. Well, can we go to court? No. We took care \nof that in order to accommodate the Senator from Georgia, Senator Nunn. \nThe courts could not involve themselves in the budget unless Congress \nexpressly gave them jurisdiction . Next question: Who can enforce this \namendment? Search me. I do not know.\n  If you have an amendment that requires a balanced budget by the year \n2002 and the courts are taken out in that same amendment, who does that \nleave you to enforce it? The same U.S. Congress that has refused to do \nit in the past. We are back to square one. You pass this amendment, and \nthe American people will have been hoodwinked like they have never been \nhoodwinked before in the history of this Nation. That is right. We are \nright back where we started, with the U.S. Congress having to balance \nthe budget, and with the right to ignore it with 60 votes. We have \nnever put anything in the Constitution that was not absolute and \ninviolate. We act as if we are dealing with a State constitution around \nhere. The balanced budget amendment is legislation all dressed up in \nthe finery of the Constitution.\n  I remember that spectacle in 1993 where only the Democrats voted for \na bill to actually reduce the deficit. It is the most significant thing \nthat has happened since I have been in the U.S. Senate. Every fall, for \n7 years, I have stood at this desk and offered amendment after \namendment after amendment to cut spending. In 1993 I offered six \namendments to kill or cut appropriations. Those amendments would have \nsaved the taxpayers over $420 billion, including interest over the next \n35 years, but 13 Republican votes was my highwater mark on those votes. \nIt reminds me of the back bencher who hears the preacher say ``Who all \nhere wants to go to Heaven?'' and replies, ``I do, but not tonight.''\n  I want a balanced budget, and I do not like to have to go home and \ntell the voters that we cut the spending that affects their job or \naffects something else important to them or raises their taxes. We just \nwant to talk about it.\n  Here on this chart are the budget-cutting amendments I put in just \nthe other day for this year. I want my colleagues to look at these \nright now because they are coming, I promise you. The space station, 5-\nyear savings of $10 billion; long-term savings, $52 billion. The same \npeople who will vote to cut food stamps, Medicare, put children in \norphanages, will vote to spend every dime of that. The F-22 fighter, we \ndo not need it. We can postpone it for at least 4 years; it will cost \n$6 billion next year; in 5 years, $24 billion. I will not go through \nall of them, but we could save $33 billion over the next 5 years, and \n$114 billion over the next 15 years just on the amendments that I have \nintroduced.\n  Mr. President, if I get 13 votes on the Republican side this year for \nany of those, I will be absolutely amazed. Everybody wants to go to \nHeaven. But not just yet.\n  There is not one thing in this amendment that would require us to do \nanything between now and the year 2002. There is not one single \nenforceable thing about this that would require us to cut the deficit \none dime between now and the year 2002.\n  I offered an amendment. I got 37 votes. The amendment I offered said \nthat, starting this year, the budget resolution must contain a deficit \nsmaller than last year. And, in addition to that, it must show us how \nwe are going to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002; that would be \ndifficult to achieve but at least my amendment would keep us honest.\n  I submit that the people of this country would be immensely gratified \nif they could go to bed tonight and realize that Congress is going to \ncut the deficit every year for the next 7 years, not wait until the \nyear 2002. Do it now.\n  The Contract With America--and to the eternal credit of the \nRepublicans in the U.S. Senate, they are not a party to that. They want \nus to spend $471 billion in tax cuts and defense increases between now \nand the year 2002, and then start dealing with the deficit.\n  Do you think I enjoy standing here and saying I am not going to \nsupport a so-called middle-class tax cut? Do you think the people of my \nState do not need tax relief? If you do what the Contract With America \nproposes, I will tell you where you wind up. You will wind up with a \ndeficit that will choke a mule, that will cause interest rates to start \nsoaring again, and the poor guy who would have otherwise gotten a tax \ncut that might buy him a pizza every Friday night will lose two pizzas \nevery Friday on interest costs. And 74 percent of the people of this \ncountry agree that they would rather see the savings put into deficit \nreduction.\n  Over and over and over again, I heard people say the balanced budget \namendment is very popular, that 75 percent of \n[[Page S3384]] the people in this country favor it. When you get down \nto a little tax cut, I will be saying that 75 percent of the people \nwould rather see this go on the deficit than into a middle-class tax \ncut. You say we must do what 75 percent of the people want on one \nthing. But on the next thing that 75 percent of the people want, you \nsay something else.\n  Mr. President, I will tell you what ought to happen. The Republican \nand Democratic leaders ought to get together and say, look, we share a \ncommon goal, and that common goal is to keep faith with the American \npeople. In order to do that, we have to start getting the deficit under \ncontrol. You go back to your people and submit a list of cuts, and we \nwill come up with our own cuts; then we will get back together and try \nto figure out what we can agree on. Once we agree on what we can cut, \nonce we are convinced in our own minds that we are going to actually \ncut the deficit this year and the next year and the next year, the \nleaders, Democrats and Republicans, can go before the television \ncameras and say solemnly to the American people: Here is our contract. \nWe all agree on it.\n  If we keep going like we are going, Mr. President, the Constitution \nand the American people both are going to lose mightily. I did not sign \nthat contract. As far as I know, not a single one of the 100 Members of \nthe U.S. Senate signed that contract. Can you believe that that \ncontract would be as dramaticaly unrealistic as it is--we are going to \nhave a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, provide $471 \nbillion in tax cuts, and defense increases. Most of the people who \nsigned that are wannabes, people running for Congress who will say \nanything, sign their name to anything, and worry about the details \nlater, after they have been elected.\n  And they will do it in 100 days. We are supposed to be a deliberative \nbody. If it takes 100 days, fine; if it takes 300 days, fine. These \nthings are supposed to be seriously considered. 100 days? It would not \nhave been unthinkable in this Senator's mind to spend half of that--\nwhich we almost did--on this amendment until the American people \nfocused on it and understood precisely what the consequences were going \nto be.\n  I must say I was terribly chagrined when I realized that no change to \nthe constitutional amendment was going to be adopted. We were presented \nwith a constitutional amendment that was crafted by the House of \nRepresentatives and sent to the Senate, and they said here it is, do \nnot change one word. Do not uncross one ``t,'' do not undot one ``i,'' \ndo not change anything. Think of that, saying to Senators here, who \nrepresent the people of their States, who want to improve it or kill it \nor otherwise change it. And they say, no, you do not count. We have 52 \nvotes locked up over here and we will table anything you try to do. \nWhat kind of deliberative body is that? It is like saying we do not \ncare that we are dealing with this precious document and we do not care \nwhat you think.\n  That is not a fan you hear, Mr. President, that is the sound of James \nMadison whirling in his grave.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3382-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3384-S3386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise to make a couple comments \nconcerning the balanced budget amendment vote today, because I think in \nmy 14\\1/2\\ years in the Senate, it is probably the most important vote \nthat we have cast. In my Senate career, we voted on a balanced budget \namendment four times--three times for real; and once on a cloture vote \nto end debate on a balanced budget amendment which I offered.\n  We passed it once, in 1982. We passed it with 69 votes. It was a \nbipartisan vote. At that time, the majority leader of the Senate was \nHoward Baker. I remember his support for the amendment. We had the \nsupport of Ronald Reagan, who was President at the time. But we lost by \njust a few votes in the House of Representatives.\n  The reason we lost the vote today is because six people who voted for \nthe balanced budget amendment a year ago voted against it today. They \nhave the right to change their minds. Many of the people that voted \nagainst it today who voted for it last year said they wanted to protect \nSocial Security. But when they voted for it last year, there was no \nspecific protection for Social Security. Those individuals thought the \nbalanced budget amendment was worthy of voting for last year, but they \nvoted against it this year. They have that right, and I respect \nSenators for their votes. I also think they should be held accountable.\n  When people are running for reelection, they many times claim, ``Oh, \nyes I have always voted for a balanced budget amendment.''\n  But today we had a chance to vote for one for real. The one we voted \non last year, in all likelihood, was not going to pass. The House tried \nit last year and they lost by a few votes. We lost by a few votes.\n  This year, the House passed it. This year, if the Senate had passed \nit and we worked out whatever small differences we had between the \nHouse and the Senate, it would have gone to the States and we would \nhave found out whether 38 States would have ratified it. My guess is, \nthey would. My guess is, we would have followed the advice of Thomas \nJefferson. We would have enacted an additional amendment which would \nprohibit Congress from spending more than they take in. Thomas \nJefferson was right.\n  Bob Dole was right when he made his comments. I want to compliment \nSenator Dole for his leadership. He has shown great patience. We spent \nover a month on this amendment. The House of Representatives debated it \nfor 2 days. The Senate spent a month. Senator Dole indicated the \nwillingness to spend another week if we could have picked up the \nnecessary votes. But we might spend another 2 months and still not get \n67 votes. Senator Dole can count votes. All of us can. Many of us were \nworking, trying to make a difference, but we were not successful, \nmainly because six people changed their minds. They have the right to \nchange their minds, but people need to know why we did not pass it.\n  In the November elections, we elected a lot of new people.\n  As a matter of fact, all 11 new Senators elected in the 1994 \nelections voted for it. But six people who voted for it in the past \ndecided to vote against it. That is the reason the amendment failed.\n  To pass a constitutional amendment is a high bar to jump over. It is \nnot easy. You have to pass the constitutional amendment by two-thirds \nin both Houses, and then additionally it has to be ratified by three-\nfifths of the States. That is not easily done.\n  We have had 27 amendments to the Constitution, 10 of which were the \nBill of Rights and were ratified very early in our history. We have \nonly had 17 since then. Sixty-six Members of this body felt as though \nwe should have the balanced budget amendment, as well. The American \npeople have supported it. It was mentioned two or three times on the \nfloor that 80 percent of the American people believe we should have it.\n  I have been here long enough to know we need a balanced budget \namendment. I have served on the Budget Committee; I have served on the \nAppropriations Committee; and now I serve on the Finance Committee. I \nthink we need the discipline. It would not be necessary if we had a \nstrong majority of both bodies, being fiscally responsible Members. \nMaybe then we would not need a balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, I am totally committed to trying to balance the \nbudget, whether we pass the amendment or not. I think we ought to do it \nby the year 2002. So I hope that we will pass a budget resolution that \nwill move Congress toward balancing the budget no later than the year \n2002. I hope we can pass it in both the House and the Senate.\n  Maybe that will be the easy part. Then we will have to pass the \nimplementing legislation to make it happen, pass what we call a \nreconciliation bill and all 13 appropriations bills. We will \n[[Page S3385]] make Congress, for the first time, really cut \nentitlements. If we do not reduce the rate of growth of entitlements, \nwe will never balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, the figures are not that complicated. We are spending \nabout $1.5 trillion right now. We are taking in a little over $1.3 \ntrillion. So we have a deficit of $200 billion per year. Unfortunately, \nPresident Clinton's budget does nothing to reduce the deficit. The \ndeficit stays at least about $200 billion for the foreseeable future, \nand then escalates much, much higher in future years.\n  He does not touch entitlements; I had charts up earlier this week \nshowing what the President has accomplished budgetwise. The President \nhas said in his first 2 years, he has reduced the deficit by $600 \nbillion, but the facts do not agree with him. The facts are that \nspending has not been cut in the President's first 2 years. Actually, \nspending went up, if we use the CBO baseline. And President Clinton \nmentioned, in his State of the Union speech, that we should use the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Spending has not been cut. Actually, spending for the first 4 years \nof his administration goes up, compared to what would have otherwise \nhappened. So spending has gone up, not down. That is evidenced by the \nfact that we used to spend $1.3 trillion a couple years ago, and now we \nspend $1.5 trillion. Under the President's budget year we spent $1.6 \ntrillion, and by the year 2000, we spend $1.9 trillion. Spending goes \nup every year.\n  The facts are, also, we can balance the budget if we limit the growth \nof spending to about 3 percent per year. The total amount of money that \nwe spend, if we can limit that growth to 3 percent, we can balance the \nbudget.\n  I did not say cut spending; I say limit the growth of spending. We \nwill have to somehow ingrain this in people's minds. I can tell Members \nright now when we come up with a budget people will say, ``Republicans, \nare slashing programs. You are insensitive. You are making tough \ndecisions.'' We should be.\n  But I also say, Mr. President, even under the Republicans, and in \nspite of all the slashing that we will be accused of, Federal spending \nwill continue to escalate. I would like for Congress to freeze Federal \nspending. We are spending $1.5 trillion. I would like for Congress to \nspend next year $1.5 trillion. If we have an increase in some programs, \nthat means other programs will have to be reduced to pay for it. That \nis what I would like. If we kept spending $1.5 trillion, we could \nbalance the budget before the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, we have to do it. I just hope that our colleagues, now \nthat they have defeated this balanced budget amendment, will help us. \nMany people on the other side of the aisle said we do not need a \nbalanced budget amendment. Many Members on this side of the aisle on \nthe Budget Committee, on the Finance Committee, on the Appropriations \nCommittee, I believe are committed to trying to balance the budget by \nthe year 2002, because we think that is the right thing to do.\n  I can tell Members it probably will not be the right thing \npolitically. We will expose ourselves politically. People will say, \n``You are slashing popular programs and you are not going to be popular \nif you cut this program or that program,'' and we will have to cut most \nall programs. I say cut. We will have to reduce the rate of growth in \nalmost all programs if we are going to get there. I hope that we have \nthe courage to do it. I think we need to do what needs to be done to \nmake Congress balance the budget, regardless of whether or not we pass \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  I am really disappointed that we did not pass it today. I think if we \nwould have passed it today, it would have changed the way we do \nbusiness. I think people in the Budget Committee, in the Finance \nCommittee, in the Appropriations Committee would say, ``Wait a minute; \nthis is a different era.''\n  We stand right here in this Senate and put our hand on the Bible and \nswear to uphold the Constitution. That is the reason it is more \nimportant than a statute. That is the reason I think we would be more \ncommitted to abiding by that balanced budget amendment, regardless of \nthe enforcement mechanism, because we are sworn to uphold the \nConstitution. I think we are serious when we take that oath.\n  A lot of our colleagues said that the amendment is not necessary. \nWell, we will try to do it, anyway. We will find out how sincere they \nare when we have the tough votes. We will find out what happens when we \ntry to curb the growth of entitlements.\n  I will give an example. We have 336 different welfare programs--336--\nmost of them stacked on top of each other. Many of which are \ncounterproductive to our goals, if we want to try to help people, \nbecause it is making people become addicted to Federal programs--\naddicted to Federal assistance--not helping them climb up the economic \nladder, but basically addicted to this idea that, ``Hey, Government \nwill take care of me, so why should I bother?'' We have 152 different \njob programs. I know the Senator from Kansas is looking at \nconsolidating many of those programs and giving them to the States to \ndetermine how best to manage them.\n  We have to curb programs like Medicaid, which has grown annually by \n28, 29, 13, and 8 percent. We cannot continue to have rates of growth \nlike that. We will have to curtail programs like the earned income tax \ncredit that President Clinton is so proud of. His tax bill increased it \ndramatically. Three years ago, it cost $5 billion a year. In 3 years, \nit will cost $25 billion per year. These are astronomical rates of \ngrowth.\n  The EITC is an entitlement program. I read by one estimation that 40-\nsome percent of the people in the District of Columbia are eligible for \nthe earned income tax credit. That is absurd. It is a negative income \ntax under which Uncle Sam writes checks. It is rife with fraud. The IRS \nis now slowing the processing of returns because of fraud. A lot of \npeople found out, ``If I give you a few hundred dollars for your social \nsecurity number, I can do your return and collect a $1,000 or $2,000 \ncheck from Uncle Sam.'' A lot of people are pulling that scam.\n  Food stamps--we have had unbelievable fraud and abuse in food stamps. \nThe program's cost has compounded in growth well beyond inflation. We \nwill have to take all programs, Mr. President, and look to scale many \nback substantially. If we want programs to grow more than 2 percent or \n3 percent per year, we will have to cut other programs to make that \nhappen.\n  I just hope we will have the courage to do it, in a bipartisan \nfashion. I hope that we will come up with a budget unlike President \nClinton's, which projects $200 billion deficits forever. I hope that we \nwill pass a program that will bring the deficits on a downward trend \nwhere we will be down to zero no later than the year 2002. That will \nnot be easy. And maybe if we cannot do it--I hope we can, but maybe we \ncannot--people on the other side will realize they made a mistake in \nvoting against the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. \nMaybe they will realize that we need that kind of discipline to be able \nto say no.\n  Congress will have to say no to Federal spending if we are ever going \nto get there. You are more popular as elected officials giving people \nmoney, cutting ribbons for more Federal spending, for XYZ school and \nXYZ projects, than taking away from them in taxation. You are more \npopular giving than taking away, and more popular spending than taxing.\n  I am really disappointed in the vote today. I think we need a \nconstitutional amendment. I hope and expect that we will have the \nopportunity to vote again, and maybe they will hear from their \nconstituents. I hope people across the country, when they find out that \ntheir elected Members voted against this amendment, will talk to their \nMembers,\n and let them know how strongly they feel that this amendment should \nhave passed.\n\n  If this is a democracy where people really have a chance to meet with \ntheir constituencies and listen to their constituencies, this amendment \nshould pass, and I believe it will pass. I would like for it to pass \nthis year. Maybe it will take another election. The American people \nspoke clearly in the elections in 1994. I believe they will be speaking \nvery loudly in 1996, and maybe they will hold their elected Members \naccountable. Then maybe that will enable us to pick up the extra \n[[Page S3386]] vote or two necessary to pass this amendment.\n  So, Mr. President, I am very sincere in saying I think this is \nprobably the most important vote we have had in decades. It is \nunfortunate it did not pass today. It did not fail for a lack of effort \nor leadership on behalf of Senator Dole. He showed great patience and, \nI think, great leadership. I also wish to compliment Senator Hatch and \nSenator Craig for the hours and hours that they spent on the floor. It \nis just unfortunate we were not successful.\n  I hope that the American people help us succeed, not just for \nRepublicans in the Senate, not just for the idea of a balanced budget \nbut really succeed for American taxpayers, for our children. People \nshould not be confused about claims that, ``I would vote for that \nexcept I want to protect the Social Security trust funds.''\n  That is one of the most absurd arguments made on the floor of the \nSenate. How can they protect Social Security trust funds which do not \nexist? The Social Security trust fund is a falacy. There are no trust \nfunds. There is not a bank account where any person in America can go \nlook at the billions of dollars accumulating there. The trust fund is \nfull of IOU's. And very soon, perhaps by the year 2013, we are going to \nbe paying out more than is coming in.\n  At that point it is assumed that we will start cashing in on the \ntrust fund IOU's. But what is really there? There is nothing in the \ntrust fund but an IOU. How do we pay off Government IOU's? We borrow \nmore money. By the year 2013, we are going to be paying more in social \nsecurity benefits more than we take in from social security payroll \ntaxes, and for each IOU we cash in to pay benefits we are going to have \nto borrow to pay off the IOU. That will put an enormous burden on \nyounger generations.\n  I think my colleagues who say they voted against this amendment to \nprotect the trust funds do not understand that there are no real trust \nfunds, there is no bank account, there is no fund where money is \nactually accumulating. There is just a Government IOU, and that \nGovernment IOU is going to be paid for like we pay other Government \nIOU's. It is going to be paid for with additional borrowing.\n  Maybe that was the political cover they needed to excuse them from \nvoting against this amendment, but it is very deceptive and very \nmisleading. I think we have to be truthful with the American people.\n  Again, those same people who voted ``no'' today voted ``yes'' last \nyear, and we had no special protection for social security. We had no \nsuch exemption for Social Security. I hope that the people will speak \nout loud and clear to their elected officials, and maybe we can reverse \nthe result that we had on the floor today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3384-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3386-S3389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     PRESIDENT CLINTON'S LEADERSHIP IN REDUCING THE NUCLEAR THREAT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, yesterday, in a speech before the Nixon \nCenter For Peace and Freedom's policy conference held here in \nWashington, President Clinton spoke eloquently about America's \nleadership role in the post-cold war era and the importance of America \nremaining engaged in world affairs. The President placed particular and \nappropriate emphasis on the need to continue to make strong efforts to \nreduce the threat of nuclear weapons.\n  The President's remarks regarding his concerns over the new \nisolationism creeping into the debate over American foreign policy and \nthe outline of his ambitious agenda to reduce the international nuclear \nthreat are especially significant for members of the Senate. In the \ncoming weeks we will be beginning debate on major foreign policy issues \nand may vote this year on ratification of the START II treaty as well \nas consider the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  As President Clinton has rightly pointed out, American leadership is \nvital to continued international efforts to promote peace and reduce \nthe threat of nuclear weapons. Since the days when President Truman \nbegan American efforts to curtail the threat of nuclear war, every \nAmerican President has worked to reduce that threat to world peace. \nPresident Clinton has sought to advance that goal and exploit the \nadditional possibilities for peace and prosperity provided by the end \nof the cold war.\n  There have been some notable successes. For the first time in a \ngeneration, no Russian missiles are targeted on American cities. Under \nthe START I treaty negotiated by President Bush and placed into force \nby President Clinton, the United States and Russia are dismantling \nthousands of nuclear weapons. Former Soviet republics that were \npotential nuclear powers have now pledged to rid their countries of \nnuclear weapons.\n  This year President Clinton has started a vigorous program to reduce \nthe threat posed by weapons of mass destruction. He has called for an \nindefinite world-wide extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty. And he has urged the Senate to quickly ratify the START II \ntreaty, and the Chemical Weapons Convention to ban poison gas. He has \npromised to push for conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and \nto fight for a global ban on the production of nuclear material for \nweapons.\n  The President's efforts to keep America engaged as the world's leader \nin the pursuit of peace and in reducing the threat of nuclear weapons \nare of vital importance to the national security of the United States \nand deserve the support of every American.\n  I commend his remarks to my colleagues' attention, and I ask \nunanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Remarks by the President to the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom \n                           Policy Conference\n\n       The President. To Tricia and John Taylor, and all the \n     people from the Nixon Center; our distinguished guests from \n     Germany and from Russia; of course, to Henry Kissinger--I was \n     thinking when he said we both spoke with accents, judging \n     from the results of the last election, his native country is \n     still claiming him more than mine is claiming me. (Laughter.) \n     but I'm a big one for reconciliation. (Laughter.) And there's \n     plenty of time to achieve it.\n       I am honored to be here tonight. Just a month before he \n     passed away, President Nixon wrote me the last letter I \n     received from him about his last trip to Russia. I told some \n     people at the time that it was the best piece of foreign \n     policy writing I had received, which angered my staff but \n     happened to be the truth. (Laughter.) And as with all of our \n     correspondence and conversations, I was struck by the rigor \n     of his analysis, the energy of his convictions, and the \n     wisdom of the practical suggestions that he made to me.\n       But more than the specifics of the letter, which basically \n     argued for the imperative of the United States continuing to \n     support political and economic reform in Russia, I was moved \n     by the letter's larger message--a message that ran throughout \n     Richard Nixon's entire public life and all of his prolific \n     writings. President Nixon believed deeply that the United \n     States simply could not be strong at home unless we were \n     strong and prepared to lead abroad.\n       And that made a big impression on me. When I was running \n     for President in 1992, even though there was this little \n     sticker up on the wall of my campaign headquarters that said, \n     ``It's the economy, stupid,'' I always said in every speech \n     that we had to have two objectives. We had to restore the \n     American Dream for all of our people, but we also had to make \n     sure that we move into\n      the next century still the strongest nation in the world, \n     and the world's greatest force for peace and freedom and \n     democracy.\n       Tonight I want to talk about the vital tradition of \n     American leadership and our responsibilities, those which \n     Henry Kissinger mentioned and those which President Nixon \n     recognized so well. Our mission especially I want to \n     discuss--to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons.\n       Today if we are going to be strong at home and lead abroad, \n     we have to overcome what we all recognize I think is a \n     dangerous and growing temptation here in our own land to \n     focus solely on the problems we face here in America. I want \n     to focus on the problems we face here in America. I've tried \n     to do it for the last two years. I look forward to working \n     with this new Republican-led Congress in the next two. But \n     not solely.\n       [[Page S3387]] There is a struggle now going on between \n     those of us who want to carry on the tradition of American \n     leadership and those who would advocate a new form of \n     American isolationism. A struggle which cuts curiously across \n     both party and ideological lines. If we're going to continue \n     to improve the security and prosperity of all our people, \n     then the tradition of American leadership must prevail.\n       We live in a moment of hope. We all know that. The \n     implosion of communism and the explosion of the global \n     economy have brought new freedoms to countries on every \n     continent. Free markets are on the rise. Democracy is \n     ascendant. The slogan says, ``after victory.'' Today, more \n     than ever before, people across the globe do have the \n     opportunity to reach their God-given potential. And because \n     they do, Americans have new opportunities to reach theirs as \n     well.\n       At the same time, the post-Cold War world has revealed a \n     whole web of problems that defy quick or painless solutions--\n     aggression of rogue states, transnational threats like \n     overpopulation and environmental degradation, terrible ethnic \n     conflicts and economic dislocation. But at the heart of all \n     these complex challenges, I believe, lies an age-old battle--\n     for power over human lives. The battle between the forces of \n     freedom and tyranny, tolerance and repression, hope and fear. \n     The same idea that was under attack by fascism and then by \n     communism remains under attack today in different ways all \n     across the world--the idea of the open society of free \n     people.\n       American leadership is necessary for the tide of history to \n     keep running our way, and for our children to have the future \n     they deserve. Yet, there are some who would choose escapism \n     over engagement. The new isolationists oppose our efforts to \n     expand free trade through GATT or NAFTA through APEC and the \n     Summit of the Americas. They reject our conviction that \n     democracy must be\n      nurtured with investment and support, a conviction that we \n     are acting on from the former Soviet Union to South \n     Africa. And some of them, being hypocritical, saying that \n     we must trumpet the rhetoric of American strength; and \n     then at the same time, they argue against the resources we \n     need to bring stability to the Persian Gulf or to restore \n     democracy to Haiti, or to control the spread of drugs and \n     organized crime around the world, or even to meet our most \n     elemental obligations to the United Nations and its \n     peacekeeping work.\n       The new isolationists both on the left and the right would \n     radically revise the fundamentals of our foreign policy that \n     have earned bipartisan support since the end of World War II. \n     They would eliminate any meaningful role for the United \n     Nations which has achieved, for all of its problems, real \n     progress around the world, from the Middle East to Africa. \n     They would deny resources to our peacekeepers and even to our \n     troops, and, instead, squander them on Star Wars. And they \n     would refuse aid to the fledgling democracies and to all \n     those fighting poverty and environmental problems that can \n     literally destroy hopes for a more democratic, more \n     prosperous, more safe world.\n       The new isolationists are wrong. They would have us face \n     the future alone. Their approach would weaken this country, \n     and we must not let the ripple of isolationism that has been \n     generated build into a tidal wave.\n       If we withdraw from the world today, mark my words, we'll \n     have to contend with the consequences of our neglect tomorrow \n     and tomorrow and tomorrow. This is a moment of decision for \n     all of us without regard to our party, our background or our \n     accent. This is a moment of decision.\n       The extraordinary trend toward democracy and free markets \n     is not inevitable. And as we have seen recently, it will not \n     proceed easily in an even, uninterrupted course. This is hard \n     work. And at the very time when more and more countries than \n     ever before are working to establish or shore up their own \n     freedom in their fragile democracies, they look to us for \n     support. At this time, the new isolationists must not be \n     allowed to pull America out of the game after just a few \n     hours of debate because there is a modest price attached to \n     our leadership. (Applause.)\n       We know now, as President Nixon recognized, that there must \n     also be limits to America's involvement in the world's \n     problems--limits imposed by clear-headed evaluation of our \n     fundamental interests. We cannot be the world's policemen; we \n     cannot become involved in every problem we really care about. \n     But the choice we make must be rooted in the conviction that \n     America cannot walk away its interests or its \n     responsibilities.\n       That's why, from our first day in office, this \n     administration has chosen to reach out, not retreat. From our \n     efforts to open markets for America to support democracy \n     around the world, to reduce the threat posed by devastating \n     weapons and terrorists, to maintaining the most effective \n     fighting force in the world, we have worked to seize the \n     opportunities and meet the obligations of this moment.\n       None of this could have happened without a coalition of \n     realists--people in both Houses of Congress and, importantly, \n     people from both parties; people from coast to coast in our \n     towns and cities and communities who know that the wealth and \n     well-being of the United States depends upon our leadership \n     abroad. Even the early leaders of our republic who went to \n     great pains to avoid involvement in great power conflicts \n     recognize not only the potential benefits, but the absolute \n     necessity of engaging with the world.\n       Before Abraham Lincoln was elected President, our farmers \n     were selling their crops overseas, we had dispatched the \n     trade mission all the way to Japan trying to open new \n     markets--some problems don't go away--(laughter)--and our \n     Navy had already sailed every ocean. By the dawn of this \n     century, our growing political and economic power already \n     imposed a special duty on America to lead; a duty that was \n     crystallized in our involvement in World War I. But after \n     that war, we and the other great powers abandoned our \n     responsibilities and the forces of tyranny and hatred filled \n     the vacuum, as is well-known.\n       After the second world war, our wise leaders did not repeat \n     that mistake. With the dawn of the Nuclear Age and the Cold \n     War, and with the economies of Europe and Japan in shambles, \n     President Truman persuaded an uncertain and weary nation, \n     yearning to shift its energies from the front lines to the \n     home front, to lead the world again.\n       A remarkable generation of Americans created and sustained \n     alliances and institutions--the Marshall Plan, NATO, the \n     United Nations, the World Bank, the IMF--the things that \n     brought half a century of security and prosperity to America, \n     to Europe, to Japan and to other countries all around the \n     world. Those efforts and the special resolve and military \n     strength of our own nation held tyranny in check until the \n     power of democracy, the failures of communism, and the heroic \n     determination of people to be free, consigned the Cold War to \n     history.\n       Those successes would not have been possible without a \n     strong, bipartisan commitment to American's leadership.\n       Senator Arthur Vandenburg's call to unite our official \n     voice at the water's edge joined Republicans to Truman's \n     doctrine. His impact was all the more powerful for his own \n     past as an isolationist. But as Vandenburg himself said, \n     Pearl Harbor ended isolationism for any realist.\n       Today, it is Vandenburg's spirit that should drive our \n     foreign policy and our politics. The practical determination \n     of Senators Nunn and Lugar to help Russia reduce its nuclear \n     arsenal safely and securely; the support from Speaker \n     Gingrich and Leader Gephardt, from Chairman Livingston and \n     Representative Obey for aid to Russia and the newly-\n     independent states; the work of Senators Hatfield, Leahy and \n     McConnell, and Chairman Gilman, and Representative Hamilton \n     for peace in the Middle East; the efforts of Senator Warner \n     to restructure our intelligence--all these provide strong \n     evidence of the continuing benefits and vitality of \n     leadership with bipartisanship.\n       If we continue to lead abroad and work together at home, we \n     can take advantage of these turbulent times. But if we \n     retreat, we risk squandering all these opportunity and \n     abandoning our obligations which others have entrusted to us \n     and paid a very dear price to bring to us in this moment in \n     history.\n       I know that the choice to go forward in a lot of these \n     areas is not easy in democracies at this time. Many of the \n     decisions that America's leaders have to make are not popular \n     when they're made. But imagine the alternative. Imagine, for \n     example, the tariffs and barriers that would still cripple \n     the world trading system for years into the future if \n     internationalists coming together across party lines had not \n     passed GATT and NAFTA. Imagine what the Persian Gulf region \n     would look like today if the United States had not stepped up \n     with its allies to stop Iraqi aggression. Imagine the ongoing \n     reign of terror and the flood of refugees at our borders had \n     we not helped to give democracy a second chance in Haiti. \n     Imagine the chaos that might have ensued if we had not moved \n     to help stabilize Mexico's economy. In each case, there was \n     substantial and sometimes overwhelming majority opinion \n     against what needed to be done at the moment. But because we \n     did it, the world has a better chance at peace and freedom.\n       But above all now, I ask you to imagine the dangers that \n     our children and grandchildren, even after the Cold War is \n     over, still can face if we do not do everything we can to \n     reduce the threat of nuclear arms, to curb the terrible \n     chemical and biological weapons spreading around the world, \n     to counter the terrorists and criminals who would put these \n     weapons into the service of evil.\n       As Arthur Vandenburg asked at the dawn of the Nuclear Age, \n     after a German V-1 attack had left London in flames and its\n      people in fear, ``How can there be isolation when men can \n     devise weapons like that?''\n       President Nixon understood the wisdom of those words. His \n     life spanned an era of stunning increases in humankind's \n     destructive capacity, from the biplane to ballistic missiles, \n     from mustard gas to mushroom clouds. He knew that the Atomic \n     Age could never be won, but could be lost. On any list of his \n     foreign policy accomplishments, the giant steps he took \n     toward reducing the nuclear threat must stand among his \n     greatest achievement. As President, I have acted on that same \n     imperative.\n       Over the past two years, the United States has made real \n     progress in lifting the threat of nuclear weapons. Now, in \n     1995, we face a year of particular decision in this era--a \n     year in which the United States will pursue the most \n     ambitious agenda to dismantle and fight the spread of weapons \n     of mass destruction since the atom was split.\n       [[Page S3388]] We know that ours is an enormously complex \n     and difficult challenge. There is no single policy, no silver \n     bullet, that will prevent or reverse the spread of weapons of \n     mass destruction. But we have no more important task. Arms \n     control makes us not only safer, but it makes us stronger. It \n     is a source of strength. It is one of the most effective \n     insurance policies we can write for the future of our \n     children.\n       Our administration has focused on two distinct, but closely \n     connected areas--decreasing and dismantling existing weapons, \n     and preventing nations or groups from acquiring weapons of \n     mass destruction, and the means to deliver them. We've made \n     progress on both fronts.\n       As the result of an agreement President Yeltsin and I \n     reached, for the first time in a generation Russian missiles \n     are not pointed at our cities or our citizens. We've greatly \n     reduced the lingering fear of an accidental nuclear launch. \n     We put into force the START I Treaty with Russia that will \n     eliminate from both our countries delivery systems that carry \n     more than 9,000 nuclear warheads--each with the capacity to \n     incinerate a city the size of Atlanta.\n       START I, negotiated by two Republican administrations and \n     put into force by this Democratic administration, is the \n     first treaty that requires the nuclear powers actually to \n     reduce their strategic arsenal. Both our countries are \n     dismantling the weapons as fast as we can. And thanks to a \n     far-reaching verification system, including on-side \n     inspections which began in Russia and the United States \n     today, each of us knows exactly what the other is doing.\n       And, again, through the far-sighted program devised by \n     Senators Nunn and Lugar, we are helping Russia and the other \n     newly-independent states to eliminate nuclear forces in \n     transport, safeguard and destroy nuclear weapons and \n     material.\n       Ironically, some of the changes that have allowed us to \n     reduce the world's stockpile of nuclear weapons have made our \n     nonproliferation efforts harder. The breakup of the Soviet \n     Union left nuclear materials dispersed throughout the newly-\n     independent states. The potential for theft of nuclear \n     materials, therefore, increased. We face the prospect of \n     organized criminals entering the nuclear smuggling business. \n     Add to this the volatile mix, the fact that a lump of \n     plutonium the size of a soda can is enough to build a bomb, \n     and the urgency of the effort to stop the spread of nuclear \n     materials should be clear to all of us.\n       That's why from our first day in office we have launched an \n     aggressive, coordinated campaign against international \n     terrorism and nuclear smuggling. We are cooperating closely \n     with our allies, working with Russia and the other new-\n     independent states, improving security at nuclear facilities, \n     and strengthening multilateral export controls.\n       One striking example of our success is Operation Sapphire, \n     the airlift of nearly 600 kilograms of highly-enriched \n     uranium--enough to make dozens of bombs from Kazakhstan to \n     the United States for disposal. We've also secured agreements \n     with Russia to reduce the uranium and plutonium available for \n     nuclear weapons, and we're seeking a global treaty banning \n     the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons.\n       Our patient, determined diplomacy also succeeded in \n     convincing Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine to sign the Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty and give up the nuclear weapons left on \n     their territory when the Soviet Union dissolved. One of our \n     administration's top priorities was to assure that these new \n     countries would become non-nuclear nations, and now we are \n     also achieving that goal.\n       Because of these efforts, four potential suppliers of \n     ballistic missiles--Russia, Ukraine, China and South Africa-- \n     have all agreed to control the transfer of these missiles and \n     related technology, pulling back from the nuclear precipice \n     has allowed us to cut United States defense expenditures for \n     strategic weapons by almost two-thirds, a savings of about \n     $20 billion a year, savings which can be shifted to vital \n     needs such as boosting the readiness of our Armed Forces, \n     reducing the deficit, putting more police on our own streets. \n     By spending millions to keep or take weapons out of the hands \n     of our potential adversaries, we are saving billions in arms \n     costs and putting it to better use.\n       Now, in this year of decision, our ambition for the future \n     must be even more ambitious. If our people are to know real \n     lasting security, we have to redouble our arms control, \n     nonproliferation and antiterrorism efforts. We have to do \n     everything we can to avoid living with the 21st century \n     version of fallout shelters and duck-and-cover exercises to \n     prevent another World Trade Center tragedy.\n       In just four days we mark the 25th anniversary of the Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty. Nothing is more important to prevent \n     the spread of nuclear weapons than extending the treaty \n     indefinitely and unconditionally. And that's why I've asked \n     the Vice President to lead our delegation to the NPT \n     conference this April and to work as hard as we can to make \n     sure we succeed in getting that indefinite extension.\n       The NPT is the principal reason why scores of nations do \n     not now possess nuclear weapons; why the doomsayers were \n     wrong. One hundred and seventy-two nations have made NPT the \n     most widely subscribed arms limitation treaty in history for \n     one overriding reason--it's in their self-interest to do so. \n     Non-nuclear weapon states that sign on to the treaty pledge \n     never to acquire them. Nuclear weapons states vow not to help \n     others obtain nuclear weapons, to facilitate the peaceful \n     uses of atomic energy and to pursue nuclear arms control and \n     disarmament--commitments I strongly reaffirm, along with our \n     determination to attain universal membership in the treaty.\n       Failure to extend NPT indefinitely could open the door to a \n     world of nuclear trouble. Pariah nations with rigid \n     ideologies and expansionist ambitions would have an easier \n     time acquiring terrible weapons, and countries that have \n     chosen to forego the nuclear option would then rethink their \n     position; they would certainly be tempted to reconsider that \n     decision.\n       To further demonstrate our commitment to the goals of the \n     treaty, today I have ordered that 200 tons of fissile \n     material, enough for thousands of nuclear weapons, be \n     permanently withdrawn from the United States nuclear \n     stockpile. Two hundred tons of fissile material that will \n     never again be used to build a nuclear weapon.\n       A second key goal of ours is ratifying START II. Once in \n     effect, that treaty will eliminate delivery systems from \n     Russian and American arsenals that carry more than 5,000 \n     weapons. The major reductions under START I, together with \n     START II, will enable us to reduce two-thirds the number of \n     strategic warheads deployed at the height of the Cold War. At \n     my urging, the Senate has already begun hearings on START II, \n     and I am encouraged by the interest of the senators from both \n     parties in seeking quick action. I commend the Senate for the \n     action taken\n      so far, and I urge again the approval of the treaty as soon \n     as possible.\n       President Yeltsin and I have already instructed our experts \n     to begin considering the possibility after START II is \n     ratified of additional reductions and limitations on \n     remaining nuclear forces. We have a chance to further lift \n     the nuclear cloud, and we dare not miss it.\n       To stop the development of new generations of nuclear \n     weapons, we must also quickly complete negotiations on a \n     comprehensive test ban treaty. Last month I extended a \n     nuclear testing moratorium that I put into effect when I took \n     office. And we revised our negotiating position to speed the \n     conclusion of the treaty while reaffirming our determination \n     to maintain a safe and reliable nuclear stockpile.\n       We will also continue to work with our allies to fully \n     implement the agreement we reached with North Korea, first to \n     freeze, then do dismantle its nuclear program, all under \n     international monitoring. The critics of this agreement, I \n     believe, are wrong. The deal does stop North Korea's nuclear \n     program, and it does commit Pyongyang to roll it back in the \n     years to come.\n       I have not heard another alternative proposal that isn't \n     either unworkable or foolhardy, or one that our allies in the \n     Republican of Korea and Japan, the nation's most directly \n     affected, would fail to support.\n       If North Korea fulfills its commitment, the Korean \n     Peninsula and the entire world will clearly be less \n     threatened and more secure. The NPT, START II, the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the North Korean Agreement, \n     they top our agenda for the year ahead. There are other \n     critical tasks we also face if we want to make every American \n     more secure, including winning Senate ratification of the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention, negotiating legally binding \n     measures to strengthen the Biological and Toxin Weapons \n     Convention, clarifying the ABM Treaty so as to secure its \n     viability while permitting highly effective defenses against \n     theater missile attacks, continuing to support regional arms \n     control efforts in the Middle East and elsewhere, and pushing \n     for the ratification of conventional weapons which, among \n     other things, would help us to reduce the suffering caused by \n     the tens of millions of anti-personnel mines which are \n     plaguing millions of people all across the world.\n       My friends, this is a full and challenging agenda. There \n     are many obstacles ahead. We cannot achieve it if we give in \n     to a new isolationism. But I believe we can do no less than \n     make every effort to complete it.\n       Tonight, let us remember what President Nixon told the \n     joint session of Congress when he returned from his historic \n     trip to Moscow in 1972. He said, ``We have begun to check the \n     wasteful and dangerous spiral of nuclear arms. Let us seize \n     the moment so that our children and the world's children can \n     live free of the fears and free of the hatreds that have been \n     the lot of mankind through the centuries.''\n       Now it is within our power to realize the dream that \n     Richard Nixon described over 20 years ago. We cannot let \n     history record that our generation of Americans refused to \n     rise to this challenge, that we withdrew from the world and \n     abandoned our responsibilities when we knew better than to do \n     it, that we lacked the energy, the vision and the will to \n     carry this struggle forward--the age-old struggle between \n     hope and fear.\n       So let us find inspiration in the great tradition of Harry \n     Truman and Arthur Vandenburg--a tradition that builds bridges \n     of cooperation, not walls of isolation; that opens the arms \n     of Americans to change instead of throwing up our hands in \n     despair; that casts aside partisanship and brings together \n     Republicans and Democrats for the good of the American people \n     and the world. That is the tradition that made the most of \n     this land, won the great battles of this century against \n     tyranny and secured our freedom and our prosperity.\n       [[Page S3389]] Above all, let's not forget that these \n     efforts begin and end with the American people. Every time we \n     reduce the threat that has hung over our heads since the dawn \n     of the Nuclear Age, we help to ensure that from the far \n     stretches of the Aleutians to the tip of the Florida Keys, \n     the American people are more secure. That is our most serious \n     task and our most solemn obligation.\n       The challenge of this moment is matched only by its \n     possibility. So let us do our duty.\n       Thank you very much.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3386-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING RECESS\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4 1995, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on March 1, 1995, during the recess of the \nSenate, received a message from the House of Representatives announcing \nthat the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 257.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation and coastwise trade endorsement for the \nvessel Emerald Ayes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n       ``emerald ayes'' certificate of documentation legislation\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to direct \nthat the vessel Emerald Ayes, official number 986099, be accorded \ncoastwise trading privileges and be issued a certificate of \ndocumentation under section 12103 of title 46, United States Code.\n  The Emerald Ayes was constructed in Canada in 1992, and is a sailing \ncatamaran for use as a recreational vessel. It is 36.4 feet in length, \n18.2 feet in breadth, has a depth of 9.4 feet, and is self-propelled.\n  The vessel was purchased by Dr. Stephen D. Michel of Mount Pleasant, \nSC, who purchased it with the intention of chartering the vessel for \nshort sailing tours. However, because the vessel was built in Canada, \nit did not meet the requirements for coastwise license endorsement in \nthe United States. Such documentation is mandatory to enable the owner \nto use the vessel for its intended purpose. He first sought to purchase \na U.S.-built vessel, but this type of sailboat is not built by any U.S. \nshipbuilders. He has invested a considerable amount of money in this \nvessel, and without a Jones Act waiver for the boat, he will be forced \nto sell it.\n  The owner of the Emerald Ayes is seeking a waiver of the existing law \nbecause he wishes to use the vessel for charters. His desired \nintentions for the vessel's use will not adversely affect the coastwise \ntrade in U.S. waters. If he is granted this waiver, it is his intention \nto comply fully with U.S. documentation and safety requirements. The \npurpose of the legislation I am introducing is to allow the Emerald \nAyes to engage in the coastwise trade and the fisheries of the United \nStates.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Thompson):\n  S. 483. A bill to amend the provisions of title 17, United States \nCode, with respect to the duration of copyright, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                the copyright term extension act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Congress has in recent years passed many \nsignificant copyright measures, but it is a rare occasion when we \naddress the fundamental aspects of copyright protection, such as the \nnature of the works protected, the scope of rights recognized, or the \nduration of copyright.\n  Still, from time to time, it becomes clear that fundamental change is \nneeded. I believe we are now at such a point with respect to the \nquestion of whether the current term of copyright adequately protects \nthe interests of authors and the related question of whether the term \nof protection continues to provide a sufficient incentive for the \ncreation of new works of authorship.\n  The current term of copyright is, in my view, inadequate to perform \nits historic functions of spurring creativity and protecting authors. \nThus, I am filing today the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1995, which \nhas the general purpose of increasing existing copyright terms by the \naddition of a further 20 years of protection. I am pleased to be joined \nin this effort by my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Feinstein of California and Senator Thompson of Tennessee.\n  Mr. President, Congress has protected copyrights since the very first \nCongress, and the entire history of our copyright laws has been a \nhistory of everincreasing protection, both with respect to the nature \nof works protected, as well as with respect to the duration of \nprotection. Still, in over 200 years, the copyright term has only been \nextended on three prior occasions.\n  In 1790, the first Congress set the maximum term of copyright \nprotection at 28 years--a 14-year initial period that could be renewed \nfor an additional 14 years. In 1831, we extended that period by 14 \nyears--a 28-year initial period that could be renewed for an additional \n14 years. In 1909, the major copyright reform act of that era extended \nthe maximum term of copyright to 56 years--a 28-year initial term that \ncould be renewed for an additional 28 years.\n  Most recently, the Copyright Act of 1976 fundamentally altered the \nway in which we measure copyright by protecting works throughout the \nlife of their creator plus an additional 50 years. In so doing, we \nadopted the prevailing international standard of protection--a standard \nthat was first recommended by the members of the Berne Convention for \nthe Protection of Literary and Artistic Works in the Act of Berlin of \nNovember 13, 1908, and that was made mandatory for members of the Berne \nUnion by the Act of Brussels of June 26, 1948.\n  For existing works, the Copyright Act of 1976 created a maximum term \nof 75 years of protection--a 34-percent increase in term of protection \nover the preceding maximum of 56 years. The 20-year increase in \nprotection that the Copyright Extension Act of 1995 provides for \nexisting works is a far more modest extension of copyright than that \nwhich we adopted in 1976, or, in fact, that which was implemented by \nthe two previous congressional extensions of copyright term.\n  [[Page S3391]] Every work created after the effective date of the \nCopyright Term Extension Act will be prospectively protected for the \nremainder of the author's life and for 70 years thereafter. Works in \nexistence on that date will receive the identical protection, if their \nauthor is still living. As for the works of authors already decreased, \nmy bill provides an additional 20 years of protection; provided, that \nthe works have not, on the effective date of the bill, already gone \ninto the public domain.\n  Those works whose term of protection under the current Copyright Act \nis not tied to the life of an author but is a fixed term of years, such \nas works made for hire, will also receive an additional 20 years of \nprotection. Where they are protected for 75 years under present law, \nthey will be protected for 95 years under the provisions of the \nCopyright Term Extension Act.\n  By providing this across-the-board extension of copyright for an \nadditional 20 years, I believe that authors will reap the full benefits \nto which they are entitled from the exploitation of their creative \nworks. In addition, there are significant trade benefits to be obtained \nby extending copyright in the United States to bring our law into \nconformity with the longer copyright term enjoyed by authors in other \nnations.\n  As I noted above, our current basic copyright term of life plus 50 \nyears is prevailing international standard, one now also applicable to \nthe members of the World Trade Organization through the implementation \nof the Agreement on the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property \nProtection [TRIPS]. Despite the nearly universal adoption of the life-\nplus-50-year term of copyright, many have observed that the term \nitself, particularly the decision to give significance to 50 years, has \nachieved dominance perhaps more through imitation and acceptance than \nthrough an analytical belief that the life-plus-50-year term represents \nthe ideal period of protection needed to appropriately reward and \ninspire creative activity. See, that is, Ricketson, ``The Berne \nConvention for the protection of literary and artistic works: 1886-\n1986'' p. 321.\n\n       While the [Berne Convention's] prescriptions as to duration \n     are quite precise, there has never been any real effort made \n     to justify why, or to explain how, these terms have come to \n     be adopted * * *\n\n  Even though the United States adopted the life-plus-50-year term of \ncopyright only 19 years ago, and even though that term of protection \nhas a nearly century-old history in the international arena, I do not \nbelieve that it should be accepted uncritically as an ideal or even \nsufficient measurement of the most appropriate duration for copyright \nterm. Instead, we should be aware of the many nations that have \nhistorically provided longer terms of copyright as well as the recent \ndevelopments to extend copyright in Europe. Also, we need to examine \nthe real-life experience of creators, their reasonable expectations for \nexploiting their works, and the concerns and views of the descendants, \nheirs, and others whom the postmortem protection of copyright was \ndesigned to benefit.\n  Among the European nations, Germany and Spain have for some time \nrecognized respectively terms of life plus 70 pears and life plus 80 \nyears, and Portugal has for much of this century provided a perpetual \nterm of protection. In addition, it is common for bilateral agreements \nrelating to copyright protection among particular nations to provide \nfor terms of protection in excess of the life-plus-50-year standard.\n  As far as a general reconsideration of the life-plus-50-year term, it \nshould be noted that as long ago as 1961 the permanent committee of the \nBerne Union began the process of reexamining the sufficiency of that \nterm of protection. At the Stockholm Conference of 1967, a proposal to \nincrease the copyright term to life plus 80 years was debated though \nnot adopted. It is, however, easy to speculate that the failure to \nincrease copyright term at that time may have been disproportionately \ninfluenced by the contemporaneous efforts in the United States to adopt \na copyright act compatible with the existing minimum requirements of \nthe Berne Convention. An extension of the minimum term at that time \nwould, however meritorious, surely have made more difficult the \neventual adoption of the Copyright Act of 1976 in the United States.\n  In the intervening years, the inadequacy of the life-plus-50-year \nterm has become more apparent, and nations have acted to increase the \nduration of copyright. Most significantly, the nations of the European \nUnion, pursuant to an October 1993, directive of the Council of the \nEuropean Communities, are committed to reaching a life-plus-70-minimum \nterm of protection by July of this year. It is thus fair to say that \nfor a significant portion of the developed world--for the nations, \nmoreover, that have traditionally been in the forefront of protecting \nauthors' rights--the term of life-plus-70 has gained a broad \nacceptance.\n  I am pleased to be the author of the bill that I hope will bring \nAmerican copyright law into accord with this developing international \nunderstanding as to the appropriate duration of copyright.\n  The benefits of extending copyright by 20 years will be felt in many \nareas. The vast majority of our European and other trading partners \nhave obligated themselves to extend to our\n authors the full protection of their copyright laws--at least to the \nextent that America recognizes complementary rights. Of course, I \nshould add that with respect to the minimum requirements for copyright \nprotection, national treatment for U.S. authors is mandated by the \nBerne Convention as well as by the TRIPS agreement. But copyright \nprotections in excess of the Berne minima will not be freely granted to \nU.S. authors on the basis of national treatment. Instead, the option \nallowed by the Berne Convention's ``role of the shorter term'' will no \ndoubt be often employed by foreign states with the result that American \nworks will be protected in those nations only to the extent that the \nworks of their authors are protected in America--article 7(1) of the EC \ndirective explicitly mandates rule of the shorter term treatment for \nthe works of foreign authors.\n\n  After the European law goes into effect, American authors will be \ntheoretically protected for an additional 20 years, but will in reality \nbe unprotected for that entire period of time--unless American law is \nstrengthened in the manner proposed by the bill I am filing today.\n  America exports more copyrighted intellectual property than any \ncountry in the world, a huge percentage of it to the nations of the \nEuropean Union. Intellectual property is, in fact, our second largest \nexport; it is an area in which we possess a large trade surplus. At a \ntime when we face trade deficits in many other areas, we cannot afford \nto abandon 20 years' worth of valuable overseas protection now \navailable to our creators and copyright owners. We must adopt a life-\nplus-70-year term of copyright if we wish to improve our international \nbalance. It just makes plain common sense to ensure fair compensation \nfor the American creators whose efforts fuel this important \nintellectual property sector of our economy by extending our copyright \nterm to allow American copyright owners to benefit from foreign uses. \nBy so doing, we guarantee that our trading partners do not get a free \nride for their use of our intellectual property.\n  While we may be accustomed to a substantial American balance-of-trade \nsurplus with respect to trade in works of intellectual property, we \ncannot afford to take this condition for granted. In a world economy \nwhere copyrighted works flow through a fiber optic global information \ninfrastructure, American competitiveness demands that we adapt our \nlaws--and adapt them quickly--to provide the maximum advantage for our \ncreators.\n  Anonymous and pseudonymous works: I noted about that the copyright \nterm extension provided by the bill I file today is not mandated by our \ntreaty obligations. But it may be well to note parenthetically that at \nleast in one respect the 20-year term extension does advance our \nongoing efforts to fulfill our obligations under the Berne Convention. \nI am speaking of the term of protection applicable to anonymous and \npseudonymous works. Article 7(3) of the Berne Convention mandates that \nsuch works be protected for at least 50 years after they are first made \nlawfully available to the public. Our current law protects those works \nfor 75 years, yet Sec. 302(c) of the Copyright Act also establishes a \nmaximum term of protection-- \n[[Page S3392]] 100 years from the date of their creation--beyond which \nno anonymous or pseudonymous work will be protected, regardless of the \ndate on which it may ultimately be made available to the public. My \nbill increases each of these terms by 20 years.\n  Since the Stockholm Act of July 14, 1967, the Berne Convention has \nrecognized the need for an outer limit on the protection of anonymous \nand pseudonymous works by providing that, ``The countries of the Union \nshall not be required to protect anonymous or pseudonymous works in \nrespect of which it is reasonable to presume that their author has been \ndead for fifty years.'' Art. 7(3). It has been argued that the American \nprovision setting an outer limit of 100 years of protection for \nanonymous and pseudonymous works is in violation of the Berne \nConvention, see Nimmer, ``Copyright'' Sec. 9.01[D], at least with \nrespect to works whose country of origin is not the United States. By \nincreasing the maximum protection from its current 100 years to a \nperiod of 120 years, the Copyright Term Extension Act will at least \nserve to reduce greatly the number of potential situations in which our \nlaw may operate in violation of the Berne Convention. This for the \nreason that it is far more reasonable to presume that an author who \ncreated a work 120 years ago may have been deceased for 50 years, than \nit is to presume that the author of a work created only 100 years ago \nmay have been deceased for at least 50 years.\n  Mr. President, that is the theoretical, one might say \njurisprudential, background of the copyright issue before us today. But \nit may be well to consider this legal question in its practical aspect \nas well. What works are we talking about? Who is affected by this \nlegislation?\n  Mr. President, this legislation matters and it matters to some of the \nmost distinguished members of America's cultural and artistic \ncommunity. If we examine the significance of this legislation just in \nthe area of popular music alone, I believe we will see its importance.\n  Consider the following songs that fell into the public domain just 2 \nmonths ago at the end of 1994--works still widely performed in theaters \nand through media around the world:\n  ``Swanee'' by George Gershwin and Irving Caesar; ``A Pretty Girl Is \nLike a Melody'' by Irving Berlin; ``Alice Blue Gown'' by Joseph \nMcCarthy and Harry Tierney.\n  In the preceding 2 years, the following standards also lost\n   copyright protection, despite their continued popularity: ``After \nYou've Gone'' by Henry Creamer and turner Layton; ``Till the Clouds \nRoll By'' by Jerome Kern and P.G. Wodehouse; ``Over There'' by George \nM. Cohan; ``Till We Meet Again'' by Richard Whiting and Raymond Egan.\n\n  If the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1995 is not adopted this year \nin this session of Congress, the following songs will no longer be \nprotected by copyright: ``Look for the Silver Lining'' by Jerome Kern \nand bud DeSylva; ``Avalon'' by Al Jolson, Bud DeSylva, and Vincent \nRose.\n  Within the next few years, if Congress does not act to adopt \nlegislation such as that which I introduce today, the following musical \nworks will also fall into the public domain: ``Rahpsody in Blue'' by \nGeorge Gershwin; ``My Buddy'' by Walter Donaldson and Gus Kahn; \n``What'll I Do'' by Irving Berlin; ``Georgia'' by Walter Donaldson and \nHoward Johnson; ``It Had To Be You'' by Isham Jones and Gus Kahn; \n``Showboat'' by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II.\n  All of these songwriters and composers are household names still, \nafter 75 years. Indeed ``Showboat'' is back on Broadway, eight \nperformances a week, nearly 70 years after its premiere.\n  But I would like to draw particular attention to the career of Walter \nDonaldson. He composed the songs cited above when he was in his \ntwenties, and he died in 1947 when he was in his midfifties. He \ncomposed innumerable standards and will forever be linked to the \nextraordinary success of the 1927 film ``The Jazz Singer'' in which his \nsongs were sung by Al Jolsen. The historical significance of that \nmotion picture, the first sound film to be commercially released, can \nhardly be overstated.\n  If the present copyright law had been in effect in the 1920's, all of \nWalter Donaldson's compositions would fall into the public domain \nwithin the next 2 years. Yet these historical facts should not mislead \nus into thinking that the copyright status of his works is an academic \nissue. For it was Ellen Donaldson, the composer's daughter, who first \nalerted me to the importance of this issue only 2 years ago. I do not \nthink she will mind my pointing out that she is now only in her early \nfifties. She remains extremely active in publishing and exploiting her \nfather's music and in protecting his copyrights. Like the children of \ncomposers such as Richard Rogers, Irving Berlin, Richard Whiting, Hoagy \nCarmichael, and many, many others, her legitimate interest in her \nfather's copyrights can be expected to continue for decades, certainly \nfor another 20 years.\n  Mr. President, from interviews I have had with writers, authors, and \nartists of all kinds, and from the hearings we have held on issues of \nconcern to authors in the Judiciary Committee over the past 18 years, I \nhave come to the conclusion that the vast majority of authors expect \ntheir copyrights to be a potentially valuable resource to be passed on \nto their children and through them into the succeeding generation. I \nbelieve that they are reasonable in this expectation and that such a \ngeneral expectation is what the Framers of the Constitution had in mind \nwhen they constrained the power of Congress to grant patents and \ncopyrights only with the very broad and flexible requirement that such \nrights be granted ``for limited times.'' Article I, section 8. When, \nhowever, we so often see copyrights expiring before even the first \ngeneration of an author's heirs have fully benefited from them, then I \nbelieve that is accurate to say that our term of copyright is too short \nand for a too limited time.\n  One could also cite demographic factors that point to the need for a \nlonger term if copyright is truly to reflect the natural desire of \nauthors to provide for their heirs. Principal among these would be the \nincreasing lifespan of the average American, as well as the increasing \nfact of children being born far later, in a marriage than in past \ndecades. Whatever the reason, the inescapable conclusion must be drawn \nthat copyrights in valuable works are too often expiring before they \nhave served their purpose of allowing an author to pass their benefits \non to his or her heirs. I urge my colleagues to pass the Copyright Term \nExtension Act of 1995 to remedy this situation.\n  Mr. President, we in Congress are currently dealing with a number of \nfundamental issues that bring into question how we have done things in \nthe Federal government over many years. These debates raise the \nquestion of the proper role of the Federal Government in sponsoring, \nstimulating, and, where appropriate, funding artistic activity across a \nwide range of fields. We are asking virtually every Federal program now \nin existence to justify its function. And, as a result, we hear much \nabout the programs that do not work.\n  We hear all too little about the good that Government can do when it \nfunctions in a limited and effective way. I would submit that the \ncopyright system--in the way that it rewards private initiative through \ngovernmental protection, all without the need for a regulatory \nbureaucracy--is a model for the best that government can do to improve \nthe life of its citizens.\n  And when one considers that all works of creativity fixed by any \nmethod now known or later developed are invested from the moment of \ntheir creation with substantial rights that can be protected in any \nFederal court, then I think it becomes clear that the copyright system \nis something we should encourage and, where appropriate, extend.\n  Because the bill I introduce today does extend the benefits of \ncopyright in an appropriate and obviously needed way, I am proud to be \nits sponsor. I urge my colleagues to give it their most serious \nconsideration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\n                                 S. 483\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as always when it comes to matters of \ncopyright law, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nhas spoken well and to the point as to why extending the basic term of \ncopyright protection by 20 years is both the right and the economically \ndesirable thing to do, and to do without delay. As the bill's coauthor, \nI'd like to add just a few thoughts about our proposal to extend the \nlength of copyright protection for only the fourth time since the \nFounding Fathers established such rights more than 200 years ago.\n  First principles come first. The fundamental animating principle of \ncopyright protection was--and remains--assuring that the Nation's most \ncreative individuals have and retain a sufficient economic incentive to \ncontinue to craft, work by copyrightable work, the incomparable mosaic \nof our Nation's cultural life. For many years now, such incentive has \nbeen considered to be the right to profit from licensing one's work \nduring one's lifetime and to take pride and comfort in knowing that \none's children--and perhaps their children--might also benefit from \none's posthumous popularity. Indeed, it was to preserve that incentive \nthat Congress adopted the current life plus 50 years term that is now \nthe law.\n  Human longevity, however, is increasingly undermining this \nfundamental precept of copyright law, Mr. President, and with it the \neconomic incentive deemed essential by the authors of the Constitution. \nWe all had the great good fortune, for example, to have the \nincomparable Irving Berlin among us until 1989, when he died at the age \nof 101. By that time, however, Mr. Berlin had outlived the period in \nwhich he was entitled to royalties from the immortal ``Alexander's \nRagtime Band.'' Although not every American copyright owner will reach \nthe century mark, Mr. President, it's clear that we as a Nation are \nliving longer and more active lives.\n  Copyright law has in the past--and should now again--reflect that \ncentral fact of life. Accordingly, the Copyright Term Extension Act of \n1995 uniformly extends the life of copyright protection in this country \nby 20 years, a modest extension relative to past adjustments, as \nChairman Hatch points out. Writers, artists, filmmakers, composers, \nphotographers, sculptors, and cartographers alike--and their children, \nall will benefit from this overdue adjustment. Perhaps more \nimportantly, as the ultimate beneficiaries of the creativity that \ncopyright protection is intended to assure, so will we all.\n  Second, Mr. President, as important as America's cultural enrichment \nis, the United States also stands to benefit dramatically on the world \neconomic stage from extension of the current copyright term. As the \ntense and protracted negotiations with China just concluded \nunderscored, intellectual property--the collective copyrightable output \nof America's creators of movies, music, art and other works--is an \nenormous asset to the Nation's balance of trade.\n  Indeed, in a recent Billboard magazine commentary, Prof. Arthur \nMiller of the Harvard Law School noted that, ``In 1990, America's \n`copyright industries' recorded $34 billion in foreign sales * * *.'' \nIt's no wonder, Mr. President, that the Chinese preferred to \nappropriate American film and music for resale--two great exports from \nmy State of California--rather than license American works.\n  By extending to life plus 70 years the basic copyright protection \nafforded in the United States for new works, Congress will assure \ncomparable protection for American authors in the countries of the \nEuropean Union, which will formally adopt the life-plus-70 standard \nthis summer. If we do not act, Mr. President, those nations quite \nsimply will not be required to provide American authors, artists and \nother copyright holders with more than the protection we afford their \nintellectual property holders here at home. Simply put, Mr. President, \nconforming our intellectual property laws with those of our trading \npartners in the service of American competitiveness is critical.\n  As Professor Miller aptly put it: ``Unless Congress matches the \ncopyright extension adopted by the European Union, we will lost 20 \nyears of valuable protection against rip-off artists around the \nworld.'' I'm certain that the tired, but successful team from the \nUnited States Trade Representative's office just returned from China \nwill testify if asked, Mr. President, that the stronger our copyright \nlaws here at home, the better the deal they can negotiate for American \ncopyright holders abroad. Since America is--and is likely to remain--\nthe world's principal exporter of popular culture, extension of the \nbasic copyright term makes international dollars and sense.\n  Third, and finally, Mr. President, I want to note for the record the \nextraordinary support for this legislation within the intellectual \nproperty community. Not only do movie and music companies strongly back \nthis bill as written, as one would expect, but book and music \npublishers, performing rights societies representing America's premier \nsongwriters and composers, and major software producing firms all \nconcur that Congress can and must pass this important legislation.\n  I want to thank Chairman Hatch and his staff once again, Mr. \nPresident, for another--to my mind--successful collaboration to protect \nand encourage the production of American intellectual property. Just as \nwas the case with the digital performance rights legislation which we \nfirst introduced in the last Congress and jointly offered again \nrecently, it is equity and economics which make the Copyright \n[[Page S3394]] Term Extension Act of 1995 an important and worthwhile \nbill.\n  I commend it to my colleagues, and look forward to working with them \nand the copyright community at large to put it--as well as digital \nperformance rights legislation--before the President by the end of this \nsession of Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From Billboard magazine, January 14, 1995]\n\n              Extending Copyrights Preserves U.S. Culture\n\n                         (By Arthur R. Miller)\n\n       Beginning this summer, all member nations of the European \n     Union will extend the length of copyright protection to the \n     life of the author plus 70 years. Should we in America \n     provide the same protection for our own writers, musicians, \n     artists, computer programmers, and other creators of \n     copyrighted items?\n       Some feel that we should not tamper with existing U.S. law, \n     which provides copyright protection for life plus 50 years. \n     But this status-quoism ignores some fundamental changes that \n     have occurred in the 20th century.\n       One of the major reasons Congress originally adopted life-\n     plus-50-years was to offer protection not only to the creator \n     of the copyrighted works, but to his or her children and \n     grandchildren--that is, to three generations in all. With \n     people living longer today, an extension of the copyright \n     term by 20 years would roughly correspond to the increase in \n     longevity that has occurred during the 20th century.\n       In addition, Congress has already recognized the wisdom of \n     extending copyright protection to match the terms guaranteed \n     by other nations. That is exactly what Congress did in 1976 \n     when it extended the copyright term to life-plus-50-years, in \n     order to bring American law into line with the term then \n     commonly recognized by other nations.\n       But beyond this, the main arguments for term extension are \n     equity and economics.\n       If Congress does not extend to Americans the same copyright \n     protection afforded Europeans, American creators will have 20 \n     years less protection than their European counterparts--20 \n     years during which Europeans will not be paying Americans for \n     our copyrighted products. This situation would not only be \n     unfair to creators of copyrighted works, but would be harmful \n     economically to the country as a whole.\n       The export of intellectual property is growing at a \n     tremendous rate because America dominates popular culture the \n     world over. In 1990, America's ``copyright industries'' \n     recorded $34 billion in foreign sales of records, CDs, \n     computer software, motion pictures, music, books, scientific \n     journals, periodicals, photographs, designs, and pictorial \n     and sculptural works. Because the world is so eager for the \n     products of America's copyright industries, they are one of \n     the few bright spots in our balance-of-trade picture.\n       The question of copyright extension should be viewed in the \n     larger context of bilateral and multilateral trade talks--\n     including the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights \n     (TRIPS) negotiations under GATT. U.S. trade representatives \n     have found that shortcomings in our own copyright law are \n     used against us when we call for stronger protection for \n     American works overseas. One can just hear the Europeans \n     objecting in future negotiations: ``How can you ask for \n     better protection in Europe when you do not even grant the \n     same term of protection we do?''\n       The need for strong copyright protection becomes more \n     important every year as a weapon with which to fight the \n     piracy of intellectual property. Overseas piracy of American \n     copyrighted material has grown dramatically in recent years \n     due to the\n      availability of equipment that can make cheap copies of \n     movies, videotapes, sound recordings, and computer \n     programs. As more and more digital technology arrives on \n     the scene, the problem will only become worse.\n       Indeed, China alone produced an estimated $2 billion worth \n     of counterfeit recordings and computer discs last year. \n     According to the International Federation of the Phonographic \n     Industry, China now has as many as 26 factories capable of \n     producing 62 million compact discs. China's domestic market \n     accounts for only about 3 million discs, so the dimension of \n     the loss to copyright owners is obvious. Unless Congress \n     matches the copyright extension adopted by the European \n     Union, we will lose 20 years of valuable protection against \n     rip-off artists around the world.\n       It would not take long to see what harm can come from not \n     changing our laws to match those of Europeans. America may be \n     a young nation, but we have the world's oldest popular \n     culture. Many wonderful motion pictures and songs--including \n     Irving Berlin's ``Alexander's Rag Time Band''--already have \n     lost their copyright protection. Dozens, if not hundreds, of \n     other valuable songs and motion pictures--the legacy of \n     American culture--also will lose their protection in the next \n     few years. For example, if Congress does not act soon, such \n     classics as ``After You've Gone,'' ``I'm Always Chasing \n     Rainbows,'' ``A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody,'' ``Swanee,'' \n     and ``The World Is Waiting For The Sunrise'' will fall into \n     the public domain, and that is only the beginning.\n       Commentary writer Professor Lewis Kurlantzick (Billboard, \n     Oct. 29, 1994) asserted that when copyrighted works lose \n     their protection, they become more widely available. At first \n     blush, this appears logical. But, paradoxically, works of art \n     become less available to the public when they enter the \n     public domain--at least in a form that does credit to the \n     original. This is because few businesses will invest the \n     money necessary to reproduce and distribute products that \n     have lost their copyright protection and can therefore be \n     reproduced by anyone. The only products that do tend to be \n     made available after a copyright expires are ``down and \n     dirty'' reproductions of such poor quality that they degrade \n     the original copyrighted work. And there is very little \n     evidence that the consumer really benefits economically from \n     works falling into the public domain.\n       Kurlantzick also denigrates the importance of long-term \n     copyright protection by stating that ``a dollar to be \n     received 75 years from now is worth a small fraction of one \n     cent.'' But, he fails to see that the dollar value placed on \n     future copyright advantages will increase more or less in \n     proportion with the inflation rate. That is to say, if the \n     dollar loses 90% of its value over the next 75 years, then \n     the cost of goods and services will be roughly 90% higher in \n     75 years than it is today.\n       For all these reasons, it's clear why Congress should act. \n     America can reap valuable benefits, at no cost to itself, if \n     Congress enacts legislation to extend our copyright \n     protection by 20 years. By harmonizing our laws with the EU, \n     we can reduce our balance-of-trade deficit, encourage \n     economic investment, strengthen our hand in dealing with \n     intellectual piracy, and see to it that America's authors, \n     composers, artists, and computer programmers receive the same \n     level of protection afforded the creative people of other \n     nations. Thus, copyright term extension makes economic sense, \n     and it's equitable.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRAHAM:\n  S. 484. A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 to establish a national clearinghouse to assist in \nbackground checks of applicants for law enforcement positions, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n the law enforcement and correctional officers employment registration \n                              act of 1995\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I introduce the Law Enforcement and \nCorrectional Officers Employment Registration Act of 1995, which will \nestablish a national clearinghouse to assist in background checks on \nlaw enforcement applicants.\n  This legislation would establish a national data bank to provide \nquick, accurate and prior officer employment history on all applicants \nfor law enforcement agencies. This clearinghouse has been called a \nPointer File and simply maintains basic information of all certified \nofficers, including names, dates of birth, social security numbers, \ndates of employment, and any decertifications. The Department of \nJustice would maintain and offer computer access to all criminal \nagencies.\n  The intent of my legislation is to help prevent what ``Dateline NBC'' \nhas referred to as gypsy cops. These are police officers who have been \ndismissed or have been forced to resign from previous positions but \nconceal prior employment history in future job applications.\n  In the case of the beating death of Bobby Jewett on November 24, \n1990, in West Palm Beach, FL, ``Dateline NBC'' was able to subsequently \ntrace the prior employment histories of the two officers involved in \nthe case through four States and eight different law enforcement \nagencies. Much of this had been concealed in their job applications.\n  As noted in a Tampa Tribune editorial in support of a clearinghouse,\n\n       Few agencies, particularly those in rural areas and smaller \n     towns, have the personnel and resources to conduct thorough \n     background checks on police applicants. Not even the largest \n     agencies always succeed in finding an officer's past if he or \n     she is determined to hide it.\n\n  Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner James T. Moore \nadds, ``Experience has shown that, after being found guilty of \nmisconduct, many problem officers resign or are fired, only to seek \npolice jobs elsewhere. The clearinghouse system would allow a law \nenforcement agency to review each officer applicant's prior history as \nan officer.'' In order to protect the rights of officers, however, the \nclearinghouse would not contain information relating to causes of \ndismissal.\n  Thomas J. O'Loughlin, chief of police of Wellesley, MA, notes,\n\n       [[Page S3395]] The safety of the citizens of this \n     Commonwealth and this Nation is either weakened or solidified \n     by the character of the individuals that we entrust with the \n     responsibility to protect. This legislation provides society \n     with the necessary tools to ensure that individuals who have \n     violated this trust do not simply relocate and once again \n     commit grievous offenses against the public good, and it \n     ensures that a complete and thorough background investigation \n     will be completed prior to an individual assuming the \n     public's trust to be a protector of society.\n\n  This legislation is essential to maintaining public confidence in the \npolice. Further, the financial impact of office misconduct, as measured \nby the costs of civil liability litigation, is alarming. A 1992 survey \nof members of the National Institute of Municipal Law Officers found \npolice liability to be the leading cause of soaring litigation costs \nsince 1989. For the majority of law enforcement officers, this is also \nan issue of job integrity and job safety. The misdeeds of a few place \nothers in an unfavorable light and also at risk.\n  It is safe to say that a history of past dishonorable service in \nother criminal justice agencies is the most compelling reason to reject \nan offer. However, this critical information is often unavailable. That \nis why the International Association of Chiefs of Police has endorsed \nthis legislation.\n  In addition, the Florida Criminal Justice Standards and Training \nCommission adopted a unanimous resolution in support of such a program. \nI would like to thank these organizations, as well as Commissioner \nMoore, for their efforts to protect effectiveness and professionalism \nin law enforcement as well as the public's safety.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 485. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to provide and \nclarify the authority for certain municipal solid waste flow control \narrangements; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n        the municipal waste flow control transition act of 1995\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on May 16, 1994 the U.S. \nSupreme Court handed down a decision in C Carbone versus Clarkstown, \nNY that has important implications for local municipal waste management \nplanning.\n  At issue in the Carbone case was the constitutionality of local \nordinances that enforce flow control. A flow control ordinance enables \na local government to direct locally generated waste to a specific \nwaste disposal facility. The waste disposal facility is typically a \nsolid waste combustor that is owned by the local government.\n  In its Carbone decision the Court found that flow control was an \nunconstitutional interference in interstate commerce. In general, this \nruling was a victory for taxpaying consumers who will benefit from the \nimproved service and prices that result from competition for waste \ndisposal services.\n  However, the Court's decision leaves local governments with flow \ncontrol regimes in a vulnerable position. In most cases, flow control \nassures the financial feasibility of a locally owned or financed waste \ndisposal facility. That is, municipal bonds were sold and facilities \nbuilt in reliance on flow control guaranteed waste disposal income. \nLacking this the financial feasibility of such disposal facilities and \nlocal governments is jeopardized.\n  At the end of the 103d Congress a number of my colleagues and I \nworked on a bill that would have grandfathered existing flow control \narrangements. Unfortunately, the Senate did not complete action before \nadjournment.\n  If anything, the urgency of cushioning the effects of the Carbone \ndecision on affected local governments has increased. Although there \nhave not yet been any defaults, the risk of local and municipal bond \nmarket disruptions continues.\n  Today I offer legislation, the Municipal Waste Flow Control \nTransition Act of 1995, that is very similar to that supported by most \nof the affected parties at the end of the last Congress.\n  My bill preserves flow control for local governments that made \nsubstantial investments predicated on flow control authority before \nCarbone. It ensures flow control authority for the life of the affected \nfacilities. However, my legislation would not permit new flow control \narrangements, thereby assuring free competition and unfettered \ninterstate commerce in the future.\n  Mr. President, we should protect the local governments and local \ntaxpayers who are threatened financially by invalidation of their flow \ncontrol ordinances. We can do so, as my bill does, in a straight \nforward fashion and, at the same time, assure that businesses and \nhomeowners will have the benefits of a free market in the \nfuture.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HEFLIN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Ford, Mr. Thurmond, \n        Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Brown, Mr. Simon, Mr. Shelby, Ms. Moseley-\n        Braun, and Mr. Cohen):\n  S. 486. A bill to reorganize the Federal administrative law \njudiciary, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     the reorganization of the federal administrative judiciary act\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of \nlegislation entitled ``the Reorganization of the Federal Administrative \nJudiciary Act.'' I am pleased to advise that I have been joined today \nby nine colleagues from both sides of the aisle and who are original \ncosponsors of this reform legislation. They are Senators Specter, Ford, \nThurmond, Bumpers, Brown, Simon, Shelby, Moseley-Braun, and Cohen.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to reorganize and establish an \nindependent corps of administrative law judges within the executive \nbranch of Government. The bill is designed to address two critical \nissues which face our Nation. First, an independent corps is vital to \nthe continued impartial resolution of issues and decision of cases \narising under the administrative procedure act. Second, this bill \nstreamlines the Federal bureaucracy in order to better meet the needs \nof the people of the United States. For these reasons, legislation \nneeds to be adopted to improve this Nation's administrative system of \njustice.\n  In the 103d Congress, I introduced similar legislation, and on \nSeptember 15, 1993, the Judiciary Committee considered this \nlegislation, and ordered it favorably reported in the nature of a \nsubstitute to the Senate. On November 19, 1993, this bill was \nconsidered on the floor of the Senate and adopted a technical amendment \nwhich I offered and two valuable amendments offered by my colleagues \nSenator Hank Brown of Colorado and Senator William Cohen of Maine. The \nlegislation I am introducing today is identical to the legislation \nwhich unanimously passed the Senate on November 19, 1993.\n  While the House of Representatives regretfully failed to consider S. \n486 during the second session of the 103d Congress, I am hopeful, in \nlight of the recent election results by which the American people \nexpressed their support for leaner, more efficient, and less costly \nFederal Government, that the new Congress will favorably consider and \nadopt this legislation and send it to President Clinton for signature.\n  the primary objective of this legislation is to reorganize the \nFederal administrative judiciary to promote efficiency, productivity, \nand the reduction of overhead functions. It will provide for economies \nof scale to better serve the public in the resolution of administrative \ndisputes. This goal will be accomplished by placing all ALJ's in a \nunified corps with a chief judge as the primary administrative officer. \nThe chief judge will be responsible for developing programs and \npractices, which attain this objective. Those programs and practices \nwill include the training of judges in more than one subject area. This \ntraining will permit the utilization of the skills and expertise of \neach judge across agency lines to meet the demands of the existing \nworkload.\n  Generally, this bill would establish an independent corps for \nadministrative law judges which would operate under the executive \nbranch of the Government. The corps would be governed by a chief \nadministrative law judge. Further, the corps would be divided into \neight divisions, with each division governed by a division chief \nadministrative law judge. The chief and division chief ALJ's would be \nPresidential appointments, by and with the advice and consent of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  The chief and division chief ALJ's would form a council. The council \nwould be the policy making body for \n[[Page S3396]] the corps. The council would have the authority to \nassign judges to divisions, appoint persons as administrative law \njudges, prescribe rules of practice and procedure for the corps, issue \nappropriate rules and regulations for the efficient conduct of the \ncorps, and generally manage the day-to-day operations of the corps.\n  This bill provides explicit protection for ALJ's. The corps would \ncontinue to make appointments of administrative law judges from a \nregister of qualified candidates maintained by the Office of Personnel \nManagement. In order for an ALJ to be involuntarily reassigned to a new \npermanent duty station, an ALJ must receive a written explanation from \nthe council stating that such a move is required in order to meet \nsubstantial changes in workloads. ALJ's would continue to hear and \nadjudicate the same types of cases which they presently decide. \nFurther, ALJ's would continue to be assigned cases within their \ndivision on a rotating basis, taking into account issues of expertise \nand education. In addition, ALJ's would be given explicit authority to \ncontinue to act as special masters pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 53(a). This bill also contains provisions for the removal and \ndiscipline of administrative law judges.\n  In the committee report (103-154) to this legislation, my colleague, \nSenator Cohen. expressed support for the concept of establishing an \nindependent corps of administrative law judges within the executive \nbranch of Government and for the concept which would reform and \nstreamline the Federal bureaucracy in order to serve the American \npublic. Senator Cohen did have legitimate concerns and offered \nexcellent suggestions to improve and strengthen section 599(e) of the \nbill relating to removal and discipline of judges.\n  I have worked with Senator Cohen to strengthen and improve the \nremoval and discipline provisions of the bill, and I believe these \nprovisions are a balanced effort to make the provisions fairer to all \ninterest parties concerned by insuring public members serve on the \ncomplaint resolution board--and its panels--to ensure objectivity and \nimpartiality. This legislation is better because of Senator Cohen's \nparticipation and I greatly appreciate his cooperation.\n  This legislation will promote good government in an efficient and \neffective manner. The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] has prepared a \nreport which estimates the legislation can save as much as $22 million \na year in as few as 5 years. These are the types of savings the \nAmerican people expect and deserve.\n  Since the reorganization of the Federal administrative law judges \ninto a unified corps is expected to save the U.S. taxpayer substantial \ndollars, and in consultation with Senator Hank Brown of Colorado, a \nprovision offered by Senator Brown is included in this legislation \nensuring that agencies will reduce their budgets to reflect the \nprojected savings from the removal of ALJ's from their agencies and \nreport to Congress on their efforts.\n  The establishment of a unified corps of administrative law judges is \nnot a unique concept. In fact, this type of legislation was first \nimplemented in a number of States, and has been very successful. The \nindividual States have been leaders in adapting and streamlining the \nadministrative process to meet the changing needs of the American \npublic. The adoption of similar Federal legislation merely builds upon \nthe successful experiences of the States.\n  A final consideration which argues in favor of independence for ALJ's \nis the issue of public perception. For individuals who face the \ndaunting prospect of being accused by a Federal agency of illegal \nactivities, the fact that an administrative law judge who is an \nemployee of that agency is hearing their case is hardly reassuring. The \nrealities of the everyday world indicate that the key to public \nsatisfaction and confidence in judicial decisionmaking is the issue of \ndecisional independence. The creation of a unified corps of \nadministrative law judges is likely to have the beneficial effect of \ngreater public satisfaction with the administrative law system.\n  This legislation which I introduce today responds to concerns \nexpressed by executive branch agencies, particularly the Department of \nJustice. This legislation is truly a reorganization of Federal \nadministrative adjudication functions and not a radical departure from \nthe principles of administrative law, which has concerned some members \nin the past. To the contrary, the substitute insures that the rule of \nlaw will prevail in administrative adjudications without impermissible \ninfluence.\n  The legislation specifically states that an agency's policymaking \nauthority will not be changed nor will the administrative law judge's \nadjudicatory authority. The reorganization preserves the existing \npowers of both agency managers and the administrative law judges, while \nremoving the tension that naturally arises between those two functions. \nThe bill provides that enactment of the bill will effect no change in \nan agency's rulemaking, interpretative or policymaking authority in \ncarrying out statutory responsibilities vested in the agency or agency \nhead.\n  The bill clarifies that the reorganization of administrative law \njudges in a corps will give the new corps no policymaking authority for \nthe agency, a past concern expressed by some members. In preserving the \nstatus quo of the present administrative system, the agency and its \nhead retain the authority to review decisions of administrative law \njudges under any applicable provision of law. The policymaking role of \nALJ's is not enlarged by enactment of the bill nor is their \nadjudicatory authority changed from current status. An agency head or \nsecretary retains final authority to reverse ALJ decisions as provided \nby statute and makes the final decisions for the agency.\n  I look forward to working for passage of this reform legislation here \nin the Senate, and I hope my colleagues in the House of Representatives \nwill likewise favorably consider and act on it, so that President \nClinton can sign it into law before the end of the year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill in its entirety \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 486\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Reorganization of the \n     Federal Administrative Judiciary Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) in order to promote efficiency, productivity, the \n     reduction of administrative functions, and to provide \n     economies of scale and better public service and public trust \n     in the administrative resolution of disputes, Federal \n     administrative law judges should be organized in a unified \n     corps;\n       (2) the dispersal of administrative law judges appointed \n     under section 3105 of title 5, United States Code, in every \n     Federal agency that requires hearings to be conducted by \n     administrative law judges, underutilizes the potential of \n     administrative law judges to serve the public and assist the \n     Federal courts as special masters and finders of fact in \n     specific instances to help reduce the backlog of cases in \n     Federal courts;\n       (3) the organization of administrative law judges in a \n     corps will best promote their assignment to Federal agency \n     needs as demand requires;\n       (4) a unified administrative law judge corps will better \n     promote the use of information technology in serving the \n     public; and\n       (5) an administrative law judge corps will, through \n     consolidation, eliminate unnecessary offices and reduce \n     travel and other related costs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n        the indian gaming regulatory act amendments act of 1995\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with the \nvice chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Inouye, as \nthe sponsor of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act Amendments Act of 1995. \nI want to associate myself with Senator Inouye's remarks regarding this \nlegislation and the issue of Indian gaming. I commend Senator Inouye \nfor his outstanding leadership over the years on this complex issue.\n  The bill we are introducing today would provide for a major overhaul \nof the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. It will provide for \nminimum Federal standards in the regulation and licensing of class II \nand class III gaming as well as all of the contractors, suppliers, and \nindustries associated with such gaming. This will be accomplished \nthrough the Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Commission which will be \nfunded through assessments on Indian gaming revenues and fees imposed \non license applicants. The bill also provides a new process for the \nnegotiation of class III compacts which authorizes the Secretary of the \nDepartment of the Interior to negotiate compacts with Indian tribes in \nthose instances where a State chooses not to participate in compact \nnegotiations or where an Indian tribe and a State cannot reach an \nagreement on a compact. This process is consistent with recent Federal \ncourt decisions.\n  In addition, the bill is consistent with the 1987 decision of the \nU.S. Supreme Court in the case of California versus Cabazon Band of \nMission Indians in that it neither expands for further restricts the \nscope of Indian Gaming. The laws of each State would continue to be the \nbasis for determining what gaming activities may be available to an \nIndian tribe located in that State.\n  Since the enactment of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988, \nthere has been a dramatic increase in the amount of gaming activity \namong the Indian tribes. In 1993, Indian gaming was estimated to yield \ngross revenues of about $4 billion per year and net revenues were \nestimated at $750 million. Today, there are about 160 class II bingo \nand card games in operation and there are now over 110 tribal/State \ncompacts governing class III gaming in 21 States. Indian gaming \ncomprises about 3 percent of all gaming in the United States. Gaming \nactivities operated by State governments\n comprise about 36 percent of all gaming and the private sector \naccounts for the balance of the gaming activity in the Nation.\n\n  Indian gaming has become the single largest source of economic \nactivity for Indian tribes. Annual revenues derived from Indian \nagricultural resources have been estimated at $550 million and have \nhistorically been the leading source of income for Indian tribes and \nindividuals. Annual revenues from oil, gas, and minerals are about $230 \nmillion and Indian forestry resources revenues are estimated at $61 \nmillion. The estimated annual earnings on gaming now equal or exceed \nall of the revenues derived from Indian natural resources. In addition, \nIndian gaming has generated tens of thousands of new jobs for Indians \nand non-Indians. On many reservations gaming has meant the end of \nunemployment rates of 90 or 100 percent and the beginning of an era of \nfull employment.\n  Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, Indian tribes are \nrequired to expend the profits from gaming activities to fund tribal \ngovernment operations or programs and to promote tribal economic \ndevelopment. Profits may only be distributed directly to the members of \nan Indian tribe under a plan which has been approved by the Secretary \nof the Interior. Only a few such plans have been approved. Virtually \nall of the proceeds from Indian gaming activities are used to fund the \nsocial welfare, education, and health needs of the Indian tribes. \nSchools, health facilities, roads, and other vital infrastructure is \nbeing built by the Indian tribes with the proceeds from Indian gaming.\n  In the years before the enactment of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act \nand in the years since its enactment we have heard concerns about the \npossibility for organized criminal elements to penetrate Indian gaming. \nBoth the Department of Justice and the FBI have repeatedly testified \nbefore the Committee on Indian Affairs and have indicated that there is \nnot any substantial criminal activity of any kind associated with \nIndian gaming. Some of our colleagues have suggested that no one would \nknow if there is criminal activity because not enough people are \nlooking for it. I believe that this point of view overlooks the fact \nthat the act provides for a very substantial regulatory and law \nenforcement role by the States and Indian tribes in class III gaming \nand by the Federal Government in class II gaming. The record clearly \nshows that in the few instances of known criminal activity in class III \ngaming, the Indian tribes have discovered the activity and have sought \nFederal assistance in law enforcement.\n  Nevertheless, the record before the Committee on Indian Affairs also \nshows that the absence of minimum Federal standards for the regulation \nand licensing of Indian gaming has allowed a void to develop which will \nbecome more and more attractive to criminal elements as Indian gaming \ncontinues to generate increased revenues. The legislation we are \nintroducing today provides for the development of strict minimum \nFederal standards based on the recommendations of Federal, State and \ntribal officials. While Indian tribes or States, or both, will continue \nto exercise primary regulatory authority, their regulatory standards \nmust meet or exceed the minimum Federal standards. In the event that \nthe Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Commission determines that the \nminimum Federal standards are not being met, then the Commission may \ndirectly regulate the gaming activity until such time as the Federal \nstandards are met. In addition, the Commission is vested with authority \nto issue and revoke licenses as well as to impose civil fines, close \nIndian gaming facilities or seek enforcement of the act through the \nFederal courts.\n  As many of our colleagues know, one of the areas which has caused the \ngreatest controversy under the current law relates to what has come to \nbe known as the scope of gaming. A related issue is the refusal of some \nStates to enter into negotiations for a class III compact and their \nassertion of sovereign immunity under the 11th amendment to the \nConstitution when an Indian tribe seeks judicial relief as provided by \nthe act. The bill we are introducing incorporates the explicit \nstandards of the Cabazon decision to guide all parties in determining \nthe permissible gaming activities under the laws of any State. State \nlaws will continue to govern this issue. We have not proposed the \npreemption of the gaming laws of any State. In most States, the issue \nof scope of gaming has now been settled through negotiation or \nlitigation. In a few States this issue remains unresolved, but appears \nheaded toward resolution by the courts.\n  In the course of our work on the gaming issue in the 103d Congress, \nSenator Inouye and I advanced various formal and informal proposals for \nFederal legislation to resolve the scope of gaming issue. In addition \nproposals were developed by State and tribal officials. However, we \nwere never able to develop a consensus on any one proposal. While the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs remains open to suggestions on this issue, \nit is apparent that obtaining a consensus may not be possible. This \n[[Page S3402]] may be an area of the law best left to resolution \nthrough the courts.\n  With regard to the issue of the refusal of some States to negotiate \nand their assertion that the 1988 act violates the 11th amendment, the \nU.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to hear a case which raises that \nissue. As I noted earlier, the bill we are introducing today seeks to \nresolve this issue on terms that are consistent with recent decisions \nof the Federal courts.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that we will find many things to change in \nthis legislation as it moves through the Senate. However, I believe \nthat it provides a good foundation for our further consideration of \nthis important issue. I want to emphasize that this bill is intended to \nstimulate discussion. I am looking forward to hearing from all \ninterested parties with regard to their constructive suggestions for \nways to improve the bill and move it forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 487\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Purposes.

Subsection (a) provides \n     that for Class II gaming Indian tribes shall retain the right \n     to monitor and regulate such gaming, conduct background \n     investigations, and issue licenses in a manner which meets or \n     exceeds minimum Federal standards established by the \n     Commission pursuant to section 7(c) of this Act.\n       Subparagraph (b) provides that for Class III gaming which \n     is conducted pursuant to a tribal/state compact, an Indian \n     tribe or a state or both shall monitor and regulate such \n     gaming, conduct background investigations, issue licenses and \n     establish and regulate internal control systems in a manner \n     which meets or exceeds minimum Federal standards established \n     by the Commission pursuant to section 7(c) of this Act.\n       Subparagraph (c) provides that for Class III gaming \n     conducted under the authority of a compact negotiated with \n     the Secretary, such compact shall provide that the Indian \n     tribe or other appropriate entity shall monitor and regulate \n     such gaming, conduct background investigations, issue \n     licenses and establish and regulate internal control systems \n     in a manner which meets or exceeds minimum Federal standards \n     established by the Commission pursuant to section 7(c).\n       Subsection (d) provides that in any case in which an Indian \n     tribe conducts Class II gaming in a manner which \n     substantially fails to meet the minimum federal standards for \n     Class II gaming, then the Commission shall have the authority \n     to conduct background investigations, issue licenses and \n     establish and regulate internal control systems after \n     providing the Indian tribe an opportunity to cure violations \n     and to be heard. The authority of the Commission may be \n     exclusive and may continue until such time as the regulatory \n     and internal control systems of the Indian tribe meet or \n     exceed the minimum Federal standards established by the \n     Commission.\n       Subsection (d) also provides that in the case of Class III \n     gaming, if an Indian tribe or a state, or both, fail to meet \n     or exceed minimum Federal standards for Class III gaming \n     [[Page S3413]] then the Commission shall have the authority \n     to conduct background investigations, issue licenses and \n     establish and regulate internal control systems after \n     providing notice and an opportunity to cure problems and be \n     heard. The authority of the Commission may be exclusive and \n     may continue until such time as the regulatory and internal \n     control systems of an Indian tribe or a state, or both, meet \n     or exceed the minimum Federal standards established by the \n     Commission.\n       Section 9. Advisory Committee on Minimum Regulatory \n     Requirements and Licensing Standards. Subsection (a) \n     authorizes the President to establish an Advisory Committee \n     on Minimum Regulatory Requirements and Licensing Standards.\n       Subsection (b) provides that the advisory committee shall \n     be composed of 7 members who shall be appointed by the \n     President. Three members shall be members of federally \n     recognized Indian tribes which are engaged in gaming under \n     this Act and shall be selected from a list of recommendations \n     submitted to the President by the Chairman and Vice Chairman \n     of the Senate Committee on\n      Indian Affairs and the Chairman and ranking minority member \n     of the Subcommittee on Native American and Insular Affairs \n     of the Committee on Resources of the House of \n     Representatives. Two members shall represent state \n     governments and shall be selected from a list of \n     recommendations submitted to the President by the Majority \n     Leader and the Minority Leader of the Senate and the \n     Speaker and Minority Leader of the House of \n     Representatives. Two members shall be employees of the \n     Department of Justice.\n       Subsection (c) provides that 180 days after the date on \n     which the Advisory Committee is fully constituted it shall \n     develop recommendations for minimum Federal standards for the \n     conduct of background investigations, internal control \n     systems and licensing standards. The committee's \n     recommendations shall be submitted to the Committee on Indian \n     Affairs of the Senate, the Subcommittee on Native American \n     and Insular Affairs of the Committee on Resources of the \n     House of Representatives, the Commission and to each \n     federally recognized Indian tribe. The Commission and the \n     Advisory Committee are required to give equal weight to \n     existing industry standards, the unique nature of tribal \n     gaming, the broad variations in the scope and size of tribal \n     gaming activity, the inherent sovereign right of Indian \n     tribes to regulate their own affairs and the Findings and \n     Purposes set forth in sections 2 and 3 of this Act.\n       Subsection (d) provides that the Commission shall hold \n     public hearings on the Advisory Committee's recommendations \n     after they are received. At the conclusion of the hearings, \n     the Commission shall promulgate regulations establishing \n     minimum regulatory requirements and licensing standards.\n       Subsection (e) provides that the members of the Advisory \n     Committee who are representatives of Indian tribes and states \n     shall be reimbursed for travel and per diem during the \n     performance of the duties of the Advisory Committee and while \n     away from home or their regular place of business.\n       Subsection (f) provides that the Advisory Committee shall \n     cease to exist 60 days after it submits its recommendations \n     to the Commission.\n       Subsection (g) provides that the activities of the Advisory \n     Committee are exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act.\n       Section 10. Licensing. Subsection (a) provides that \n     licenses shall be required of gaming operations, key \n     employees of a gaming operation, management- and gaming-\n     related contractors, any gaming service industry, and any \n     person who has material control over a licensed gaming \n     operation.\n       Subsection (b) provides that the Commission may require \n     licenses of management contractors and gaming operations \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law relating to the \n     issuance of licenses by an Indian tribe or a state, or both.\n       Subsection (c) provides that the Commission may issue a \n     statement of compliance to an applicant for a license under \n     this Act at any time that the Commission is satisfied that \n     one or more eligibility criteria for the license has been \n     satisfied by the applicant.\n       Subsection (d) provides that no gaming operation shall \n     operate unless all required licenses and approvals have been \n     obtained in accordance with this Act. Each management \n     contract for a gaming operation must be in writing and filed \n     with and approved by the Commission. The Commission may \n     require that a management contract include any provisions \n     that are reasonably necessary to meet the requirements of \n     this Act. Any applicant for a license who does not have the \n     ability to exercise any significant control over a licensed \n     gaming operation may be determined by the Commission to be \n     ineligible to hold a license or to be exempt from being \n     required to hold a license.\n       Subsection (e) provides that the Commission shall deny a \n     license to any applicant who is disqualified for failure to \n     meet any of the minimum Federal standards promulgated by the \n     Commission pursuant to section 7(c).\n       Subsection (f) provides that the Commission shall conduct \n     an investigation into the qualifications of the applicant and \n     may conduct a non-public hearing concerning the applicant's \n     qualifications. After an application is filed with the \n     Commission final action will be taken by the Commission to \n     grant or deny the application not later than 90 days after \n     completing all hearings and investigations and receiving all \n     information required to be submitted. If an application is \n     denied by the Commission, the applicant can request a \n     statement of the reasons, including specific findings of \n     fact. If the Commission is satisfied that the applicant is \n     qualified to receive a license, then the Commission shall \n     issue a license upon the tender of all license fees and \n     assessments required by this Act and such bonds as the \n     Commission may require for the faithful performance of all \n     requirements imposed by this Act. The Commission is \n     authorized to fix the amount of any bond it requires. Bonds \n     furnished to the Commission may be applied by the Commission \n     to any unpaid liability of the licensee. Bonds shall be \n     furnished in cash or negotiable securities, by a surety or \n     through an irrevocable letter of credit.\n       Subsection (g) provides that the Commission shall renew any \n     license issued under this Act, subject to its power to deny, \n     revoke or suspend licenses, upon proper application for \n     renewal and the receipt of license fees and assessments. \n     Licenses can be renewed for up to two years for each of the \n     first 2 renewal periods and three years for each succeeding \n     renewal period. A licensing hearing can be reopened by the \n     Commission at any time. Any licenses in existence on the date \n     of enactment of this Act may be renewed for a period of 18 \n     months. Any application for renewal must be filed with the \n     Commission not later than 90 days prior to the expiration of \n     the current license. Upon renewal of a license, the \n     Commission shall issue an appropriate renewal certificate.\n       Subsection (h) provides that the Commission shall establish \n     procedures for the conduct of hearings associated with \n     licensing including procedures for denying, limiting, \n     conditioning, revoking or suspending any such license. After \n     the completion of a licensing hearing the Commission shall \n     render a decision and issue and serve an order on the \n     affected parties. The Commission may order a rehearing on a \n     decision on a motion made by a party or the Commission not \n     later than 10 days after the services of a decision and \n     order. Following a rehearing, the Commission shall render a \n     decision, issue an order and serve it on the affected \n     parties. Any licensing decision or order made by the \n     Commission shall be final agency action for the purposes of \n     judicial review. The United States Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia has jurisdiction to review the licensing \n     decisions and orders of the Commission.\n       Subsection (i) provides that the Commission shall maintain \n     a registry of all licenses granted or denied and shall make \n     the information contained in the registry available to Indian \n     tribes to assist them in the licensing and regulation of \n     gaming activities.\n       Section 11. Requirements for the Conduct of Class I and \n     Class II Gaming on Indian Lands. Subsection (a) provides that \n     Class I gaming shall be within the exclusive jurisdiction of \n     the Indian tribes and shall not be subject to the provisions \n     of this Act.\n       Subsection (b) provides that Class II gaming shall be \n     within the jurisdiction of the Indian tribes, but shall be \n     subject to the provisions of this Act. An Indian tribe may \n     engage in and license and regulate Class II gaming on the \n     lands within the jurisdiction of the tribe if: the gaming is \n     located within a State that permits such gaming for any \n     purpose by any person; such gaming is not otherwise \n     specifically prohibited on Indian lands by Federal law; and \n     the Class II gaming operation meets or exceeds the \n     requirements of section 7(c) and 10. With regard to any Class \n     II gaming operation, the Commission shall ensure that: the \n     Indian tribe has issued a separate license for each place, \n     facility or location at which Class II gaming is conducted; \n     the Indian tribe has or will have the sole proprietary \n     interest and responsibility for the conduct of any Class II \n     gaming activity, except as provided elsewhere in the Act with \n     regard to gaming operations by Indian individuals; and the \n     net revenues from Class II gaming may only be used to\n      fund tribal government operations or programs, to provide \n     for the general welfare of the Indian tribe and its \n     members, to promote tribal economic development, to donate \n     to charitable organizations, to help fund operations of \n     local government agencies or to comply with section 17 of \n     this Act. The Indian tribe is required to provide the \n     Commission with annual outside audits of its Class II \n     gaming operation. Such audits shall include a review of \n     all contracts for supplies and services equal to or more \n     than $50,000 annually, except for contracts for legal and \n     accounting services.\n       Subsection (b) further provides that the Commission shall \n     ensure that the construction and maintenance of a Class I \n     gaming facility and the operation of the gaming shall be \n     conducted in a manner that adequately protects the \n     environment and public health and safety. The Commission must \n     also ensure that there is an adequate system for background \n     investigations on all persons who are required to be licensed \n     in accordance with sections 7(c) and 10 and notice to the \n     Commission by the Indian tribe of the results of the \n     background investigation before the issuance of any license. \n     No license may be granted to any person whose prior \n     activities, criminal record or reputation habits and \n     associations pose a threat to the public interest or the \n     effective regulation of gaming.\n       With regard to per capita payments, subsection (b) provides \n     that such payments may \n     [[Page S3414]] only be made if: the Indian tribe has prepared \n     a plan to allocate revenues to the public, governmental, \n     economic development and social welfare purposes prescribed \n     by this Act and the Secretary determines that the plan is \n     adequate; the interests of minors and other legally \n     incompetent persons are protected and preserved and the \n     payments for such individuals are disbursed to their parents \n     or legal guardians under a plan approved by the Secretary and \n     the governing body of the Indian tribe; and the per capita \n     payments are subject to Federal income taxation and Indian \n     tribes withhold such tax.\n       With regard to Class II gaming operations on Indian lands \n     which are owned by a person or entity other than the Indian \n     tribe, subsection (b) requires the issuance of a separate \n     license which includes the requirements of this section and \n     requirements that are at least as restrictive as those \n     established by state law governing similar gaming within the \n     jurisdiction of the state within which the Indian lands are \n     located. No person or entity, other than the Indian tribe \n     shall be eligible to receive a tribal license to own a Class \n     II gaming operation on Indian lands within the jurisdiction \n     of the Indian tribe if such person or entity would not be \n     eligible to receive a state license to conduct the same \n     activity within the jurisdiction of the state. Any \n     individually owned Class II gaming operation that was in \n     operation on September 1, 1986 shall not be barred by this \n     Act if: it is licensed by an Indian tribe; the income to the \n     Indian tribe from such gaming is not used for per capita \n     payments; not less than 60 percent of the net revenues from \n     the gaming operation is income to the Indian tribe; and the \n     owner of the gaming operation pays an assessment to the \n     Commission pursuant to section 17 for the regulation of such \n     gaming. This exemption for certain individually owned games \n     cannot be transferred to any person or entity and only \n     remains in effect so long as the gaming activity remains \n     within the same nature and scope as the gaming operation \n     which was operated on October 17, 1988. The Commission is \n     required to maintain and publish in the Federal Register a \n     list of individually owned gaming operations.\n       Subsection (c) provides that any Indian tribe that operates \n     a Class II gaming activity may petition the Commission for a \n     certificate of self-regulation if that Indian tribe has \n     continuously conducted such gaming activity for a period of \n     not less than 3 years, including at least one year after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, and has otherwise complied \n     with the provisions of this Act. The Commission shall issue a \n     certificate of self-regulation if it determines that the \n     Indian tribe has: conducted its gaming activity in a manner \n     which has resulted in an effective and honest accounting of \n     all revenues; resulted in a reputation for safe, fair, and \n     honest operation of the activity; been generally free of \n     evidence of criminal or dishonest activity; and the Indian \n     tribe has adequate systems for accounting for revenues, \n     investigation and licensing of employees and contractors, \n     investigation and enforcement of its gaming\n      laws and has conducted the gaming operation on a fiscally \n     sound basis. During any period in which a certificate of \n     self-regulation is in effect, the Indian tribe shall \n     continue to submit an annual independent audit to the \n     Commission and a complete resume of each employee and \n     contractor hired and licensed by the Indian tribe. The \n     Commission cannot assess a fee on a self-regulated \n     activity pursuant to section 17 in excess of one quarter \n     of 1 percent of the net revenue from such activity. The \n     Commission may rescind a certificate of self-regulation \n     for just cause and after an opportunity for a hearing.\n       Subsection (d) provides that if the Commission notifies the \n     Indian tribe that any license which has been issued by the \n     tribe under this section does not meet any standards \n     established under sections 7(c) or 10, then the Indian tribe \n     shall immediately suspend the license and after notice and \n     hearing to the licensee in conformity with the laws of the \n     Indian tribe may revoke such license.\n       Section 12. Class III Gaming on Indian Lands. Subsection \n     (a) provides that Class III gaming activities shall be lawful \n     on Indian lands only if such activities are authorized by a \n     compact that: is adopted by the governing body of the Indian \n     tribe having jurisdiction over such lands; meets the \n     requirements of section 11(b)(3) for the conduct of Class II \n     gaming; is approved by the Secretary; is located in a state \n     that permits such gaming for any purpose by any person; and \n     is conducted in conformity with the tribal/state compact that \n     is in effect. Any Indian tribe which has jurisdiction over \n     the lands upon which a Class III gaming activity is to be \n     conducted may request the state in which such lands are \n     located to enter into negotiations for the purpose of \n     entering into a compact to govern the conduct of Class III \n     gaming activities. A request for negotiations shall be in \n     writing and shall specify each gaming activity that the \n     Indian tribe proposes for inclusion in the compact. The state \n     shall respond to the request within 30 days of receipt. \n     Compact negotiations shall commence not later than 30 days \n     after the date on which a response by a state is due to the \n     Indian tribe and shall be completed not later than 120 days \n     after the initiation of negotiations unless the state and the \n     Indian tribe agree to a different time period. If the state \n     and the Indian tribe cannot commence or complete compact \n     negotiations within the time periods provided in this Act, \n     the Indian tribe shall notify the Secretary. After the \n     Secretary receives the notice from the Indian tribe, the \n     Secretary shall provide the state and the Indian tribe 60 \n     days to present their positions on the gaming activities that \n     are permissible, the framework for the regulation of the \n     gaming, and such other matters as the Secretary may consider \n     appropriate. Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     expiration of the 60 day period for the submission of the \n     positions of the state and the Indian tribe, the Secretary \n     shall approve a compact that meets the requirements of this \n     Act and publish it in the Federal Register. The Secretary \n     shall not approve a compact if the compact requires state \n     regulation of Indian gaming without the consent of the state \n     or the Indian tribe. The publication of a compact that \n     permits a form of Class III gaming shall be conclusive \n     evidence that such Class III gaming is an activity subject to \n     the laws of the state where the gaming is to be conducted. \n     Any compact negotiated under this subsection shall become \n     effective on its publication in the Federal Register. The \n     Commission shall monitor and, if authorized, regulate and \n     license Class III gaming with respect to any compact that is \n     approved by the Secretary.\n       Subsection (a) also provides that a compact may include \n     provisions relating to the criminal and civil laws of the \n     Indian tribe or the state; the allocation of criminal and \n     civil jurisdiction between the state and the Indian tribe; \n     the assessment by the state of the costs associated with such \n     activities in such amounts as are necessary to defray the \n     costs of regulating such activity; taxation by the Indian \n     tribe of such activity in amounts comparable to the amounts \n     assessed by the state for similar activity; remedies for \n     breach of contract; standards for the operation of such \n     activity and maintenance of the gaming facility; and any \n     other subject that is directly related to the operation of \n     gaming activities and the impact of gaming on tribal, state \n     and local governments. Nothing in this Act may be construed \n     as conferring on a state or political subdivision of a state \n     the authority to impose any tax,\n      fee, charge, or other assessment on an Indian tribe, an \n     Indian gaming operation or the value generated by the \n     gaming operation or any person or entity authorized by an \n     Indian tribe to engage in a Class III gaming activity in \n     conformity with this Act.\n       Nothing in subsection (a) impairs the right of an Indian \n     tribe to regulate Class III gaming on the lands of the Indian \n     tribe concurrently with a state and the Commission, except to \n     the extent that such regulation is inconsistent with or less \n     stringent than this Act. The Gambling devices Transportation \n     Act shall not apply to any gaming activity conducted pursuant \n     to a compact entered into under this Act. The Federal \n     District Court for the District of Columbia shall have \n     jurisdiction over any action initiated by an Indian tribe, a \n     state, the Secretary or the Commission to enforce a compact \n     or to enjoin a Class III gaming activity located on Indian \n     lands and conducted in violation of any compact.\n       Subsection (c) provides that the Secretary is authorized to \n     approve any compact between an Indian tribe and a state \n     governing the conduct of Class III gaming on the Indian lands \n     of such Indian tribe. The Secretary may disapprove a compact \n     entered into under this Act only if such compact violates any \n     provision of this Act or any regulation promulgated by the \n     Commission or any other Federal law or the trust obligation \n     of the United States to Indians. If the Secretary fails to \n     approve or disapprove a compact within 45 days after the \n     compact is presented to the Secretary for approval, then the \n     compact shall be considered to have been approved by the \n     Secretary, but only to the extent that it is consistent with \n     this Act and the regulations promulgated by the Commission. \n     The Secretary shall publish notice in the Federal Register of \n     any compact that is approved or considered to have been \n     approved.\n       Subsection (d) provides that the governing body of an \n     Indian tribe may adopt an ordinance or resolution revoking \n     any prior ordinance or resolution that authorized Class III \n     gaming on the Indian lands of the Indian tribe. Such a \n     revocation shall render Class III gaming illegal on the \n     Indian lands of such Indian tribe. The Commission is required \n     to publish the revocation ordinance or resolution in the \n     Federal Register and it shall take effect upon such \n     publication. Any person or entity operating a Class III \n     gaming activity on the date of such revocation may continue \n     to operate such activity in conformity with a compact that is \n     in effect for one year from the date of publication of the \n     revocation.\n       Subsection (e) provides that with regard to compacts \n     entered into and approved by the Secretary before the date of \n     enactment of this Act shall remain lawful during the period \n     such compact is in effect notwithstanding any amendments made \n     by this Act or any changes made in state law enacted after \n     the approval of the compact. Any compact entered into after \n     the date of enactment of this Act shall remain lawful under \n     this Act notwithstanding any change in state law enacted \n     after the approval of the compact.\n       Section 13. Review of Contracts. Subsection (a) provides \n     that the Commission shall review and approve or disapprove \n     any management contracts for the management of any gaming \n     activity and any gaming-related contract unless such gaming \n     related contract is licensed by an Indian tribe consistent \n     with the minimum Federal standards promulgated pursuant to \n     section 7(c).\n       [[Page S3415]] Subsection (b) provides that the Commission \n     shall only approve a management contract if it determines \n     that the contract provides for: adequate accounting \n     procedures that are maintained and for verifiable monthly \n     financial reports prepared by or for the governing body of \n     the Indian tribe; access to the gaming operations by tribal \n     officials who shall have the right to verify the daily gross \n     revenues and income derived from the gaming activity; a \n     minimum guaranteed payment to the Indian tribe that has \n     preference over the retirement of any development and \n     construction costs; an agreed upon ceiling for the repayment \n     of any development and construction costs; a contract term of \n     not more than 5 years unless the Commission determines that a \n     term of 7 years is appropriate based on the capital \n     investment required and the income projections for the gaming \n     activity; and grounds and mechanisms for the termination of \n     the contract.\n       Subsection (c) provides that the Commission may approve a \n     management contract that provides for a fee of 30% of the net \n     revenues of a tribal gaming activity, unless the Indian tribe \n     requests a higher fee and the Commission determines that \n     based on the capital investment required and the income \n     projections a higher fee is justified. In no circumstance can \n     a management fee exceed 40%.\n       Subsection (d) provides that the Commission shall approve a \n     gaming-related contract only if the Commission determines \n     that the contract provides for: grounds and mechanisms for \n     the termination of the contract and such other conditions as \n     the Commission may be empowered to impose under this Act.\n       Subsection (e) provides that not later than 90 days after \n     the date on which a management contract or gaming-related \n     contract is submitted to the Commission for approval the \n     Commission shall either approve or disapprove the contract. \n     The 90 day period may be extended for 45 days if the \n     Commission notifies the tribe in writing of the reason for \n     the extension. The Indian tribe may bring an action in the \n     Federal District Court for the District of Columbia to compel \n     action by the Commission if it does not act in a timely \n     manner. Any gaming-related contract for an amount of $100,000 \n     or less which is submitted to the Commission for approval by \n     a person who holds a valid license that is in effect under \n     this Act, shall be deemed to be approved if the Commission \n     has not acted to approve or disapprove it within 90 days of \n     its submission.\n       Subsection (f) provides that after providing notice and \n     hearing, the Commission shall have the authority to require \n     appropriate contract modifications to ensure compliance with \n     this Act or may void any contract if the Commission \n     determines that it violates any of the provisions of this \n     Act.\n       Subsection (g) provides that no contract regulated by this \n     Act may transfer or in any other manner convey any interest \n     in real property unless specific statutory authority exists, \n     all necessary approvals have been obtained and the conveyance \n     is clearly specified in the contract.\n       Subsection (h) provides that the authority of the Secretary \n     under 25 U.S.C. 81 shall not extend to any contracts or \n     agreements which are regulated pursuant to this Act.\n       Subsection (i) provides that the Commission may not approve \n     a contract if the Commission finds that: any person having a \n     direct financial interest in, or management responsibility \n     for such contract, and in the case of a corporation, any \n     member of the board of directors or any stockholders who hold \n     more than 10% of its issued stock is an elected member of the \n     governing body of the Indian tribe which is a party to the \n     contract; has been convicted of any felony or any gaming \n     offense; has knowingly and willfully provided materially \n     false statements to the Commission or the Indian tribe or has \n     refused to respond to questions propounded by the Commission; \n     or has been determined to be a person whose prior activities, \n     criminal record, reputation, habits or associations pose a \n     threat to the public interest or to the effective regulation \n     and control of gaming. The Commission may also disapprove any \n     contract if it finds that: the contractor has unduly \n     interfered or influenced for its gain any decision or process \n     of tribal government relating to the gaming activity; the \n     contractor has deliberately or substantially failed to comply \n     with the terms of the contract; or a trustee, exercising the \n     skill and diligence that a trustee is commonly held to, would \n     not approve the contract.\n       Section 14. Review of Existing Contracts; Interim \n     Authority. Subsection (a) provides that at any time after the \n     Commission is sworn in and has promulgated regulations for \n     the implementation of this Act the Commission shall notify \n     each Indian tribe and management contractor who entered into \n     a contract prior to the enactment of this Act that the Indian \n     tribe is required to submit the contract to the Commission \n     within 60 days of such notice. Any such contract shall be \n     valid under this Act unless the Commission disapproves it \n     under this section. Not later than 180 days after the \n     submission of a contract for review, the Commission shall \n     review it to\n      determine if it meets the requirements of section 13. The \n     Commission shall approve a contract if it determines that \n     the contract meets the requirements of section 13 and the \n     contractor has obtained all of the licenses required by \n     this Act. If the Commission determines that a contract \n     does not meet the requirements of section 13, the \n     Commission shall provide written notice to the parties of \n     the necessary modifications and the parties shall have 180 \n     days to make the modifications.\n       Subsection (b) provides that the Commissioners who are \n     holding office on the date of enactment of this Act shall \n     exercise the authorities vested in the Federal Indian Gaming \n     Regulatory Commission until such time as the members of that \n     Commission are sworn into office. Until such time as the \n     Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Commission promulgates \n     regulations under this Act, the regulations promulgated under \n     the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 shall apply.\n       Section 15. Civil Penalties. Subsection (a) provides that \n     any person who violates this Act or the regulations \n     promulgated pursuant to this Act, either by an act or an \n     omission, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more \n     than $50,000 per day for each violation.\n       Subsection (b) provides that the Commission shall assess \n     the civil penalties authorized by this Act and the Attorney \n     General shall collect them in a civil action. The Commission \n     may seek to compromise any assessed civil penalty. In \n     determining the amount of a civil penalty, the Commission \n     shall take into account: the nature, circumstances, extent \n     and gravity of the violation; with regard to the person found \n     to have committed the violation, the degree of culpability, \n     any history of prior violations, ability to pay and the \n     effect on ability to continue to do business; and such other \n     matters as justice may require.\n       Subparagraph (c) provides that the Commission may order the \n     temporary closure of all or part of an Indian gaming \n     operation for substantial violation of this Act and the \n     regulations promulgated by the Commission. Not later than 30 \n     days after an order of temporary closure the Indian tribe or \n     the individual owner of the gaming operation may request a \n     hearing to determine whether the order should be made \n     permanent or dissolved. Not later than 30 days after a \n     request for a hearing, the Commission shall hold the hearing \n     and render a final decision within 30 days after the \n     completion of the hearing.\n       Section 16. Judicial Review. Any decision made by the \n     Commission pursuant to sections 7, 8, 10, 14, and 15 shall \n     constitute final agency decisions for purposes of appeal to \n     the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia under \n     the Administrative Procedures Act.\n       Section 17. Commission Funding. Subsection (a) provides \n     that the Commission shall establish an annual schedule of \n     fees to be paid to it by each Class II and III gaming \n     operation that is regulated by this Act. No gaming operation \n     may be assessed more than 2% of its net revenues and the \n     Commission cannot collect more than $25 million in fees in \n     any year. Fees are payable to the Commission on a monthly \n     basis. The fees paid by a gaming operation may be reduced by \n     the Commission to take into account that regulatory functions \n     are performed by an Indian tribe, or an Indian tribe and a \n     state. Failure to pay fees imposed by the Commission will be \n     grounds for revocation of any license required under this Act \n     for the operation of gaming activities. Any surplus \n     assessments in any given year will be credited pro rata \n     against such fees for the succeeding year.\n       Subparagraph (b) provides that the Commission is authorized \n     to assess license applicants, except for Indian tribes, for \n     the actual cost of all reviews and investigations necessary \n     to determine whether a license should be granted or denied.\n       Subparagraph (c) provides that the Commission shall adopt \n     an annual budget for each fiscal year. Any request for an \n     appropriation pursuant to section 18 shall be submitted \n     directly to the Congress.\n       Section 18. Authorization of Appropriations. This section \n     authorizes an appropriation of $5 million for the operation \n     of the Commission for each of the fiscal years, 1997, 1998 \n     and 1999, to remain available until expended.\n       Section 19. Miscellaneous. Subsection (a) provides that in \n     general, gaming regulated by this Act shall not be conducted \n     on lands acquired by the Secretary in trust for the benefit \n     of an Indian tribe unless: such lands are located within or \n     are contiguous to the boundaries of the reservation of the \n     Indian tribe; the Indian tribe has no reservation and such \n     lands are located in the State of Oklahoma and are within the \n     boundaries of the former reservation of the Indian tribe or \n     are contiguous to other land held in trust by the United \n     States for the Indian tribe; or such lands are located in a \n     state other than Oklahoma and are within the last recognized \n     reservation of the Indian tribe within the state in which the \n     Indian tribe is presently located.\n       Subsection (a) further provides that the general \n     prohibition on the use of lands taken into trust after the \n     date of enactment of this Act for gaming does not apply if \n     the Secretary, after consultation with the Indian tribe, \n     other Indian tribes, state and local officials and a review \n     of the recommendations of the Governor of the state in which \n     such lands are located, determines that gaming on the newly \n     acquired lands would be in the best interest of the Indian \n     tribe and would not be detrimental to the surrounding \n     community; or where lands are taken into trust as part of a \n     settlement of a land claim; or the initial reservation of an \n     Indian tribe is acknowledged by the Secretary under the \n     Federal acknowledgement process; or where lands are restored \n     for an Indian tribe that is restored to federal recognition.\n       [[Page S3416]] Lastly, subsection (a) provides that nothing \n     in this section may affect or diminish the authority and \n     responsibility of the Secretary to take land into trust.\n       Subsection (b) provides that the provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code with regard to reporting and withholding taxes \n     on winnings and the provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act \n     relating to the reporting requirements for cash transactions \n     of $10,000 or greater will apply to Indian gaming operations \n     which are regulated by this Act.\n       Subsection (c) provides that the Commission shall make \n     available to a state or the governing body of an Indian tribe \n     any law enforcement information it has obtained pursuant to \n     section 7(d), unless otherwise prohibited by law, in order to \n     assist the state or Indian tribe to carry out its \n     responsibilities under this Act or any compact approved by \n     the Secretary.\n       Section 24. Definition of Financial Institutions. This \n     section amends section 5312(a)(2) of title 31, United States \n     Code to include Indian gaming establishments.\n       Section 3. Conforming Amendments. This section provides for \n     several amendments to titles 10, 18, 26 and 28 of the United \n     States Code to conform them to the provisions of this \n     Act.\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the esteemed \nchairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs today, in the introduction, \nfor purposes of discussion, of a bill to amend the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act of 1988.\n  Mr. President, the impetus for the amendment of the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act arose a little under 3 years ago when a number of \nGovernors of the several States called upon the President and the \nCongress to address the rulings of Federal district courts interpreting \nthe act within the context of various State laws. In response, Chairman \nMcCain and I initiated a dialog involving Governors, attorneys general, \nand tribal leaders that we hoped would lead to a consensus with regard \nto the manner in which the act would be amended. Although the dialog \ndid not yield that consensus, it did provide us with considerable \nguidance in formulating the amendments that we advance today for the \nconsideration of all affected parties.\n  In the interim, there have been a number of rulings from the circuit \ncourts of appeal that have clarified what has become known as the \nscope-of-gaming issue, and the Supreme Court has granted certiorari in \nlitigation raising the issues associated with the 11th amendment and \nthe doctrine of Ex parte Young. Nonetheless, the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act Amendments Act sets forth a process that does not entail \nlitigation between State and tribal governments. In an effort to \naddress the 10th amendment concerns of the States, the bill we \nintroduce today removes any requirement for good-faith negotiations and \nprovides for tribal-State compacting only if a State elects to engage \nin negotiations leading to a compact.\n  As Chairman McCain has indicated, the 1995 Amendments Act provides \nauthority for the establishment of minimum Federal standards for the \nregulation of Indian gaming, including background investigations, \ninternal control and licensing standards. The States and the tribes \nwould participate in the development of recommendations of these \nstandards through an advisory committee, and the Federal Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Commission would hold hearings on those recommendations and \npromulgate regulations. It is in the capacity of assuring compliance \nwith minimum Federal standards that the Commission will have a greater \nrole to play in the area of class III gaming.\n  This is a matter that I believe bears some emphasis. Under existing \nlaw, the\n National Indian Gaming Commission's responsibilities lie primarily in \nthe area of class II gaming. Class III gaming is regulated by the State \nand tribal governments. Thus, when comparisons are made by some between \nthe regulatory capacity of Nevada or Atlantic City to the regulatory \nauthority of the National Indian Gaming Commission, they are comparing \ntwo regulatory systems that oversee those activities that are typically \nassociated with large casino operations with a regulatory system that \nis designed to monitor tribal regulation of bingo halls. I would hope \nthat as the debate in the Congress on matters of Indian gaming \nproceeds, this stark disparity in the type of operation being regulated \nwill not be lost.\n\n  Finally, in an effort to address the constitutional concerns \nassociated with the Interior Secretary's authority to take land into \ntrust for gaming purposes, the bill authorizes the Secretary to consult \nwith the Governor of the State in which the land is located.\n  Chairman McCain and I wrote to all parties in December of last year \nto advise them of our intent to introduce a bill to amend the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act early in the 104th session of the Congress, and \nto request their comments on the substitute amendment to S. 2230, a \nbill we introduced in the 103d session of the Congress. The National \nGovernors Association [NGA] requested that we delay introduction of a \nnew measure, and we indicated that we would delay introduction until \nMarch. Unfortunately, at the scheduled time of introduction, the \ncommittee has not had the benefit of the Governors' views on these \nmatters--and so the bill we introduce today is substantially lacking in \nthat respect. However, as Chairman McCain has indicated, we look \nforward to working with all of the affected governments--Federal, \nState, and tribal--in the further refinement of this measure.\n  In conclusion, I want to thank the chairman of the Committee on \nIndian Affairs for his kind comments, and to commend him on his \nleadership of the committee in the 104th session of the \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 488. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose a \nflat tax only on the earned income of individuals and the business \ntaxable income of corporations, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                        the flat tax act of 1995\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.\n   Mr. President, I now turn to the introduction of the modified flat \ntax bill entitled the Flat Tax Act of 1995. This is a proposal which \nwould simplify the filing of Federal tax returns, would provide for \nfairness among all taxpayers, and would stimulate economic growth in \nthe United States. As these proceedings of the U.S. Senate are being \nwatched on C-SPAN2, I am confident that thousands of Americans are \nsitting at their desks with an ear to television but an eye to their \ntax returns and they are poring over the complexities of the Federal \ntax laws.\n\n  This bill would permit the American taxpayer to file his or her \nreturn on a small, 10-line postcard. It would do so because it retains \nthe principles of a flat tax, which have long been discussed but not \nreally considered in sufficient depth and not acted upon by the \nAmerican Congress. This flat tax would be a 20-percent rate, with \ndeductions limited to interest on home mortgages up to $100,000 in \nborrowing and charitable deductions up to $2,500.\n  The entire return could be filled out on a simple 10-line postcard. \nThis postcard would identify the taxpayer, specify the total amount of \nwages, salaries, pensions, and retirement benefits, list the deductions \nand exemptions, and allow taxpayers to compute their taxes on this \nsimple postcard form.\n  Beyond simplicity, and the simplicity is of great importance, we now \nhave reliable estimates that Americans spend some $5.4 billion a year \non their tax returns. The Internal Revenue Service regulations have \ngrown from 744,000 words in 1955 to some 5,600,000 words at the present \ntime. The Internal Revenue Service is a mammoth bureaucracy, with \nannual spending of $13 billion on the IRS bureaucracy alone, with \n110,000 employees in over 650 offices nationwide. The compliance costs \nto the American people are almost $200 billion a year.\n  We all know that the greatest impediment in confidence between the \nAmerican Government and the American citizen is concern with the \nInternal Revenue Service. How often have you and I received those \nautomatic computer printouts from the IRS, written them a letter, \nwritten them a second letter or multiple letters, and finally had a \nconference to work out some bureaucratic computer error? And most of \nthe time, no additional tax is needed.\n  This legislation would liberate the American people to devote their \ntime and energy to productive pursuits.\n  A second major advantage to my flat tax bill is that there would be \nan enormous increase in growth. This growth would occur because this \nflat tax would not impose any tax burden on interest, on dividends, or \ncapital gains because \n[[Page S3417]] all of those items of income would have been taxed at \nthe source; that is, at the business level.\n  Another benefit of the flat tax is the projected growth in the \neconomy. From the point of view of growth, reliable estimates are that \nwe would have an increase in the gross national product of some $2 \ntrillion during the course of a 7-year period--an increase of some 28 \npercent.\n  We would also benefit from increased savings, which would mean that \nthe United States of America would be less dependent on borrowing from \nforeign sources. These increased savings would substantially change the \ngreat imbalance we have now, where we have massive interest payments on \nforeign debt flowing abroad.\n  Additionally, in terms of fairness, there would be a lesser tax on \nthose in the lower brackets by having an increase in the personal \nallowance for $16,500 for married couples filing jointly, $9,500 for \nsingle taxpayers, $14,000 for single head of households, and an \nexemption of $4,500 for each dependent. That would be substantially \nmore than under the present code and would enable a family of four \nearning $25,500 to pay no taxes at all. A family of four earning up to \n$30,000 a year would pay very minimal or no taxes at all. The effective \ntax rate would be as low as 12.7 percent for an average projection of a \nfamily earning $100,000 a year.\n  This proposal is revenue neutral based upon the computations made by \nProfessor Hall and Professor Rabushka of Stanford's Hoover Institute. \nThey have elaborately projected a national flat tax with no deductions \nand are calling for a rate of some 19 percent to have tax neutrality. \nThis bill deviates from what Professors Hall and Rabushka have proposed \nby having the allowance of charitable contributions of up to $2,500 a \nyear and the deduction for interest on home mortgages with a maximum \nborrowing of up to $100,000 a year.\n  The computations provided by the Joint Tax Committee show that the \ncost will be $35 billion a year to the Government for the interest \ndeduction on borrowings up to $100,000 a year, and $13 billion for the \ncharitable contributions up to $2,500 a year. The computation is that \nthe additional 1 percent in my flat tax above Hall and Rabushka would \ncover those deductions.\n  I might say the computation is necessarily inexact because the model \nused by the Joint Tax Committee was on a national flat tax on \nindividuals alone while this proposal is a national flat tax on both \nindividuals and businesses. The Hall-Rabushka proposal is very similar \nto the proposal made by Congressman Armey last year with the \ndifferences being in the allowance here for interest and charitable \ncontributions. Also, a difference between this plan and the flat tax \nplan of Congressman Armey is that Congressman Armey did not provide for \nautomatic withholding.\n  Mr. President, my interest in tax policy is longstanding, originating \nduring my law school days. Some of my early practice of law included \nsome tax work. And years ago, I published an article on the subject in \nthe Villanova Law Review raising an issue of fairness as to the pension \nand profit sharing deductions for professional associations contrasted \nwith corporations.\n  This is a subject where I debated my former colleague, Senator John \nHeinz, almost 20 years ago in our contest for the Republican nomination \nto the U.S. Senate in 1976 based upon legislation which he had \nintroduced in the House of Representatives where he had suggested very \nsubstantial cuts in a good many deductions.\n  Mr. President, in offering this legislation, it is not cast in stone, \nbut I think it is high time that the U.S. Senate consider in some \ndetail the benefits of this national flat tax proposal or the modified \nFlat Tax Act which I am suggesting today.\n  The benefits are very, very substantial in terms of simplicity, \ngrowth, and fairness.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my \nstatement be printed in the Record, as well as the text of the \nlegislative proposal itself.\n  Mr. President, as April 15 rapidly approaches--and as I present this \nfloor statement--millions of Americans are spending their evenings \nporing over page after page of IRS instructions, going through their \nrecords looking for information and struggling to find and fill out all \nthe appropriate forms on their Federal tax returns. At the same time, a \npatchwork quilt of deductions, credits, and special exceptions lets \nsome Americans pay less than their fair share of taxes. Year after \nyear, we continue to ask the same question--isn't there a better way?\n  Today I am introducing legislation that provides that better way. I \nam introducing legislation which will fundamentally revise the present \nTax Code, with its myriad rates, deductions, and instructions. Instead, \nthe legislation I offer today would institute a simple, flat 20 percent \ntax rate for all individuals and businesses. It will allow all \ntaxpayers to file their April 15 tax returns on a simple postcard. This \nlegislation is a vital first step in simplifying our Nation's Tax Code \nand redirecting our collective energies toward productivity and growth. \nThis proposal is not in stone, but is intended to move the debate \nforward as the first such legislation to be introduced this term in the \nSenate, by focusing attention on three key principles which are \ncritical to an effective and equitable taxation system: simplicity, \nfairness, and economic growth.\n  Over the years, I have devoted considerable time and attention to \nanalyzing our Nation's Tax Code and the policies which underlie it. I \nbegan this study of the complexities of the Tax Code 40 years ago as a \nlaw student at Yale University. I included some tax law as part of my \npractice in my early years as an attorney in Philadelphia. In the \nspring of 1962, I published a law review article in the Villanova Law \nReview, ``Pension and Profit Sharing Plans: Coverage and Operation for \nClosely Held Corporations and Professional Associations,'' 7 Villanova \nL. Rev. 335, which in part focused on the inequity in making tax-exempt \nretirement benefits available to some kinds of businesses but not \nothers. It was apparent then, as it is now, that the very complexities \nof the Internal Revenue Code could be used to give unfair advantage to \nsome; and made the already unpleasant obligation of paying taxes a real \nnightmare for many Americans.\n  I became interested many years ago in the practicality and simplicity \nof a flat tax as a way to reduce the burden on working Americans. My \nformer Senate colleague, John Heinz, while he was in the House of \nRepresentatives, introduced H.R. 636, which would have eliminated \nnumerous deductions, including the deductibility of home mortgage \ninterest, charitable contributions, the investment tax credit, the oil \ndepletion allowance and other exemptions, exclusions and deductions. \nLast fall, I had discussions with Congressmen Richard Armey, now the \nHouse majority leader, about his flat tax proposal, which he introduced \nas H.R. 4585. Since then, my staff and I have studied the flat tax at \nsome length and have engaged in a host of discussions with economists \nand tax experts, including the staff of the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, to evaluate the economic impact and viability of a flat tax.\n  Based on those discussions, and on the revenue estimates supplied to \nus, I have concluded that a simple flat tax at a rate of 20 percent on \nall business and personal income can be enacted without reducing \nFederal revenues, and I offer such a bill today.\n  The flat tax will help reduce the size of Government and allow \nordinary citizens to have more influence over how their money is spent \nbecause they will spend it and not the Government. With a simple 20-\npercent flat tax rate in effect, the average person can easily see the \nimpact of any additional Federal spending proposal on his or her own \npaycheck. By creating strong incentives for savings and investment, the \nflat tax will have the beneficial result of making available larger \npools of capital for expansion of the private sector for the economy--\nrather than more tax money for big Government. This will mean more jobs \nand, just as important, more better paying jobs.\n  As a matter of Federal tax policy, there has been considerable \ncontroversy over whether tax breaks should be used to stimulate \nparticular kinds of economic activity, or whether tax policy should be \nneutral, leaving people to do what they consider best from a purely \neconomic point of view. Our current Tax Code attempts to use tax policy \nto direct economic activity, \n[[Page S3418]] but experience under that Code has demonstrated that so-\ncalled tax breaks are inevitably used as the basis for tax shelters \nwhich have no real relation to solid economic purposes, or to the \nactivities which the tax laws were meant to promote. Even when the \nGovernment responds to particular tax shelters with new and often \ncomplex revisions of the regulations, clever tax experts are able to \nstay one or two steps ahead of the IRS bureaucrats by changing the \nstructure of their business transactions and then claiming some legal \ndistinctions between the taxpayer's new approach and the revised IRS \nregulations and precedents.\n  Under the massive complexity of the current IRS Code, the battle \nbetween $500-an-hour tax lawyers and IRS bureaucrats to open and close \nloopholes is a battle the Government can never win. Under the flat tax \nbill I offer today, there are no loopholes, and tax avoidance through \nmanipulations will become a thing of the past.\n  The basic model for this legislation comes from a plan created by \nProfessors Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institute at \nStanford University. Their plan envisioned a flat tax with no \ndeductions whatever. After considerable reflection, I have decided to \ninclude limited deductions for home mortgage interest on up to $100,000 \nin borrowing and charitable contributions up to $2,500 in the \nlegislation I offer today. While this modification undercuts the pure \nprinciple of the flat tax, and does continue the use of tax policy to \npromote homebuying and charitable contributions by retaining those \ndeductions, I believe that those two deductions are so deeply ingrained \nin the financial planning of American families that they should be \nretained as a matter of fairness and public policy--and also political \npracticality. With those two deductions maintained, passage of a \nmodified flat tax will be difficult; but without them, probably \nimpossible.\n  In my judgment, an indispensable prerequisite to enactment of a \nmodified flat tax is revenue neutrality. Professor Hall advised that \nthe revenue neutrality of the Hall-Rabushka proposal, which uses a 19-\npercent rate, is based on a well documented model founded on reliable \ngovernmental statistics. The bill offered today raises that rate from \n19 to 20 percent to accommodate retaining limited home mortgage \ninterest and charitable deductions. A preliminary estimate by the \nCommittee on Joint Taxation places the annual cost of the home interest \ndeduction at $35 billion, and the cost of the charitable deduction at \n$13 billion. While the revenue calculation is complicated because the \nHall-Rabushka proposal encompasses significant revisions to business \ntaxes as well as personal income taxes, there is a sound basis for \nconcluding that the 1-percent increase in rate would pay for the two \ndeductions. Revenue estimates for Tax Code revisions are difficult to \nobtain and are, at best, judgment calls based on projections from fact \nsituations with a myriad of assumed variables. It is possible that some \nmodification may be needed at a later date to guarantee revenue \nneutrality.\n  This legislation offered today is quite similar to the bill \nintroduced in the House by Congressman Armey, which was itself modeled \nafter the Hall-Rabushka proposal and uses much of the same legislative \nlanguage as the Armey bill. The flat tax offers great potential for \nenormous economic growth, in keeping with principles articulated so \nwell by former Congressman Jack Kemp. This proposal taxes business \nrevenues fully at their source, so that there is no personal taxation \non interest, dividends and capital gains. Restructured in this way, the \ntax code can become a powerful incentive for savings and investment--\nwhich translates into economic growth and expansion, more and better \njobs, and a rising standard of living for all Americans.\n  In this Congress, we have so far been concerned with the work of \nreducing the size and cost of Government, and this is work which is \nvitally important. But the work of downsizing Government is only one \nside of the coin; what we must do at the same time, and with as much \nenergy and care, is to grow the private sector. As we reform the \nwelfare programs and Government bureaucracies of past administrations, \nwe must replace those programs with a prosperity that extends to all \nsegments of American society through private investment and job \ncreation--which can have the additional benefit of producing even lower \ntaxes for Americans as economic expansion adds to Federal revenues. \nJust as Americans need a tax code that is fair and simple, they also \nare entitled to tax laws designed to foster rather than retard economic \ngrowth. The bill I offer today embodies those principles.\n  Professors Hall and Rabushka have summarized the advantages of their \nproposals as follows:\n\n       The tax on families is fair and progressive--the poor pay \n     no tax at all, and the fraction of income that a family pays \n     rises with income. The system is simple and easy to \n     understand. And the tax operates on the consumption-tax \n     principle [encourages savings; discourages consumption]--\n     families are taxed on what they take out of the economy, not \n     what they put into it\n       Our system rests on a basic administrative principle: \n     income should be taxed exactly once, as close as possible to \n     its source. Today's tax system violates this principle in all \n     kinds of ways. Some kinds of income--like fringe benefits--\n     are never taxed at all. Other kinds, like dividends and \n     capital gains, are taxed twice. And interest income, which is \n     supposed to be taxed once, escapes taxation completely in all \n     too many cases, where clever taxpayers arrange to receive \n     interest beyond the reach of the IRS.\n       Under our plan, all income is taxed at the same rate. \n     Equality of tax rates is a basic concept of the flat tax. Its \n     logic is much more profound than just the simplicity of \n     calculation with a single tax rate. Whenever different forms \n     of income are taxed at different rates or different taxpayers \n     face different rates, the public figures out how to take \n     advantage of the differential.\n       Limiting the burden of taxes on the poor is a central \n     principle of tax reform. Some ideas for tax simplification \n     and reform flout this principle--neither a federal sales tax \n     nor a value-added tax is progressive. Instead, all citizens, \n     rich and poor alike, pay essentially the same fraction of \n     their spending in taxes. We reject sales and value-added \n     taxes for this reason. . . .\n       Exempting the poor from taxes does not require graduated \n     tax rates rising to high levels for upper-income taxpayers. A \n     flat rate, applied to all income above a generous personal \n     allowance, provides progressivity without creating important \n     differences in tax rates. Graduated taxes automatically \n     create differences in tax rates among taxpayers, with all the \n     attendant opportunities for leakage. Because it is high-\n     income taxpayers who have the biggest incentive and the best \n     opportunity to use special tricks to exploit tax-rate \n     differentials, applying the same tax rate to these taxpayers \n     for all of their income in all years is the most important \n     goal of flat-rate taxation. . . .\n       We believe that the simplicity of our system is a central \n     feature. Complex tax forms and tax laws do more harm than \n     just deforesting America. Complicated taxes require expensive\n      advisers for taxpayers and equally expensive reviews and \n     audits by the Government. A complex tax invites the \n     taxpayer to search for a special feature to exploit to the \n     disadvantage of the rest of us. And complex taxes diminish \n     confidence in government, inviting a breakdown in \n     cooperation with the tax system and the spread of outright \n     evasion.\n\n  My plan, which like Representative Armey's is based on the Hall-\nRabushka analysis, differs from the legislation introduced by \nRepresentative Armey in four key respects: First, my bill contains a \n20-percent flat tax rate. Second, this bill would retain modified \ndeductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions, which \nwill require a 1 percent higher tax rate than otherwise. Third, my bill \nwould maintain the automatic withholding of taxes from an individual's \npaycheck. Lastly, my bill is designed to be revenue neutral, and thus \nwill not undermine our vital efforts to balance the Nation's budget. \nThe estimate of revenue neutrality is based on the Hall-Rabushka \nanalysis together with preliminary projections supplied by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation on the modifications proposed in this bill\n  The key advantages of this flat tax plan are threefold: First, it \nwill dramatically simplify the payment of taxes. Second, it will remove \nmuch of the IRS regulatory morass now imposed on individual and \ncorporate taxpayers, and allow those taxpayers to devote more of their \nenergies to productive pursuits. Third, since it is a plan which \nrewards savings and investment, the flat tax will spur economic growth \nin all sectors of the economy as more money flows into investments and \nsavings accounts, and as interest rates drop. By contrast, there will \nbe a contraction of the IRS if this proposal is enacted.\n  Under this tax plan, individuals would be taxed at a flat rate of 20 \npercent on all income they earn from \n[[Page S3419]] wages, pensions, and salaries. Individuals would not be \ntaxed on any capital gains, interest on savings, or dividends--since \nthose items will have already been taxed as part of the flat tax on \nbusiness revenue. The flat tax will also eliminate all but two of the \ndeductions and exemptions currently contained within the Tax Code. \nInstead, taxpayers will be entitled to personal allowances for \nthemselves and their children: $9,500 for a single taxpayer, $14,000 \nfor a single head of household and $16,500 for a married couple filing \njointly; and $4,500 per child or dependent. These personal allowances \nwould be adjusted annually for inflation.\n  In order to ensure that this flat tax does not unfairly impact low \nincome families, the personal allowances contained in my proposal are \nmuch higher than the standard deduction and personal exemptions allowed \nunder the current Tax Code. For example, in 1994, the standard \ndeduction is $3,800 for a single taxpayer, $5,600 for a head of \nhousehold, and $6,350 for a married couple filing jointly, while the \npersonal exemption for individuals and dependents is $2,450. Thus, \nunder the current Tax Code, a family of four which does not itemize \ndeductions would pay tax on all income over $16,500--personal \nexemptions of $9,800 and a standard deduction of $6,350. By contrast, \nunder my flat tax bill, that same family would receive a personal \nexemption of $25,500, and would pay tax only on income over that \namount.\n  My legislation retains the provisions for the deductibility of \ncharitable contributions up to a limit of $2,500 and home mortgage \ninterest on up to $100,000 of borrowing. Retention of these key \ndeductions will, I believe, enhance the political salability of this \nlegislation and allow the debate on the flat tax to move forward. If a \ndecision is made to eliminate these deductions, the revenue saved could \nbe used to reduce the overall flat tax rate from 20 to 19 percent.\n  With respect to businesses, the flat tax would also be a flat rate of \n20 percent. My legislation would eliminate the intricate scheme of \ncomplicated depreciation schedules, deductions, credits, and other \ncomplexities that go into business taxation in favor of a much-\nsimplified system that taxes all business revenue less only wages, \ndirect expenses and purchases--a system with much less potential for \nfraud, ``creative accounting,'' and tax avoidance.\n  Businesses would be allowed to expense 100 percent of the cost of \ncapital formation, including purchases of capital equipment, structures \nand land, and to do so in the year in which the investments are made. \nThe business tax would apply to all money not reinvested in the company \nin the form of employment or capital formation--thus fully taxing \nrevenue at the business level and making it inappropriate to retax the \nsame money when passed on to investors as dividends or capital gains.\n  Professors Hall and Rabushka summarize the benefits from this kind of \nflat taxation of business revenue as follows:\n\n       The business tax is a giant, comprehensive withholding tax \n     on all types of income other than wages, salaries, and \n     pensions. It is carefully designed to tax every bit of income \n     outside of wages, but to tax it only once. The business tax \n     does not have deductions for interest payments, dividends, or \n     any other type of payment to the owners of the business. As a \n     result, all income that people receive from business activity \n     has already been taxed. Because the tax has already been \n     paid, the tax system does not need to worry about what \n     happens to interest, dividends, or capital gains after these \n     types of income leave the firm. The resulting simplification \n     and improvement in the tax system is enormous. Today, the IRS \n     receives over a billion Form 1099s, which keep track of \n     interest and dividends, and must make an overwhelming effort \n     to match these forms to the 1040s filed by the recipients. \n     The only reason for a Form 1099 is track income as it makes \n     its way from the business where it originates to the ultimate \n     recipient. Not a single Form 1099 would be needed under a \n     flat tax with business income taxed at the source.\n\n  Let me now turn to a more specific discussion of the advantages of \nthe flat tax legislation I offer today.\n\n\n                               simplicity\n\n  The first major advantage to this flat tax is simplicity. According \nto reliable studies, Americans spend approximately 5.4 billion hours \neach year filling out tax forms. Much of this time is spent burrowing \nthrough IRS laws and regulations, which, according to the Tax \nFoundation, have grown from 744,000 words in 1955 to 5.6 million words \nin 1994. The Internal Revenue Code annotations alone have grown to 21 \nvolumes of mind-numbing detail and minutiae. Even those IRS forms which \nare intended to be simple are not--the instructions for the 1040EZ \nform--the so-called easy form--alone comprise 17 small-print pages.\n  Whenever the Government gets involved in any aspect of our lives, it \ncan covert the most simple goal or task into a tangled array of \ncomplexity, frustration and inefficiency. By way of example, most \nAmericans have become familiar with the absurdities of the Government's \nmilitary procurement programs. If these programs have taught us \nanything, it is how a simple purchase order for a hammer or a toilet \nseat can mushroom into thousands of words of regulations and \nrestrictions when the government gets involved. The Internal Revenue \nService is certainly no exception. Indeed, it has become a distressly \ncommon experience for taxpayers to receive computerized printouts \nclaiming that additional taxes are due, which require repeated \nexchanges of correspondence or personal visits before it is determined, \nas it so often is, that the taxpayer was right in the first place.\n  The plan offered today would eliminate these kinds of frustrations \nfor millions of taxpayers. This flat tax would enable us to scrap the \ngreat majority of the IRS rules, regulations and instructions and \ndelete literally millions of words from the Internal Revenue Code. \nInstead of tens of millions of hours of nonproductive time spent in \ncompliance with--or avoidance of--the Tax Code, taxpayers would spend \nonly the small amount of time necessary to fill out a postcard-sized \nform. Both business and individual taxpayers would thus find valuable \nhours freed up to engage in productive business activity, or for more \ntime with their families, instead of poring over tax tables, schedules \nand regulations.\n  The flat tax I have proposed can be calculated just by filling out a \nsmall postcard which would require a taxpayer only to answer a few easy \nquestions. The postcard would ask for the following information:\n                   Form 1--Individual Wage Tax, 1995\n\n       Your first name and initial (if joint return, also give \n     spouse's name and initial):\n       Your social security number:\n       Home address (number and street including apartment number \n     or rural route):\n       Spouse's social security number:\n       City, town, or post office, state, and ZIP code:\n       1. Wages, salary, pension and retirement benefits:\n       2. Personal allowance (enter only one):\n       $16,500 for married filing jointly\n       $9,500 for single\n       $14,000 for single head of household\n       3. Number of dependents, not including spouse, multiplied \n     by $4,500:\n       4. Mortgage interest on debt up to $100,000 for owner-\n     occupied home:\n       5. Cash or equivalent charitable contributions (up to \n     $2,500):\n       6. Total allowances and deductions (lines 2, 3, 4, 5):\n       7. Taxable compensation (line 1 less line 6, if positive; \n     otherwise zero):\n       8. Tax (20% of line 7):\n       9. Tax withheld by employer:\n       10. Tax or refund due (difference between lines 8 and 9):\n\n  Filing a tax return would become a manageable chore, not a seemingly \nendless nightmare, for most taxpayers.\n\n\n                        cutting back government\n\n  Along with the advantage of simplicity, enactment of this flat tax \nbill will help to remove the burden of costly and unnecessary \ngovernment regulation, bureaucracy and redtape from our everyday lives. \nThe heavy hand of government bureaucracy is particularly onerous in the \ncase of the Internal Revenue Service, which has been able to extend its \ninfluence into so many aspects of our lives.\n  In 1994, the IRS employed over 110,000 people, spread out over 650 \noffices across the United States. Its budget was in excess of $13 \nbillion, with some $7.1 billion spent annually just to administer the \ntax laws, and another $4 billion for enforcement. By simplifying the \nTax Code and eliminating most of the IRS' vast array of rules and \nregulations, the flat tax would enable us to cut a significant portion \nof the IRS budget, including the bulk of the funding now needed for \nenforcement and administration.\n\n[[Page S3420]]\n\n  In addition, a flat tax would allow taxpayers to redirect their time, \nenergies, and money away from the yearly morass of tax compliance. \nAccording to the Tax Foundation, in 1994, businesses spent \napproximately $127 billion in compliance with the Federal tax laws, and \nindividuals spent an additional $65 billion, for a total of $192 \nbillion. Moneys spent by businesses and investors in creating tax \nshelters and finding loopholes could be instead directed to productive \nand job-creating economic activity. With the adoption of a flat tax, \nthe opportunities for fraud and cheating would also be vastly reduced, \nallowing the Government to collect, according to some estimates, over \n$120 billion annually.\n\n\n                            economic growth\n\n  The third major advantage to a flat tax is that it will be a \ntremendous spur to economic growth. Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson \nestimates adoption of a flat tax like the one offered today would \nincrease future national wealth by over $2 trillion, in present value \nterms, over a 7-year period. The economic principles are fairly \nstraightforward. Our current tax system is inefficient; it is biased \ntoward too little savings and too much consumption. The flat tax \ncreates substantial incentives for savings and investment by \neliminating taxation on interest, dividends, and capital gains--and tax \npolicies which promote capital formation and investment are the best \nvehicle for creation of new and high paying jobs, and for a greater \nprosperity for all Americans.\n  It is well recognized that to promote future economic growth, we need \nnot only to eliminate the Federal Government's reliance on deficits and \nborrowed money, but to restore and expand the base of private savings \nand investment that has been the real engine driving American \nprosperity throughout our history. These concepts are interrelated, for \nthe Federal budget deficit soaks up much of what we have saved, leaving \nless for businesses to borrow for investments.\n  It is the sum total of savings by all aspects of the U.S. economy \nthat represented the pool of all capital available for investment--in \ntraining, education, research, machinery, physical plant, et cetera--\nand that constitutes the real seed of future prosperity. The statistics \nhere are daunting. In the 1960's the net U.S. national savings rate was \n8.2 percent, but it has fallen to a dismal 1.5 percent. In recent \ninternational comparisons, the United States has the lowest savings \nrate of any of the G-7 countries. We save at only one-tenth the rate of \nthe Japanese, and only one-fifth the rate of the Germans, which is \nclearly reflected in the comparative growth rates of our economies over \nthe last three decades.\n  An analysis of the components of U.S. savings patterns shows that \nalthough the Federal budget deficit is the largest cause of dissavings, \nboth personal and business savings rates have declined significantly \nover the past three decades. Thus, to recreate the pool of capital \nstock that is critical to future U.S. growth and prosperity, we have to \ndo more than just get rid of the deficit. We have to very materially \nraise our levels of private savings and investment. And we have to do \nso in a way that will not cause additional deficits.\n  The less money people save, the less money is available for business \ninvestment and growth. The current tax system discourages savings and \ninvestment, because it taxes the interest we earn from our savings \naccounts, the dividends we make from investing in the stock market, and \nthe capital gains we make from successful investments in our homes and \nthe financial markets. Indeed, under the current law these rewards for \nsaving and investment are not only taxed, they are overtaxed--since \ngains due solely to inflation, which represent no real increase in \nvalue, are taxed as if they were really profit.\n  With the limited exceptions of retirement plans and tax-free \nmunicipal bonds, our current Tax Code does virtually nothing to \nencourage personal savings and investment, or to reward it over \nconsumption. As William Schreyer wrote recently in the Harvard Business \nReview, ``the budget deficit is only one part of a larger national \nproblem: the U.S. saving deficit.''\n  This bill will change this system, and address this problem. The \nproposed legislation reverses the current skewed incentives by \npromoting savings and investment by individuals and by businesses. \nIndividuals would be able to invest and save their money tax-free and \nreap the benefits of the accumulated value of those investments without \npaying a capital gains tax upon the sale of these investments. \nBusinesses would also invest more as the flat tax allowed them to \nexpense fully all sums invested in new equipment and technology in the \nyear the expense was incurred, rather than dragging out the tax \nbenefits for these investments through complicated depreciation \nschedules. With greater investment and a larger pool of savings \navailable, interest rates and the costs of investment would also drop, \nspurring even further economic growth.\n  Critics of the flat tax have argued that we cannot afford the revenue \nlosses associated with the tremendous savings and investment incentives \nthe bill affords to businesses and individuals. Those critics are \nwrong. Not only is this bill carefully crafted to be revenue neutral, \nbut historically we have seen that when taxes are cut, revenues \nactually increase, as more taxpayers work harder for a larger share of \ntheir take-home pay, and investors are more willing to take risks in \npursuit of rewards that will not get eaten up in taxes. As one example, \nunder President Kennedy individual tax rates were lowered, investment \nincentives including the investment tax credit were created and then \nexpanded, depreciation rates were accelerated, and yet between 1962 and \n1967 gross annual Federal tax receipts went from $99.7 to $148 \nbillion--an increase of nearly 50 percent. More recently under \nPresident Reagan, after his tax cuts in the early 1980's, Government \ntax revenues rose from just under $600 billion in 1981 to nearly $1 \ntrillion in 1989. In fact, the Reagan tax cut program helped to bring \nabout the longest peacetime expansion of the U.S. economy in history. \nThere is every reason to believe that the flat tax proposed here can do \nthe same--and by maintaining revenue neutrality in this flat tax \nproposal, as we have, we can avoid any increases in annual deficits and \nthe national debt.\n  In addition to increasing Federal revenues by fostering economic \ngrowth, the flat tax can also add to Federal revenues without \nincreasing taxes by closing tax loopholes. The Congressional Research \nService estimates that for fiscal year 1995, individuals will shelter \nmore than $393 billion in tax revenue in legal loopholes, and \ncorporations will shelter an additional $60 billion. There may well be \nadditional moneys hidden in quasi-legal or even illegal tax shelters. \nUnder a flat tax system, all tax shelters will disappear and all income \nwill be subject to taxation.\n  The larger pool of savings created by a flat tax will also help to \nreduce our dependence\n on foreign investors to finance both our Federal budget deficits and \nour private sector economic activity. Currently, of the publicly held \nFederal debt, that is, the portion was not held by various Federal \ntrust funds like Social Security, nearly 20 percent is held by \nforeigners--the highest level in our history. By contrast, in 1965 less \nthan 5 percent of publicly held national debt was foreign-owned. We are \npaying over $40 billion in annual interest to foreign governments and \nindividuals, and this by itself accounts for roughly one-third of our \nwhole international balance of payments deficit. These massive interest \npayments are one of the principal sources of American capital flowing \nabroad, a factor which then enables foreign investors to buy up \nAmerican business. During the period 1980-91, the gross value of U.S. \nassets owned by foreign businesses and individuals rose 427 percent \nfrom $543 billion to $2.3 trillion.\n\n  The substantial level of foreign ownership of our national debt \ncreates both political and economic problems. On the political level, \nthere is at least the potential that some foreign nation may assume a \nposition where its level of investment in U.S. debt gives it \ndisproportionate leverage over American policy. Economically, \nincreasing foreign investment in Treasury debt furthers our national \nshift from a creditor to a debtor nation, weakening the dollar and \nundercutting our international trade position. A recent Congressional \nResearch Service report put it succinctly: ``To pay for today's \ncapital \n[[Page S3421]] inflows, tomorrow's economy will have to ship more \nabroad in exchange for fewer foreign products. These payments will be a \nconsequence in part of heavy Federal borrowing since 1982.'' With a \nflat tax in place, America's own supply of capital can be replenished, \nand we can return to our historic position as an international creditor \nnation rather than a debtor.\n  Professors Hall and Rabushka describe the pro-growth aspects of the \nflat tax in this way:\n\n       Today's absurd system taxes entrepreneurial success at 60 \n     percent while it actually subsidizes leveraged investment. \n     Our simple tax would put the same low rate on both \n     activities. A huge redirection of national effort would \n     follow. And the redirection could only be food for national \n     income. There is nothing wrong with shopping centers, \n     apartment buildings, airplanes, boxcars, medical equipment, \n     and cattle, but tax advantages have made us invest far too \n     much in them, and their contribution to income is \n     correspondingly low. Real growth will come when effort and \n     capital flow back into innovation and the development of new \n     business, the areas where confiscatory taxation has \n     discouraged investment. The contribution to income from new \n     resources will be correspondingly high.\n       We project a 3 percent increase in output from increased \n     total work in the U.S. economy and an additional increment to \n     total output of 3 percent from added capital formation and \n     dramatically improved entrepreneurial incentives. The sum of \n     6 percent is our best estimate of the improvement in real \n     incomes after the economy has had seven years to assimilate \n     the changed economic conditions brought about by the simple \n     flat tax. Both the amount and the timing are conservative.\n       Even this limited claim for economic improvement represents \n     enormous progress. By 2002, it would mean each American will \n     have an income about $1,900 higher, in 1995 dollars, as a \n     consequence of tax reform.\n\n  As Professors Hall and Rabushka state it, the growth case for a flat \ntax is compelling. It is even more compelling in the case of a tax \nrevision that is simple and demonstrably fair.\n\n\n                                fairness\n\n  By substantially increasing the personal allowances for taxpayers and \ntheir dependents, this flat tax proposal ensures that poorer taxpayers \nwill pay no tax and that taxes will not be regressive for lower and \nmiddle income taxpayers. At the same time, by closing the hundreds of \ntax loopholes which are currently used by wealthier taxpayers to \nshelter their income and avoid taxes, this flat tax bill will also \nensure that all Americans pay their fair share.\n  A variety of specific cases illustrate the fairness and simplicity of \nthis flat tax:\n   Case No. 1.--Married couple with two children, rents home, yearly \n

A summary of the key advantages \nare:\n  Simplicity: A 10-line postcard filing would replace the myriad forms \nand attachments currently required, thus saving Americans up to 5.4 \nbillion hours they currently spend every year in tax compliance.\n  Cuts Government: The flat tax would eliminate the lion's share of IRS \nrules, regulations, and requirements, which have grown from 744,000 \nwords in 1955 to 5.6 million words in 1994. It would also allow us to \nslash the mammoth IRS bureaucracy of 110,000 employees spread out over \n650 offices nationwide.\n  Promotes economic growth: Economists estimate a growth of over $2 \ntrillion in national wealth over 7 years, representing an increase of \n$1,900 in personal income for every man, woman, and child in America.\n  Increases efficiency: Investment decisions would be made on the basis \nof productivity rather than simply for tax avoidance, thus leading to \neven greater economic expansion.\n  [[Page S3422]] Reduces interest rates: Economic forecasts indicate \nthat interest rates would fall substantially, by as much as two points, \nas the flat tax removes many of the current disincentives to savings.\n  Lowers compliance costs: Americans would be able to save up to $192 \nbillion they currently spend every year in tax compliance.\n  Decreases fraud: As tax loopholes are eliminated and the Tax Code is \nsimplified, there will be far less opportunity for tax avoidance and \nfraud, which now amounts to over $120 billion in uncollected revenue \nannually.\n  Reduces IRS costs: Simplification of the Tax Code will allow us to \nsave significantly on the $13 billion annual budget currently allocated \nto the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Professors Hall and Rabushka have projected that within 7 years of \nenactment, this type of a flat tax would produce a 6-percent increase \nin output from increased total work in the U.S. economy and increased \ncapital formation. The economic growth would mean a $1,900 increase in \nthe personal income of all Americans.\n  No one likes to pay taxes. But Americans will be much more willing to \npay their taxes under a system that they believe is fair, a system that \nthey can understand, and a system that they recognize promotes rather \nthan prevents growth and prosperity. The legislation I introduce today \nwill afford Americans such a tax system.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 489. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter \ninto an appropriate form of agreement with, the town of Grand Lake, CO, \nauthorizing the town to maintain permanently a cemetery in the Rocky \nMountain National Park; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n    THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK GRAND LAKE CEMETERY ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, on January 26, 1915, Congress passed \nlegislation creating a 265,726-acre Rocky Mountain National Park. In \n1892, long before the park was created, the town of Grand Lake \nestablished a small, less than 5-acre community cemetery that lies \nbarely 1,000 feet inside the western edge of the park. Apparently, in \nthe early 1950's, the National Park Service took notice of the cemetery \nand issued the town a formal special use permit, which has been renewed \nover the years. In 1991, Rocky Mountain National Park apparently \ninformed the town of Grand Lake that it would issue one final 5-year \nspecial use permit.\n  This 103-year-old cemetery has become part of the community's \nheritage. Grand Lake residents have very strong emotional and personal \nattachments to it and need to be assured of its continued use and \ndesignation as a cemetery. The current permit is due to expire in 1996. \nAll parties have agreed that a more permanent solution was needed to \nmeet the needs of the community and the resource preservation and \nprotection intended by the establishment of the park.\n  Existing measures available to the National Park Service, including \nspecial use permit authority, do not provide for a permanent solution \nthat satisfies both the park and the community. In addition, special \nuses apparently can only be permitted for a maximum period of 5 years. \nGiven that the town and park agree that the small cemetery is a \npermanent use, continued renewal of a 5-year permit is not a realistic \nsolution.\n  In an effort to avoid future difficulties, park and town \nrepresentatives have agreed that this legislation would offer the best \nsolution to this problem. Authorizing the continued existence of the \ncemetery with specific size and boundaries within the park also \nprotects park resources. The community has expressed a strong \nwillingness and desire to assume responsibility for permanent \nmanagement of the cemetery. This legislation would authorize the \ndevelopment of an agreement to turn maintenance responsibilities for \nthe cemetery and road over to the town, resulting in a financial \nsavings to the park. It also recognizes the cultural significance of \nthe cemetery and its strong ties with the history of the Grand Lake \narea, which includes the story of Rocky Mountain National Park.\n  This legislation would negate the need for repeated negotiations \nbetween the community and the National Park Service, and the chance for \nmisunderstandings. The National Park Service and Grand Lake \nrepresentatives have worked long and hard on developing this proposal. \nEnactment of this legislation would go a long way in maintaining and \nenhancing the spirit of cooperation and goodwill between park and \ncommunity that has been achieved during the development of this \nresolution.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 490.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide coverage of outpatient self-management training services under \npart B of the Medicare Program for individuals with diabetes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n the medicare diabetes outpatients self-management training act of 1995\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, diabetes is the third leading cause \nof death from disease in the United States. It is the leading cause of \nblindness in people aged 25 to 74 and the most frequent cause of \nnontraumatic lower limb amputations. Diabetes also greatly increases an \nindividual's chances of succumbing to stroke or heart disease.\n  What is such a shame, Mr. President, is that diabetes is a condition \nthat can generally be treated so that major complications do not occur. \nIn some cases it can even be prevented. While there is no known cure \nfor diabetes, individuals with the disease can lead completely normal \nlives--even extraordinarily productive lives--if they know how to \nbalance their diet, get enough exercise, and manage their disease.\n  [[Page S3423]] People with diabetes learn to take care of themselves \nthrough self-maintenance and education programs. Generally, classes are \ntaken when an individual is diagnosed with the disease and periodically \nthereafter in order to keep up with the changes in their condition and \nto get the most up-to-date treatments available.\n  Appropriate preventive education services for those with diabetes \nhave the potential to save a great deal of money that would otherwise \ngo for hospitalizations and other acute care costs. Education also \nsaves these individuals from a great deal of unnecessary pain and \nsuffering. Studies by the American Diabetes Association and others have \nshown that the Medicare program could save $2 to $3 for every $1 spent \non diabetes education.\n  Medicare currently covers these services in inpatient or \nhospitalbased settings and in limited outpatient settings--specifically \nhospital outpatient departments or rural health clinics. Unfortunately, \nMedicare does not currently cover education services if they are given \nin any other outpatient setting, such as a doctor's office. Even the \nlimited coverage of outpatient settings that is currently permitted \nunder Medicare is subject to State-by-State variation according to \ninterpretation by the program's fiscal intermediaries.\n  The Medicare Diabetes Outpatient Self-Management Training Act of \n1995, which I am reintroducing today along with Senators Chafee, \nCochran, Inouye, and Hollings, would provide for Medicare coverage for \noutpatient diabetes education on a consistent basis throughout the \ncountry. The bill would extend Medicare coverage of outpatient programs \nbeyond hospital-based programs and rural health clinics. It would \ndirect the Secretary of Health and Human Services to guarantee that \ncoverage be available only for those services delivered through \nprograms that meet stringent quality standards. Uniform payment would \nbe achieved through implementation of new working guidelines.\n  This legislation is all about preventive medicine and is a sensible \napproach that should show savings for the Medicare Program in the long \nrun. I hope that my colleagues will join me as cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 491\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto issue a certificate of documentation for the vessel Intrepid under \ntitle 46, United States Code.\n  The Intrepid has a long and proud history in sailing, including \nrepresenting the United States in the America's Cup and winning in 1967 \nand 1971. It is currently U.S.-owned and is the Flagship of the \nAmerica's Cup Hall of Fame.\n  The Intrepid is a 12 meter yacht, 65 feet in length that was built at \nthe Minneford Boat Yard in City Island, NY in 1967. At the time of its \nconstruction, the vessel employed the breakthrough technology of noted \nboat designer Olin Stephen. In a departure from the past, its design \nseparated the keel and rudder, and added a trim tab on the trailing \nedge of the keel. Variations of this technology are still being used \ntoday.\n  Because the Intrepid was at one point sold to non-U.S. owners and \nthus became ineligible to participate in U.S. coastwise trade, the \nowners seek a waiver of the Jones Act. They plan to use the vessel only \nin limited commercial ventures, and the vessel's use will not adversely \naffect the coastwise trade in U.S. waters. If granted this waiver, \nIntrepid's owners intend to fully comply with U.S. documentation and \nsafety requirements.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 492\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto issue a certificate of documentation for the vessel Consortium under \ntitle 46, United States Code.\n  A recently formed Rhode Island corporation, Marine Consortium, Inc., \nhas purchased the 102-foot Camper and Nicholson motoryacht, Consortium. \nIt is a U.S. documented vessel homeported in Newport, RI, and is \nideally suited for charter operation.\n  Because Consortium has a foreign built--British--hull, it cannot \nundertake charters in U.S. waters.

Res. 28. A joint resolution to grant consent of Congress to the \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact; read the first time.\n\n\n                   northeast interstate dairy compact\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly support the \nintroduction of a joint resolution to grant the consent of Congress to \nthe northeast interstate dairy compact. Congress is simply being asked \nto ratify a completed piece of legislation--legislation that passed \noverwhelmingly in each of the six New England States that the compact \nrepresents.\n  Mr. President, a great deal of time and effort has gone into creating \nthe dairy compact, over 6 years in fact. The dairy compact represents a \ncooperative effort of six States working collectively to restore the \ntraditional Federal-State balance to milk regulation. The compact has \nbeen carefully designed so that it will not adversely affect any other \nregion of the country. Provisions have been set forth in the compact to \nprotect the interests of farmers and processors outside the compact \nregion. In addition, there is no cost to the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, the dairy compact simply complements the Federal Milk \nMarketing Program. It would not supplant or replace Federal law. The \ncompact regulates only fluid milk, which is milk for beverage use. Milk \nfor manufacturing purposes such as cheese and ice cream would be \nabsolutely exempt from the compact. We are talking about a very small \namount of milk in a local market.\n  Just since 1984, almost a third of the 3,170 farms then operating in \nVermont have shut down. In 1994 alone, Vermont lost 148 farms and if \nthe downward trend of milk prices continues we will lose more this \nyear. Vermont dairy farmers are receiving milk prices well below the \ncost of production. Current milk prices for farmers are as low as they \nwere 10 years ago, yet the cost of production and price to the consumer \nhas increased. Farmers and consumers would both benefit from the \ncompact's ability to establish a more stable price structure for the \nmilk they produce and purchase, removing the fluctuations in fluid milk \nprices, assuring the region a viable supply of locally produced milk.\n  The dairy compact is a unique partnership of the region's governments \nand the dairy industry supported by a broad coalition of organizations \nand people committed to maintaining the vitality of the region's dairy \nindustry.\n  The joint resolution being introduced today, has strong support from \nboth sides of the isle. All 12 Senators from the New England \ndelegation, representing producing and consuming States have come \ntogether to cosponsor this joint resolution.\n  Mr. President, I can say with certainty, support for the dairy \ncompact in New England is impressive. During the New England Governors' \nConference winter meeting, all six New England Governors urged Congress \nto approve the dairy compact. A resolution of the New England \nGovernors' Conference in support of congressional enactment of the \nnortheast dairy compact was approved and signed by the chair of the New \nEngland Governors, Governor Steve Merrill of New Hampshire.\n  The Governors of the compact region speak for not only the farmers \nand consumers but for the States themselves and the rights of the \nStates. Mr. President, the message to Congress from Governors \nnationwide has been clear. ``Increase the flexibility of states and \nsupport legislation that promotes state and regional policy \ninitiatives.''\n  Well Mr. President, this thoroughly thought out compact provides the \nopportunity for a partnership between Congress and the States to \nstrengthen this fundamental federalism movement. It maintains that the \nStates' constitutional authority, resources, and competence of the \npeople to govern, is recognized and protected.\n  Mr. President, I am certain that my colleagues will agree with me \nthat dairy farmers deserve a fair price for their product. What does it \nsay about our values when some of the hardest working people. our \nfarmers, are underpaid and unappreciated? The people of New England \nhave a right and deserve the chance to help themselves. The joint \nresolution that I am introducing today, along with Senator Leahy and my \ncolleagues from New England gives the region the tools to face the \nchallenges of improving and stabilizing farm prices.\n  I urge my colleagues to respect this interstate cooperation and \nratify the dairy compact.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this one page fact sheet \nthat explains and addresses the compact appear in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I unanimous consent ask to have printed in the Record \nthe resolution of the New England Governors' Conference.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            New England Governors'\n\n\n                                             Conference, Inc.,\n\n                                    Boston, MA, February 13, 1995.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: I understand the Northeast \n     Interstate Dairy Compact awaits action by the full Senate. On \n     behalf of the New England Governors' Conference, Inc., I \n     write to ask your help in moving the Compact bill forward as \n     quickly as possible.\n       The attached Resolution of the New England Governors' \n     Conference, Inc. was adopted unanimously at our recent \n     meeting in Washington, D.C.\n       The Dairy Compact has been enacted into law by the six New \n     England states. We hope you will support this unique \n     experiment in cooperative federalism. This Compact is a bi-\n     partisan, state-sponsored, regional response to the chronic \n     problem of low dairy farm prices. If successfully \n     implemented, the Compact will stabilize our region's dairy \n     industry and reinvigorate this crucial segment of our rural \n     economy, without cost to the federal government or adverse \n     impact on the national industry.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this matter.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                William A. Gildea,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                resolution 127--northeast dairy compact\n\n       A Resolution of the New England Governors' Conference, Inc. \n     in support of congressional enactment of the Northeast Dairy \n     Compact.\n       Whereas, the six New England states have enacted the \n     Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact to address the alarming \n     loss of dairy farms in the region; and\n       Whereas, the Compact is a unique partnership of the \n     region's governments and the dairy industry supported by a \n     broad and active coalition of organizations and people \n     committed to maintaining the vitality of the region's dairy \n     industry, including consumers, processors, bankers, equipment \n     dealers, veterinarians, the tourist and travel industry, \n     environmentalists, land conservationists and recreational \n     users of open land; and\n       Whereas, the Compact would not harm but instead complement \n     the existing federal structure for milk pricing, nor \n     adversely affect the competitive position of any dairy \n     farmer, processor or other market participant in the nation's \n     dairy industry; and\n       Whereas, the limited and relatively isolated market \n     position of the New England dairy industry makes it an \n     appropriate locality in which to access the effectiveness of \n     regional regulation of milk pricing, and\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States expressly \n     authorizes states to enter into interstate compacts with the \n     approval of Congress and government at all levels \n     increasingly recognizes the need to promote cooperative, \n     federalist solutions to local and regional problems; and\n        [[Page S3425]] Whereas, the Northeast Interstate Dairy \n     Compact has been submitted to Congress for approval as \n     required by the Constitution;\n       Now therefore be it resolved That the New England \n     Governors' Conference, Inc. requests that Congress approve \n     the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact; and\n       Be it further resolved that, a copy of this resolution be \n     sent to the leadership of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives, the Chairs of the appropriate legislative \n     committees, and the Secretary of the United States Department \n     of Agriculture.\n       Adoption certified by the New England Governors' \n     Conference, Inc. on January 31, 1995.\n                                                  Stephen Merrill,\n     Governor of New Hampshire Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                 the northeast interstate dairy compact\n\n       Was adopted with near-unanimous support by the six New \n     England state legislatures. It is backed by the New England \n     Governors Conference, the region's consumer groups, dairy \n     farmers and processors.\n       Establishes an interstate commission authorized to regulate \n     New England dairy farm prices. The commission would help \n     stabilize fluid milk prices for both consumers and farmers by \n     establishing a pricing structure which would remove the price \n     fluctuations that currently exist.\n       Assures control by the region's consumer states. Four of \n     the six compact states, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode \n     Island and New Hampshire, are milk importing states. They \n     joined the Compact because it promotes as well as protects \n     the consumer interest.\n       Complements the federal milk marketing program. It would \n     not supplant or replace federal law.\n       Does not discriminate against out-of-region farmers or \n     processors. Milk will flow into and from the Compact region \n     in exactly the same manner as occurs under federal law. Any \n     farmer or processor, regardless of their location, may market \n     milk in the compact region without competitive disadvantage.\n       Benefits out-of-region farmers equally with New England \n     farmers. Thirty percent of New England's milk supply is \n     produced by New York farmers. These farmers will receive the \n     same Compact benefits as New England farmers.\n       Is strictly local in effect. The Compact regulates only \n     fluid milk. Processors purchasing milk for manufacturing \n     purposes such as cheese and ice cream would be absolutely \n     exempt from the Compact.\n       Protects against the production of surplus milk. Provisions \n     in the Compact and the Congressional enabling legislation \n     ensure this result.\n       Was given a zero score by the Congressional Budget Office. \n     It will operate without cost to the federal government.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise along with my good friend from \nVermont, Senator Jeffords, and in fact the entire New England \ndelegation. We rise to introduce a resolution to approve the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact.\n  The compact is an agreement among the six New England States that has \nbeen approved by each of our States' legislatures. It needs approval, \nunder the Constitution, of the Congress to take effect. Its intent is \nsimple. It would rationalize the pricing of fluid milk in the New \nEngland States so our farmers can receive a fair price and so the \nconsumers themselves can play a role in stabilizing these milk prices.\n  In fact, the roots of this compact are in the country's strong \ntradition of federalism. On January 27, 1995, this body overwhelmingly \napproved the unfunded mandates bill, which is currently in the House-\nSenate conference committee.\n  Now, throughout that debate, I heard Senator after Senator talk about \ngiving more power back to our States. They said the Federal Government \nshould not dictate to the States what they are supposed to do without \nproviding the money. They said the States should have constraints \nlifted so they could take care of their own concerns.\n  The New England States are concerned about the dairy farmers in our \narea. They want to take more control of pricing fluid milk as a minimum \nprice that is now set by a very complicated system of Federal milk \nmarketing orders.\n  So, here is a chance for the Senate to show its support of the \nfederalist principles it espoused in the unfunded mandates bill. This \nmeasure was approved last year by the Senate Judiciary Committee with \nthe strong support of Senator Kennedy, and Senator Cohen, but it ended \nin a filibuster at the end of last year.\n  All we are saying from New England, is that we have gotten the \nGovernors together, Republicans and Democrats; the Senators together, \nRepublicans and Democrats; legislatures made up of Republicans and \nDemocrats all came together to agree on a procedure that affects only \nthe New England States in the pricing and sale of fluid milk. We have \ndone all this. We now come, as the Constitution requires, to the \nCongress to ask for the imprimatur of the Congress, the blessing of the \nCongress. We can go forward and handle our own affairs without the \nFederal Government telling us what to do.\n  The New England States want to improve the way milk is priced and the \ncompact is the way to do it. Farmers are struggling as they receive \nprices at or below their cost of production. While farmers struggle \nwith low prices, the consumers have not seen any benefit. While farm \nprices have declined 5 to 10 percent for the last decade, retail milk \nprices have increased nearly 30 percent. A recent USDA study shows that \nstable prices will help consumers.\n  The compact would create a commission made up of both farmers and \nconsumers that would have the authority to adjust and stabilize fluid \nmilk prices. The commission could raise prices so farmers receive a \nfair return for their work, but there are also strong consumer \nsafeguards. Consumers are represented from each State and it would take \nfour of the six New England States to approve any price increase. Any \nState could drop out of the compact after 1 year.\n  The compact is designed to work in conjunction with the New England \nFederal milk marketing order. The compact would work just as the \nFederal order does with all farmers supplying the market benefitting \nfrom any price increase. Milk would move into and out of the region \njust as it does now.\n  This compact is a model of cooperation--it is a partnership between \nthe States and the Federal Government, between dairy cooperatives and \nmilk processors and most importantly, between farmers and consumers.\n  In addition to the New England Governors Association, the National \nAssociation of State Departments of Agriculture, the National Grange, \nthe National Farmers Organization, and dairy cooperatives from many \nregions in the country support this compact.\n  The New England States are asking for nothing from this body nor the \nFederal treasury--just the opportunity to act in concert for their \ncommon good. In the spirit of federalism I urge my colleagues to give \nthis opportunity to the New England States and approve this compact.\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \nfrom New England in introducing this resolution to grant the consent of \nCongress to the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. The survival of \nmany family dairy farms in Maine and the other New England States \ndepends on prompt passage of this legislation.\n  As in many other rural regions of the country, agriculture is a \ncornerstone of Maine's economy. Within the agricultural sector, dairy \nfarming usually ranks second or third in cash receipts every year. The \ndairy industry provides not only jobs for the farmers themselves, but \nfor the people who sell farm machinery, service the machinery, sell \nfuel and feed, and provide other goods and services. Dairy farms also \naccount for large shares of the municipal tax base throughout rural \nMaine, making them critical contributors to local schools and essential \ntown services.\n  Unfortunately, all is not well in the Maine dairy industry. In 1978, \nMaine had 1,133 dairy farms. By 1988, that number had declined to 800. \nIn 1991, there were 680. And by 1994, the number dwindled further to \n606.\n  This precipitous decline in the number of dairy farms can be \nattributed to several factors, most notably to the fact that dairy \nprices are very low while costs remain high, and these same \ncircumstances are driving farmers in other New England States out of \nbusiness as well. In Maine, the average cost of producing milk is $17 \nper 100 pounds. The June 1994 Federal order price in the Northeast was \n$16.23 per hundred. For August of 1994, the market order price declined \nto $14.49. In 1993, the average milk price in the Northeast declined by \n54 cents per hundred.\n  Milk prices simply have not increased in concert with production. \nWhereas the retail price for a gallon of milk in 1991 was $2.20 a \ngallon, that same gallon still retailed for $2.20 a \n[[Page S3426]] gallon in 1994--without adjusting for inflation.\n  Another contributing factor in the loss of dairy farms is price \nvolatility. Prices can decline by $2 per hundred in less than 3 months. \nThese price swings add serious uncertainty to a farmer's daily \nexistence, making it difficult for the farmer to plan strategically or \nto raise capital when needed.\n  The State of Maine attempted to address this serious problem by \nestablishing a dairy vendor's fee that stabilized the price that \nfarmers in Maine received for their milk. The vendor's fee enjoyed the \nstrong support of both farmers and consumers in Maine, but a Federal \ncourt struck it down in 1994 as a violation of interstate commerce. \nAccording to the Maine Department of Agriculture, the inevitable result \nof the court's action will be an accelerating decline in family dairy \nfarms.\n  Faced with similar problems throughout the region, the six New \nEngland States banded together to develop a joint regional solution. \nThey negotiated an interstate dairy compact that will ensure a more \nreasonable and stable price for dairy farmers in the region. But it is \na pricing program that also protects the interests of consumers in the \nregion. As evidence of the balance and fairness achieved by the \ncompact, both the net-producing and net-consuming States in the region \nall approved it with strong support.\n  The compact creates a regional commission which has the authority to \nset minimum prices paid to farmers for fluid, or class I milk. \nDelegations from each State comprise the voting membership of the \ncommission, and these delegations in turn will include both farmer and \nconsumer representatives. The minimum price established by the \ncommission is the Federal market order price plus a small over-order \ndifferential that would be paid by milk processing plants. This over-\norder price is capped in the compact, and a two-thirds voting majority \nof the commission is required before any over-order price can be \ninstituted.\n  Mr. President, until the court struck down the Maine dairy vendor's \nfee, milk in my State was priced by a mechanism that is similar to that \nwhich could be utilized by the compact commission. Maine's experience \nwas uniformly positive. Farm prices were stable, and they were higher, \nbut only modestly higher. No farmers got rich on the minimal adjustment \nprovided by the over-order price under the vendor's fee program. It \nhelped them keep their heads above water. Dairy processors and vendors \nmaintained their business, and consumers did not see any significant \nincreases in the price of milk. It was a win-win proposition for \neveryone in Maine, and I am confident that the compact will achieve the \nsame success throughout New England without violating the \nConstitution's interstate commerce clause.\n  Although the compact affects only the participating States, the \ncosponsors decided to remove any doubt by including language in the \nresolution that provides explicit assurances to farmers and processors \nin States outside the region. These assurances further specify that the \nover-order price can only be established for class I fluid milk, that \nno new States can join the compact without the formal approval of both \nHouses of Congress, that out-of-region farmers who sell milk in the \ncompact region will get the same price as farmers in the region, that \nthe commission's pricing authority is strictly limited, and that the \ncommission must develop a plan to ensure that over-order prices do not \nlead to increases in production.\n  In the debates held so far in this Congress, and surely in the \ndebates to come, we have heard and will hear many Members argue that \nthe States are often best-positioned to solve their own problems, and \nthat they should be allowed to do so without interference from \nWashington. I couldn't agree more.\n  With the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact bill being introduced \ntoday, Senators will have an opportunity to match words on this concept \nwith deeds. The compact represents a regional response to a regional \nproblem. It affects only those States that belong to the compact. Why \nshould the Federal Government deny the States an opportunity to solve \ntheir own problems? The answer is that we shouldn't. We should praise \nthe States for their self-reliance and ingenuity. I hope that Senators \nwill recognize the value in this kind of State-based problem-solving, \nand support the compact when it comes to the floor for a vote.\n\n\n

Res. 83\n\n       Whereas the Federal budget according to the most recent \n     estimates of the Congressional Budget Office continues to be \n     in deficit in excess of $190 billion;\n       Whereas continuing annual Federal budget deficits add to \n     the Federal debt which soon is projected to exceed $5 \n     trillion;\n       Whereas continuing Federal budget deficits and growing \n     Federal debt reduce savings and capital formation;\n       Whereas continuing Federal budget deficits contribute to a \n     higher level of interest rates than would otherwise occur, \n     raising capital costs and curtailing total investment;\n       Whereas continuing Federal budget deficits also contribute \n     to significant trade deficits and dependence on foreign \n     capital;\n       Whereas the Federal debt that results from persistent \n     Federal deficits transfers a potentially crushing burden to \n     future generations, making their living standards lower than \n     they otherwise would have been;\n       Whereas efforts to reduce the Federal deficit should be \n     among the highest economic priorities of the 104th Congress; \n     and,\n       Whereas enacting across-the-board or so-called middle class \n     tax cut measures could impede efforts during the 104th \n     Congress to significantly reduce the Federal deficit:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate that reducing \n     the Federal deficit should be one of the nation's highest \n     priorities, that enacting an across-the-board so so-called \n     middle class tax cut during the 104th Congress would hinder \n     efforts to significantly reduce the Federal deficit.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with the \nsenior Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] to submit a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that enacting an across-the-board or \nso-called middle-class tax cut during the 104th Congress would hinder \nefforts to reduce the Federal deficit.\n  Mr. President, though I would certainly like to support a tax cut \nmeasure, especially one that provides a Well Deserved tax break to \nmiddle-class Americans, supporting that kind of proposal is simply not \nresponsible right now, especially given the recent developments with \nrespect to the balanced budget amendment.\n  During a month of telling debate on the proposal, we have not done \none thing that will actually help us achieve the widely shared goal of \na balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, it is time we did.\n  We have been making some headway in reducing the deficit.\n  President Clinton's 1993 deficit reduction package was a critical \nturning point in our fight to reduce the deficit, and we are now in the \nthird straight year of progressively lower deficits.\n  However, we need to do more, and I firmly believe we not only \nundermine those needed future efforts but could also jeopardize the \nprogress we have already made if we rush along now and do tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize that my opposition to tax cuts is \nbipartisan--the tax cut proposals of both parties are wrong.\n  I publicly opposed the President's proposed tax cuts the same day he \neven announced them.\n  An I think opposition to the tax cuts proposals of both parties has \nbipartisan support.\n  In fact, I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank the \nSenator from Oregon [Mr. Packwood], the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. \nChafee], and the Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] for their support of a \nsimilar effort that I made as part of the debate on the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Their support was particularly heartening, and I think it reveals a \ngrowing consensus that deficit reduction must be a higher priority than \ntax cuts right now.\n  As part of his fiscal year 1996 budget, the President, has proposed \nabout $63 billion in tax cut over the next 5 years, and that is a \nfigure that grows to $174 billion over 10 years.\n  Even more troubling the Republican contract with America has proposed \ntax cuts totaling $196 billion over 5 years and the whopping figure of \n$704 billion over 10 years.\n  To me, all of those figures represent the cost of a lost opportunity.\n  The President's tax cuts are part of\n   his budget package, and he has indicated that they are more than \noffset by $184 billion in spending cuts.\n\n  And at least some of those supporting the Republican Contract With \nAmerica tax cut package have indicated they too would be offsetting the \ncost of those tax cuts with spending cuts.\n  However, even if they are fully offset--I hope we would agree that to \nbe an absolute minimum requirement--we would do much better to forego \nthose tax cuts.\n  Eliminating the President's tax cut proposals, while doing nothing \nelse to his budget, would result in $72 billion in additional deficit \nreduction over the next 5 years--the $63 billion in foregone tax cuts \nplus $9 billion in interest savings.\n  Just doing that, and nothing more, would produce a Federal budget \ndeficit of $170 billion in fiscal year 2000, $24 billion lower than the \n$194 billion projected as part of the President's budget.\n  In fact, the figures for the Contract With America tax cuts are very \ndramatic.\n  Assuming spending cuts are produced to offset that tax cut package, \nand then assuming we decided not to adopt those tax cuts, doing nothing \nelse to the President's budget would result in $217 billion in \nadditional deficit reduction over the next 5 years--$196 billion in \nforegone tax cuts plus $21 billion in interest savings.\n  Just doing that, and nothing more, would produce a Federal budget \ndeficit of $114 billion in the year 2000, $80 billion less than what \nthe President projected.\n  Over 10 years, just under this scenario, we would save $178 billion \nin interest costs alone by not adopting the Contract With America tax \ncut package, and could produce $882 billion in deficit reduction.\n  Let me conclude by noting that tax cut proposals are grounded in the \nold politics of the free lunch--promise the people a tax cut and a \nbalanced budget.\n  [[Page S3428]] It is the kind of politics that created the fiscal \nmess which now confronts us and undermined the American people's faith \nin their Government.\n  By resisting calls for tax cuts, we not only help alleviate pressure \non the deficit, we also can begin to restore the lost confidence of the \nAmerican people in their elected officials.\n  I hope other members will join Senator Bumpers and me in persuading a \nmajority of the Senate that it is irresponsible to cut taxes as we are \ntrying to reduce the deficit and balance the Federal budget.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

COMMEMORATION BY THE PRESIDENT.\n\n       The Senate calls on the President to issue a Presidential \n     message calling on the people of the United States and all \n     Federal, State, and local governments to commemorate the \n     sesquicentennial anniversary of Florida becoming a State with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n     SEC. 4. COPIES OF RESOLUTION.\n\n       The Secretary of the Senate shall send this resolution to \n     the Florida Congressional delegation, the Governor of \n     Florida, the National Archives, and the Florida Archives.\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, this week marks the anniversary of a very \nspecial event in the history of my State.\n  One hundred and fifty years ago on the 1st of March 1845, the U.S. \nSenate passed a bill admitting Florida to the Union as the 27th State. \nPresident John Tyler signed the bill into law on March 3, 1845.\n  Tomorrow, March 3, 1995, the State of Florida will celebrate its \nsesquicentennial.\n  Florida has a rich history stretching nearly five centuries.\n  The search for gold and glory brought Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de \nLeon to Florida during the Easter season of 1513.\n  He and his crew disembarked between present-day St. Augustine and \nCape Canaveral to claim the land in the name of the King of Spain. \nPonce de Leon called this new land Florida--a Spanish word meaning \n``full of flowers.''\n  From discovery in 1513 to early 1821, Spain, France, and England \nplayed significant roles in Florida's exploration and development.\n  During the territorial period--1821 through 1845--Florida became one \nof the major cotton producing areas of the region. The struggle for \nstatehood was a major political issue in Washington and throughout the \nterritory of Florida.\n  David Levy (Yulee), who later became Florida's first U.S. Senator, \nled the fight to bring Florida into the Union.\n  Florida's admission to the Union and the contributions of its \ncitizens have proven to be of immense benefit both to the United States \nand to the State of Florida.\n  As the United States has grown and prospered Florida has become a \nworld leader in agriculture, commercial fishing, education, financial \nservices, horse breeding, high technology, manufacturing, phosphate \nproduction, and tourism.\n  More than 20 million tourists visit Florida each year to experience \nthe Sunshine State's great natural beauty, her pristine beaches, clean \nwaters, pure air, and extraordinary scenery.\n  Each region of Florida has its own unique identity. There are vivid \ncontrasts between the excitement of Cape Canaveral and Disney World, \nthe cosmopolitan feel of south Florida, the tropical world of the \nFlorida Keys, the natural beauty of the west coast, the mystery that is \nthe Everglades, the citrus and cattle country of central Florida, and \nthe deep South culture of north Florida and the panhandle.\n  The marvelous diversity of those who have migrated to Florida seeking \na better life for themselves and their families have made the State a \nmicrocosm of America itself.\n  The dedication and innovation of Floridians, both past and present, \ninspire all of us in Florida as we prepare our State for the challenges \nof the 21st century.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3428-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3428-S3431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n              THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RISK MANAGEMENT ACT\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                         LOTT AMENDMENT NO. 316\n\n  (Ordered referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.)\n  Mr. LOTT submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nbill (S. 333) to direct the Secretary of Energy to institute certain \nprocedures in the performance of risk assessments \n[[Page S3429]] in connection with environmental restoration activities, \nand for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill add the following:\n\n     SEC. 8.

Peer Review.\n       (1) PEER REVIEW BY INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL PEER REVIEW PANELS.\n       a. Initiation of Peer Review.--The head of the Office of \n     information and regulatory Affairs of the Office of \n     management and Budget may initiate a peer review under this \n     section if he or she determines that such peer review is \n     advisable because the assessments or analyses to be reviewed \n     are matters of major importance due to their potential for \n     direct or indirect health, safety, or environmental or \n     economic impacts or because they would establish an important \n     precedent.\n       b. Establishment and Membership of Panels.--Peer reviews \n     shall be conducted by panels consisting of members appointed \n     by the head of the agency which conducted the risk assessment \n     and cost-benefit analysis, in consultation with the head of \n     the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the \n     Office of management and Budget, the head of the Office of \n     Science and Technology Policy, and other concerned Federal \n     agencies, and officials of any affected state and local \n     governments.

Peer review panels shall be \n     established within 90 days after a determination under \n     subsection (a). Members of the panels shall--\n       1. be recognized and credentialed experts in the \n     appropriate disciplines;\n       2. have recent professional experience conducting a risk \n     assessment, an assessment of the cost of a regulation, or an \n     assessment of the benefits of a regulation, as applicable to \n     the panel for which they are selected;\n       3. have filed and made publicly available financial \n     disclosure forms; and\n       4. have not been involved in a recent comprehensive \n     analysis of the substance, condition, or activity under \n     review, and have not recently taken a public position on the \n     risks or costs to be reviewed.\n       c. Termination.--A peer review panel shall terminate upon \n     submission of the report with respect to the risk assessment \n     or cost-benefit analysis for which the panel was established.\n       d. Standards Applicable to Peer Review.--\n       1. all peer reviews of the risk assessments conducted \n     pursuant to this section shall have the purpose of \n     determining whether the agency's risk assessment complies \n     with the principles set out in this Act;\n       2. all peer reviews of cost-benefit analyses conducted \n     pursuant to this section shall have the purpose of \n     determining whether the cost-benefit analysis meets the \n     standards set out in this Act.\n       e. Completion Prior to Judicial Review.--If the head of the \n     Office of information and Regulatory Affairs has initiated \n     the peer review process pursuant to subsection a, or states \n     in writing that initiation of the process is under \n     consideration by that office, no suit for judicial review of \n     a risk assessment or cost-benefits analysis or related agency \n     action may be brought until after the peer review process has \n     concluded or such official determines not to initiate the \n     process; provided, however, that if such official does not \n     indicate a determination within 30 days after stating that \n     such matter is under consideration, a judicial review suit \n     may be brought and the official will not thereafter have the \n     authority to issue a determination to initiate the process.\n       (2) Procedures for Peer Review.\n       a. Submission to Panel.--Within 30 days after the \n     establishment of a peer review panel, the head of the Federal \n     agency shall submit to the panel all data and testing \n     (including the details of the methodology) used by the agency \n     for the assessment and analysis.\n       b. Report and Recommendations.--\n       1. In general.--Within 180 days after the date on which the \n     head of the Federal agency submits data and testing under \n     subsection a, each peer review panel shall transmit to the \n     head of the agency a report and recommendations on whether \n     the agency's risk assessment or cost-benefit analysis meets \n     the applicable standards and principles specified in this \n     Act.\n       2. Contents.--A report and recommendations under this \n     subsection shall either conclude that the agency's assessment \n     or analysis meets the applicable standards, or shall set out \n     its views on any significant deficiencies and its \n     recommendations on how those deficiencies should be \n     corrected.\n       3. Comments and appendix.--Each peer review report and \n     recommendations under this subsection shall include--\n       (A) all conclusions and recommendations supported by a \n     majority of the members of the peer review panel submitting \n     the report; and\n       (B) an appendix which sets forth the dissenting opinions \n     that any peer review panel member wants to express.\n       c. Openness of Process.--The proceedings of peer review \n     panels under this section shall be subject to the relevant \n     provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act 5 USC App. \n     (1988), PL 92-463.\n       (3) Consideration and Incorporation of Peer Review \n     Recommendations.\n       If a majority of a peer review panel established under this \n     subtitle concludes that a risk assessment or cost-benefit \n     analysis does not meet the applicable standards, the \n     assessment, analysis or proposed major rule shall not be \n     issued in final form unless the head of the agency either \n     revises the risk assessment to include the findings and \n     recommendations of the peer review panel and makes the \n     recommended revisions or explains clearly the scientific \n     basis for disagreeing with any of the panel's recommendations \n     and not revising the assessment.\n       (4) Matters Requiring Peer Review.--At a minimum, there \n     shall be submitted for peer review--\n       a. all major rules\n       b. all entries in the Integrated Risk Information System \n     (IRIS), and the Toxic Release Inventory.\n       c. any risk assessment which has been used as a scientific \n     rationale for regulatory actions by local or state \n     governments.\n     SEC. 13. ADDITIONAL DEFINITION.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (11) Scientifically Objective and Unbiased.--The term \n     ``scientifically objective and unbiased'' means that the risk \n     assessment, risk characterization or communication have not \n     been significantly influenced by policy or value judgments or \n     preferences, and that it clearly and accurately relates its \n     descriptions and conclusions regarding risk (or absence of \n     risk) to data or knowledge, including negative data, that are \n     based on empirical observations, measurements, or testing \n     that meet generally accepted scientific standards, and are \n     substantially reproducible by similarly experienced \n     scientists analyzing the same data independently.\n\n     SEC. 14. TOXIC RELEASE INVENTORY (TRI).\n\n       (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of Chapter 116, of \n     Title 42, United States Code, the Administrator, \n     Environmental Protection Agency may by rule add a chemical to \n     the list described in Section 11023(c) only after the \n     Administrator makes a risk assessment determination that the \n     chemical causes significant adverse human health effects at \n     concentration levels that are reasonably likely to exist \n     beyond the facility site boundaries, the probability of \n     exposure and potential harm to local residents.\n       (2) a. In making the risk assessment determination, the \n     Administrator shall take into account the nature and \n     frequency of the releases, the actual concentration, and the \n     frequency of use of the chemical in general commerce.\n       b. The principles for risk assessment within this act \n     should be applied to future listings on the Toxic Release \n     Inventory.\n       (3) A chemical shall be deleted if the Administrator \n     determines no later than 60 days after the enactment of this \n     provision that based on the record there is insufficient \n     evidence to establish the criteria described in this section.\n       (4) A chemical shall be deleted if the Administration, \n     within 180 days of receipt of a petition described in Section \n     5, does not prepare a risk assessment as described in Section \n     5 which determines that the chemical causes significant \n     adverse human health effects at concentration levels that are \n     reasonably likely to exist beyond the facility site \n     boundaries, the probability of exposure and potential harm to \n     local residents.\n     SEC. 15. USE OF APPROVED RISK ASSESSMENTS.\n\n       The Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency shall \n     not conduct or perform, or require any person to conduct or \n     perform, as a condition for issuance of any permit, license, \n     or any other form of approval (or condition to operate), any \n     type of risk assessment that is not explicitly required as a \n     condition for the issuance of such a permit, license, or \n     approval by existing statutory or final regulatory \n     provisions. The Administrator, Environmental Protection \n     Agency shall not implement or enforce such a condition in any \n     way nor deny or condition a permit, license, or approval \n     based upon the results of such a risk assessment or the \n     failure to conduct or perform such a risk assessment.\n\n     SEC. 16. ``SEC 627. OF AMENDMENT 230--REGULATIONS; PLANS FOR \n                   ASSESSING NEW INFORMATION.''\n\n       Change paragraph (b)(1) to read:\n       Review of the risk assessment, risk characterization, or \n     risk communication for any major rule or issuance used by \n     states or local governments as a scientific basis for \n     regulatory action promulgated or prepared prior to enactment \n     or prior to issuance of a final regulatory requirement by \n     subsection (a) of this section shall be conducted by the head \n     of the agency on the written petition of a person showing a \n     reasonable likelihood that--\n       (A) the risk assessment is inconsistent with the principles \n     set forth in section 625 and 626;\n       [[Page S3430]] (B) the risk assessment produces \n     substantially different results;\n       (C) the risk assessment is inconsistent with a rule issued \n     under subsection (a);\n       (D) the risk assessment does not take into account material \n     significant new scientific data or scientific understanding.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for the purpose of \nsubmitting an amendment to the Department of Energy Risk Management Act \nwhich was referred to the Senate Committee on the Energy and Natural \nResources for consideration.\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment to the Department of \nEnergy Risk Management Act (S. 333), and ask unanimous consent that it \nbe printed in the Record.\n  First, let me say this is the year and this is the Congress that will \nestablish a genuine link between real risks, as defined by sound \nscience, and responsible public policy to address risk.\n  This will be done by including scientific data and an openness in the \nregulatory process. My solution is based on citizen involvement. So why \ndo we hear all of these distortions and exaggerations reporting that \nAmerica's health and safety will be placed in jeopardy and sacrificed. \nThese emotional and often irrational overstatements are just not true.\n  What is so threatening about requiring knowledgeable scientists, who \nare independent of the Government, to participate in a peer review of \nthe science? It makes sense to me to ensure that science-based rules \nare supported by scientist. But clearly, opponents of this provision \nbelieve that scientists are the problem. I find this curious. Peer \nreview will certify the Government's practices. It replaces an \nunchecked monopoly over risk assessment methodologies with \nparticipation of scientists from academia.\n  What is so threatening about requiring the science to be unbiased and \nobjective? I guess opponents of this legislation really want rules to \nhave a bias which supports their political agenda. Accurate science \nmust get in their way. How distressing. I said it last month on the \nSenate floor when S. 333 was introduced, but it is important to repeat \nthe thought. Maybe those who like the flawed status quo really can be \ncharacterized as backing regulations which indeed are cavalier and \narbitrary.\n  What is so threatening about requiring products listed on the Toxic \nRelease Inventory [TRI] to actually be dangerous or, for that matter, \neven toxic? Presently, chemicals are listed simply because they appear \nfrequently in the environment. In fact, many chemicals on the list are \nnot toxic. EPA knows they are not. EPA has let the TRI misrepresent the \ntoxicity of chemicals and permitted unnecessary anxiety within local \ncommunities. This is terrible public policy. Also, what is the problem \nin requiring a Federal agency to act promptly? To list or delist needs \na fixed public schedule. Maybe it is too much to ask an agency to be \nresponsive to American citizens.\n  What is so threatening about judicial review? Opponents complain that \nrisk assessments would not be constructed by the courts. OK. That is \nbetter than what America has now. Currently, risks are set by arrogant \nbureaucrats who are invisible and not accountable to the public. At \nleast in a court room risk decisions will be made in a public forum. \nThe American people hold their courts in high esteem, and perhaps \npublic participation is necessary to save risk assessment.\n  What is so threatening about emphasizing the need of State and \nmunicipal participation in setting priorities for addressing their \nhealth and safety risks? Providing a structured methodology for making \ndifficult budgetary choices regarding health and safety matters would \nbe helpful. Both the officials and the citizens can understand the \nrisks they face together. And jointly they will be involved in \nselecting the risks to address. Cost benefit provisions will be a \nuseful rational for public policy goal setting and in allocating \nfunding.\n  What is so threatening about preventing abuse through indirect risk \nassessments? In the words of EPA's own Science Advisory Board, indirect \nrisk\n assessment suffers from a general lack of measured input and very \nlittle validation of the models. By requiring that only approved risk \nassessments, we are saying that Federal agencies will only use \nassessments subjected to the rigors of this legislation. In fact, EPA \nhas no legal basis to proceed with indirect risk assessments. Does it \nmake scientific sense to let EPA hold permits and licenses hostage \nwithout the marketplace having its due process? Does it make sense for \nEPA to first demand and then use data which is short on scientific \nvalidation? Both are legally and scientifically reprehensible. We are a \nland governed by laws--not by bureaucrats who are not accountable to \nthe public. Besides, Federal agencies must not regulate by press \nrelease.\n\n  The cost-benefit provisions of this legislation are important to \nevaluate regulatory effectiveness. This is especially useful since \npublic funds are scare and finite. And, because governmental intrusion \ninto our private lives must be minimized to only genuine risk. But the \nsad truth is the Government's decisions and actions are rarely cost \neffective. In fact, I recently read an article where an EPA official \nsaid that regulatory ``efficiency is not of great importance.'' For \nhim, his colleagues and this administration it may not be; but to \nmillions of American taxpayers who pay the bills it is a big deal.\n  The importance of risk assessment and risk communication with public \nparticipation can not be underscored. This is especially true when we \nconsider that billions and billions of taxpayer dollars are spent \nannually by all levels of government to deal with risk.\n  I believe the public has lost confidence in the Government's science. \nI further believe this has hurt the credibility of existing \nenvironmental and health rules. Saving an owl which is endangered in \ntwo States by destroying 30,000 jobs; only to discover this bird is \nthriving in a number of other States is not good science--it is an \nagenda. Ruining an entire apple harvest with a rush to judge without \nscience on alar is not good science--it is regulatory abuse. Both \nillustrate a Government unchecked. That is what this legislation is \nabout--provide an opportunity to challenge the Government.\n  Nothing in this amendment or the basic bill is excessively \nprescriptive. On the contrary, my legislative purpose is to ensure \nconsistency and technical value\n when risk assessments are prepared. I firmly believe my legislative \nefforts will improve both the quality and visibility of risk \nassessment.\n\n  It is time to deal with scientific controversies surrounding the \nextrapolations of maximum tolerated dose to minuscule doses, animal to \nhuman etc. Many of the Government's regulatory actions will not stand \nup to public scrutiny--this is not the fault of this legislation. No, \nthis is an error caused by Government's arrogant false science. I am \nfor environmental, health and safety rules which address real problems, \nnot regulatory abuse supporting a nonscientific agenda.\n  Risk assessment is a powerful tool which has been abused for years by \na political agenda. No--it has been exploited. Both public confidence \nand public funds have been squandered chasing nonscientific solutions \nand nonrisks. Now is the time to transform our environmental and health \npolicies with accountable scientific judgment.\n  Risk assessment reforms will help settle environmental and health \ndecisions with science and technology, not with a political agenda. It \nwill not eliminate controversies but it will open up the process to \npublic participation. It will not end environmental laws, as we now \nknow them. What it will do is make sure that the right information is \non the table in the right form and at the right times to best \nincorporate both economic and ecological consequences in the decision \nmaking process.\n  My approach, through the basic bill (S.333) and with this amendment, \nis to demand rigorous, consistent and continuous inclusion of the \npublic in the development of health and safety public policy. Using a \ndeliberative and transparent process has merits which exceed all the \ncomplaints I have heard from opponents who say it would create burdens.\n  My approach will strengthen our public policies, not destroy them. \nAll I am mandating is sound science. I am not mandating bureaucratic \nburdens. If sound science principles are followed there will be no \nhassles or problems. \n[[Page S3431]] However, I am not terribly sympathetic for a Federal \nagency which misbehaved and manipulated the public trust. They have \nplaced burdens and expenses on Americans through false risks and \nunnecessary anxiety. This type of regulatory zeal must be stopped.\n  Plain and simple; this legislation will identify the underlying \nscientific assumptions used in the risk assessments so that all \nconcerned parties can evaluate the judgments and conclusions. This \nprocess allows for full and open public debate which will neither \nthreaten our democracy nor the health and safety of the American public \nwho we all serve.\n  Opponents want to dismiss any risk assessment legislation as a form \nof technospeak to justify the destruction of the environment and health \nrules. But this ``sky-is-falling'' complaint strategy is spurious and \ndisingenuous. This legislation will not remove one environmental or \nsafety rule. It will, however, require the assumptions, methodologies \nand extrapolations to be part of the public record. Only if science \nsupports different conclusions can the foundation for the rules be \nchallenged.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at S.333, the basic legislation which \nwas introduced by Senators Murkowski and Johnston last month and this \namendment. Both focus on removing risk misinformation and restoring \npublic confidence in our rulemaking process. I believe it deserves your \nsupport.\n  It is time to get past partisan bickering and exaggerations.\n  It is time to end the false debate on the value of risk assessment \nand cost benefit analysis.\n  It is time to focus our health and safety policies with sound risk \nassessment methodologies.\n  It is time for Congress to act.\n  I thank my colleagues for their consideration.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3428-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n                     Committee on Veterans' Affairs\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

Mr. President, what is it about F-22 electronic \ncombat effectiveness testing that terrifies Air Force?\n  The fiscal year 1995 Senate Defense Appropriations Report 103-321 \nincluded the following language:\n\n       The Committee is concerned that the F-22 test and \n     evaluation master plan [TEMP] may not include sufficient \n     electronic combat effectiveness testing before the onset of \n     production. The Committee believes that it is important for \n     the F-22 to demonstrate its capabilities in an offensive air \n     superiority mission against a full array of likely threats. \n     Those threats should include a modern integration air defense \n     system, at a minimum on a simulated basis to the extent \n     practicable, affordable, and cost effective.\n       Therefore, the Committee directs that no more than 65 \n     percent of the funds provided for the F-22 program for fiscal \n     year 1995 may be obligated until the Assistant Secretary of \n     the Air Force (acquisition) submits to the congressional \n     defense committees a report outlining the cost and schedule \n     impacts on the F-22 program, and the technical and \n     operational advantages and disadvantages, of revising the \n     TEMP to include significantly more thorough electronic combat \n     effectiveness testing before initiation of: (1) pre-\n     production vehicle procurement; (2) commitment to low-rate \n     initial operational test and evaluation.\n       This report shall include, as a baseline, thorough \n     electronic combat testing at the real-time electromagnetic \n     digitally controlled analyzer and processor [REDCAP] and the \n     Air Force electronic warfare evaluation simulator [AFEWES], \n     and an installed system test facility with a capable wide-\n     spectrum radio frequency generator that is interfaced for \n     real-time control from remote facilities and a high \n     capability dome, visual system cockpit simulator.\n       The report also shall identify the funding required between \n     fiscal years 1996-99 to allow the electronic combat test \n     facilities cited in the preceding paragraph to thoroughly \n     undertake effectiveness testing on integrated avionics \n     suites.\n\n  This report requirement was retained in Conference, though, as a \ncourtesy of the House colleagues, the fence was dropped.\n  Well, March 1, 1995 has come and gone, but no report; however, there \nhas been an interesting development. On February 28, 1995, the Air \nForce base closure and realignment recommendations were made public. \nThe Air Force operates 10 major test and evaluation [T] facilities \nwith a combined budget in fiscal year 1995 of $1.722 billion. Not one \nwas recommended for closure; but two very small T facilities with a \ncombined fiscal year 1995 budget of less than $20 million were \nrecommended for closure: the Real-time Electromagnetic Digitally-\nControlled Analyzer and Processor [REDCAP] and the Air Force Electronic \nWarfare Evaluation Simulator [AFEWES], the very facilities where \nCongress directed the Air Force to consider conducting F-22 electronic \ncombat effectiveness testing. What is the Air Force afraid of?\n  The one facility mentioned in the Senate report that was not closed, \nthe installation system test facility, belongs to the Navy. Apparently, \nthe Air Force could not get at it.\n  The most perplexing thing about the aversion of the Air Force to \nproper testing of the F-22 is that the B-2 program is about to \nundertake tests at the REDCAP very similar to those being avoided by \nthe F-22. The B-2 test program has been thorough to the point of \nexhaustive. Is the B-2 successful because it was thoroughly tested, or \nwas it successful so it is being thoroughly tested? Either way, what \nlesson can we draw about the F-22?\n  When our needs are so many, and money so short, Congress can ill-\nafford to buy a pig in a poke. Congress gave the Air Force the \nopportunity to prove its claims regarding the F-22. The Air Force \nresponded by trying to eliminate the facilities that could have \nrendered a judgment on the effectiveness of the F-22, Obviously, the \nAir Force has something to hide. If they will not test it, we will not \nbuy it. Come budget \n[[Page S3432]] time, I will lead the fight to strike F-22 \nfunds.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3431-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support Senate \nResolution 79, the resolution designating March 25, 1995, as Greek \nIndependence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American \nDemocracy. The resolution also asks the President to issue a \nproclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe \nthe designated day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  March 25, 1995, marks the 174th anniversary of the beginning of the \nrevolution which freed the Greek people from the Ottoman Empire. It is \nfitting that we celebrate this day together with Greece in order to \nreaffirm the common democratic heritage of Americans and Greeks.\n  The ancient Greeks forged the very notion of democracy, placing the \nultimate power to govern in the people. As Aristotle said, ``If liberty \nand equality, as is thought by some, are chiefly to be found in \ndemocracy, they will best be attained when all persons alike share in \nthe government to the utmost.''\n  Because the concept of democracy was born in the age of the ancient \nGreeks, all Americans, whether or not of Greek ancestry, are kinsmen of \na kind to the ancient Greeks. America's Founding Fathers drew heavily \nupon the political and philosophical experience of ancient Greece in \nforming our Government. For that contribution alone, we owe a heavy \ndebt to the Greeks.\n  The common heritage which we share has forged a close bond between \nGreece and the United States, and between our peoples. And it is \nreflected in the numerous contributions made by present-day Greek-\nAmericans in New Jersey and across the country to our American culture.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution as a tribute to these \ncontributions, past and present, which have greatly enriched American \nlife.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3432-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO TOM AND GANIA TROTTER\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute \ntoday to two eminent Alaskans, Tom and Gania Trotter, on the occasion \nof their retirement after many years of dedicated service to higher \neducation in America, but most recently in their roles as president and \nassociate to the president for development at Alaska Pacific \nUniversity.\n  F. Thomas Trotter is a native of Los Angeles, CA. After serving in \nthe U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II, he attended Occidental College \nand received his Ph.D. from Boston University. He served in numerous \nministerial and faculty roles, and was elected to be the first dean of \nthe School of Theology at Claremont College. In 1973, Dr. Trotter \nbecame general secretary of the Board of Higher Education and Ministry \nof the United Methodist Church. In this post, he gave oversight to 128 \ncolleges and universities related to the denomination. During his \nadministration, significant international programs were established \nincluding a United States-Japan consortium and the establishment of a \nnew university in Zimbabwe. He has been the director of several \nbusinesses, including the Third National Bank of Nashville, is the \nrecipient of 10 honorary degrees, and is a trustee of Dillard \nUniversity. Dr. Trotter is the author of ``Jesus and The Historian'' \nand ``Loving God With One's Mind.''\n  Gania Demaree Trotter, a native of Anaheim, CA, is also a graduate of \nOccidental College and received an M.A. in Student Personnel \nAdministration from Columbia University. A gifted musician, Mrs. \nTrotter was a choral director in California schools and churches and a \nmember of the Robert Shaw Collegiate Chorale. She was director of \ndevelopment for the Blair School of Music of Vanderbilt University and \nis an experienced higher education administrator.\n  Dr. Trotter began his service to Alaska Pacific University as a \ntrustee in 1974, and in 1987, he was selected as its eighth president. \nHe worked diligently to improve curriculum design and financial growth. \nHe introduced new undergraduate and graduate programs and thawed the \nice curtain when he forged an agreement between APU and Far Eastern \nUniversity in Vladivostok, Russia. The Carr Gottstein academic \nbuilding, which has been a wonderful addition to the campus, was \ndesigned and constructed under President Trotter's careful oversight. \nDuring his tenure, Alaska Pacific University has been recognized in \nseveral national publications for its academic excellence.\n  Gania Trotter has supported the university and its mission with \nenergy and grace both in development and community awareness. She has \ncultivated important relationships which will benefit the university \nand its students for many years to come. Mrs. Trotter has further \ndistinguished herself in Alaska through her creative enthusiasm and \ncivic involvement, most notably in the symphony, opera, and Catholic \nsocial services.\n  Tonight in Anchorage, several hundred friends and colleagues will \ngather to honor Tom and Gania for their years of selfless dedication to \nthe education of Americans, a gift that will last for generations. I \njoin many others in offering my sincere gratitude and best wishes to \nboth of them.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3432-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3432-S3435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       LINCOLN, LABOR AND THE BLACK MILITARY: THE LEGACY PROVIDED\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, William B. Gould IV--the \nChairman of the National Labor Relations Board [NLRB]--celebrates the \nend of the first year of his first term today.\n  Mr. Gould recently delivered a speech entitled, ``Lincoln, Labor, and \nthe Black Military: The Legacy Provided,'' that makes an important \ncontribution to the celebration of Black History Month. This speech \nanalyzes President Abraham Lincoln's legacy on the development of \ndemocratic institutions and the protection of human rights in the \nUnited States. More specifically, this speech highlights the Great \nEmancipator's views on labor and the right to strike which were founded \non the belief that ``All people could improve themselves and thus arise \nout of their station if opportunity were afforded them.''\n  Our Nation held its first, officially recognized, Black History Month \nin 1976. In reality, of course, the event dates back to 1926, when \nCarter G. Woodson, the noted historian and author, selected February to \nhonor the achievement of black Americans because it was the month in \nwhich both Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass were born.\n  There are still some who would simply like to forget the ugly history \nthat surrounds race relations in this country, and who question the \nneed for a month set aside to reflect on the accomplishments of \nAfrican-Americans. But for me, each year the month of February provides \nme with an occasion to look back and survey the triumphs of African-\nAmericans, often against overwhelming odds. It gives me a chance to \ngive thanks to those who have gone before me, and who paved the way for \nme. And, more importantly, it provides me with the opportunity to \nreflect not only on how far we have come, but also on how far, in many \nrespects, we still have to go.\n  Having spoken in favor of his nomination on the Senate floor 1 year \nago today, I am pleased to see that Mr. Gould--the first African-\nAmerican chairman of the National Labor Relations Board--also \nrecognizes the importance of celebrating President Lincoln's birthday \nand Black History Month.\n  I am also encouraged by the fact that Mr. Gould continues to reaffirm \nhis commitment to promoting ``The right of employees to band together \nfor the purpose of protecting or improving their own working \nconditions, to join unions, to engage in collective bargaining, and to \nbe free from various forms of discrimination.''\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks by urging my \ncolleagues to read Mr. Gould's speech and by wishing Mr. Gould all the \nbest as he continues to serve his country as chairman of the National \nLabor Relations Board.\n  I ask that the text of Mr. Gould's speech be printed in the Record.\n  The speech follows:\n\n[[Page S3433]]\n\n       Lincoln, Labor and the Black Military: The Legacy Provided\n\n       I heard the glad tidings that the Stars and Stripes have \n     been planted over the Capitol of the Confederacy by the \n     invincible Grant. While we honor the living soldiers who have \n     done so much we must not forget to whisper for fear of \n     disturbing the glorious sleep of the men who have fallen. \n     Martyrs to the cause of Right and Equality.--Diary of William \n     B. Gould, April 15, 1865\n       These are the words of my great-grandfather written 130 \n     years ago at the time of Appomattox. They reflect the \n     thoughts and passion of one of our country's black naval \n     veterans of the Civil War and his commitment to the military \n     initiatives waged by President Lincoln.\n       It is meet and right that we come here this evening to \n     honor the memory of Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth President \n     of the United States, properly known throughout the world as \n     the Great Emancipator. The New World's central political and \n     social achievements, the Emancipation Proclamation which \n     President Lincoln authored, transcends the ages and future \n     generations. And his ideas about democracy and the rights of \n     all people constitute the central vision of the American \n     democratic system today.\n       As the sons of Union officers who fought in the Civil War, \n     you know better than most that this 186th anniversary of \n     Lincoln's birthday marks anew the ongoing struggle to free \n     our country from the legacy of the odious institution of \n     slavery so that all people may live out their lives and \n     fulfill their aspirations without the actuality or fear of \n     arbitrary limitation.\n       One of my law professors used to say that the ``greatest \n     constitutional decision ever rendered occurred when Pickett's \n     charge failed at Gettysburg.'' The legacy of Appomattox and \n     all that led to its resonates throughout our society to this \n     evening here in Washington as part of the unceasing struggle \n     against all arbitrary barriers which afflict mankind.\n       And both Gettysburg and Appomattox produced the great Civil \n     War amendments to the Constitution, which reversed the \n     infamous Dred Scott decision in which the Supreme Court \n     declared blacks to be property constitutionally. The \n     amendments, in turn, have provided our country with the \n     historical framework for both the Supreme Court's great Brown \n     v. Board of Education, 1954 ruling condemning separate but \n     equal as a denial of equal protection and also the modern \n     civil rights movement as well as the legislation that it \n     produced. Similarly, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964, our most comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation \n     relating to the workplace, is a lineal descendant of the \n     previous century's developments.\n       I am not a Lincoln or Civil War scholar. Indeed, I find the \n     amount of literature about both subjects to be daunting--and, \n     accordingly, I know that you do not expect a scholarly \n     examination of President Lincoln from me. But there are \n     matters which have and do involve me both practically and \n     professionally with Lincoln and his times.\n       The first is that I am the fourteenth Chairman of the \n     National Labor Relations Board and, as such, administer an \n     agency and interpret a statute which both seek to implement \n     some of Lincoln's most basic views on labor.\n       The second is that I am the great-grandson of the first \n     William Benjamin Gould who, along with seven other \n     ``contraband'' (seized property--the appellation which \n     General Benjamin Butler gave to escaped slaves) set sail in a \n     small boat from Cape Fear, North Carolina and boarded the USS \n     Cambridge on September 22, 1862, the day that President \n     Lincoln announced his intent to issue the Emancipation \n     Proclamation. You will know that the Proclamation states in \n     relevant part:\n       ``And I further declare and make known, that such persons \n     of suitable condition [the freed slaves held by those in \n     rebellion], will be received into the armed service of the \n     United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and \n     other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said \n     service.''\n       And thus it was that William B. Gould joined the United \n     States Navy and served as landsman and steward on the North \n     Atlantic Blockade and subsequently served on vessels visiting \n     Britain, France, Belgium, Portugal and Spain, chasing the \n     Confederate ships which were built by their undercover \n     allies.\n       In 1864 the American Minister Charles Francis Adams had \n     notified the British government that if the Alabama and the \n     Georgia--two iron clad ``rams'' built by the British for the \n     Confederacy--were allowed to go to sea, this would be \n     construed by the United States as a declaration of war. \n     William B. Gould sailed with the steam frigate Niagara for \n     the European station to join other vessels such as the \n     Kearsarge to keep, in my great-grandfather's words, a ``sharp \n     lookout'' for these vessels. The Niagara's destination was \n     the Bay of Biscay where she eventually engaged in battle.\n       William B. Gould's service ended on September 29, 1865 when \n     he made the following entry in his diary:\n       ``At the Navy Yard [Charlestown, Massachusetts] at five \n     Oclock I received my Discharge being three years and nine \n     days in the service of Uncle Samuel and glad am I to receive \n     it . . . [pay] of four hundred and twenty four dollars. So \n     end my service in the Navy of the United States of America.''\n       I did not know the first William B. Gould for he died--in \n     Dedham, Massachusetts where he resided from 1871 onward--\n     thirteen years before my birth. I did not know my \n     grandfather, William B. Gould, Jr., a Spanish-American War \n     veteran, for he was to die nine years later in 1932. But the \n     third William B. Gould was my greatest inspiration in my most \n     formative years--and my belief is that the values and culture \n     which he attempted to\n      transmit to me where very much a part of the lives of the \n     first two gentlemen to whom I have referred.\n       Truly then, President Lincoln's views and policies have had \n     a major impact upon my own life.\n       As Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board, I have a \n     responsibility to implement a statute which promotes the \n     right of employees to band together for the purpose of \n     protecting or improving their own working conditions, to join \n     unions, to engage in collective bargaining and to be free \n     from various forms of discrimination. This statute, enacted \n     as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal in \n     1935, is one of the country's proudest achievements, \n     expressing the policy that the protection of ``the exercise \n     by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, \n     and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for \n     the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their \n     employment or other mutual aid or protection'' should be \n     encouraged.\n       In recent years, a number of scholars and critics, like \n     myself, took note of the fact that the statute has not been \n     working well in implementing these objectives because of poor \n     administrative processes and ineffective remedies. Some of \n     these matters can be and are being cured by us at the Board \n     and some can be only addressed by Congress. I hope to do what \n     I can to make continued progress in the former category \n     before I depart from Washington and return to California a \n     few years down the road when my term ends.\n       I enthusiastically support the views contained in the \n     preamble and have made my position known in books, articles, \n     and speeches. In many respects, the fundamentally similar \n     views of President Lincoln were a precursor of our own 1935 \n     legislation.\n       Recall what Lincoln said to the New York Workingmen's \n     Democratic Republican Association on March 21, 1864:\n       ``The strongest bond of human sympathy, outside of the \n     family relation, should be one uniting all working people, of \n     all nations, and tongues and kindreds.''\\1\\\n     Footnotes at the end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       As the Presidential campaign of 1860 unfolded, Lincoln \n     stated his philosophy in these terms:\n       ``When one starts poor, as most do in the race of life, \n     free society is such that he knows he can better his \n     condition; he knows that there is no fixed condition of labor \n     for his while life . . . I want every man to have the \n     chance--and I believe a black man is entitle to it--in which \n     he can better his condition--when he may look forward and \n     hope to be a hired laborer this year and the next, work for \n     himself afterward, and finally to hire men to work for him! \n     That is the true system.''\\2\\\n       In the same speech, Lincoln makes clear that the right to \n     strike is integral to a democratic society, a policy \n     reflected in the language of Sections 7 and 13 of the \n     National Labor Relations Act and in the Norris-LaGuardia Act \n     of 1932 which preceded it. Just a few weeks ago, President \n     Clinton took note of one of our law's limitations in his \n     statement criticizing the Bridgestone/Firestone Company's use \n     of permanent striker replacements, noting that such tactics \n     show the need to enact legislation prohibiting such a denial \n     of the fundamental right to strike.\n       It bears note that Lincoln's view of labor and the right to \n     strike ran against the tide of laissez-faire thinking which \n     predominated in the previous century--thinking which has \n     reared its head again toward the close of this century, one \n     of its forms being the repressive striker replacement weapon \n     of which President Clinton spoke. President Lincoln supported \n     the right to strike and spoke out in the spring of 1860 in \n     support of a well-organized strike conducted by the boot and \n     shoe workers in New England. Lincoln regarded the right to \n     strike by free labor as a ``virtue, not a failing, of free \n     society,'' as G.S. Boritt has written in Lincoln and the \n     Economics of the American Dream.\\3\\\n       Boritt also notes that during the Civil War several \n     delegations of strikers from the Machinists and Blacksmiths \n     Union of New York visited the White House and spoke to the \n     President about their position. States Boritt:\n       ``The labor representatives took great comfort from their \n     interview, reasoning that although their employers refused to \n     deal with them, Lincoln received them. `If any man should \n     again say that combinations of working men are not good,' \n     they concluded, `let them point to the Chief Magistrate.' \n     They even quoted the President as saying `I know that in \n     almost every case of strikes, the men have just cause for \n     complaint.' It is rather likely that the union men quoted \n     Lincoln correctly.''\\4\\\n       Of course, Lincoln's view of labor was closely related to \n     his view of slavery. Again, in 1860 he said: ```Owned labor' \n     would compete with free labor so as to `degrade' the \n     latter.'' And, in an earlier and lengthy speech to the \n     Wisconsin State Agricultural Society in Milwaukee on \n     September 30, 1859, \n     [[Page S3434]] he noted that the so-called ``mud-sill'' \n     theory was that a hired laborer is ``fatally fixed in that \n     condition for life'' and thus his condition is the same as \n     that of a slave.\\5\\\n       But as Lincoln noted, this theory proceeded upon the \n     assumption that labor and education were incompatible and \n     that one could not improve oneself and one's family through \n     free labor. Lincoln's view was antithetical to all of this. \n     He held the view that workers should be able to rise to new \n     horizons.\n       And this view is closely related to another held by the \n     President which has similar contemporary implications. \n     Because Lincoln believed that all people could improve \n     themselves and thus rise out of their station if opportunity \n     were afforded them, unlike other proponents of the rights of \n     labor, he did see the working class as a well-defined unit, \n     notwithstanding his endorsement of its use of the strike to \n     defend its interests and act jointly in its dealings with \n     employers. To some extent, said Professor Boritt, Lincoln \n     shared the view that there was a harmony between the capital \n     and labor and that it ought to be promoted so as to enhance \n     the ability of workers to rise out of their class.\n       Again, these views resonate with us today as Congress \n     considers proposals to enhance employee participation and \n     proposed amendments to the National Labor Relations Act which \n     will achieve this goal. I believe that President Lincoln \n     would be sympathetic with contemporary efforts to promote \n     employee involvement in the workplace and thus enhance our \n     industry's global competitiveness--so long as such reforms do \n     not interfere with the ability of the workers and unions to \n     defend their own positions, a proposition that I have long \n     advanced.\\6\\\n       The view that an individual was not ``fatally fixed'' in a \n     particular condition forever constitutes the philosophy which \n     prevailed in the Civil War and through the Emancipation \n     Proclamation and the enactment of the Thirteenth Amendment \n     which Lincoln sponsored before his assassination. Again, this \n     is reflected anew in last month's State of the Union address \n     by President Clinton when, in advocating new minimum wage \n     legislation, he said that the worker who works must have his \n     ``reward'' and that the job of government is to ``expand \n     opportunity . . . to empower people to make the most of their \n     own lives. . . .''\n       This is what is at the heart of modern democracy and the \n     Bill of Rights for workers in the private sector which are \n     contained in the National Labor Relations Act and similar \n     statutes. And this has been the assumption behind the \n     struggle for equality which has attempted to make good on the \n     promise of emancipation in the previous century.\n       My great-grandfather, a mason who worked with his mind and \n     hands and established a business as a contractor, employing \n     other workers in Dedham, Massachusetts, benefited from the \n     above-noted philosophy and the quoted portions of the \n     Emancipation Proclamation. Said William B. Gould on March 8, \n     1863, two months after its issuance:\n       ``Read . . . the Proclamation of Emancipation . . . verry \n     [sic] good.''\n       The policy, of course, had evolved in fits and starts. As \n     Benjamin Quarles has noted in ``The Negro in the Civil War,'' \n     General Butler was the first to devise a policy of acceptance \n     of blacks who wanted to fight with the North.\\7\\ This was, as \n     Quarles noted, the most ``insistent'' problem faced by the \n     Lincoln Administration in 1861 and 1862. It emerged, as he \n     has noted, after the Union defeat at Bull Run which was \n     attributable ``in part to the Confederate military defenses \n     constructed by slaves. . . .''\n       Congress enacted legislation which provided for the \n     forfeiture of all slaves whose masters had permitted them to \n     be used in the military or naval service of the Confederacy. \n     Quarles notes that the 1861 legislation ``strengthened the \n     hand of the small band of Union officers from the beginning \n     had been in favor of freeing the slaves.'' Two military \n     initiatives--one designed by John C. Fremont in July 1861, \n     ``The Pathfinder,'' and the other undertaken by Major General \n     Dave Hunter in the summer of 1862--were both rescinded by \n     Lincoln out of his concern with preserving the allegiance of \n     the border states.\n       The confiscation Act enacted on July 17, 1862, declaring \n     free all slaves who were owned by those in rebellion was the \n     next step in the process. This had the effect of increasing \n     the number of fugitives in whom the United States Navy \n     expressed a particular interest so as to make use of the \n     information that they could provide about enemy locations and \n     movements. As summer became fall the problem became more \n     ``insistent.''\n       Three days after my great-grandfather boarded the U.S.S. \n     Cambridge came this report of Commander G.H. Scott regarding \n     the blockade of Wilmington:\n       ``Fourteen contrabands have reached the `Monticello' and \n     `Penobscot' and several the `Cambridge' within a few days, \n     and as the vessels have not room for them, will you please \n     direct what disposition shall be made of them?''\n       We know what disposition was made of William B. Gould. On \n     October 3, 1862, he said:\n       ``All of us shipped today for three years, first taking the \n     Oath of Allegiance to the Government of Uncle Samuel.''\n       Thus, he, and eventually I, benefited from both the \n     Confiscation Act and the new policy expressed in the \n     Emancipation Proclamation which was not to be effective for \n     another three months. His service was made possible because \n     of it. This was then his opportunity--and his observations, \n     hopes and views are chronicled in the diary which he kept \n     between 1862 and 1865.\n       On the perils of the seas and their storminess, he says:\n       ``[T]he gale still blows fresh and the seas running very \n     [sic] high. We shipped several through the night and one--\n     fill'd the Ward Room with Water. I have got ducked awfully \n     last night. It was worth something to be upon the Deck. \n     Although there is much danger in a storm there is something \n     very sublime to hear the roar of the storm. The hissing of \n     the Waves, the whistling of the Rigging and the Cannon like \n     report of the torn sail and above all the stern word of the \n     commander and the--sound of the boatswain's pipe all adds to \n     the grandeur of the scene. For there is something grand in a \n     storm. Allnight with eager eyes both Officers and Men paced \n     the deck watching our Foretopsail, feeling in a measure \n     secure as long as we could sail at all. It has it stood \n     through the night. There was no sign of the storm abateing \n     [sic]. All the galley fire is out and nothing to eat is the \n     cry and almost nothing to wear on account of the Water. Shine \n     out fair sun and smote the Waves that we may proceed on our \n     course and all be saved.''\n       And on December 25 and December 27 of 1862, he had this to \n     say about the loneliness of his work off New Inlet:\n       ``This being Christmas I think of the table at home . . . \n     cruised around as usual. Fine weather but very lonesome in \n     the absence of news and we all had the Blues.''\n       While on the North Atlantic Blockade with the U.S.S. \n     Cambridge he says on November 17, 1862:\n       ``A sail was reported close under the land right ahead. We \n     gave chase. When within range of our boat we told them good \n     morning in the shape of a shot for her to heave to.''\n       But then he describes the difficulties that arose:\n       ``To this [the shot] they took no notice. We sent another \n     which fell under her stern . . . the ship stood for the \n     Beach. Shot after shot was set after her but they heeded not \n     . . . we immediately manned the first cutter and sent her . . \n     . to board and destroy her. We also sent two boats to lend \n     assistance . . . [after sending a line to these boats so that \n     they could return to the main ship] . . . they got the Boat \n     all ready to come out when a body of Rebel Soldiers dashed \n     over the hill at the double quick and all were prisoners. We \n     could see them from the ship marching off our men and \n     dragging the boats after them. We lost eleven men and three \n     officers. Rather a bad day's work.''\n       But the fortunes of war were not all negative as testified \n     to by him in this entry in the summer of 1864 off Portugal:\n       ``[W]e made a steamer and stood for her. She kept on her \n     course without any until we got within 5 miles of her when \n     she suddenly changed her course. We beat to Quarters and \n     Fired a shot. She showed the English collors [sic]. We Fired \n     another. When she came to be boarded her and found her to be \n     the Rebel Privateer `Georgia' from Liverpool on her way to \n     refit a cruiser. But the next cruise that she makes will be \n     for Uncle Samuel . . . this capture makes a crew feel verry \n     [sic] proud.''\n       While in the English Channel:\n       ``[W]e took on board an English Pilot who brought the \n     thrice glorious news of the sinking of the `Alabama' by \n     `Kearsarge' off Cherbough. . . . [A]lthough we have been \n     disappointment to us in not getting a shot at the `Alabama' \n     we are satisfied that she is out of the way.''\n       And in 1864 while serving on the Niagara he said about the \n     people that he saw in Spain:\n       ``[I]t looks very strange in this country which nature have \n     lavished with riches that there should be so many Poor \n     People.''\n       And again on the shameful treatment of black soldiers on \n     his ship:\n       ``Yesterday about 900 men of the Maryland (colored) \n     regiment came on board (they being transferred to the Navy) \n     and took dinner then departed for Portsmouth, New Hampshire. \n     They were treated very rough by the crew. They refused to let \n     them eat out of the mess pans and call them all kinds of \n     names. One man [had] his watch stolen from him by these \n     scoundrels. In all they were treated shamefully.''\n       On the proposed colonization of blacks to Africa or the \n     Caribbean:\n       ``We see by the papers that President [Johnson] intimates \n     colonization for the colored people of the United States. \n     This move of his must and shall be resisted. We were born \n     under the Flag of the union and never will we know no other. \n     My sentiment is the sentiment of the people of the \n     States.''\\8\\\n       All of this ended in 1865 and provided William B. Gould \n     with his chance at life. Sometimes I think about his thoughts \n     as he walked the streets of Wilmington a young man and what \n     would have been had he stayed in North Carolina and the \n     events of those four critical years had not taken place. Most \n     certainly his great-grandson would not be here today \n     addressing you as Chairman of the National Labor Relations \n     Board.\n       I am privileged to have this opportunity in 1995 to \n     contribute to the public good in the most inspirational and \n     progressive Administration in Washington since the 1960's--\n     one which is unabashedly committed to the principles of those \n     who fell 130 years ago.\n       My hope is that I can reflect well upon the first William \n     B. Gould and the chance that he made for me by rising out of \n     his ``fixed station,'' to use Lincoln's words, and I am all \n     [[Page S3435]] too aware of the limitations of time as we \n     move rapidly toward a new millennium.\n       As William B. Gould said on December 31, 1863, in New York \n     harbor:\n       ``We are obliged knock off on the account of the storm. It \n     blew very hard from South East. The old year of `1863' went \n     out furiously as if it was angry with all the world because \n     it had finished the time allotted to it. Sooner or later we \n     must follow.''\n       My first major impression during my first trip outside of \n     the United States in 1962, as a student at the London School \n     of Economics, is of the grand and majestic statute of \n     President Lincoln which sits in Parliament Square today. Now \n     I live in Washington within a mile of the great Lincoln \n     Memorial in which his brooding historical omnipresence is \n     made so manifest.\n       You and I, the entire nation and the world honor President \n     Lincoln and his policies tonight. Both personally and \n     professionally they are with me always as is the legacy \n     provided by him and so many others in what my great-\n     grandfather called:\n       ``[T]he holiest of all causes, Liberty and Union.\\9\\\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\Basler, Roy P., Editor, The Collected Works of Abraham \n     Lincoln, Volume VII, page 259, (1953)\n     \\2\\Ibid.

CATRON\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it should surprise none of her \nacquaintances that when Janie Catron retired from my office, her \nfarewell statement was motivational as well as emotional. For those of \nus who have known and worked with Janie for years, her parting words \nwere an affirmation of her remarkable drive and sense of purpose. For \nthose whose association with her is relatively recent, it was a \nmemorable primer on how to succeed through hard work.\n  Janie Catron was, officially, my eastern Kentucky field \nrepresentative from the beginning of my first term in the Senate until \nher retirement this winter. But her official title did not do justice \nto the work she did. Janie was not just my representative in eastern \nKentucky, she was the region's representative in my office. And she \nremains the staunchest advocate of that very special place. Anyone \nwithout a personal grounding in eastern Kentucky need only spend time \nwith Janie to know that the people and the area are extraordinary.\n  I will not soon forget our travels over Appalachian mountain roads, \nthe stunning vistas--notably unmarred by guardrails--framed by Janie's \nkeen insight and observations as we drove to meet with constituents. \nStaffers, present and former, will long treasure the tours she arranged \nand the hospitality she and her husband, Frank, provided at their home \nin Corbin.\n  Janie fostered much of the cohesiveness which has made our office \nmore than simply a collection of individuals. She has worked to instill \na sense of shared purpose, responsibility, and loyalty. In fact, \nloyalty was the thrust of her farewell statement. It is a quality she \nhas personified through deeds as well as words. It was never more \nevident than the day last November when she summoned the strength to \nspeak through grief and deliver a stirring eulogy in the Mansfield Room \nduring a memorial service for a member of our staff. In reflecting on \nthis aspect of Janie, one could substitute the term ``love'' for \nloyalty because it is so clearly evident in her actions and \nachievements. Loyalty to and love of nation, state, party, family, \nfriends and colleagues--a hallmark of Janie Catron and, if she has \nanything to say about it, qualities she will impart on others.\n  Born and reared in Pulaski County, KY Janie has stated that she was \nborn a Democrat but changed her registration upon marrying a \nRepublican. She has often said that she became a Republican by \nconvenience and remained one out of conviction. As anyone who knew her \nwould expect, however, Janie was not just a registered Republican--she \nwas an outspoken, unabashed, active big-``R'' Republican. This was \nrather bold in a State where, until recently, Republican were an \nendangered species.\n  Mr. President, on March 11, Janie Catron will be duly recognized when \nshe is inducted into the Fifth Congressional District Republican Hall \nof Fame. When she receives this honor at the Fifth District Lincoln Day \nDinner she will joining other notables such as the legendary Kentucky \nSenator John Sherman Cooper and Congressman Tim Lee Carter. It is a \ndistinction well-deserved.\n   I am honored to have been associated with Janie these many years. \nHer departure leaves a void in my office that probably never will be \nfilled because, by force of her personality and energy, Janie created a \nniche. I am confident that I speak for my entire office when I say we \nmiss her and wish her well in future endeavors.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3435-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO CHIEF RICHARD E. RILEY\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my respects \nto Chief Richard E. Riley who recently retired from the Morris County \nProsecutor's Office.\n  Chief Riley retired after a long career in public service. He began \nhis service in 1963 as a patrolman in the Dover Police Department. In \n1968, he was appointed as an investigator with the Morris County \nProsecutor's Office. In 1980, he was promoted to sergeant, and finally \nin 1990, he was appointed chief of investigations.\n  Throughout his long and distinguished career, Chief Riley was always \nknown as a scrupulous investigator and a man of great integrity. He was \nbest known for his work in the area of investigations, and received \nstatewide respect for his diligent work in investigating the 1992 \nmurder of Exxon executive Sidney Reso.\n  Chief Riley approached that very public investigation in the same way \nhe approached all his work--with care, with compassion, and with \nmeticulous concern for details.\n  Over the years, Chief Riley has been recognized repeatedly for his \nhard work and his tireless commitment to the safety of Morris County \nresidents.\n  In 1974, he received a Prosecutor's Citation for Armed Robbery \nInvestigation. In 1981, he received a Unit Command Citation for \nGambling Investigation. In 1982, he received a Prosecutor's Command \nCitation for Narcotics Investigation.\n  He has also been honored with a Good Conduct Award, a Chief's \nAchievement Award and a Distinguished Service Award. And in 1985, Chief \nRiley was named Officer of the Year.\n  Mr. President, the retirement of Chief Riley will leave a great void \nin the Morris County Prosecutor's Office. But I know that his legacy of \ninvestigative excellence will live on in the office and throughout \nMorris County for many years to come.\n  We in New Jersey are very proud to count among our midst men and \nwomen like Chief Riley, who are committed to public service, to public \nsafety and to the quality of life in our State.\n  I wish Chief Riley a very restful and exciting retirement, and I \npersonally thank him for all he has done for the people of New \nJersey.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3435-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3435-S3436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                MEMORIALIZING WILLIAM LEONARD BLOCKSTEIN\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to William \nLeonard Blockstein who died last week at age 69.\n  Bill was professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison \nfollowing a notable career there. Prior to his retirement in 1991, he \nwas the Edward Kremers professor of pharmacy in the School of Pharmacy, \nclinical professor of Preventive Medicine in the Medical School, and \nprofessor and director of the health sciences unit of university \nextension.\n  [[Page S3436]] Bill published over 400 papers on pharmacy education, \ncontinuing professional education, health planning, and consumer health \neducation, and edited or coedited 15 books. In 1985, he received the \nAmerican Pharmaceutical Association's Joseph P. Remington Medal, \npharmaceutical science's most prestigious award.\n  But as distinguished a scientist as he was, Bill was an even better \nhuman being.\n  As one of his colleagues from the University of Wisconsin noted, Bill \nwas a good friend to everyone. Marge Sutinen, the women he planned to \nmarry this July, said that Bill was one of the most charitable men in \nthe community, and indeed, his charity and friendship had no limits.\n  I had known Bill for years when I asked him to be the first senior \nintern in my Senate office, and he kindly consented. Though he did \nspend time advising me on health care issues--a subject on which he had \nconsiderable expertise--as many Members understand, working in a Senate \noffice, especially as an intern, does not always involve the most \nglamorous of work. Bill, a nationally recognized scientist and emeritus \nprofessor at the University of Wisconsin pitched in on every task, \ncheerily helping out younger staffers and interns with any and all \noffice chores.\n  Bill loved art, and was an avid supporter of the arts. He loved to \ntravel, and I understand he was planning to travel to Sweden and Great \nBritain later this year. He was active in Friendship Force, a group \nthat combined his altruism and desire for fellowship with that \nenthusiasm for travel.\n  He enjoyed being out with people, and especially loved to go dancing. \nHe found pleasure in the cloths he wore--often proudly sporting a new \ntie or shirt around the office to the delight of the rest of us.\n  Bill's obvious pleasure in these and other things was contagious. It \nwas simply not possible to be in the same room and not be infected by \nhis enthusiasm.\n  Bill suffered more than his share of personal tragedy, including the \ndeath of his wife Liesl, killed by a drunk driver in 1986. But \nthroughout that and other tragedies, Bill said that it was important to \ncelebrate life every day.\n  He did just that.\n  No one did a better job of living than Bill Blockstein. I shall miss \nhim a great deal.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3435-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF DR.

Rees, \nDeputy Assistant Secretary for Planning, Policy and Legislation at the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works, retired after a long and \ndistinguished career of Federal service.\n  Dr. Rees joined the Army Corps of Engineers in 1969 as a Civil \nEngineering Project Manager in the New England Division. From 1973 to \n1981, he served as the Chief of the Regulatory Branch in the New \nEngland Division. In 1981, Dr. Rees became the Chief of the Regulatory \nand Policy Section, Civil Works Directorate, Office of the Chief of \nEngineers. The following year, he was named Assistant for Regulatory \nPrograms in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Works. Dr. \nRees was promoted again in 1986 to the position of Deputy Assistant \nSecretary for Planning, Policy and Legislation.\n  Mr. President, as many in the Senate are aware, Dr. Rees played a \nmajor role for the Army in the passage of the landmark Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1986. I have worked with him on the passage of each \nWater Resources Development Act since then. Dr. Rees' career record \nreflects the professionalism and dedication found at the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers.\n  I want to commend him for his many valued contributions to the Army, \nthe Congress of the United States, and the Nation. On behalf of the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, I want to wish him the very \nbest in his future endeavors.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3436-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3436-S3437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      PREVENTIVE ACTION IN BURUNDI\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in the past few months, political \nviolence between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-dominated military has \nintensified in the small Central African nation of Burundi.\n  Extremist Tutsi gangs, seeking to destabilize the Hutu government, \nhave been carrying out dead city operations, where residents are \nordered to remain at home or shut down business, or risk violent \nattacks. Grenades are exploding in crowded city centers, including one \nwhich recently blew up a bus, and another which killed many civilians \nin a schoolyard. Scores of civilians have been murdered, and a Hutu \nprovincial Governor, Fidele Muhezi, was assassinated on January 26. The \nU.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says that over 60,000 people have \nfled to Tanzania, including 30,000 last week alone.\n  These are tragedies in any context. In Burundi, they bear eerie \nresemblances to what happened in neighboring Rwanda in April of last \nyear, which of course exploded in the bloodiest genocide ever recorded, \nin real time, on television. Given the close ties between the tribes in \nboth countries, events in Rwanda influence happenings in Burundi.\n  Like Rwanda, Burundi's population is roughly 85-percent Hutu and 15-\npercent Tutsi. Like Rwanda, there is a long history of Hutu-Tutsi \nviolence. Like Rwanda, the parties in Burundi have been pursuing peace \nthrough a power-sharing arrangement and democratic means. In Burundi, \nthe agreement brought elections in which a Hutu was chosen President, \nbut the Tutsis continued to dominate the military.\n  Already violence has erupted once since the peace process began when, \nin October 1993, President Melchoir Ndadaye was assassinated by Tutsis, \nand in retribution by both sides, up to 50,000 people were slaughtered. \nAlmost 10,000 more people have died in ethnic violence since then. The \ncurrent cycle of violence further threatens the peace plan. For \nexample, the Tutsi opposition party has called for the coup d'etat of \nthe Government. This recent spate of violence is a result of extremist \nTutsis, with little or no popular support, trying to seize power from \nHutus, which they cannot get through democratic means.\n  For months, observers have been warning that Burundi will go the \nroute of Rwanda if order and justice are not restored. Pierre Buyoya, \nthe former Tutsi military ruler who initiated the democratization \nprograms in Burundi, in fact, states in the Washington Post on February \n6 that ``Things are worse in Burundi than they were in Rwanda in \nApril.'' Scholars have documented that historically, violence in Rwanda \nhas foreshadowed violence in Burundi, and vice-versa.\n  A major reason this violence is so frightening is that many of the \nindividuals responsible for the assassination of President Ndadaye and \nthe subsequent killings have never been prosecuted. This impunity only \nreinforces the use of violence as a legitimate political tool, and \ncould effectively help extremists achieve their goals.\n  In an effort to help contain this mounting chaos and to build \ndemocracy in Burundi, the United States should request the U.N. \nSecurity Council to establish a judicial commission of experts. This \ncommission would assist the Burundi Government to investigate President \nNdadaye's assassination and the mass murders in 1993. Legal officers, \ninvestigators, and judges from countries with legal systems similar to \nBurundi's, such as Mali, could work in this commission. A strengthened \nBurundi judicial system would demonstrate that there is no impunity for \nsuch heinous political crimes. International assistance is needed to do \nit.\n  I want to applaud the administration for its high-level attention to \nthis problem. I commend President Clinton's personal plea on the Voice \nof America to the people of Burundi, urging them to ``say no to \nviolence and extremism'' and work toward peace. I am also pleased that \nNational Security Adviser Tony Lake and Secretary of State Warren \nChristopher have publicly expressed their concerns about Burundi and \ncalled for diplomatic intervention. These are calls which carry \nsignificant weight in Burundi, and if successful, will have contributed \nto prevention of a potentially horrible conflict. I want to make sure \nthat they will get public credit for their efforts.\n  [[Page S3437]] Given the histories and the lessons of the very recent \npast, the United States and the international community should be \nresponsive to calls for help when another Central African nation is on \nthe brink of disaster. We have offered rhetoric that early preventive \naction can save millions of lives and billions of dollars later. \nConflict resolution and preventive diplomacy is a new mantra in \ninternational relations. And it should be. Here is an opportunity to \nlisten to the warning signs and respond in some way.\n  If we do, Burundi may be able to stem the recent spate of violence \nand continue its move toward democracy. If we do not, then Burundi \nrisks becoming another Rwanda.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3436-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            SALUTING 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF FLORIDA STATEHOOD\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Will the leader yield?\n  Could he give any indication of what Monday might be?\n  Mr. DOLE. I may be able to do that in the morning.\n  Mr. FORD. All right, fine. There is some interest in that.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think it depends on what happens on the Paperwork \nReduction Act, and I will be able to make that announcement hopefully \nearly tomorrow so people, if we do not have votes Monday, can make \nplans.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the leader.\n\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/02/senate-section/article/S3437-4", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3438]]\n                     RECESS UNTIL 10 A.M.
