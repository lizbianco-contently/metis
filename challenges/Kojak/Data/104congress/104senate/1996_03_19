Under the time agreement on these \namendments, there is 1 hour now allocated to the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Coats]. The amendment is now before the Senate.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Last week, as we were looking at potential amendments for this \nlegislation, the issue of the potential discrimination that might exist \nregarding payments from the Federal Government to medical hospitals and \nto individual residents in training, loans, and other Federal \nassistance that is available for these individuals and these \ninstitutions, was threatened by potential loss of accreditation to \nthese institutions as a result of the Accrediting Council on Graduate \nMedical Education's change in their requirements for accreditation to \nmandate the training in abortion techniques.\n  Previously, this had been done on a voluntary basis. Many hospitals, \nfor a number of reasons, whether they are religious reasons, moral \nreasons or just purely decisions on the basis of the board of directors \nor governors of these institutions, determined that they would not have \na mandatory program of abortion training. Voluntary programs existed. \nThose who sought that training had access and could receive that \ntraining, but it was not mandated.\n  The change in regulations on the part of the Accrediting Council on \nGraduate Medical Education threatened to withdraw accreditation from \nmany of these institutions unless they opted out under a so-called \nconscience or moral clause. It was my feeling and the feeling of many \nthat this opt-out clause was not sufficient to address the concerns of \na number of institutions, particularly nonreligious-based institutions. \nSo I offered an amendment last week which was designed to clarify this.\n  That amendment essentially said that any State or local government \nthat receives financial assistance should not subject any health care \nentity to discrimination on the basis that the entity refused to \nundergo training in the performance of induced abortions or to require \nor provide such training to perform such abortions or provide referrals \nfor the training for such abortions.\n  We, in discussion with a number of other Senators, came across a \npossible misinterpretation of the exceptions to the section that \nbasically said that nothing in this amendment that I am offering should \nin any way restrict or impede the accrediting council from making that \naccreditation. The concern was, if I state it correctly, that we would \nlose a valuable means of examining the various programs that existed in \nhospitals and resident training programs for determination of whether \nor not the Government should participate. It is legitimate that we have \nan accrediting process on which we can rely. What I was trying to do \nwith my amendment was simply address the question of training for \ninduced abortions.\n\n  We had exceptions to that which basically stated that nothing in this \nact should prohibit the accrediting agency or a Federal, State, or \nlocal government from establishing standards of medical competency \napplicable to those individuals who voluntarily elected to perform \nabortions or prevent any health care entity from voluntarily electing \nto be trained or arrange for training in the performance of or \nreferrals for induced abortions.\n  We have had numerous discussions with the Senator from Maine relative \nto this language. Some negotiations over the weekend have resolved \nthis. It preserves the entire impact of the Coats amendment and yet \naddresses and clarifies the concerns of the Senator from Maine. So I am \npleased to announce this morning that we have reached agreement on this \namendment. The amendment will be cosponsored by the Senator from Maine. \nWe resolved the language differences. It also addresses an issue of \nsecond-degree, which would have prolonged the debate\n\n[[Page S2263]]\n\non this important broader bill, and so I am happy to report to my \ncolleagues that we will be able to free up some time on that basis for \ndiscussion of the amendment that is offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer.\n\n  The Senator from Maine is present this morning, and I know she has \nsome comments to make in this regard. Let me say this. The Senator from \nTennessee, Senator Frist, has been instrumental in helping us first \nunderstand the accrediting process and the importance of the \naccrediting process. As a medical doctor, he has some knowledge and \npersonal experience with this issue and these questions that I cannot \nbegin to bring to the debate. He and his staff have been immensely \nhelpful in helping us to draft this legislation so we can accomplish \nwhat we intended to accomplish, but also retain the integrity of the \naccrediting process.\n  I am very happy to yield to him. I will yield whatever time the \nSenator from Tennessee desires in order to speak to this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The chair did not hear the Senator \nseek to modify his amendment.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this is an appropriate time to ask \nunanimous-consent to modify my amendment. I send that modification to \nthe desk.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are no yeas and nays ordered, \nso the Chair is corrected. Since there is a time agreement, it takes \nunanimous consent.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will discuss this modification with the \nSenator from California and, hopefully, we can resolve the question \nhere. At the present time, I want to yield time to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  I will withhold the unanimous-consent request at this time so I can \ndiscuss it with the Senator from California.\n  I yield whatever time the Senator from Tennessee needs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Indiana for his \nthoughtful approach to this important issue. My colleague has proposed \nan amendment that will protect medical residents, individual \nphysicians, and medical training programs from abortion-related \ndiscrimination in the training and licensing of physicians. However, in \nour efforts to safeguard freedom of conscience, there are limits to \nwhat Congress should impose on private medical accrediting bodies. I \nbelieve this amendment stays within the confines of the governmental \nrole and addresses the matter of discrimination in a way that is \nacceptable to all parties.\n\n  This amendment states that the Federal Government, and any State that \nreceives Federal health financial assistance, may not discriminate \nagainst any medical resident, physician, or medical training program \nthat refuses to perform or undergo training and induced abortions, or \nto provide training or referrals for training in induced abortions.\n  Discrimination is defined to include withholding legal status or \nfailing to provide financial assistance, a service, or another benefit \nsimply because an unwilling health entity is required by certain \naccreditation standards to engage in training in or the performance of \ninduced abortions.\n  The primary concern that occurs when one addresses any accreditation \nissue is that quality of care will be sacrificed. As a physician, the \ncare of patients is my highest priority, and this amendment \nspecifically addresses this issue. It makes it clear that health \nentities would still have to go through the accreditation process, and \nthat their policy with regard to providing or training in induced \nabortion would not affect their Government-provided financial \nassistance, benefits, services, or legal status.\n  The Government would work with the accrediting agency to deem schools \naccredited that--and I quote from the amendment--``would have been \naccredited but for the Agency's reliance upon a standard that requires \nan entity to perform an induced abortion, or require, provide, or refer \nfor training in the performance of induced abortions or make \narrangements for such training.''\n  Mr. President, this amendment arose out of a controversy over \naccrediting standards for obstetrical and gynecological programs. The \nAccreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the ACGME, is a \nprivate body that establishes and enforces standards for the medical \ncommunity. As a physician, I deeply respect and appreciate the ACGME, \nand I understand the fundamental need for quality medical standards and \noversight.\n  Moreover, I feel strongly that the Federal Government should not \ndictate to the private sector how to run their programs. We must not \nusurp the private accreditation process. But, at the same time, \nCongress is responsible for the Federal funding that is tied to \naccreditation by the ACGME, and as public servants, we must ensure that \nthere is no hint of discrimination associated with the use of public \nfunds.\n\n  I am pleased, Mr. President, that we could work together to address \nthe legitimate concerns of both sides in crafting this amendment. I \njoin with the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from Maine in \nsupporting this amendment, which will prevent discrimination with \nrespect to abortion, but preserve the integrity of the accreditation \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak briefly with regard \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 44, a resolution which I and several \ncolleagues submitted last week, that would reauthorize the Specialty \nEquipment Market Association, in consultation with the Architect of the \nCapitol, to stage an event on the Capitol Grounds on May 15.\n  As a motor enthusiast, I believe it is important to recognize the \ncontributions the motor sports industry has made to improve the \nquality, performance and, more importantly, the safety of most all \nmotor vehicles on the road today. Certainly, the American public has \ndemonstrated a continuing love affair with motor vehicles since their \nintroduction over 100 years ago in this country, enjoying vehicles for \ntransportation and recreational endeavors, ranging from racing to show \ncompetitions, and as the way of creating individual expression that has \nbeen extremely popular in the last 100 years.\n  In addition, research and development connected with motor sports \ncompetition and specialty applications has provided consumers with such \nlife-saving safety mechanisms, including seatbelts, airbags, and many \nother important innovations.\n  As a result, the motor sports industry has grown tremendously over \nthe years, where today hundreds of thousands of amateur and \nprofessional participants enjoy motor sports competitions each and \nevery year throughout\n\n[[Page S2264]]\n\nthe United States, attracting attendance in excess of 14 million \npeople, making the motor sports industry one of the most widely \nattended of all U.S. sports.

Mr. President, earlier this morning I proposed a \nunanimous-consent request to modify the amendment which I had offered \nlast week, on Thursday, to the legislation that the Senate is currently \nconsidering. We have had some discussion with the Senator from \nCalifornia and others regarding this. I believe we have resolved \nconcerns relative to this modification, at least regarding offering the \nunanimous-consent request.\n  So I now repeat my unanimous-consent request to modify the pending \namendment to H.R. 3019.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3513), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, let me just state, during our discussion \nlast Thursday on this amendment, which I will describe in a moment, \nquestions were raised by the Senator from Maine relative to some \nlanguage and the interpretation of that language as it affected a \nportion of the bill providing for an exemption to the accreditation \nstandards based on a conscience or moral clause relative to performing \nabortion.\n  We have discussed that question over the weekend and made some \nclarifications in that language, which is the purpose of the \nmodification. The Senator from Maine spoke this morning and the Senator \nfrom Tennessee spoke, relative to the procedures of the Accrediting \nCouncil for Graduate Medical Education, its involvement in accrediting \nmedical providers and medical training programs, and support for the \nCoats amendment to this particular bill.\n  Let me describe that very briefly. The problem that we had here is \nthat, prior to 1996, the ACGME, which is the American Council on \nGraduate Medical Education, did not require hospitals or ob/gyn \nresidency programs to perform induced abortions or train to perform \ninduced abortions. That was done on a voluntary basis. Until 1996, \nhospitals were only required to train residents to manage medical and \nsurgical complications of pregnancy, that is those situations where \ntreatment of life-threatening conditions to the mother or complications \nof a spontaneous abortion, miscarriage, or stillbirth, was part of the \nmedical training.\n  At the same time, 43 States have had in place statutes, as well as \nthe Federal Government, to protect individual residents in hospitals \nfrom having to perform on a mandatory basis, or having to train on a \nmandatory basis, for the performance of induced abortions or abortion \non demand. These procedures generally apply regardless of the reason to \nrefuse to perform an abortion.\n\n  Then in 1996, the Accrediting Council on Graduate Medical Education \nchanged its standards, indicating that failure to provide training for \ninduced abortions could lead to loss of accreditation for these \nhospitals and for these training programs.\n  The reason this is important is that a great deal of Federal funding \nis tied to this accreditation. The Medicare reimbursement is tied to \naccreditation, loan deferral provisions are tied to accreditation, and \na number of other federally provided support for hospital providers and \nfor training programs for ob/gyn and others are tied to the \naccreditation. So, if the accreditation is removed, these institutions \ncould lose their Federal funds.\n  So the language that I offered in the bill that we offered to the \nSenate basically said that, one, we do not think it is right that the \nFederal Government could discriminate against hospitals or ob/gyn \nresidents simply because they choose, on a voluntary basis, not to \nperform abortions or receive abortion training, for whatever reason. \nFor some it would be religious reasons; for some it would be moral \nreasons; for some it could be practical reasons; for some hospitals it \ncould be economic reasons. There are a whole range of reasons why a \nprovider may choose not to engage in this mandatory practice.\n  But at the same time, we did not feel that it was proper for us to \nmandate to a private, although somewhat quasi-\n\n[[Page S2265]]\n\npublic, accrediting agency how they determine their accrediting \nstandards. We do not want to prevent ACGME from changing its standards. \nIt has every right, even though I do not agree with all of its \nrequirements, to set its own standards.\n  Second, we do not want to prevent those who voluntarily elect to \nperform abortions from doing so. Nobody is prevented in this \nlegislation from voluntarily receiving abortion training or from \nvoluntarily offering that training in their hospital, nor do we prevent \nthe Government from relying on those accreditation standards. I think \nyou can make a case that the Government, by relying on a quasi-public \nentity for accreditation, may be too narrowly restricting in scope in \nterms of determination on Federal reimbursement, but we are not \naddressing that issue.\n  So this legislation does not prevent the Government from relying on \nthe ACGME for accreditation. We do not prevent the Government from \nrequiring training of those who voluntarily elect to perform abortions.\n  What we do do is attempt to protect the civil rights of those who \nfeel that they do not want to participate in mandatory abortion \ntraining or performance of abortions. That is a civil right that I \nthink deserves to be provided and is provided in this legislation.\n  It is a fundamental civil right, as a matter of conscience, as a \nmatter of moral determination, as a matter of any other determination, \nas to whether or not this procedure, which is controversial to say the \nleast, ought to be mandated and whether that is a proper procedure for \nthose who then are forced to participate in programs in order to \nreceive reimbursement from the Federal Government for various forms of \nsupport. We do not believe that it is.\n  There was some question about the so-called conscience and morals \nclause that was included in the accrediting standards, but we had \ntestimony before our committee from a number of individuals who felt \nthat that exception language was unnecessarily restrictive for those \nwho felt, because they were a secular hospital or because they were \nresidents in a training program at a secular hospital, that conscience-\nclause exception would not protect them from the loss of accreditation \nor protect their basic civil rights.\n  I have just some examples of that. The University of Texas Medical \nBranch at Galveston wrote to us essentially saying, and I quote:\n\n       Those involved in resident education at the University of \n     Texas Medical Branch made a decision in the mid 1970's not to \n     teach elective abortion as part of our curriculum. This \n     decision was based, originally, on concerns other than moral \n     issues. We encountered two significant problems with our \n     Pregnancy Interruption Clinic, or PIC as it was known at the \n     time. First, the PIC was a money loser. Since there was no \n     reimbursement for elective abortions from either State funds \n     or Medicaid a great deal of expense of the PIC was \n     underwritten by faculty professional income. Faculty income \n     was used without regard to the moral concerns of individual \n     faculty members who generated the income. A second problem \n     was more significant and involved faculty, resident, and \n     staff morale. Individuals morally opposed to performing \n     elective abortions were not required to participate. This led \n     to a perception, by trainees performing abortions, that they \n     were carrying a heavier clinical load than trainees not \n     performing abortions. As fewer and fewer residents choose to \n     become involved in the PIC, this perceived maldistribution of \n     work became a significant morale issue. Morale problems also \n     spilled over to nursing and clerical personnel with strong \n     feelings about the PIC. It is a gross understatement to say \n     that elective abortion is intensely polarizing. Because of \n     bad feelings engendered by a program that was a financial \n     drain, the PIC was closed.\n\n  So here is a respected hospital, the University of Texas at \nGalveston, which basically said the moral, conscience reasons were not \nbasically the reasons why this particular hospital chose not to \nparticipate in the program.\n  They followed that up with a letter, which I will quote again. They \nsaid:\n\n       Because we are a secular institution, and a state supported \n     university, we would have no recourse under the new ACGME \n     ``conscious clause,'' except to provide such instruction to \n     our trainees. The ACGME ``conscious clause,'' providing an \n     opportunity to invoke a moral exemption to teaching elective \n     abortion, is restricted to institutions with moral or \n     religious prohibitions on abortion. It does nothing to \n     protect the faculty at State-run universities.\n\n  I have a similar letter from Mt. Sinai Hospital:\n\n       Your amendment is desperately needed to protect the rights \n     of faculty; students and residents who have no desire to \n     participate in abortion training but who do not work in \n     religious or public hospitals.\n       Since our institution would not, therefore, ``qualify\" as \n     one with a moral or legal objection--\n\n  Therefore, the moral and conscience clause would not protect them.\n  Albany Medical Center in New York offers the same, and the list could \ngo on and on.\n  So, essentially, what we are saying here is that the amendment that I \nam offering is clearly one which is designed to protect the basic civil \nrights of providers and medical students in training who elect, for \nwhatever reason, whether it is a moral or conscience reason or whether \nit is an economic, social or other reason, not to perform abortions.\n  We do not believe that it is proper for the Federal Government to \ndeny funds on the basis of lack of accreditation if that lack of \naccreditation is based on the decision of a provider or a program that \nthey do not want to participate in a mandatory training procedure for \ninduced abortions.\n  I am pleased we were able to work out language with the Senator from \nMaine, which addressed her concerns to make sure that we did not \nprohibit ACGME from accrediting or not accrediting, because there are \nother reasons why facilities might not deserve accreditation. Federal \nfunds certainly should not flow to those hospitals and to those \nprograms that do not meet up to basic medical standards that the \nGovernment requires for its reimbursement.\n  By the same token, we do not think that injecting a forced or \nmandatory induced abortion procedure on these institutions, for \nwhatever reason, is appropriate. That is the basis of the amendment. \nThe amendment has now been offered. It has the support of the Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  The Senator from Tennessee, Dr. Frist, spoke this morning. He \ncertainly knows more about these procedures and more about the medical \nconcerns than this Senator from Indiana. He has looked this bill over \nvery, very carefully and believes that the language incorporated in the \nCoats amendment is most appropriate, and he is supportive of that. I \nthink that is a solid endorsement from someone who clearly understands \nthe issue in great depth and understands the accrediting process, \nsupports that process, but believes there ought to be this exemption.\n  Mr. President, I have not yet asked for the yeas and nays on this. My \nunderstanding is that the vote will be ordered, along with other votes, \nafter 2 p.m. So I will now ask for the yeas and nays for this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere appears to be a sufficient second. There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Indiana has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wanted to clarify that. I know we lost some time here. \nSo I have 15 minutes remaining to discuss both amendments, is that \ncorrect, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I want to explain why it was that it took the Senate extra time to \nget to this point of debating these amendments. The modified amendment \ncame to the attention of my staff, in its final form, late last night. \nI was on a plane coming back from California, where I had a full \nschedule. When I returned at midnight, clearly, it was too late to \ncontact my colleagues, and, therefore, I needed some time to really \nread the amendment and understand its implications, because the \namendment, as modified, is of grave concern to me.\n  The longer I have to look at this amendment, the more concerned I am \nabout it. I would like to explain to my colleagues why. Before I do \nthat, I want to explain also that those in this\n\n[[Page S2266]]\n\ncommunity who support a woman's right to choose strongly oppose the \nCoats amendment. Those groups--who oppose this amendment are the \nWomen's Legal Defense Fund, the National Abortion Federation; the \nAmerican Association of University Women; the National Women's Law \nCenter; Planned Parenthood, and the National Abortion Reproductive \nRights Action League.\n  I think it is very, very clear why. It is because if you look at what \ncould happen as a result of the Coats amendment, you quickly come to \nthe conclusion, Mr. President, that theoretically --and we hope it \nwould not happen--but it is possible under this amendment that every \nsingle medical school in this country could stop teaching their \nresidents how to perform safe, legal abortions and still get Federal \nfunding.\n  I really do feel that is the intent because I know there are those in \nthis Senate, and I have great respect for them, who would like to \noutlaw a woman's right to choose. They cannot do it up front, so they \ntry to do it in every which way they can. This is just one more example \nlike they said, if the woman is in the military she cannot get a safe \nabortion in a military hospital. This is the kind of theory that you \nsee being practiced on the floor. I say to my friends, they have every \nright to do this. I respect their right to do it. But I strongly \ndisagree.\n  Under current circumstances, for a medical school with an ob/gyn \nResidency training program to get Federal funds they must teach their \nresidents how to perform safe, legal abortions unless the institution \nhas a religious or moral objection, called a conscience clause. I fully \nsupport that conscience clause. I do not believe that any institution \nthat has a religious or moral problem should have to teach their \nresidents how to perform safe, legal abortions. However, under this \nmodified amendment by Senator Coats, any institution can stop teaching \nabortion and still get the Federal funds even if they have no religious \nor moral objection.\n  For example, let us suppose the anti-choice community targets a \nparticular hospital or medical school and day after day stands outside \nthere protesting and demanding that they stop, and finally the \ninstitution throws up its hands and says, ``You know, it isn't worth \nit. We will still get our Federal funds. We'll just stop teaching how \nto perform safe, legal abortions.''\n  What does that mean? It seems to me that as long as abortion is legal \nin this country--and it is legal under Roe versus Wade, and it has been \nupheld to be legal by the Court--what we are doing here is very \ndangerous to women's lives, because if we do not have physicians who \nknow how to perform these safe abortions, we are going to go back to \nthe days of the back alley.\n  My friends, I have lived through those years, and no matter how many \npeople think you can outlaw a woman's right to choose, in essence, even \nwhen abortions were illegal in this country, they happened. They \nhappened in back alleys. They happened with hangers. Women bled to \ndeath and women died. We need doctors to know how to perform safe, \nlegal abortions. It is very, very important.\n  What if a woman is raped? What if she is a victim of incest, and she \nis in an emergency circumstance, and they cannot find a doctor who \nknows how to do a safe, legal abortion? That is the ultimate result of \nthis. That is why so many organizations who care about women, in my \nopinion, are opposing this amendment.\n  We need trained and competent people to take care of the women of \nthis country. If they have a religious or moral problem, I strongly \nsupport their right not to have to learn how to perform such an \nabortion. But if they have no conscience problem, if the institution \nhas no conscience problem, it is in the best interests of all of us \nthat we have doctors who are trained, competently, to perform surgical \nabortions until there is another way for a woman to exercise her right \nto choose that is safe.\n  I ask the Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes, 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask that the President advise me when I have 5 minutes \nremaining. I will retain those 5 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3508\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have an amendment that I ask for the \nyeas and nays on right now, if I might, dealing with the District of \nColumbia. I ask for the yeas and nays on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second. There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  (Mr. Coats assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. Boxer. I want to thank my colleague for allowing me to have an \nup-or-down vote. It is quite simple. Mr. President, in this country \ncalled America, there are 3,049 counties and 19,100 cities. It seems to \nme extraordinary that in this bill that is before us, there is only one \nentity that is singled out and only one entity that is told that it \ncannot use its locally raised funds to help a poor woman obtain an \nabortion.\n  We already have strict control on the use of Federal funds. No \nFederal Medicaid funds may be used by any city, county, State or entity \nfor abortion. But we have no stricture on what a local government can \ndo, except in this bill where we tell Washington, DC, they cannot use \ntheir own property taxes to help such a poor woman, they cannot use \nfines they collected to help such a poor woman. I think it is a rather \nsad situation.\n  I know my colleagues will get up here and say, ``We think we can tell \nWashington, DC, to do whatever we want it to do.'' If we want to do \nthat with Federal funds, that certainly is an argument, but not with \ntheir own locally raised funds.\n  So, Mr. President, what I simply do by my amendment, by adding the \nword ``Federal'' my amendment clarifies a point. My amendment \nguarantees that Washington, DC, will be treated as every other city and \nevery other county in this country. They may not use Federal funds--\nalthough, by the way, I object to that, but I know I do not have the \nvotes to overturn that situation--but I am hoping that we can get the \nvotes to stand up and say that local people can decide these matters on \ntheir own.\n  What always interests me in this Republican Congress is, we hear \nspeech after speech about ``Let the local people decide, let the States \ndecide. Why should Big Brother come into cities and localities and \nStates and decide for them?'' Yet, when it comes to this issue, somehow \nthis philosophy goes flying out the window and we are going to tell a \nlocal elected body how they should treat the poor women in their \ncommunity.\n  Now, a woman's right to choose is the law of the land. But if she is \ndestitute and she is in trouble, it is very hard for her to exercise \nthat legal right. And if the locality of Washington, DC, wants to help \nher, I do not think we should stop them.\n  Thank you, very much. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by my colleague from California, Senator Boxer. I am proud to \nbe a cosponsor of this measure and I urge all of my colleagues to do \nthe right thing and vote for our amendment.\n  Since 1980, Congress has prohibited the use of Federal funds \nappropriated to the District of Columbia for abortion services for low-\nincome women, with the exception for cases of rape, incest, and life \nendangerment.\n  From 1988 to 1993 Congress also prohibited the District from using \nits own locally raised revenues to provide abortion services to its \nresidents. I am pleased that for fiscal year 1994 and 1995 Congress \nvoted to lift the unfair restriction on the use of locally raised \nrevenues, and allow the District to decide how to spend its own locally \nraised moneys.\n  There is language in this bill that would coerce the District into \nreturning to the pre-1994 restrictions. This bill is a step backward, \nand we shouldn't allow it to pass. Congress does not restrict the use \nof dollars raised by the State of Washington or by New York, Texas, \nCalifornia or any other State--because Congress does not appropriate \nthose funds.\n  Why should our Nation's capital be the solitary exception? It \nshouldn't be the exception, Mr. President, and our amendment ensures \nthe District of Columbia will have the same rights as\n\n[[Page S2267]]\n\nevery locality--every county and city--to determine how to spend \nlocally-raised revenue.\n  I know why the District is being targeted in this way. And so does \nevery woman, and so should every American. This is just another of the \nmany attempts by some Members of Congress to chip away and take away a \nwoman's right to choose.\n  It sure is ironic. That in this Congress, where the mantra has been \n``States know best'' month after month, the majority party now wants to \nmicro manage DC's financial decisions.\n  Mr. President, restricting the ability of the District to determine \nhow it is going to spend its locally raised revenue is the ``Congress \nknows best'' approach at its worst. I find it so very hypocritical that \nvirtually every debate over the past year has touted local flexibility \nand vilified Washington, DC's presence in policy making.\n  We should allow the District the same right as all other localities--\nto choose how to use their locally raised revenue. We should not single \nout our Nation's capital. We should pass the Boxer amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator the time will be \ncharged to the Senator unless she asks unanimous consent that her \nremaining time be reserved.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I make a unanimous-consent request that my remaining time \nbe reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 6 seconds remaining, \nand that time will be reserved.\n  The quorum call will be charged to no one at this particular point.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition for a few \nmoments this morning to speak in morning business for a period not to \nexceed 5 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that I may be permitted to do \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized to speak up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before yielding the floor, I have been \nasked to take a limited leadership role here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2264-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROVIDING FOR THE EXCHANGE OF LANDS WITHIN ADMIRALTY ISLAND NATIONAL \n                                MONUMENT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

The bill \nis supported by the Forest Service and local environmental \norganizations.\n  Mr. President, let me explain the history of the Greens Creek Mine \nand this agreement. The Greens Creek Mine was located under the mining \nlaws while the area was still part of the general National Forest area. \nAs you may know, in 1980 the area became part of the Admiralty Island \nNational Monument through the enactment of the Alaska National Interest \nLands Conservation Act [ANILCA]. Because this mine had world-class \npotential, Congress made special provisions in the act to ensure that \nthe mine could go forward.\n  I was pleased to participate in the opening ceremonies of the Greens \nCreek Mine. The mine provided high-paying jobs to Juneau residents and \nsupported the local economy. Unfortunately, low metal prices caused the \ntemporary closure of the mine in April 1993. Kennecott worked \ndiligently to reorient its mining development plan to permit the mine \nto reopen. In fact, they recently announced plans to reopen the mine \nduring the next several months.\n  Mr. President, this land exchange is the combination is a 10-year \neffort by Kennecott to deal with one of the problems created by the \nspecial management regime in ANILCA. Although that regime permitted the \nperfection and patenting of certain claims, it did not provide an \nadequate time for exploration of all the area of mineral potential \nsurrounding the Greems Creek Mine.\n  Since Kennecott determined that it would be unable to fully explore \nall the areas of interest during the 5-year time period it was allowed \nto provide exploration under ANILCA, it has been searching for a way to \nexplore these areas.\n  They have engaged in a multiyear negotiation with the Forest Service \nto develop a land exchange which would permit access to the area in a \nmanner which is compatible with the monument designation provided by \nCongress in 1980.\n  In other words, the land exchange allows exploration under strict \nenvironmental regulations. The terms of the exchange require Kennecott \nto utilize its existing facilities to the maximum extend possible to \nensure minimal changes to the existing footprint.\n  Additionally, the development of any areas once explored would be \nunder the same management regime by which Kennecott developed the \nexisting Greens Creek Mine.\n  This land exchange also provides other major benefits to the \nGovernment, the community, and the environment.\n  At the end of mining, Kennecott will revert its existing patented \nclaims and any other claims which it holds on Admiralty Island to the \nFederal Government.\n  Kennecott will also fund the acquisition of over 1 million dollars' \nworth of inholdings in the Admiralty Island National Monument and other \nconservation system units in the Tongass.\n  Finally, the exchange improves the likelihood that 300 jobs will \nreturn to the Juneau area for many years to come.\n  Mr. President, the Greens Creek Land Exchange is good policy. I \ncongratulate Kennecott and the Forest Service for negotiating a fair \nagreement and urge the President to sign the bill as soon as possible.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be placed at \nthe appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (H.R. 1266) was considered and passed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I make the request of the clerk, who is \nasking me to do that on behalf of leadership, to discount any \npersonalized knowledge as to the complexities which we have ruled upon.\n  I have been asked to further make this request for unanimous consent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2267-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2267-S2268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AMENDING THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I understand the time is controlled. I \nyield myself 12 minutes from Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 5 minutes \nremaining. Senator Murray has 7\\1/2\\, and Senator Feinstein has 7\\1/2\\.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 3 minutes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3508\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, very briefly, there are two major \nproposals before the Senate this afternoon. One proposal prohibits the \nDistrict of Columbia from using locally raised funds to provide \nabortions for its residents. It allows the Congress of the United \nStates to undermine the constitutional rights of poor women and thus, \ntheir ability to receive an abortion.\n  We do not interfere with the disbursement of local funds in any of \nthe States because it is inappropriate to dictate State and local \npolicy in this area. It is equally inappropriate to impose the will of \nthe Federal Government on the District of Columbia. This is the long \narm of the Federal Government reaching in and dictating the health \nconditions for needy women in the District. Many of these women have \ndetermined that they must have an abortion but, because they are poor, \nthey need assistance from the District of Columbia. District of \nColumbia elected officials should have the ability to allocate funds to \nwomen in these circumstances.\n  Second, I reject the belief that the Senate should determine medical \nresidency training criteria as it pertains to issues regarding women. \nThis is the first real attempt to superimpose Congress' view on \nobstetric and gynecological medical training. Today, we are saying we \nwill not require that medical training institutions provide abortion \ntraining for ob/gyn residents. Tomorrow, we may be making policy and \nsetting standards in another area of medical training. Congress should \nleave the practice of medicine to the doctors. In this case, a highly \nrespected board is attempting to insure that we have the best-trained \nphysicians in the world. We have already acceded to a conscience clause \nthat protects religious and moral beliefs of institutions and \nresidents. Those individuals and institutions will not be required to \nparticipate in certain medical procedures that violate their conscience \nor their religious training. But to go beyond that by passing a law \nthat substitutes congressional and political opinion for medical \ndecisionmaking is wrong. Congress should not interfere with current \nACGME policy. It is an inappropriate use of our authority. It is bad \npolicy and it is bad medicine. We should reject this proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield whatever time remains.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield myself 1 minute just to say to the Senator from \nMassachusetts how grateful I am that he expressed his views on the \nfloor. This has been a very difficult morning because there was a \nmodified amendment which, unfortunately, I could not get to analyze \nuntil this morning. And the Senator is right. We already have a \nconscience clause. Any institution who has a moral or religious \nobjection to teaching abortion is covered under current law, and what \nthis would say is that any institution, even if they did not have a \nmoral or religious objection, would not have to teach residents how to \nperform safe, competent abortions so that our women are safe.\n  On the matter of Washington, DC, I wish to tell the Senator that \nthere are 3,049 counties, 19,100 cities, and every one of them has the \nright to spend their locally raised funds as they wish. To pick out one \nentity and reach the long arm of the Federal Government into it is \nreally unfair and goes against the supposed spirit of this Republican \nCongress. So I thank my friend very much.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her 1 minute.\n  Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 30 minutes \nallocated to her under the previous order.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3513, as Modified\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. I will consume as much time as I require. I thank the \nChair.\n  I rise today to join the distinguished Senator from Indiana in \noffering an amendment that I think will address many concerns. In fact, \nI am pleased to have the opportunity to clarify some of the \nmisinformation that has been expressed regarding this compromise \namendment.\n  No one can question whether or not it is appropriate to ensure \nquality care for women in America. No one can question that we need to \nmaintain accreditation standards for medical institutions across this \ncountry. The fact remains that this amendment on which I worked in \nconjunction with the Senator from Indiana does not allow Federal funds \nto go to an unaccredited institution because they fail to provide for \nabortion training.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. This amendment accomplishes \ntwo things. One, it does protect those institutions and those \nindividuals who do not want to get involved in the performance or \ntraining of abortion when it is contrary to their beliefs. Second, and \njust as important, it preserves the quality of health care that will be \nprovided to women because it protects the universally accepted \nstandards--there is only one set of standards--of the Accreditation \nCouncil for Graduate Medical Education that provides for quality \nstandards for ob-gyn programs. So this amendment would not only make \nsure that women have access to quality health care with the strictest \nof standards when it comes to quality and safety but it also will \nensure that they have access to physicians who specialize in women's \nhealth care.\n  I do not think anybody would disagree with the fact--and I am pro-\nchoice on this matter, but I do not think anybody would disagree with \nthe fact that an institution or an individual who does not want to \nperform an abortion should do so contrary to their beliefs. But at the \nsame time we have to make sure we preserve the accreditation standards \nthat are established by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical \nEducation, that provides for the standards for more than 7,400 medical \ninstitutions in America.\n\n[[Page S2269]]\n\n  We want to make sure we do not undo 50 State licensure boards with \nrespect to overturning or overriding this one set of accreditation \nstandards. That is what we were dealing with, and hence this compromise \nhere today, because whether we like it or not--and certainly I do not \nlike it--in the House of Representatives they have already passed \nlegislation that would allow Federal funds to go to an unaccredited \ninstitution. That is a fact, and that is unacceptable. That is why I \nworked with the Senator from Indiana to ensure that would not happen.\n  Contrary to what has been said here today, 88 percent of medical \ninstitutions in this country do not provide abortion training even \nthough it is implicitly required in the accreditation standards. So we \nare not broadening this issue to provide for an exodus from performing \nor participating in abortion training. Eighty-eight percent of the \ninstitutions currently do not provide it, even though there is a \nconscience clause.\n  So this legislation is saying we do not want what is going to happen \nin the House of Representatives with the accreditation standards being \ndismissed and abandoned. That is an issue and that is a reality. That \nis why I worked with the Senator from Indiana to ensure that we \npreserve the one set of standards in America that the Federal \nGovernment relies on for the purposes of Federal funding, that medical \nstudents rely on for the purposes of Federal funding, that physicians \nrely on in terms of judging standards, that patients and consumers and \nStates rely on in terms of determining their licensing procedures.\n  So the choice was not to address the reality of what is taking place \nin the House or making sure, more importantly, that the Senate was on \nrecord in opposition to that kind of language and developing a \ncompromise with the Senator from Indiana to ensure that we maintained \nthe accreditation standards for all medical institutions to advance the \nquality health care for women and at the same time to allow training \nfor abortion for those who want to participate in that training or for \nthe institutions who want to provide it. Because that is the way it is \ndone now. That is the status quo, and that is not changing.\n  I know consensus and compromise is not the norm anymore. I think it \nis important on this issue because abortion is a very divisive issue. \nNo one can challenge me on where I stand on this issue. But I think it \nis also important to make sure that we preserve quality health care for \nwomen in America. I do not want to see these accreditation standards \nundone, and that is what the legislation that was originally pending \nwould have done. The House language went much further than that. This \nis a compromise to preserve those standards. This is a compromise to \nensure that it does not jeopardize the 273 ob-gyn programs that \notherwise would have been affected if this compromise was not before \nus. That is the risk, and that is why I worked with the Senator from \nIndiana to ensure that would not happen.\n  It is inappropriate for this institution to be involved in the \naccreditation standards or curriculum, but that is not what we are \ndealing with here. It has already happened. I want to be able to go to \nconference to ensure that the House language is not adopted, and the \nbest way to do that is to ensure we can pass language that everybody \ncould agree on, that represents a consensus and does not jeopardize the \nkind of care that women in America deserve. That is what this \ncompromise amendment is all about.\n  I urge adoption of this compromise amendment. To do otherwise is to \nrisk getting the House language in the final analysis. That, indeed, \nwould set a very dangerous precedent.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her \ndiligent work with us in clarifying language here and for her \narticulate statement of support and the reasons why she supports this \nparticular amendment. I will not repeat those, but I think they clearly \nmake the case.\n  I would like to respond, also, to the Senator from California, who \nindicated that one of the reasons why she opposes the Coats amendment \nis that we will not have medical personnel adequately trained to \nperform abortions if necessary.\n  I would like to state for the record that an ACGME member--the \ncertifying body--ACGME member submitted testimony to the Senate Labor \nand Human Resources Committee that the D procedures that are taught \nto every ob-gyn and procedures used in cases of miscarriages and those \nof induced abortion require similar experience. Numerous ob-gyn's have \nindicated to us--and I have a pile of letters here from them, \nindicating so, and I will be happy to submit those for the Record--that \nan OB-GYN who is trained, as they must be trained, to perform D \nprocedures in the case of spontaneous abortions, are more than \nadequately prepared, should the need arise, to perform an induced \nabortion. Again, I have an extensive set of letters from those who are \ntrained in those procedures, indicating that is the case.\n\n  In short, a resident needs not to have performed an abortion on a \nlive, unborn child, to have mastered the procedure to protect the \nhealth of the mother if necessary. Maternal health will not be improved \nby forcing ob-gyn's to perform abortions on live fetuses if an ob-gyn \nwill not do an abortion in actual practice. But it is clear from the \nrecord that they will have sufficient training to do so if necessary.\n  Second, I would like to just once again, for my colleagues' benefit, \nindicate the support of Dr. Bill Frist, the Senator from Tennessee, for \nthis amendment, who has stated, ``The Coats amendment will protect \nmedical residents, individual physicians, and medical training programs \nfrom abortion-related discrimination in the training and licensing of \nphysicians.'' ``However,'' he goes on to say, ``in our efforts to \nsafeguard freedom of conscience, there are limits to what Congress can \nimpose on private medical accrediting bodies. I believe this amendment \nstays within the confines of the governmental role and addresses the \nmatter of discrimination in a way that is acceptable to all parties. \nThe Congress is responsible,'' he goes on to say, ``for the Federal \nfunding that is tied to accreditation by the ACGME, and as public \nservants we must ensure that there is no hint of discrimination \nassociated with the use of public funds, and that is exactly what this \namendment does.''\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3508\n\n  I would like to respond to the issue raised in the second amendment, \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from California, relative to the \nuse of funds for abortions in the District of Columbia. It is clear, as \nthe Constitution so states, that article I, section 8, gives this \nCongress exclusive legislation over all cases whatsoever in the \nDistrict of Columbia. It is stated in the Constitution clearly. It has \nbeen the basis on which we have operated, and it is a constitutional \nbasis. In all matters relative to the District of Columbia, the \nresponsibility for protection of those and implementation of those and \nestablishment of those is established in the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Public law 931-98, the home rule law, is consistent with this \nconstitutional mandate, because it charges Congress with the \nresponsibility for the appropriation of all funds for our Nation's \nCapital. The Congress, then, bears the ultimate constitutional and full \nresponsibility for the District's abortion policies.\n  Second is the question of separating or mingling.\n  I ask the Senator from Maine if I could have an additional 2 minutes \nfrom her time?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 17 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Yes, I yield the Senator 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Second, let me state this idea of separating Federal from \nDistrict funds is nothing more than a bookkeeping exercise. \nEssentially, what would happen is that the so-called District funds \nwould allow the local government to continue funding abortion on \ndemand. I do not believe that is something this Congress endorses. I do \nnot believe that is something that we should not deal with as\n\n[[Page S2270]]\n\nwe have dealt before. The separation of Federal funds from District \nfunds is a distinction without a difference, given the constitutional \nmandate and the practice of this Congress to appropriate all funds for \nexpenditure in the District. We all know that the District has one of \nthe more permissive, if not one of the most permissive abortion funding \npolicies in the country. It is essentially unrestricted abortion on \ndemand. I do not believe that is what this Congress wants to authorize \nfor the District of Columbia, and we have, on numerous instances, \naddressed this issue.\n  In the conference report that is before us on the omnibus funding \nbill, this was discussed at length. The language that is incorporated \nis language that has been agreed to by the conferees. It does allow the \nuse of funds for abortions to protect the life of the mother or in \ncases of rape or incest. Members need to understand that. What we are \nnot trying to do, what we are opposing, what I am opposing and others \nare opposing, is the use of those funds for unrestricted abortion, \nabortion on demand. That is the issue before us on the Boxer amendment, \nand I urge my colleagues to vote no on that and vote yes for the Coats \namendment, which is a separate issue, and that is the discrimination \nissue relative to the use of Federal funds for hospitals that provide \nabortion.\n  I yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from California \n[Mrs. Boxer] is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Feinstein offered me her time. I \nask unanimous consent that I be allowed to use her time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask the President how much time Senator Feinstein has.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Feinstein has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And I believe I have a minute and some?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 1 minute 15 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will you let me know when I have 5 minutes \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the Chair will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to respond to \nSenator Coats' point on the D.C. issue when he says, ``Look, we still \nallow them to use their own local funds for rape and incest but not for \nabortion on demand, not for unrestricted abortion.'' I want to make \nthis point because over and over again in this debate by the anti-\nchoice Senators, they use the terms abortion on demand and unrestricted \nabortion. They use the terms and ignore the holding of Roe versus Wade.\n  Anyone who has read Roe versus Wade knows the anti-choice Senators \nare not using the terms correctly. According to Roe, in the first 3 \nmonths of a woman's pregnancy, she has a right to choose. That is her \nlegal right. The Supreme Court has decided it, and even in this more \nconservative Court, has reaffirmed it.\n  Clearly, a poor woman in Washington, DC, cannot get access to \nMedicaid funding, and the only option she would have, except for \ncharity, would be Washington, DC's own locally raised funds, Mr. \nPresident. We do not stop any one of the 3,000-plus counties in this \ncountry from using their local funds if they wish, if they desire to \nhelp a poor woman. We do not tell the 19,100 cities that they cannot \nuse their locally raised funds.\n  Washington, DC, does have property tax funds, and they have other \nfunds that clearly are raised by them. If they feel it is a priority to \nhelp a woman in poverty in a desperate situation exercise her right to \nchoose, I do not think the long arm of U.S. Senators ought to reach \ninto that situation. That ought to be her own private personal decision \nand the decision of the locality to help her out.\n  So I hope that there will be support for the Boxer amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3513\n\n  As to the Coats amendment regarding Federal funding to medical \nschools, I want to reiterate what I think is a very important point.\n  The Senator from Indiana says, ``There is not going to be any danger, \nno one is going to be put in danger by this. So what if every single \nteaching hospital and medical school says, `We will not teach our \nresidents how to do surgical abortion.''' He says, ``Oh, they will have \nenough training in emergency areas, D's, and other ways.''\n  I do not think the Senator from Indiana would get up here and say it \nis not necessary for residents to learn how to do a bypass if it was \ntheir heart. ``Oh, you can just learn it from reading a book, you can \nlook at a computer simulation.'' No one would ever suggest that.\n  I really have to say, with due respect, total respect for my \ncolleague, that we are treating women in this circumstance quite \ndifferently than a person who had a heart condition, than a person who \nneeded a kidney operation. We would never stand up here and say that \ndoctors do not have to be trained in actually doing those procedures.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield on the Senator's time, because I am running \nout of time. I will yield on Senator Snowe's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator asked to be notified when she had \n5 minutes remaining. She has 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Why do I not yield to the Senator on Senator Snowe's \ntime?\n  Mr. COATS. If that is appropriate with the Senator from Maine.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I retain my 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield 2 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I just want to inform the Senator from \nCalifornia and our colleagues that what I stated was that on the basis \nof letters that we have received from a number of trained physicians in \nobstetrics and gynecology that the similarities between the procedure \nwhich they are trained for, which is a D procedure, and the \nprocedures for performing an abortion are essentially the same and, \ntherefore, they have the expertise necessary, as learned in those \ntraining procedures, should the occasion occur and an emergency occur \nto perform that abortion.\n  But to compare that with not having training for a bypass operation \nor kidney operation or anything else would not be an accurate \ncomparison. There are enough similarities between the procedure they \nare trained for and the procedure the Senator from California is \nadvocating they need to be trained for that is not a problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, Mr. President, \nletters that I have received which so state that training is adequate.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                  Catholic Physicians' Guilds,\n\n                                    Elm Grove, WI, March 23, 1995.\n     Re the amendment offered by Senator Coats to S. 555, Health \n         Professions Education Consolidation and Reauthorization \n         Act of 1995.\n     Members,\n     Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing on behalf of the National \n     Federation of Catholic Physicians' Guilds which is the \n     Catholic medical association in the United States, \n     representing physicians and physician's guilds from all over \n     the U.S. I respectfully urge you to support Senator Coats' \n     Amendment, specified in Sec. 407. Civil Rights for Health \n     Care Providers.\n       Senator Coats' amendment is certainly accurate in finding \n     the ACGME's revised regulations on Residency Training for \n     Obstetrics and Gynecology a violation of the civil rights of \n     individuals and institutions that are morally or \n     conscientiously opposed to abortion. The revised regulations \n     would require, under penalty of loss of accreditation, \n     Catholic Ob-Gyn training programs, or any training program \n     for that matter, to provide for training in the performance \n     of induced abortion. As you probably know, Catholic moral \n     teaching holds abortion to be a grave moral evil. What might \n     not be as clear is the fact that not only may a Catholic not \n     participate in the procurement of an abortion, they may also \n     not cooperate in any way with the procurement of an abortion; \n     not only may they not offer training in abortions, they may \n     also not provide for the opportunity of training in \n     abortions. Such cooperation would give the cooperator a share \n     of the culpability. The ACGME's regulation would be coercion, \n     an attempt, under severe penalty for failure to comply, to \n     force the institution to participate in the performance of an \n     activity which it, in conscience, considered evil. This would \n     seem to be a clear violation of the civil rights of the \n     individuals and institutions involved.\n       It is of significant note that the ACGME's regulation \n     revision in this matter comes at a\n\n[[Page S2271]]\n\n     time when fewer and fewer Ob-Gyn physicians will do \n     abortions. Ob-Gyn training programs that require abortion \n     training are also declining in number. Physicians do not want \n     to be involved in this procedure. Why they do not want to be \n     involved is understandable. The medical profession has always \n     held the moral belief that it's charge is the care of the \n     life of the human being. The Obstetrician has always been the \n     doctor who takes care of the mother and the baby until the \n     baby is born and the Pediatrician can take over the baby's \n     care. It is not in the professional ethos, in the soul of the \n     physician, to take life. It is his or her charge to protect \n     it! Abortion is a surgical procedure that intentionally takes \n     the life of the baby and exposes the mother to a normally \n     unnecessary operation. All of this violates the moral basis \n     of the physician's code. The physician cannot be cast as a \n     killer. He or she is a healer and an agent of the patient for \n     healing. If the regulation mandate from the ACGME is an \n     attempt to require physicians to perform a morally \n     reprehensible act to serve a political charge, then the ACGME \n     has stepped well beyond it's reason for existence.\n       The stated premise behind the ACGME's revision of the \n     standards was to ``address the need for enhanced education in \n     the provision of primary and preventative health care for \n     women by obstetrician-gynecologists''. (ACGME Press Release, \n     16 Feb. 95) How does abortion training enhance the provision \n     of primary and preventative health care for women? Primary \n     health care involves the prevention of pathology. Pregnancy \n     is not a disease that must be treated by termination. Primary \n     health care provides medical care for the mother and the \n     child she is carrying. Primary care cares for the well-being \n     of mother and child. To talk of abortion as primary care is a \n     distortion of the meaning of care. We cannot define killing \n     as care. Does abortion training enhance preventative health \n     care for women? What does it prevent? Exposure to sexually \n     transmitted diseases? No. Pregnancy? It certainly doesn't \n     prevent pregnancy. The woman is already pregnant (which means \n     she is already carrying a very dependent human life whom the \n     Ob-Gyn is normally committed to care for, too, working to \n     ensure the baby's successful entrance into the world). What \n     does it prevent, then? Responsibility for my actions? \n     Maternal love? Enhanced education in the provision of primary \n     and preventative health care for women could cover a lot of \n     territory. The destruction of one of the most natural \n     functions of the human person; the characterization of \n     pregnancy as a pathological condition; the denial of \n     professional responsibility to two patients when the pregnant \n     woman comes to your clinic; the acceptance of a cooperative \n     role with the woman in the ending of her child's life . . . \n     these do not seem to fit into this educational objective.\n       It must be noted that all Ob-Gyn physicians are trained to \n     do D's and to handle fetal demise. The training in the \n     specific procedure of induced abortion, especially \n     considering the great moral questions involved, probably has \n     no place as a requirement in Ob-Gyn training. If the ACGME \n     believes it is responsible for providing physicians to do \n     abortions, it needs to find a way to do it other than \n     mandating that training programs include this procedure in \n     their curricula.\n       Thank you for reading through a somewhat lengthy letter. \n     The issue really is significant. It deals with a \n     controversial area; a procedure that is legal to perform, but \n     morally questionable and lamented by most Americans as an \n     indication that something has failed. Also at stake are the \n     civil rights of those who morally and religiously object to \n     induced abortion and who are now being told that they must, \n     under penalty, provide for training in abortion procedures. \n     There is, as Senator Coats points out, the effect of \n     ``running out of business'' training programs that could not \n     obey the ACGME mandate. And, there is the chilling advocacy \n     of the notion that the doctor should be killer.\n       I ask you, on behalf of the many members of the NFCPG, and \n     other medical professional men and women of conscience who \n     cannot obey this regulation, to support Senator Coats' \n     amendment and keep true choice available to us.\n       God bless you in your many varied and difficult duties.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Kevin J. Murrell, M.D.,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 The University of\n\n\n                            Texas Medical Branch at Galveston,\n\n                                    Galveston, TX, March 23, 1995.\n     Vincent Ventimiglia,\n     Office of Senator Dan Coats,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Ventimiglia: I am a Professor of Obstetrics and \n     Gynecology at the University of Texas Medical Branch at \n     Galveston. It has come to my attention that Senator Coats, \n     during upcoming hearings to reauthorize the Health \n     Professions Education Act, will make efforts to protect the \n     rights of Obstetrics and Gynecology training programs who \n     choose not to teach techniques of abortion for contraception. \n     For this I am deeply grateful.\n       The Commission which accredits training programs for \n     residents in Obstetrics and Gynecology has made significant \n     changes in requirements for accreditation. In the near \n     future, ``hands on'' experience with elective abortion will \n     be a required component of an approved residency training \n     program. Although an individual trainee may invoke moral \n     grounds to excuse himself from participating, no approved \n     program, or program director, may excuse themselves.\n       Requirements for an accredited residency training are \n     ultimately approved by the AMA's Committee on Graduate \n     Medical Education (ACGME), and are listed in the Essentials \n     of an Approved Residency. Under the current Essentials of an \n     Approved Residency, an approved program is required to teach \n     its trainees about management of abortion related \n     complications, and provide some exposure to the technique of \n     abortion. Currently a program may fulfill this requirement by \n     providing instruction to residents in the care of women \n     with spontaneous incomplete abortions or missed abortions. \n     Requirements that become effective January 1 1996 \n     specifically require training in the performance of \n     elective abortion as a contraception technique.\n       Those involved in resident education at the University of \n     Texas Medical Branch made a decision in the mid 1970's not to \n     teach elective abortion as part of our curriculum. This \n     decision was based, originally, on concerns other than moral \n     issues. We encountered two significant problems with our \n     ``Pregnancy Interruption Clinic,'' or the PIC as it was known \n     at the time. First, the PIC was a money loser. Since there \n     was no reimbursement for elective abortions from either state \n     funds or Medicaid a great deal of the expense of the PIC was \n     underwritten by faculty professional income. Faculty income \n     was used without regard to the moral concerns of individual \n     faculty members who generated the income. A second problem \n     was more significant and involved faculty, resident, and \n     staff morale. Individuals morally opposed to performing \n     elective abortions were not required to participate. This led \n     to a perception, by trainees performing abortions, that they \n     were carrying a heavier clinical load than trainees not \n     performing abortions. As fewer and fewer residents chose to \n     become involved in the PIC, this perceived maldistribution of \n     work became a significant morale issue. Morale problems also \n     spilled over to nursing and clerical personnel with strong \n     feelings about the PIC. It is a gross understatement to say \n     that elective abortion is intensely polarizing. Because of \n     bad feelings engendered by a program that was a financial \n     drain, the PIC was closed.\n       Regardless of our reasons, the failure to teach the \n     technique of elective abortion has never been a factor in the \n     approval of our program by an accrediting agency. When the \n     changes to the Essentials of an Approved Residency become \n     effective next January, I will never be forced to participate \n     in the performance of abortion; but I am distressed that, to \n     keep my current job, I would be forced to cooperate in an \n     educational mission that espouses these objectives. To me, a \n     ``non-combatant'' working to advance amoral objectives bears \n     significant culpability. How could a pro-life physician ever \n     become a Program Director if required to teach this \n     curriculum? How could any Catholic hospital support such a \n     training curriculum, even if its trainees went elsewhere to \n     obtain the skills? Shouldn't program directors have freedom \n     of choice to decide if a morally controversial area is \n     included in their program? Where does a pro life medical \n     student obtain training in an abortion free environment?\n       Aside from my personal problems there are larger issues. \n     Due to a number of forces, there recently has been a de facto \n     segregation of the abortionist from the mainstream of \n     practitioners of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The abortionist \n     has become a specialist apart from the rest of us--they \n     are practitioners of a peculiar paraspecialty. Trainees \n     completing a residency program in Obstetrics and \n     Gynecology recognize that the professional community \n     considers the abortionist to be a physician on the fringe \n     of respectability. In addition to this marginalization by \n     the professional community, marketplace forces make a new \n     practitioner avoid abortions. Patients do not tend to seek \n     obstetric services from physicians heavily identified with \n     abortion. Young physicians who start doing abortions soon \n     have a medical practice which only does abortions. \n     Residents, hoping to practice the breadth of our \n     specialty, structure their new practices accordingly. \n     Changing the Essentials of an Approved Residency is a \n     deliberate attempt by those wishing to disseminate \n     abortion services to try to reintroduce abortion into the \n     ``everyday practice'' of our specialty. Their claim that \n     unique technical skills are involved in performing \n     elective abortions, that are different from technical \n     skills involved in treating spontaneous abortions, is \n     ridiculous and a clear attempt to mislead. The changes in \n     training requirements were not made to serve an \n     educational agenda--only a political agenda.\n       This change in the Essentials is coercive. It will make my \n     participation in furthering an amoral educational objective a \n     condition of employment. I currently have the right not to \n     teach that which is morally repugnant. I hope my right can be \n     protected.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Edward V. Hannigan, M.D.,\n     Frances Eastland Connally Professor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 1995.\n       Dear Colleague: There is one thing that can be said with \n     certainty about the abortion training mandate of the \n     Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education: it has \n     nothing to do with ensuring that medical residents receiving \n     training will be better equipped to provide appropriate \n     health care\n\n[[Page S2272]]\n\n     to women and children. OB/Gyn residents already learn the \n     techniques to handle pregnancy, miscarriages and \n     complications from abortions and, in learning these, learn \n     the medical techniques to handle those extremely rare \n     situations in which an abortion is actually performed in \n     response to a women's health emergency.\n       So, if the ACGME directive is not really about providing \n     medically necessary training for medical residents, what is \n     it about? Simply, to accomplish what 20 years of legalized \n     abortion have failed to do: to make abortion a part of \n     mainstream of medical care and force doctors and hospitals to \n     do abortion as if a refusal on their part would constitute \n     substandard medical practice. Can there be any doubt \n     whatsoever that after they define abortion as a part of \n     standard medical care for residents, they will move on to \n     declare it standard care for every hospital? Can there be any \n     doubt the directive that we would overturn is only the first \n     step in a battle against every medical facility which would \n     dare claim that abortion is not ``health care,'' that it is \n     no part of standard medical practice?\n       The way in which ACGME and their friends in the pro-\n     abortion community are going about this is deeply disturbing. \n     They are not merely forcing doctors and hospitals to adhere \n     to a particular ideology, they are requiring them in the name \n     of practicing good medicine--to actually kill defenseless, \n     unborn human lives. It is not enough for them that medical \n     residents are already learning the techniques that could be \n     used in abortion, but learning these without using them to \n     destroy live human beings. Abortion advocates are not \n     satisfied unless these techniques are used to kill unless \n     residents resistance in this killing is actually numbered.\n       This attempt to overturn the healing ethic that is the very \n     lifeblood of medical residency programs and medicine itself \n     must be rejected. I ask that all Members support the \n     provision in the bill to overturn the ACGME's directive and \n     to oppose any motion to strike it.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Delay,\n       Majority Whip.\n     Tom A. Coburn, M.D.,\n       Member of Congress.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 St. John Hospital\n\n\n                                           and Medical Center,\n\n                                      Detroit, MI, March 27, 1995.\n     Dan Coats,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       This is a letter of support for any legislation that would \n     prevent a residency program from being forced to implement a \n     special kind of training that would be against the ethical \n     and moral teachings of the institution in which the residency \n     program resides. Specifically, we decry the decision made by \n     the ACGME to mandate induced abortion training in all \n     residency programs. There are major flaws in the reasoning of \n     the ACGME: 1) an assumption that somehow abortions are not \n     being carried out because of lack of providers: there is \n     certainly no evidence of this locally or nationwide; 2) \n     failure of the ACGME to recognize the fact that training to \n     perform an induced abortion is exactly the same training as \n     to perform a uterine evacuation procedure in the context of a \n     missed abortion; 3) assuming that OB/GYN residency graduates \n     are not performing induced abortion because they don't know \n     how to; clearly every graduating OB/GYN resident from any \n     program in the United States has the capabilities of being \n     able to perform induced abortions but chooses not to on the \n     basis of conscience and possibly also for a concern for \n     personal rather than because they don't know how to do it; 4) \n     by coming out so strongly for induced abortion, the ACGME \n     creates further polarization in the United States over a very \n     inflammatory issue when further polarization is counter-\n     productive, 5) failing to recognize the philosophical \n     integrity of an institution by arbitrarily forcing health \n     care providers or individuals to do something against their \n     institutional ethics.\n       In conclusion, the directors of the St. John Hospital and \n     Medical Center's OB/GYN residency program strongly support \n     legislation preventing coercion of a residency program toward \n     implementing an unnecessary training that is against any \n     institution's ethical and moral philosophy and thereby only \n     contributes to the further polarization of the abortion issue \n     in the United States.\n\n                                  Michael Prysak, Ph.D., M.D.,\n\n                                                  Program Director\n     and Vice Chief of Obstetrics.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           Providence Hospital and\n\n\n                                              Medical Centers,\n\n                                   Southfield, MI, March 29, 1995.\n     Hon. Dan Coats,\n      U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coats: I urge the Senate Labor and Human \n     Resources Committee to adopt the amendment you offered to S. \n     555, Health Professional Education Consolidation and \n     Reauthorization. This amendment would neither limit abortion \n     services currently available in this country, nor would it \n     prevent physicians from seeking the training they might \n     choose in order to perform abortions. This amendment would \n     not interfere with a woman's legal right to choose an \n     abortion. This amendment is about the right of institutions \n     to refuse participation or cooperation in procedures which \n     directly violate their ethical codes.\n       The reason that our organization, Providence Hospital and \n     Medical Centers, supports this is because:\n       As a Catholic institution, we hold that direct abortion is \n     a grave evil. It is therefore not an optional procedure for \n     us, since we are bounded by Catholic ethical standards of \n     health care. Since Catholic teaching classifies the direct \n     killing of innocent human life to be among the gravest forms \n     of evil, cooperating with the new ACGME OB/GYN residency \n     guidelines by sending our OB/GYN medical residents to other \n     facilities for training in induced abortions may not be a \n     moral option for us.\n       There are over 45 OB/GYN residency programs in Catholic \n     hospitals, about a third of all OB/GYN residency programs in \n     the United States. We cannot afford losing these programs. \n     Trying to coerce health care facilities who are morally \n     opposed to direct abortions into cooperating with the new \n     ACGME guidelines will not resolve the issue of the dwindling \n     number of physicians being willing to perform abortions in \n     the United States. It will only exacerbate the situation.\n       How would mandating abortion training enhance the provision \n     of primary and preventative health care for women? Primary \n     health care involves the prevention of a pathology. Pregnancy \n     is not a disease to be treated by termination. Furthermore, \n     all OB/GYN medical residents are currently trained to do \n     D's, to handle fetal demise, and are trained in techniques \n     such as early induction of labor when the pregnancy \n     constitutes a serious life-threatening condition for the \n     mother.\n       Thank you for considering adoption of this amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Sister Jane Burger, D.C.,\n     Vice President--Mission/Ethics Services.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           Christian Medical & Dental Society,\n\n                                Richardson, TX, February 15, 1995.\n\n          Christian Doctors Protest Abortion Training Mandate\n\n       Dallas, TX.--The Christian Medical & Dental Society (CMDS) \n     announced today that it is protesting a medical council's \n     decision to mandate abortion training as politically induced, \n     personally coercive and professionally unnecessary. The \n     Council for Graduate Medical Education, which oversees \n     physician training, announced yesterday that obstetrical \n     residents must be taught how to do abortions.\n       Dr. David Stevens, executive director of the Dallas-based \n     CMDS, said, ``The Council is clearly out of touch with its \n     constituency, the vast majority of whom oppose abortion on \n     demand.'' He cited the results of an independent nationwide \n     poll of obstetricians, conducted in 1994 by the PPS Medical \n     Marketing Group in Fairfield, New Jersey, that revealed that \n     over 59 percent of obstetricians disagreed with the statement \n     that ``every OB/GYN residency training program should be \n     mandated to include elective abortion training.''\n       Stevens says the Council's decision ``is apparently induced \n     by political pressure from pro-abortion groups who want to \n     force their belief system on a medical community that has \n     largely rejected abortion.'' Stevens said that ``pro-abortion \n     leaders are worried that few doctors are willing to perform \n     abortions, based on personal convictions as well as the sheer \n     repugnancy of the act itself.''\n       Stevens said that despite the Council's technical \n     allowances for moral or religious objections, the practical \n     effect of the Council's ruling will be to pressure every \n     resident and teaching hospital into performing abortions.\n       ``Throwing in a little verbiage about `moral or religious \n     objections' does little to remove the intense pressure these \n     residents will now face to perform abortions,'' Stevens \n     explained. ``The threat of failing to meet GME requirements \n     will now be like a sword of Damocles hanging over their heads \n     as well as over the heads of program administrators,'' \n     Stevens noted.\n       ``In everyday practice, when one resident attempts to opt \n     out of the procedure, he or she can face intense pressure \n     from colleagues who would be forced to take up the slack by \n     performing more abortions,'' Stevens asserted. ``The mandate \n     will also effectively discourage those opposed to abortion on \n     demand from entering the OB/GYN field.''\n       CMDS chief operating officer Dr. Gene Rudd, an OB/GYN \n     physician, explained that abortion training is unnecessary. \n     ``The skills required to perform first trimester abortions \n     are acquired through learning dilation and curettage (D) \n     and other procedures involving spontaneous abortions,'' Rudd \n     noted. ``Only the more controversial second and third \n     trimester abortions require additional training.\n       ``Does the Council's new policy mean,'' Rudd posited, \n     ``that all OB/GYN's who have not been trained to do abortions \n     are inadequately prepared for professional practice? Of \n     course not! There is absolutely no practical reason to force \n     residents to learn to perform abortions if those residents do \n     not intend to perform abortions in practice. Abortion \n     training need not be considered an integral part of OB/GYN \n     training, as evidenced by the fact that roughly a third of \n     all residency programs in the U.S. do not even offer it.''\n       To receive a free booklet on bioethical issues or for more \n     information on the Christian Medical & Dental Society, \n     contact CMDS at P.O.

Mr. President, I will also just state, with what little \ntime I have remaining, that the Coats amendment has the support of the \nAMA, the American Medical Association, the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists and the Accrediting Council for \nGraduate Medical Education. So the very organizations that are most \ndirectly involved in this have looked at the Coats amendment, and they \nhave said it is a reasonable amendment and they not only do not oppose \nit, they support it.\n  So the very organizations that are held up as being the objectors to \nthis are supporters of the Coats amendment, and I hope my colleagues \nwill use that as a basis for their determination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on my own time, and I ask that I have 3 \nminutes remaining so that I can close on those 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, let me say to my friend from Indiana, I just talked to \nthe representative of the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists. They much prefer the existing policy. The reason they \nare on this particular amendment is because they feel this is far \nsuperior than the House language, but they prefer the current policy.\n  I will further say, just trying to exercise a little common sense--\nand, Mr. President, I feel many times we think these things are over \nour head--if your daughter found herself in a circumstance where she \nwas raped, let us say, and, let us say she found out within a month \nthat she was pregnant and she made the decision to end this pregnancy, \nshe did not want to bear this rapist's child, and someone asked you, \n``Senator, I've got two doctors available to do this. One of them \nperformed a D a few times and never did a surgical abortion and one \nhas the experience,'' I do not think it takes a degree in science to \nknow that if you want her to be safe, you want her to go to someone who \nhad the actual experience of performing a surgical abortion.\n  So I simply do not buy into this argument that because someone \nperformed a D and it is similar--it is not the same thing, by any \nstretch of the imagination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for another 30 seconds. What this amendment would \ndo is basically say you do not have to teach your ob-gyn residents how \nto perform surgical abortion and you would still get Federal funds. \nThat is why it is opposed by Planned Parenthood, National Women's Law \nCenter, American Association of University Women, National Abortion \nFederation, Women's Legal Defense Fund and NARAL. I think it is very \nclear where this comes down. This takes a situation and makes it \ndangerous for women.\n  Is it better than the House language? Sure it is, but why should we \ngo forward with something that is worse than the current policy and I \nthink open up a grave risk to the women of this country?\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I oppose the Coats-Snowe amendment to \nthe continuing resolution, S. 1594.\n  This amendment does two things: It puts into law a prohibition on \nFederal and State governments from discriminating against institutions \nthat refuse to provide training for abortion procedures; and, it \nundermines the long-respected accreditation system by allowing programs \nto opt out of meeting the required medical training standards set by \nthe ACGME and still receive Federal funds as if these programs met \nthose standards.\n  The Coats-Snowe amendment is unnecessary, it undermines the integrity \nof Federal and State medical educational and licensing standards, and \nit represents another step in the erosion of freedom of choice in this \ncountry.\n\n\n                              UNNECESSARY\n\n  First of all, this amendment is unnecessary because its \nantidiscrimination section is redundant. Although earlier standards set \nby the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the \naccrediting body for medical residency programs, did require abortion \ntraining in ob-gyn residency programs, ACGME revised those requirements \nin February 1995 to explicitly exempt ob-gyn residents or institutions \nwith religious or moral objections to performing abortions.\n  The policy states: ``No program or resident with a religious or moral \nobjection will be required to provide training in, or to perform, \ninduced abortions.''\n  The revised standard does not require programs to make alternative \narrangements for abortion training. The only obligations on programs \nthat do not provide the training are to inform applicants to the \nresidency program that they do not provide abortion training and to not \nimpede their residents from obtaining the training elsewhere for those \nwho wish to do so.\n  These requirements strike a balance between the program's desire not \nto be involved in abortion training and fairness to residents who \ndesire to obtain such training.\n  So I fail to see any need for this amendment other than to inject \nCongress further into the abortion decision and into questions of \nmedical curriculum.\n\n\n                    UNDERMINES ACCREDITATION SYSTEM\n\n  This amendment, even with the compromise language, still undermines \nthe system for evaluating the quality of medical training programs in \nthis country. Under current law, medical training programs may only \nreceive Federal funds if they are an accredited institution.\n  This amendment creates a loophole by allowing entities to not meet \neducational and training standards for ob-gyns set by ACGME, the \nindependent accrediting body of medical experts.\n  Does anyone in this body think Congress is better equipped to \ndetermine the educational requirements for a medical specialty such as \nobstetrics and gynecology than the medical professionals who actually \npractice medicine?\n  The ACGME, a private-sector, professional entity, is the only \ngraduate medical education accreditation organization in the United \nStates, responsible for evaluating over 7,000 medical residency \nprograms throughout the United States.\n  ACGME is sponsored by five of the leading medical organizations in \nthe Nation: the American Medical Association, the American Hospital \nAssociation, the American Board of Medical Specialties, the Association \nof American Medical Colleges, and the Council of Medical Specialty \nSocieties.\n  Accreditation by medical experts provides the only method the Federal \nGovernment has to assure that residency programs meet appropriate \nmedical training standards. Congress should not undermine that system \nby supplanting political judgment in place of medical expertise.\n\n\n            FEDERAL INTRUSION INTO STATE LICENSING STANDARDS\n\n  Accreditation is relied upon not just by the Federal Government, but \nalso by State governments, private funding sources, students and \npatients to ensure quality in medical training.\n  Even if the Federal Government is willing to abandon educational \nstandards in medical training, which it should not be, it should \ncertainly not prevent the States from maintaining standards.\n  All 50 States currently require an individual to participate in an \nACGME accredited residency program to obtain a right to practice \nmedicine. The Coats-Snowe amendment would prevents States from \nrequiring that ob-gyn residency programs meet ACGME standards in \nabortion training for those they are licensing to practice medicine in \ntheir States. The alternative for States that wish to maintain ACGME \ntraining standards is the loss of Federal funds.\n  This is an unconscionable intrusion by the Federal Government into \nState licensing procedures.\n  The ACGME standards, which were unanimously approved by the \nsponsoring medical organizations, reflect the input of physicians, \nmedical specialists, hospital administrators, clinicians, researchers, \nand educators who bring decades of medical judgment to their decisions.\n  The Federal Government has long recognized the specialized expertise \nthat formulates the ACGME accreditation standards and we should not \nreject that expertise now simply because the issue is abortion.\n\n\n                           EROSION OF CHOICE\n\n  This amendment is yet another effort to chip away at a woman's right \nto\n\n[[Page S2274]]\n\nchoose--a constitutionally protected right that the Supreme Court has \nclearly affirmed. This is one more in a series of steps Congress has \ntaken to destroy that right:\n  The 104th Congress, in particular, has enacted an unprecedented \nnumber of laws threatening access to safe and legal abortion for many \nwomen:\n  Ending access to abortion for U.S. servicewomen overseas by barring \nabortions on military bases even if the woman used her own money. This \nis particularly harsh on servicewomen overseas where private facilities \nmay be inadequate or abortion is illegal.\n  Prohibiting Federal employees from choosing health insurance plans \nwith abortion coverage.\n  Maintaining the prohibition on Medicaid coverage for abortion for \nlow-income women--except in cases of rape, incest, or life \nendangerment.\n  Denying access to abortion for women in Federal prisons.\n  Prohibiting the District of Columbia from using its own locally \nraised money to pay for Medicaid funded abortions.\n  Banning Federal funds for human embryo research.\n  Most significantly, Congress for the first time directly challenged \nRoe versus Wade by passing legislation that criminalizes a particular \nand rarely used abortion procedure and jails doctors who perform them.\n  All of these represent a steady march by the Federal Government into \nthe abortion decision, and the weakening of a woman's constitutional \nright of personal privacy. The Coats amendment is yet another erosion \nof that right.\n  But it is an extremely important one. This is a direct attack on \nmaintaining access to quality reproductive health care for women.\n\n\n                          SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS\n\n  There is already a severe and escalating shortage in the number of \nphysicians who are trained and willing to provide abortion services.\n  The total number of abortion providers in the country decreased by \nnearly 20 percent since 1982--from 2,908 to 2,380--in spite of a 10-\npercent increase in the population.\n  Eighty-four percent of the counties in the United States have no \nphysicians who can perform abortions. States such as North and South \nDakota have only one provider each.\n  Only 25 percent of obstetrician-gynecologists in the southern United \nStates are trained to perform abortions. Only 16 percent of doctors in \nthe Midwest are trained.\n  With the violence and harassment aimed at abortion providers \nincreasing steadily in recent years, fewer doctors are willing to risk \ntheir lives or the safety of their families, to provide abortion \nservices.\n  This amendment is a thinly veiled attack on freedom of choice. By \nmaking abortion unavailable, opponents of abortion will do what they \ncannot do legislatively--eliminate abortion as a safe and legal option \nfor women in this country--one State, one doctor, one piece of \nlegislation at a time. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I think it is always important that, when \nwe are discussing legislation, we get a chance to read the legislation, \nin this case, the amendment that is before this body. The fact remains \nthat this compromise amendment allows that anybody who wants to \nparticipate in training of abortions is allowed to do so. Nothing \nchanges from the current circumstances. Any agency or institution that \nwants to provide the training of abortions to medical residents can do \nso. That is how the legislation reads. That is fact.\n  I regret the fact that there has been so much misinformation \ncirculated about what this amendment does and does not do. This \namendment avoids getting the U.S. Congress involved in setting \naccreditation standards, because that is exactly what is happening with \nthe legislation that passed in the House of Representatives. The \nSenator from Indiana and I worked with the American College of \nObstetrics and Gynecologists on this very language. Sure we prefer not \nto be here today discussing this issue, but that is not reality.\n  I am looking down the road. What I do not want to have happen is to \nhave the U.S. Congress overturning the one set of accreditation \nstandards that is predicated on quality care. If we do nothing, we run \nthe very serious risk of having the U.S. Congress, because of the House \nlanguage, overturn that one set of standards that everybody in America \nuses to determine the standards and the quality of care.\n  If you think that is a risk worth taking, then vote against this \namendment. I do not happen to think so. This accreditation standard \nthat we are talking about in this legislation is the accreditation \nstandard that has been developed by the Accrediting Council for \nGraduate Medical Education. You might say, Who sits on this \naccreditation council? This is the one council that everybody looks to \nfor setting the standards for medical institutions and residents in \nthis country.\n  The organizations that sit on the council are: the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Hospital Association, the Association of \nAmerican Medical Colleges, the American Board of Medical Specialties, \nthe Council of Medical Specialties Societies. Then you have the \nresidency review committee that reviews the ob-gyn programs that set \nthe standards for the accreditation council, the American Board of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists, and the Council on Medical Education of the American \nMedical Association.\n  These standards have been set with the conscience clause for medical \nresidents since 1982. There has always been a conscience clause. That \nis what this legislation does. It allows for that. The accreditation \ncouncil had to go a step further and establish a conscience clause for \ninstitutions because of a recent court case. That is a fact.\n  Not one institution in America--even when it was implicitly required \nin the accreditation council standards before their proposed change \nthis year, they did not deny accreditation to one institution in \nAmerica because they solely refused to provide abortion training. It \nwas for a host of other issues.\n  So even when it was required, 88 percent of the institutions did not \nprovide for abortion training. So this amendment basically preserves \nthe status quo under the Accrediting Council for Graduate Medical \nEducation, the one set of standards that everybody uses from the \nFederal Government on down.\n  If we fail to support this amendment, I hesitate to think what \nmessage it is going to send to the conference committee on this issue. \nIt is important that the Senate send a very strong message that we \nreject the intervention of Congress in establishing a different set of \nstandards. That is what this is all about.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I would like to quote part of a letter that was sent by \nDr. James Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical \nAssociation, which he sent in March 1995 to Senator Kassebaum. I quote:\n\n       The Accrediting Council for Graduate Medical Education \n     standards were developed by professional medical educators in \n     the field of obstetrics and gynecology. The standards were \n     developed with great sensitivity to the differing moral and \n     ethical views about abortion and after substantial \n     consultation with medical societies, program directors, and \n     obstetrics and gynecology and other individuals and \n     organizations.\n\n  So that is the standard that is embodied in this compromise \nlegislation. If individuals who are participating in medical training \nprograms want to get training for abortion, they will be allowed to do \nso. If an institution wants to provide it, they will be allowed to do \nso, just like it is under current circumstances.\n  We, also, preserve the accreditation standards of the one group in \nAmerica that sets those standards, rather than running the risk of what \nhas been established in the House of Representatives that says that \nFederal funds can go to any institution in America that is unaccredited \nif those standards mention abortion. That is what the legislation says \nin the House of Representatives. That is what we are dealing with here. \nThey would allow Federal funds to go to any institution that is \nunaccredited if those institutions use the accreditation standards, of \nwhich there is only one set in America, if they refer to abortion in \nwhatever way.\n\n[[Page S2275]]\n\n  That is what I do not want to have happen in this body. That is why I \nsupported and worked on this compromise legislation. The fact is the \nHouse goes further. Every State has a licensing board. Every State \nlooks to the Accrediting Council for Graduate Medical Education \nstandards in order to determine the licensing. So, if we are saying it \ndoes not matter anymore, then they are going to have to go back, and \nevery State will have their own set of standards for medical \ninstitutions, of which there are 7,400 in America.\n  So is that what we want to create? I do not think so. I think there \nis a time when you have to accept what is before you and work together \nin reaching a consensus, which is what the Senator from Indiana and I \nhave done. I think that is what the American people want. We are never \ngoing to get unanimity on the issue of abortion. Far from it.\n  But I do think it is important that we work together in the best way \nthat we can to ensure that we have legislation that will benefit, in \nthis case, the women of America, because this is who will be most \ndirectly affected by this legislation, and to ensure that our medical \ninstitutions are dealing with one set of accreditation standards rather \nthan 50 different sets because that is, in essence, what will happen if \nwe reject this amendment. That is the risk that we are running. That is \nwhy I would urge adoption of the Coats-Snowe amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield to the Senator from Arizona for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I was going to call up an amendment of mine. I will be \nglad to wait until the Senator from California finishes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I am assuming we are debating the abortion amendment \nthat is----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Maine makes a \ngood point when she says we have to work together. That is what we did \nto get to where we are with the current policy. Current policy says \nthat, if you are an ob-gyn resident with a religious or moral objection \nto learning to perform surgical abortion, or if you are an institution \nwith a religious or moral objection to teaching abortion procedure, you \ndo not have to learn it and you do not have to teach it.\n  I support that. I am pro-choice. I believe very much in Roe versus \nWade and a woman having the right to choose to make this decision \nwithout Government interference. But I believe that if someone has a \ndeep religious or moral objection, and they are a medical school or an \nob-gyn resident, they should have the right to say, I really do not \nwant to learn this. However, if there is no religious or moral \nobjection, I believe that it is very important that these ob-gyn \nresidents learn how to perform surgical abortion until there is another \nsafe alternative. And what the Coats amendment does, regardless of the \nkind of spin we hear, is basically says to us that an institution that \nhas no religious objection can just decide, because they bow to public \npressure, we are not going to teach our residents how to perform \nsurgical abortion, and we will get Federal funds anyway.\n\n  Now, just to stand up here and say, ``I have a compromise'' is not \nenough.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to take Senator Murray's \ntime. She has offered it to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Reserving the right to object. How much time is that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Murray has 7\\1/2\\ minutes reserved.\n  Ms. SNOWE. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, was there some kind of an agreement about \ntime?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I may answer the question, I asked if I \ncould take Senator Murray's time as it relates to the abortion issue. \nShe has 7 minutes. I do not think I am going to use it all, but I need \nto make a couple of points.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have no objection. I was under the \nimpression that we were going to recess at 12:30. I thought I would \nspeak on the Murkowski Greens Creek amendment prior to the recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct that we were to adjourn \nat 12:30.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I do not understand the time. How much time is left on \nthe Coats amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 3 minutes 30 \nseconds. Senator Boxer used her time, and Senator Murray had reserved \n7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Arkansas have 15 minutes to speak immediately following the hour \nof 12:40, and that we extend the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will require postponing the recess.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct, until 12:55, so the Senator can have his \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend that we may not use all this time. I \nthink it is important that when we stand on the floor of the Senate and \ntalk about a compromise, we understand what we are compromising. A \ncompromise was made on this issue previously. Institutions and ob-gyn \nresidents already have a very generous and appropriate clause for a \nreligious or moral objection. So not only individual doctors and \nresidents in medical school, but also we, the institutions themselves, \nmay exercise a conscious clause exemption.\n  So now to take that compromise and say we need to compromise because \nthe House has some terrible language--Mr. President, I came here to \nfight for the issues that I think are right. I came here to fight for a \nwoman's right to choose. I believe that there are some things you can \ncompromise, and I was very pleased to support a religious conscience \nclause.\n  But if you take it further, theoretically, under the Coats amendment, \nevery single medical school in this country could say that they were no \nlonger going to teach residents how to perform surgical abortions, and \nthey would still get their Federal funds.\n  Now, you can stand up here and read off everybody who belongs to the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The fact is that \nthey prefer current policy. Yes, they are willing to go with the Coats \namendment as a lesser of two evils, but why are we not fighting this, \nstraightforwardly fighting this, and saying this is nonsense--saying it \nis nonsense that institutions who have no religious problem would still \nbe able to not teach surgical abortion and get Federal funds?\n  On the issue of Washington, DC, they would be the only one of 19,000 \ncities to be told by the Federal Government what they can or cannot do \nwith their local funds.\n  Mr. President, I see that the Senator from New Jersey has just come \non the floor. We have precious few moments remaining. I would be very \npleased if he is ready to yield to him the time I have remaining, if I \nmight inquire how much that would be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes 52 seconds of Senator \nMurray's time remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask the Senator from New Jersey if he would like my \nremaining time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would appreciate having some time from the \ndistinguished Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the Senator from New Jersey the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator allow me 30 seconds to make a request to \nmodify my pending amendment?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am happy to do it, and I ask unanimous consent that \nit does not come off the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3521, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment No. 3521.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3521), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 756, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S2276]]\n\n     SEC. 1103. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, funds \n     made available under this title for emergency or disaster \n     assistance programs of the Department of Agriculture, \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development, Economic \n     Development Administration, National Park Service, Small \n     Business Administration, and United States Fish and Wildlife \n     Service shall be allocated in accordance with the established \n     prioritization process of the respective Department, \n     Administration, or Service.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3513, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the one thing that mystifies me about \nsome of the actions that we take here is, why is it that a few want to \ncontrol the thoughts for so many? It is an assault on one's human \nrights, one's civil rights. It is inappropriate to be introducing this \nkind of legislation that has to deal with things other than the funding \nissue, and to intrude on people's private lives.\n  To suggest that the way to deal appropriately with the sparseness of \nfunds is to take away people's right to learn as part of a medical \neducation, and that they might lose their Federal funding--not might, \nbut will--it is outrageous. God was good to me yesterday. My oldest \ndaughter delivered a beautiful baby boy, and I was in that hospital on \nthe maternity ward, and I was looking around, and I thought, thank \ngoodness, they have the facilities that they have to be able to bring \nnew life into being. I thought about those poor women who, at the same \ntime, who may be distressed by the fact that there was a conception. It \nwas bizarre, but in the news today was a woman who was 10 years \ncomatose, was raped by someone in the institution she was in, and she \ndelivered a child. Is that not ridiculous that we would object to \nhaving someone learn the abortion technique, so that in the case of a \nrequest or a need, that it is unavailable?\n  I think this is mischievous, I think it is unfair, and I think that \nthe American people ought to rise up and say: Listen, enough of that \nstuff. You do what you want to. If you do not believe that a woman \nought to have choice in an unwanted pregnancy, then do not do it. But \nwhy should someone else lose their right to make that choice if they \nare in such a situation? It is outrageous. We have these sneak attacks \nconstantly--do it one way, do it another way. You violate the \nprinciples that we operate under. Privacy--that is what the Supreme \nCourt said. Why is it OK for some people to decide what is appropriate, \nprivate or not? The courts have made a decision.\n  So, I hope, Mr. President, that both bodies will reject this. I hope \nthe Senate will decline to support this. The notion that the city of \nWashington should not be able to use its own funds as it sees fit, I \nthink, is a disgrace. So I hope that we will reject this invasion of \nprivacy, of decency, if you will. This issue is not about abortion, it \nis about Federal intrusion into a private decision.\n  With that, I yield the floor back to my colleague, if any time \nremains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 28 seconds \nleft.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the ACLU opposes this amendment, as does \nthe Center for Reproductive Rights, Planned Parenthood, and on and on. \nI just hope my colleagues will stand up and say that we already \ncompromised and gave a good conscience clause. That was a compromise. \nLet us not open this up wide and have women's lives put at risk. Say \n``no'' to this Coats amendment and ``yes'' to the Boxer amendment. Let \nus protect the lives of women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, to sum up on where we stand with respect to \nthe Coats-Snowe amendment, first of all, I remind this body what we are \ndealing with here. This amendment modifies an underlying amendment, and \nthat underlying amendment would allow Federal funds to go to an \nunaccredited institution. That is what I wanted to prevent. That is the \nissue. That is what we are modifying through this compromise amendment, \nso that does not happen. Who supports this amendment? I think that is \nimportant since we are naming groups.\n\n  The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, which is \nthe entity that establishes the one set of standards in America for the \nmedical institutions; the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists--it is very important because we are talking about ob-gyn \nprograms, and the medical association is made up of the profession of \nphysicians. That is who supports this amendment. They say it is \nacceptable. They saw what I saw. What were the choices? What we will be \nfacing here potentially is a major risk and threat to women's health.\n  The House language, which gives Federal funds to unaccredited \ninstitutions, basically guts the accreditation standards for ob-gyn \nprograms if those standards mention ``abortion.'' Then we have the \noriginal--the underlying--amendment which we are now seeking to modify \nthrough this compromise amendment which would have also let funding go \nto unaccredited medical institutions.\n  Finally, you have the Coats-Snowe amendment--the compromise \namendment--which says we will prevent Congress from engaging in the \naccreditation standards of medical institutions, will preserve those \nvery important standards for health care in America, and at the same \ntime we will also protect the accreditation standard when it comes to \nabortion. And that is what it has always been. Nothing has changed. It \nhas always been that, if an individual, who is in a medical training \nprogram, does not want to get training for abortion, he or she does not \nhave to. The same is true for institutions. They will be able to exempt \nthe institution from providing that training if it is contrary to their \nbelief. That is what it has always been. The accreditation council has \nnever denied an institution accreditation based on the fact that they \nrefused to provide abortion training. It was always for a host of other \nstandard equality reasons.\n  I want to make sure that we preserve those reasons by preventing \nCongress from engaging in establishing, or overturning, accreditation \nstandards which is our only guidepost for quality care for women in \nAmerica.\n  That is the reality. I hope the Senate understands that because to do \notherwise, if this amendment is rejected, is that we will face the \nlanguage in the House which would basically gut and do away with \naccreditation for all medical institutions in America. That is not a \nchoice nor a decision that we should have to make.\n  Thank you. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArkansas has 15 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3525\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by the junior \nSenator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], which authorizes the Greens Creek \nLand Exchange. This amendment gives the Kennecott mining company 7,500 \nacres in the Admiralty Island Monument area of Alaska, in addition to \nthe 340 acres they already own. They received the 340 acres they \nalready own from the U.S. Government in the traditional way. They paid \n$2.50 an acre for it. For a while Kennecott had to shut down their \nsilver, copper, and gold mine at the site because they were losing \nmoney. Now metal prices are higher and Kennecott has reopened the mine. \nI am glad they reopened the mine because it is good business for them.\n  But more than anything else, Kennecott has agreed to pay a 3-percent \nnet smelter return royalty on everything they mine from the additional \n7,500 acres they are receiving as long as metal prices are at least \n$120 a ton. If prices go below $120 a ton, their royalty will decline. \nI want to pay a little tribute to Kennecott. That is what I call good \ncorporate citizenship.\n  They got the 340 acres for a song because of the 1872 mining law \nwhich continues to this day to be the biggest scam in America. And the \nU.S. Senate has consistently ratified that scam at the same time this \nbody is willing to cut Head Start, student loans so kids can go to \ncollege, school lunches, Medicaid, 40 percent of which is used to keep \nelderly people in nursing homes, and another 40 percent for children. \nThey are willing to cut all of that but not to address this scam.\n  As I say, I am happy to support the amendment of the Senator from \nAlaska. It is a good deal for them. It is a\n\n[[Page S2277]]\n\ngood deal for the taxpayers of America. That is what we ought to be \ndoing around here. But that is not what we are doing.\n  Mr. President, when I took this issue on 7 years ago, 7 long years \nago, the price of gold in this country was $300 an ounce. Every time I \nhave attempted to stop the giveaway of Federal lands for $2.50 an acre, \nI got my brains beat out. Fortunately, I have been successful in \ngaining passage of a moratorium on the processing of new mining patent \napplications.\n  The small progress I have made has been glacial. The mining companies \nwant the taxpayers of this country to deed them Federal lands that \nbelong to all of us for $2.50 an acre, $5 max, mine the gold, silver, \ncopper, platinum, and other minerals off of this land and then, \noftentimes, leave an unmitigated environmental disaster for the \ntaxpayers to clean up--and not pay one thin dime.\n  When I first took this issue on, gold was $300 an ounce. And the \nmining industry said, ``Well, if you put a 3- or 4- percent royalty on \nus, we will go broke. We will have to shut down, and all of these poor \nminers will be out of a job.'' Today gold is $400 an ounce. And what do \nyou think their argument is? ``We will lose money. We will have to shut \ndown and put all of those poor miners out of work.'' And like Pavlov's \ndog, Senators in the U.S. Senate grab it like a raw piece of meat and \nthink that is the most wonderful thing they ever heard--``Keep all of \nthese people working, if we will just not put a royalty on it.''\n  We charge people 12.5 percent for every ounce of coal they take off \nFederal lands--12.5 percent. We make people who mine underground coal--\na very expensive undertaking--pay 8 percent for every ounce of coal \nthey mine. We make the natural gas companies and the oil companies pay \n12.5 percent for every dollar's worth of oil and gas they take off \nFederal lands. And here is what we get for gold--zip. Here is what we \nget for silver--zip. And here is what we get for platinum--zip.\n  Do you know what platinum is selling for as of this moment? It is \n$413 an ounce. We have given billions and billions of dollars worth of \nplatinum and palladium away in Montana in the process of doing it, and \nwe will not get one thin dime out of it.\n  Just look at this chart: ``Miners Get the Gold and the Taxpayers Get \nthe Shaft.'' Here is Barrick Gold Co., the stock of which has climbed \nin accordance with the price of gold. About a year and a half ago \nSecretary Babbitt was required by law to give Barrick Resources 11 \nbillion dollars' worth of gold. Do you know what the Secretary and the \ntaxpayers of the United States got for that $11 billion? Yes, $9,000. \nAsk Senators who own land with gold or silver or platinum or palladium: \nHow many of you are willing to give the gold companies that kind of a \ndeal? You know the answer to that question.\n  Then just recently the Secretary was required by law to give a Danish \ncompany--Faxe Kalk--1 billion dollars' worth of travertine. Travertine \nconverts into a powder which has very special uses. What do you think \nthe taxpayers of the United States got for that $1 billion? Why, they \ngot a whopping $700--enough to take your family out to dinner about \nfive times.\n  Do you think I am making this up? If you think I am making it up, \ninvite all Senators who think this is just such a wonderful thing to \ncome to the floor and refute it.\n  In the past year, we gave Asarco, a copper and silver company, lands \nthat have underneath them--who cares about the value of the surface? We \njust gave Asarco 3 billion dollars' worth of copper and silver. What \ndid the taxpayers get for their $3 billion? Yes, $1,745. We are going \nto be required--we have not done it yet, but under the law, because of \nthe 1872 law that Ulysses Grant signed when he was President, we are \ngoing to be required to give the Stillwater Mining Co. 44 billion \ndollars' worth of platinum and palladium. Mr. President, this is their \nfigure, not mine. You want to go and find out where I got that figure? \nLook at their prospectus. And the taxpayers of this country in exchange \nfor their $44 billion are going to get the whopping sum of $10,000.\n  We are trying to balance the budget. It makes a mockery of it. It \nmakes an absolute mockery of it. You talk about corporate welfare. That \nis the reason I applaud the Kennecott Co. At least in the land \nexchange, the grant we are going to give Kennecott in the Murkowski \nbill, they had the decency to say, ``We will give you a 3-percent net \nsmelter return for all the copper we mine.'' That is still less than \nprivate property owners charge, but it is at least reasonable. If the \ntaxpayers of this country were getting a severance tax or a net smelter \nreturn royalty over the next 7-year period when we are trying to \nbalance the budget, it is a big piece of money.\n  When we look at some of the things we are doing to the environment, \neven after the add-back in the amendment we are going to vote on here \nin about 2 hours, even after we add that back into the environmental \nfund, EPA is still going to be cut significantly. Mr. President. When I \ncame to the Senate, 65 percent of the streams and lakes of this country \nwere not swimmable and not fishable. Today, in 1996, that figure has \nbeen reversed; 65 percent of the streams and lakes are fishable, are \nswimmable. And I do not care where you go. If you go to Main Street \nAmerica--you pick the town--and you ask people: Do you think we are \ndoing enough for the environment? Seventy percent of the people say, \nno. Do you want to reverse that figure to 35 percent of the streams and \nlakes not being fishable and swimmable from the point that 65 percent \nof them are? No. Nobody wants to turn the clock back on the \nenvironment.\n  The air we breathe, the water we drink goes to the very heart of our \nexistence, and we are cutting the Environmental Protection Agency's \nbudget. Too much regulation, they say. That may be true. Cut the \nregulations back, but do not cut back the quality of water and air.\n  Here is an opportunity to find an awful lot of money that we have \nbeen giving away since 1872, originally to encourage people to move \nwest. You think about the rationale for the 1872 law--to encourage \npeople to move west--124 years ago. What is the rationale now? \nCorporate greed. Political campaign contributions. That is it, pure and \nsimple. People will not vote to impose a royalty on mining companies \nbecause they give away a lot of money around here. Until we straighten \nthat out, this is not going to be straightened out.\n  Mr. President, I have made the same speech on this floor many times. \nThe figures keep changing. The companies that are benefiting from it \nkeep changing. I do not know how much longer I am going to be in the \nSenate, but I promise you one thing: The last day I serve here I will \nbe standing right here, unless this is rectified, making the same \nspeech.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2268-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will vote to support the Bond amendment \nto the underlying Lautenberg-Kerry amendment only because it provides \nsome additional funding for environmental programs that are critical to \nimproving the health and safety of all Americans and because it is the \nmost that Democratic negotiators could wrest from the Republicans for \nthese purposes. Regrettably, this Bond-Mikulski compromise eliminates \nany opportunity to pass the Lautenberg-Kerry amendment which contains \nalmost double the funding for environmental protection, including water \ninfrastructure funding for the State revolving loan fund and additional \nfunds to cleanup of Boston Harbor.\n  However, I hope that the overwhelming support for the Bond-Mikulski \ncompromise amendment will demonstrate to the House conferees that the \nvast majority of Senators want to support increased funding for \ncritical\n\n[[Page S2278]]\n\nenvironmental protection. I plan to work with the White House and the \nSenate and House conferees in the hope that we can provide even more \nsupport for the environment.\n  Let me first put in perspective the situation before us on funding \nfor environmental programs. I was pleased to join Senator Lautenberg in \noffering the underlying amendment to the Hatfield substitute to H.R. \n3019. Our amendment would add back nearly $900 million for \nenvironmental programs at four Federal agencies: the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the Departments of Energy, Agriculture, and \nInterior. The EPA would receive over $700 million--for clean water, \nSuperfund and EPA enforcement and operations, environmental technology \nand climate change programs--with the remainder going to important \nconservation programs at the other agencies. This funding is critically \nneeded to continue to protect the public's health and safety at a level \nthat Americans have come to expect from their Government.\n  The conference report on the 1996 VA/HUD/independent agencies \nappropriations bill, from which the Environmental Protection Agency \nobtains its funding, was vetoed last December by President Clinton in \npart because it provided $1.6 billion less for environmental protection \nthan the President's budget request of $7.4 billion--a 23-percent cut. \nThe President, in budget negotiations with the Republicans, then \nproposed to compromise by restoring approximately $1 billion to the EPA \nbudget. The Republicans rejected that proposal.\n  The amendment I offered with Senator Lautenberg and a number of other \nSenators would restore just over $700 million for the EPA including \n$365 million for the two State revolving loan funds for water \ninfrastructure projects and an additional $75 million to share the \ncosts facing the residents of the Boston area for a multi billion-\ndollar water and sewer treatment facility. This further compromise was \nalso rejected by the Republicans.\n\n  Following that rejection, Senators Mikulski and Lautenberg negotiated \nwith Republicans the deal reflected in the amendment before us today--\nthe Bond-Mikulski amendment. While it provides far less environmental \nprotection than the Lautenberg-Kerry amendment, it does restore \ncritically needed resources to the EPA that neither the House bill nor \nthe underlying Senate committee bill includes.\n  The Bond amendment restores $300 million for the State revolving \nfunds for water projects and additional funding for Superfund and EPA \noperations. That is important and beneficial. However, I cannot fail to \ndescribe why I wish the Bond amendment went further.\n  While the Bond amendment restores funding for some activities at the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, it eliminates critical funding for \nservices and functions vital to protecting the environment in my State \nof Massachusetts and the rest of the Nation.\n  Relevant to the Democrat proposal, the Bond amendment reduces the \nadditional funding for the EPA contained in the underlying amendment by \nalmost half. It reduces funding for water infrastructure projects under \nthe State revolving loan fund by $75 million and eliminates the \nadditional $75 million for cleaning up Boston Harbor--high priorities \nfor both me and for the President and other Members of the House and \nSenate.\n  In addition, the Bond-Mikulski amendment cuts $100 million from other \ncrucial environmental protection activities within EPA such as the \nEnvironmental Technology Initiative, the climate change program and the \noperations and enforcement budgets--the environmental cops on the \nstreet.\n  Finally, the Bond amendment eliminates $170 million included in our \namendment for other environmental enhancement and protection efforts, \nincluding funding for the Department of Energy's conservation and \nweatherization activities which would have insulated 12,000 homes, $72 \nmillion to help keep our national parks open and $20 million for \nconservation and research projects at the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency and environmental protection \nactivities it and other agencies operate have been subjected to far \nmore than their fair share of cuts in the past year. For example, in \nthe fiscal year 1995 rescission bill, the EPA budget was cut by $600 \nmillion to pay for disaster assistance. Now, for fiscal year 1996, we \nare asking the EPA to take another huge reduction in its budget. It is \nclear the Republicans are not imposing cuts on environmental protection \nactivities just to reach a balanced budget. Their objective is far more \nsinister--to cripple environmental protection efforts because their \nfriends who own or manage polluting industries don't want to go to the \ntrouble or expense.\n  If we want a healthier environment for all Americans, we must provide \nadequate resources to accomplish this to those arms of our Government \ncharged with that responsibility. What has happened to these activities \nduring the past year is a tragedy. In the case of the EPA, first, there \nwas a Government shutdown, then proposals for significant layoffs of \nthousands of employees, followed by another 3-week-long shutdown, \nfollowed by another short-term funding measure which only served to \nprolong the anxiety and uncertainty among EPA employees. EPA is facing \na crisis where its best and brightest minds are seeking more secure \nemployment outside public service. This directly affects the quality \nand effectiveness of our Government's efforts to ensure a clean, \nhealthy environment to all our citizens. The only way to resolve this \ncrisis is for Congress to make environmental protection a priority, not \na punching bag.\n  This Congress is seeking to place more burdens on the EPA through new \nregulatory reform measures and new assistance for small businesses. I \nsupport a number of these measures. But if they are to be implemented \nproperly, or at all, we must provide the requisite resources.\n  If we want clean water and air, if we want to clean up toxic waste \ndumps, if we want a healthy environment, we in the Congress have to \nsupport those activities.\n  The Bond amendment is the very least we should do. But it is more \nthan anything for which we have been able to secure Republican support \nup to this point. So I support the Bond amendment and I still firmly \nsupport the goals of the Lautenberg-Kerry amendment to restore \nenvironmental protection and I will work to achieve the higher funding \nlevels in the conference committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the suggestion of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia for 1 minute to explain both the pro and con of \nthese amendments. I think when we run a whole bunch together, that is \nnecessary.\n  I argued this morning in opposition to the Boxer amendment because it \nallows, essentially, unrestricted funding of abortion on demand in the \nDistrict of Columbia. The amendment, I believe, violates the conference \nagreement and restricts the use of funds for abortion to protect the \nlife of the mother and in cases of rape and incest. It also violates \narticle I, section 8 of the Constitution, which gives the exclusive \nright of legislation for the District to the Congress. It is not \npossible to separate the funds appropriated by the Federal Government \nfrom the funds raised by the District of Columbia. I do not believe it \nshould be the policy of this body to allow for, essentially, an \nunrestricted right to abortion in the District of Columbia.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the Boxer amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think it is important that we look at \nthe current situation regarding the Federal Government telling \nlocalities what they can do. There are thousands of counties in this \ncountry, and there are thousands of cities, and not one of them is told \nby the Federal Government how to spend their own local funds.\n  If you support the Boxer amendment, you merely say that Washington, \nDC, will be treated the same way as every other entity in this Nation. \nIt would still not allow Federal funds to be used, but it would permit \nWashington, DC, to make that decision on how to spend their own locally \nraised funds.\n  Thank you very much.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3508\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of this amendment. \nVery simply, this amendment will change the name of the Walla Walla \nVeterans Medical Center in Walla Walla, WA to the Jonathan M. \nWainwright Memorial VA Medical Center.\n  General Wainwright was born at Fort Walla Walla and was a member of \nthe 1st cavalry after graduating from West Point. He served in France \nduring World War I and was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in \n1945 by President Truman for his service in World War II. He spent \nnearly 4 years in a prisoner of war camp in the Philippines and was \nknown as the hero of Bataan and Corregidor. General Wainwright was a \ntrue war hero and won the praise and respect of all Americans.\n  Mr. President, the people of Walla Walla, WA want this name change to \nhonor a war veteran and local hero. In May, they are dedicating a \nstatue in his honor and would like to dedicate the name change of the \nhospital at the same time. The entire Washington State congressional \ndelegation supports this change. And all of the veterans service \norganizations in Washington State support the change.\n  I urge my colleagues to support changing the name of the Walla Walla \nVeterans Medical Center to the Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA \nMedical Center, and to allow this war hero the recognition he so \nrightly deserves.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under a prior unanimous-consent agreement, the Senator from Indiana \nis recognized for 1 minute.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3513, As Modified\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the amendment on which we are about to vote \nprevents the Government from discriminating against hospitals and ob-\ngyn residents who choose not to perform abortions. It protects those \ncivil rights, but it also allows those who voluntarily choose to \nperform abortions to receive training in that procedure. The amendment \nis supported by Senator Frist. The amendment is supported by Senator \nSnowe. It is supported by the American Medical Association, the \nAccreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. It goes to the rights of \ninstitutions and individuals to say that they do not believe it is in \ntheir best interests to receive mandatory training for abortion \nprocedures. It is a civil rights issue. I hope our Members would vote \nfor it.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I hope my colleagues understand that under current law any medical \nschool that has any conscience objection in teaching abortion does not \nhave to teach abortion and they still get their Federal funds. What the \nCoats amendment would do is say that even if an institution has no \nconscience objection, it can stop teaching surgical abortion and \ncontinue to receive Federal funds.\n  The reason why many of us on this side particularly oppose this is \nthat we think it is dangerous for women. We think that doctors will no \nlonger know how to perform surgical abortions. We think it is very \ndangerous that a woman is put in a situation where a physician does not \nknow how to perform a surgical abortion, say, if she is brought in in \nan emergency situation. That is why the American Association of \nUniversity Women opposes this amendment, the National Women's Law \nCenter, the Women's Legal Defense Fund, and the Center for Reproductive \nLaw and Policy, among others.\n  I hope you will vote no. Current law has a conscience clause. We all \nsupport that. I hope we can defeat the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.

The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3519\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this bill started with a $4.8 billion \ncontingency fund which represented our effort to buy the President into \na budget agreement where, if he would agree to a budget--any budget, \nnot just a balanced budget--we would give him $4.8 billion.\n  But it seems since we started, we were overly eager to give the money \naway. We have already given the President about $3.3 billion by adding \nit right to spending, without even requiring a budget agreement. What I \nam saying here is, let us take this contingency appropriation out. If \nwe have an agreement with the President, let us negotiate at that time. \nLet us not negotiate in advance. I thought we were\n\n[[Page S2281]]\n\ntrying to cut spending, not increase it. I do not understand how we \nbalance the budget by giving the President $4.8 billion of additional \nspending. So I ask my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. May we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. We can move this \nprocess along a little faster if Senators will take their conversations \nto the Cloakroom.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, let me clarify the Gramm amendment, \nwhich is in the context of what the leadership has been doing in trying \nto negotiate with the White House. In fact, the leadership supports my \neffort to try to table or to kill or vote no on the Gramm amendment, \nand that is simply this.\n  The negotiators on our side said to the President there would be $10 \nbillion that we would consider adding in nondefense discretionary \nspending if you agree to balance the budget through this process by the \nyear 2002. That was our leaders, the Speaker of the House and Mr. Dole, \nthe majority leader of the Senate.\n\n  So, consequently, the administration came up with a request for this \nparticular fiscal year for $8 billion of additional spending under the \nproposed agreement contingent upon getting that agreement.\n  We in the Appropriations Committee went over those requests. We cut \nit to $4 billion and we said, ``But that $4 billion is contingent upon \nthe leadership, who have been negotiating that long-term agreement \nfinding an agreement.''\n  So what we are trying to do is to help the leadership by providing \nthe incentive, by providing the continuing leverage, and that is simply \nit. There is not a dollar of this that can be spent until the \nleadership has reached an agreement with the White House, and that is \nto assist the leadership to pursue this expeditiously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3519. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3520.\n  The yeas and nays have not been requested.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I proposed this amendment with Senators \nSpecter, Santorum, Jeffords, and Harkin.\n  This amendment has two parts to it. It urges the Senate to maintain \nthe Senate position going into the conference committee on the energy \nassistance program, which the House has attempted to eliminate. It \nurges the President to release emergency energy assistance money, which \nhe already has under the LIHEAP program.\n  This is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. It is extremely important, \nnot just for cold-weather States, but also for some of the Southern \nStates that have experienced cold weather this winter.\n  I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague, \nSenator Santorum, and the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, Senator \nWellstone, in supporting this amendment. The Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, known as LIHEAP, is vital for the poor, especially \nfor the elderly. In many cases, they have to choose between eating or \nheating.\n  This amendment will be of substantial assistance in conference as we \nattempt to provide advanced funding for LIHEAP for next year. It is \ncritical because of the way the appropriations process has worked when \nwe have had continuing resolutions. Under the continuing resolutions, \nif there is not advanced funding for the program, we will not have the \nfunds available and the States and local governments will not be able \nto do their planning. So I think this is a very important amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, my Republican colleagues will come to this \nfloor and vote for millions of dollars in corporate welfare, and then \nvote against providing $168 to assist a 73-year-old widow in New \nBedford to pay her heating bill.\n  They'll vote to fund the Defense Department at a level above what the \nDefense Department has requested, and they'll turn around and vote \nagainst 143,000 families in Massachusetts.\n  All this sense of the Senate does, Mr. President, is ask the \nPresident to release about $300 million in emergency assistance LIHEAP \nfunding to people who need it. It's been a long, cold winter in New \nEngland and across this country--a record amount of snow has fallen in \nmy State--and it has been very, very cold. Too many people just can't \npay their heating bills. We simply should do the right thing and \nrelease this money.\n  This year, those in Massachusetts who need help paying their heating \nbills are going to receive about $20 million less than they did last \nyear. The release of emergency funds still won't bring us close to what \nwas received last year, but it will help hard-working families \nstruggling to make ends meet, seniors who are having the safety net \nstripped from beneath them in this Congress, and the disabled who \ndeserve our help.\n  Mr. President, if my Republican colleagues can vote in unison for \nmillions of unnecessary dollars for defense, I would like to hope they \ncould do as much to release a few extra dollars already appropriated to \nhelp people financially survive the winter.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer with my colleague \nfrom Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, an amendment on the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program [LIHEAP]. The amendment is a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution with two parts.\n  The first calls upon the Senate to hold its position on advance \nappropriations for LIHEAP in fiscal year 1997 when we go to conference \nwith the House. Advance appropriations allow States to plan properly \nfor next winter and enable their programs to be fully operational by \nthe time the cold weather begins.\n  The second part calls upon the President to use the LIHEAP emergency \nfunds to meet the energy needs of America's low income citizens. If \nthis bill passes, there will be no additional LIHEAP funds available \nfor the rest of this year. Under existing law, the President has the \nauthority to use emergency funds to help low income families pay their \nenergy bills. He should do so.\n\n[[Page S2282]]\n\n  I am very pleased that the chairman of the subcommittee was able to \ninclude $1 billion in advance appropriations for LIHEAP in this bill. \nThe House bill does not include these funds and we must fight to keep \nthem.\n  The recent temporary funding bills severely limited the rate at which \nStates could draw down their LIHEAP allocations and caused serious \ndisruptions in States' ability to provide assistance to low income \nfamilies. If LIHEAP funds had not been appropriated in advance in the \nfiscal year 1995 Labor-HHS appropriations bill, the President would not \nhave been able to release $578 million in energy assistance in \nDecember.\n  These funds enabled millions of low income households to keep their \nhomes warm during the coldest winter months. Both the Senate fiscal \nyear 1996 Labor-HHS appropriations bill and the administration's budget \nrequest for fiscal year 1996 included advance appropriations in fiscal \nyear 1997 for LIHEAP.\n  Last week I joined with 16 of my colleagues in writing to Chairman \nHatfield asking that he include advance appropriations. I ask that a \ncopy of this letter be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 Northeast Midwest\n\n\n                                             Senate Coalition,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 1996.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     Senate Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Before March 15th, the Senate may \n     consider an appropriations bill to provide funds needed \n     through the remainder of FY1996. We are writing to urge you \n     to include at least $1 billion in advance appropriations for \n     the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for \n     FY1997 in this bill. Advance appropriations allow states to \n     plan properly for next winter and enable their programs to be \n     fully operational by the time the cold weather begins.\n       The recent temporary funding bills severely limited the \n     rate at which states could draw down their LIHEAP allocations \n     and caused serious disruptions in states' ability to provide \n     assistance to low income families. If LIHEAP funds had not \n     been appropriated in advance in the FY1995 Labor/HHS \n     Appropriations bill, the President would not have been able \n     to release $578 million in energy assistance in December. \n     These funds enabled millions of low income households to keep \n     their homes warm during the coldest winter months. As you \n     know, both the Senate FY1996 Labor/HHS Appropriations bill \n     and the Administration's budget request for FY1996 included \n     advance appropriations in FY1997 for LIHEAP.\n       We must ensure that state LIHEAP programs can operate \n     effectively next winter. Advance appropriations are \n     essential. We urge you to include at least $1 billion in \n     advance appropriations funding for LIHEAP for FY1997. Thank \n     you.\n           Sincerely,\n         James M. Jeffords, Co-Chairman. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, \n           Co-Chairman. Herb Kohl, John Glenn, Olympia Snowe, John \n           F.

Chaffee, Chris \n           Dodd, Patrick Leahy, ------ ------, Rick Santorum, Bob \n           Smith.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we must ensure that State LIHEAP \nprograms can operate effectively next winter. Advance appropriations \nare essential in this regard.\n  The other part of this resolution deals with funding for the rest of \nthis fiscal year.\n  With passage of this bill, LIHEAP funding for this year will only be \n$900 million--a 40-percent cut from last year. Let me say at this point \nthat getting to the $900 million level has been quite a struggle.\n  There has been an effort by some Members of the other body to abolish \nthe program. I have worked very hard to combat these efforts as have \nthe Senator from Minnesota and the chairman and ranking member of the \nLabor/HHS subcommittee--the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  While $900 million is not sufficient to meet the energy needs of \nAmerica's low income families, these funds have made it possible for \nStates to provide energy assistance to many low income residents.\n  The problem is that the money is all spent. Using the authority \ngranted under the advance appropriations and the continuing resolutions \nwe had previously passed, the President has already released $900 \nmillion so far this year, the amount this bill includes for LIHEAP. \nAlmost all of these funds have gone out to the States and they have \nobligated the funds. There isn't any money left.\n  There is currently available to the President up to $300 million in \nemergency LIHEAP funding. A portion of these funds could be made \navailable to those areas with the greatest need in order to meet the \nurgent home heating needs of families eligible for LIHEAP. No emergency \nfunds have been used so far this fiscal year.\n  Mr. President, spring may officially start later this week, but for \nmany parts of the country winter is not over. Last week we had lows in \nthe twenties in Burlington, VT.\n  Checking today's USA Today we see that people can expect lows of 28 \ndegrees in Grand Rapids, MI; 18 degrees in Eau Clair, WI; 13 degrees in \nDuluth, MN; and 15 degrees in Rapid City, SD. I might also remind my \ncolleagues that 3 years ago, the so-called Storm of the Century \noccurred, not in January, not in February, but in March. We are not out \nof the woods yet.\n  How are low income families going to heat their homes? How are they \ngoing to pay their energy bills? How are they going to avoid having \ntheir heat shut off? Mr. President, there are no more LIHEAP funds \navailable. Using the emergency funds is the only way to meet this need.\n  And what about this summer? Traditionally, 10 percent of LIHEAP funds \nare used for cooling assistance during the warm weather months, but \nthis year there is no money left. How are States going to help low \nincome senior citizens and persons with disabilities keeps their homes \ncool this summer?\n  This is not a trivial matter. High temperatures pose a serious health \nthreat. Look at what happened last summer in Chicago. Hundreds of \npeople died as a result of the extreme heat. There aren't any LIHEAP \nfunds left, we are going to need emergency funds to meet this need.\n  Mr. President, because of reductions in LIHEAP funding, most States \nhave had to reduce benefit levels and restrict eligibility. There has \nbeen a 24-percent reduction in the number of households served by \nLIHEAP. In seven States that figure is 40 percent.\n  I guess you can say Vermont has done well in this regard. Only 14 \npercent of the 25,000 households that received aid last year have not \ngotten heating assistance this year, but the benefit level has been \nreduced by almost half.\n  I call to my colleagues' attention an article that appeared in \nyesterday's Providence Journal. It says that local agencies that \nprovide heating assistance expect the need for heating assistance to \ncontinue well beyond April 1 but they do not have the money to meet the \nneed.\n  Mr. President, our amendment is simply a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution calling upon the President to use the authority he already \nhas to meet the energy needs of America's low income families. LIHEAP \nfunds have been cut 40 percent from last year and there is no money \nleft. We need to use the emergency funds.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. This \nwinter is not over and we have to start thinking about next winter.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the sense-of-the-\nsenate resolution on the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n[LIHEAP].\n  This resolution calls on the President to release additional LIHEAP \nfunds this year, and recognizes that forward funding for next year is \ncritical to the LIHEAP program.\n  Mr. President, according to the calender, Spring has almost arrived, \nbut freezing weather is still expected for the Upper Midwest. There is \nstill a very real need for LIHEAP assistance.\n  Mr. President, we came perilously close to disaster earlier this \nwinter because of cuts to LIHEAP and the failure of the Congress to \nfinalize spending for the year.\n  Thankfully, President Clinton was able to release emergency funding \nwhen extended and severe cold weather spells threatened to result in a \ncrisis situation for thousands of people in my State of Wisconsin and \nthroughout the Nation.\n  LIHEAP has traditionally received forward funding by the \nAppropriations Committee so that States will know what to expect and \nmay plan for the next heating season.\n  Forward funding this year also served to prevent partisan budget\n\n[[Page S2283]]\n\nfighting from holding up emergency help. Even though many important \nprograms were held hostage during the Government shut-downs, forward \nfunding allowed the President to release critical heating assistance \nwhen it was needed the most.\n  Despite the President's action, the LIHEAP program was still hit with \n$400 million in cuts from previous levels, which represented a 25-\npercent loss this winter.\n  LIHEAP has continued to receive severe cuts even though home heating \nrepresents a disproportionate cost for low income households. Recent \nreductions in the program has led to steep shortfalls for States and \nprevented many families from qualifying for assistance.\n  In Wisconsin, over 126,000 families depend upon the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program. This year, Wisconsin families have been \nforced to confront an annual reduction of $100 due to LIHEAP cuts.\n  Given the funding shortfall this winter and the real prospect that \nsevere weather conditions will likely drag on over the next month, it \nis important that remaining Federal assistance be allocated to the \nStates. This resolution would call on the President to use his \nauthority to do just that.\n  Low income families and elderly people struggle year in and year out \nwith bitter cold weather and ever rising heating costs. For these \nfamilies, the LIHEAP program has provided life-saving help when heating \nbills or needed furnace repairs become impossible.\n  We must preserve LIHEAP and allow those who still need help this year \nto receive emergency assistance. We should also affirm the Senate \nposition and make sure that LIHEAP is prepared to meet energy \nassistance needs in the future through forward funding.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nDodd, Moynihan, Kerry, and Moseley-Braun as additional cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I do not see anybody rising in opposition. \nIf there is time, and if nobody wishes to speak in opposition to this \namendment, I would like to speak in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for that purpose.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think we have reached the point of being \nridiculous here. We have added $5.6 billion to Government spending \nright here in this bill. We are now so eager to spend money that we are \nno longer spending it this year, we are spending it next year. We \ncannot wait until next year to spend money on a program. We have to do \nit right now.\n  What happened to the mandate of the 1994 elections? I am opposed to \nthis amendment. I intend to vote against it, even if I am the only \nMember of the Senate that does. I am glad we have the yeas and nays. I \nhope it will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3520.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 77, nays 23, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 41 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--77\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--23\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Brown\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Faircloth\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Helms\n     Inhofe\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Shelby\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n  So the amendment (No. 3520) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3524, as modified\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent to send a modification of \namendment No. 3524 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3524), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page   , beginning with line   , insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SEAFOOD SAFETY.\n\n       (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any \n     domestic fish or fish product produced in compliance with \n     food safety standards or procedures accepted by the Food and \n     Drug Administration as satisfying the requirements of the \n     ``Procedures for the Safe and Sanitary Processing and \n     Importing of Fish and Fish Products'' (published by the Food \n     and Drug Administration as a final regulation in the Federal \n     Register of December 18, 1995), shall be deemed to have met \n     any inspection requirements of the Department of Agriculture \n     or other Federal agency for any Federal commodity purchase \n     program, including the program authorized under section 32 of \n     the Act of August 24, 1935 (7 U.S.C. 612c) except that--\n       (b) The Department of Agriculture or other Federal agency \n     may utilize lot inspection to establish a reasonable degree \n     of certainly that fish or fish products purchased under a \n     Federal commodity purchase program, including the program \n     authorized under section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935 (7 \n     U.S.C. 612c), meet Federal product specifications.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator from Alaska, [Mr. Murkowski], has offered an \namendment relating to the purchase of domestic fish or fish products by \nthe Department of Agriculture and other Federal agencies. It is the \nunderstanding of the Senator that his amendment would impose no new \nrequirement on the Federal Government to purchase these items?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes, that is my understanding. Currently, Federal \nagencies are authorized to contract with suppliers of fish and fish \nproducts for various Federal feeding programs. Additionally, these \nproducts may be purchased by the Secretary of Agriculture under the \ncommodity surplus reduction authorities of section 32 of the \nAgriculture Act of 1938. While these authorities for purchase will \nremain, my amendment will impose no requirement for purchase beyond the \ndiscretionary authorities of current law.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is it also the understanding of the Senator from Alaska \nthat his amendment would not reduce the ability of Federal agencies to \nensure the quality of fish and fish products purchased under these \nauthorities?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes, that is my understanding. All Federal agencies \nwho enter into agreements for purchase of food commodities solicit bids \nwhich contain a number of contractual conditions relating to the \nquality of the items. Nothing in my amendment would restrict the \ncriteria imposed by the Federal Government relating to the quality of \nthe product. The only restriction imposed by my amendment would be to \nprohibit a contractual requirement that processing be subject to any \nfederally mandated continuous inspection method beyond that imposed by \nthe Food and Drug Administration.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I understand current procedures for such purchases \nrequire an inspector of the National Marine Fisheries Service to be \npresent at all times during processing. Would the Senator's amendment \nprohibit the presence of any Federal inspector during processing for \nthese products in order to ensure contractual compliance related to \nquality standards?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. No. My amendment would only eliminate the requirement \nof their continuous present for\n\n[[Page S2284]]\n\nany inspection purpose other than food safety and wholesomeness. All \nFederal agencies involved in the purchase of fish and fish products \nwould retain all current authorities to inspect and impose quality \nstandards they feel proper to protect the Federal investment in, and \nultimate consumers of, these products.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides for agreeing to the amendment. I \nthink no further debate is necessary. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3524), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendments Nos. 3521 and 3522 Withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the McCain \namendment No. 3521.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \namendment No. 3521 and amendment No. 3522. They will be included in the \nmanagers' package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3525\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 3525.\n  The amendment (No. 3525) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Could I inquire what the parliamentary situation is at this \npoint?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to the \nThurmond amendment No. 3526.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily \nlay aside the Thurmond amendment so that we might consider some other \namendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question would now occur on the Burns amendment No. 3528.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to suggest the absence of a \nquorum at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3528 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote be \nvitiated on the Burns amendment to H.R. 3019, amendment No. 3528, and \nthe amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, let me, first of all, indicate to the \nSenate our progress. We have now completed all of our amendments, with \nthe exception of a Thurmond amendment and then the matter relating to \nthe pending appeal of the ruling of the Chair by Senator Burns. Then I \nwant to put in a quorum call for a few minutes for us to catch our \nbreath and review things, because the only other item to be taken into \nconsideration is the managers' package--the managers' package.\n  In this package are those accommodations we made to Senators who were \nnot able to meet the deadline for filing amendments and for those which \nhad been in the process of being cleared on either side with the \nauthorizing committees.\n  Everyone's right is reserved in the managers' package, because anyone \ncan move to strike or move to modify or second degree, whatever. So I \nwant to make that process clear. We have copies now of the managers' \npackage. I would like to make sure everyone has reviewed these, and I \nhave made sure their own interests are protected.\n  So at this time, Mr. President, I would like to, with the two parties \non the floor, dispose of the two remaining issues, the Burns appeal and \nthe Thurmond amendment.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                Appeal of Ruling of the Chair Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \nappeal of the ruling of the Chair on my amendment No. 3551 yesterday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3526, As Modified\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to modify my amendment No. 3526. I send the modification to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 754, line 4, before the period at the end, insert \n     the following: ``: Provided further, That the authority under \n     this section may not be used to enter into a multiyear \n     procurement contract until the earlier of (1) May 24, 1996 or \n     (2) the day after the date of enactment of an Act that \n     contains a provision authorizing the Department of Defense to \n     enter into a multiyear contract for the C-17 aircraft \n     program.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I understand this amendment now has been \nagreed to by both sides. There is no objection. We tried to work \neverything out in a satisfactory manner. I urge the adoption of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3526, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3526), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I inquire of the Chair if I am correct \non indicating, as I did, that all the amendments that were part of the \nunanimous consent agreement have been acted upon and disposed of in \nsome manner?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, as I say, I am going to take this time \nto recite those amendments that are in the managers' package. Then I \nwill ask for a quorum call to give time for people to come to the floor \nor to indicate an interest in either one of these. They are open to \nsecond degree or for striking:\n  One amendment by Senators Chafee and Kempthorne on ESA funding; an \namendment by Senator Burns on a hydroelectric facility in Montana; an \namendment by the Finance Committee on reimbursement of certain claims \nunder the Medicaid Program; an amendment by Senator Cohen to repeal the \nrequirement to discharge or retire members of the Armed Services who \nare HIV positive; an amendment by Senators Dorgan and Conrad, \nadditional funds for B-52's; an amendment by Senators Bennett and \nHatch, photographic technology; an amendment by Senators Breaux and \nJohnston on machine tools; an amendment by Senator Bond earmarking ER \nhighway funds within those appropriated; an amendment by Senator \nDaschle which earmark CDBG funds within those appropriated; two \namendments by Senator Santorum, two sense-of-the-Senate amendments \nregarding offsets for title II disaster assistance and language that \nmakes adjustments to discretionary spending to offset disaster \nassistance; an amendment by Senator Gorton, a Walla Walla, WA, veterans \nmedical center naming; an amendment by Senators DeWine and McConnell, \nprovides $11.8 million for local governments for the development of \ncriminal justice identification systems, offset from foreign operations \nEximbank.\n\n  Let me say all of these amendments either have been offset or they do \nnot\n\n[[Page S2285]]\n\nhave a major impact on the overall bill that we are recommending from \nthe committee. But these are all part of the managers' package. I did \nnot want anyone to be blindsided or have any thought of any right being \ndiminished by the action of the committee.\n  Excuse me, Mr. President, there is a second page. Amendments, like \nmushrooms, tend to grow in the night:\n  An amendment by Senator McCain on allocation of health care resources \nat VA; an amendment by Senator Hatfield, Umpqua River basin from \nexisting funds; an amendment by Senator McCain on disaster funds \nallocated in accordance with established prioritization processes; a \ntechnical amendment making section changes; an amendment by Senator \nMurkowski; Greens Creek, AK.\n\n  Mr. President, at the time when we move to act on these packaged \namendments, I will also ask unanimous consent that the following \nstatements and colloquies be placed in the Record: A statement by \nSenator Hutchison; a statement by Senator DeWine; a colloquy by \nSenators Stevens and Campbell; a colloquy by Senators Specter and Pell; \na colloquy by Senators Simon and Specter; a colloquy by Senators \nHollings, McCain, and Specter; a colloquy by Senators McConnell and \nLeahy; and a colloquy by Senators Harkin, Johnston, and Specter.\n  I would also ask further that a statement by Senator McCain be \nprinted in the Record at the appropriate place following the Burns \namendment adopted herein. That is a lot.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me ask the distinguished Senator if there is not \nalso a Dole amendment on the IRS commission, which he did not list.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I am told there is. Typographical error.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Would the Senator add that to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I have not asked yet unanimous consent, but we do have \nthat included. That is on the second page.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for just a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, at the end of last week I came to the \nfloor and talked about the Violence Against Women Act. I announced that \nwe now set up an important hotline, and that every day on the floor of \nthe Senate I wanted to just announce this number for families in our \ncountry. This is the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and the number \nis 1-800-799-SAFE. There is also a TTD number for the hearing-impaired, \nand that is 1-800-787-3224.\n  Mr. President, I talked about domestic violence last week. I will not \ntake the time today. But I would like for the next couple of weeks to \nget about 30 seconds every day to announce this number.\n  Again, for those that are watching C-SPAN, the National Domestic \nViolence Hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE, and the TTD number for the hearing-\nimpaired is 1-800-787-3224. If a woman feels she needs help because she \nis being beaten or her children are being beaten, she is being \nbattered, this is the number to call. There are people who are \nskillful; there are people who understand this issue. Because of this \nhotline, there is help for women, there is help for children, there is \nhelp for families in this country.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

Mr. President, I send to the desk the managers package, \nas I have outlined it and explained it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for himself and Mr. \n     Byrd, proposes an amendment numbered 3553 to Amendment No. \n     3466.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, again, let me call to the Senate's \nattention--as I have done now in the Republican caucus at lunch, and \nothers in the Democratic Caucus, I think, had similar material--that we \nhave put together, with the clearance of Senator Byrd on the Democratic \nside of the aisle, a managers package to accommodate those Members who \nwere not present when a unanimous-consent agreement was entered into at \n7:45 last Thursday night. The deadline was 8:05. So there were those \nwho were negotiating at that time with other colleagues.\n  I have recited those amendments and we have indicated very clearly \nthat people's rights to either modify, to change, second degree, or \nstrike were certainly open.\n  We have waited now close to half an hour for anyone to appear to take \nadvantage of that opportunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statements that the following \nstatements and colloquies--I am just boxing those together--be placed \nin the Record. As I recited before, there is a statement by Senator \nHutchison; a statement by Senator DeWine; a colloquy by Senators \nHatfield and Specter; a colloquy by Senators Stevens and Campbell; a \ncolloquy by Senators Specter and Pell; a colloquy by Senators Simon and \nSpecter; a colloquy by Senators Hollings, McCain, and Specter; a \ncolloquy by Senators McConnell and Leahy; a colloquy by Harkin, \nJohnston, and Specter; a colloquy by Senators Simon and Specter; a \ncolloquy by Senators McCain and Burns, which I ask be placed in the \nRecord in the appropriate place following the Burns amendment that we \nwill have adopted in this package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                SEMATECH\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the purpose of my amendment is to \nrestore the funding level for Sematech to the full amount authorized in \nthe 1996 Defense authorization bill.\n  Mr. President, semiconductor manufacturing leadership is as critical \nto America's national defense and economic security today as it was in \n1987 when Sematech was formed. Sematech has proven to be a model for \ngovernment-industry cooperation. Unlike so many other programs, \nSematech has produced all that it has promised it would and then took \nthe unprecedented step of deciding to decline all future direct Federal \nfunding.\n  It is indeed ironic that as this program come to an end, our \ncompetitors in Japan recently announced they are establishing a \nconsortium modeled after Sematech. They have publicly admitted that the \nsuccess of Sematech has resulted in America reclaiming world market \nshare leadership in both chips and the equipment used to manufacture \nthem and the Japanese now feel the need for their own Sematech.\n  We must never surrender our leadership or our resolve to be the \ntechnology leader of the world. In this the final year of funding, I \nbelieve we have an obligation to provide adequate funding to ensure \nSematech is able to complete its mission and finish research\n\n[[Page S2286]]\n\nproject already underway that the industry and the Department of \nDefense are counting on.\n\n\n                Criminal Justice Identification Systems\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, my amendment provides $11.8 million for \nlocal governments for the development of criminal justice \nidentification systems and their linking to FBI databases. \nSpecifically, this amendment allows the FBI to grant funds to local \ncommunities, in consultation with the States, to upgrade their criminal \nidentification systems. Through this funding, law enforcement agencies \ncould develop their criminal histories, and DNA, fingerprint, and \nballistics identification systems, and hook them up to the FBI national \ndatabases. It would also allow local law enforcement to contribute \nidentification materials to the database in Washington. This proposal \nis strongly supported by the FBI and State and local law enforcement \nagencies and governments.\n  While the FBI's fingerprint and criminal histories systems are not \nyet complete, State and local governments need these funds now to take \nnecessary steps to prepare their criminal records for connection to the \nnational database.\n  This language was also passed by the Senate in June, 1995, as part of \nS. 735, the Senate's antiterrorism measure, and in October, 1995, as \npart of H.R. 2076, the Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary \nAppropriations.\n  I want to thank Senator McConnell for his tremendous efforts in \nsecuring passage of this amendment. I also want to express my \nappreciation to Senator Hatfield and Senator Gregg for accepting this \namendment.\n\n\n                   Regional Educational Laboratories\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I am pleased to see that the Senate provided an \nincrease of funding for education research in fiscal year 1996. There \nis not a more central and basic role for the Federal Government than to \nbe funding research and development activities. Within that increase, \nhave you provided for the regional educational laboratories?\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have provided $51 million for the regional \neducational laboratories in the education research item. We have 10 \nlaboratories across the Nation. This funding will provide them each \nwith a $1 million increase.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Have you designated the purpose of these funds for the \nlaboratories?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The laboratories, by law, are to have their research \npriorities and program of work determined totally by their regional \neducational governing boards. These boards are responsible to meet the \neducation needs of their region. We are not giving a specific charge. \nWe expect the laboratory boards to determine what is needed.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Does this mean that the Department of Education can \ndirect these funds in any way?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Hatfield, the answer is that these funds are \nintended for regional priorities only and only when the priority is \ndetermined by a laboratory's board, and is a priority within the \ngeneral problem areas established in the law. None of these funds are \nto be used for any other purpose. This is what Congress intended when \nwe reauthorized these laboratories. A key role of the Office of \nEducational Research and Improvement is to guarantee that this \nexpectation is met, not only with the additional funds we provide this \nyear, but for all the funds for the regional educational laboratories.\n\n\n                         National Test Facility\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Would the Senator from Alaska yield a few moments at \nthis time to enter into a brief colloquy?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator. As the Senator may recall, the \nSenate report on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n1996 contained language concerning the $30,000,000 mandated cut from \nthe Ballistic Missile Defense Organization [BMDO] program management \nand support program element. It is also my understanding that based on \nthe additional management requirement, the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee directed that none of the program management and support \naccount reduction be applied to the programs, activities, or functions \nof the Army Space and Strategic Defense Command. As a result of this \nreport language, the National Test Facility [NTF] will take \napproximately a $4 million reduction in funding. As a result, there \nwill be insufficient funds to do the much needed upgrade of the \ncommunications of the national test bed network. Also, a computer \nessential to the NTF's mission may not be able to support its \noperational requirements. I am advised that this facility is essential \nto the BMDO's mission, and therefore, cannot withstand any further \nreduction in funding.\n  I would like to ask the Honorable Chairman, Senator Stevens, if he \nwould work to include the National Test Facility as another program not \nbe affected by the BMDO program management and support account \nreduction?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Colorado raises important issues \nregarding the NTF and I can assure him I will work in the conference \ncommittee to address this issue. I also take this opportunity to thank \nthe Senator from Colorado for his diligent efforts as the newest member \nof the Appropriations Committee.\n\n\n                        international education\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Pell, we are pleased to be able to provide \nsupport in the amount of $5 million in fiscal year 1996 for the \nInternational Education Program in title VI of the Goals 2000: Educate \nAmerica Act. Since this sum is one-half of the originally authorized \namount for this program we would appreciate any guidance that you, as \nthe author of this legislation and the ranking minority member of both \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Education Subcommittee, \nmight be able to provide on the use of these funds.\n  Mr. PELL. Thank you. First, I want to express to you my deep \nappreciation for the efforts you have made on behalf of this program, \nwhich provides critically important help in both civics and economic \neducation to the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and the former \nSoviet Union. Also I want to personally thank your staff member, \nBettilou Taylor, for the amount of time and work she put forth in this \narea.\n  I very much appreciate the opportunity to provide guidance on how the \nfunds for this program should be used. In a colloquy with then-Chairman \nHarkin in 1994, we agreed that the Department, given the limited funds, \nshould award one grant in each area--one in civic education and one in \neconomics education. I am pleased that the Department of Education \ncomplied with this request, and I believe it is a practice that should \nbe continued.\n  Further, given the delay in reaching an agreement on a fiscal 1996 \nappropriations bill, I believe it advisable that the Department award \ncontinuation grants to the two organizations that received awards last \nyear. These organizations, the National Council on Economic Education \nin New York and the Center for Civic Education in California, have had \ntheir grants for less than a year and should be given ample opportunity \nto implement fully the programs they have initiated over the past \nseveral months.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator for his kind words. Also, I believe \nhe has offered good, solid advice, and would concur with him that the \nDepartment should award continuation grants for the two organizations \nin question.\n\n\n                      funding for library literacy\n\n  Mr. SIMON. I am concerned that funds for library literacy have been \neliminated in the committee report. This is a particularly important \nprogram that supports literacy projects in over 250 libraries across \nthe country. I did note and do appreciate, however, that the committee \nincreased funding for library services.\n  Mr. SPECTER. My colleague is correct. Libraries are important in \npromoting literacy and I want to make it clear that the committee \nintends that library literacy projects continue to receive support \nthrough the additional funds allocated for library services. I will \nwork in Conference Committee with the House to ensure that the \nconference report reflects this intent.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague. Though I obviously would feel more \ncomfortable if funds were appropriated\n\n[[Page S2287]]\n\nspecifically for this purpose, I appreciate my colleague's efforts to \naccommodate my concerns regarding this important program.\n\n\n                       medicare-medicaid databank\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of engaging in a \nshort colloquy with the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania and the \nSenator from Arizona regarding the Medicare-Medicaid databank.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am familiar with the issue and would be glad to \ndiscuss it with my friends from South Carolina and Arizona.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Well, I do not believe that this is controversial \nbecause it has been addressed in the past by the committee and by the \nSenate. Last year, the committee report included report language \nprohibiting the use of funds for the Medicare-Medicaid databank. This \nyear, the House fiscal year 1996 Labor, Health and Human Services, \nEducation, and Related Agencies Appropriations report again makes it \nclear that the House committee does not intend for funds to be used for \nthis function, which could generate both needless paperwork and fines \nfor businesses across America. I just want to make the record clear \nthat the Senate continues to agree.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I share the concern of my friend from South Carolina and \nhave supported this prohibition from the start. Implementing the \ndatabank clearly would burden business with costly reporting \nrequirements. In fact, I have introduced a bill to eliminate this \nburdensome mandate and hope it could be passed by the end of the year.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I appreciate my colleagues raising this issue. I know \nthat language similar to the fiscal year 1996 House report language was \nincluded in the Senate report last year, and certainly, the Senate \ncommittee continues to agree.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for his \nclarification.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank my colleagues and yield the floor\n\n\n                           foreign operations\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the chairman of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, Senator McConnell, and I have agreed to an amendment he \nis offering to rescind $25 million in funds appropriated in Public Law \n104-107, the fiscal year 1996 Foreign Operations bill, for the Export-\nImport Bank. Those funds would then be eligible for transfer to the \nCommerce, Justice, State Subcommittee for programs under the \njurisdiction of the Attorney General.\n  Senator McConnell and I have also agreed that if the $50 million \nemergency supplemental appropriation for anti-terrorism assistance for \nIsrael that is contained in this omnibus appropriations bill is offset \nwith Defense Department funds or military construction funds, the $25 \nmillion transfer to the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee may \noccur. However, if any of the Israel supplemental is offset with \nForeign Operations funds, the transfer will not occur. This ensures \nthat if the Israel supplemental is paid for with Foreign Operations \nfunds, the Export-Import Bank money would remain in the Foreign \nOperations budget and would reduce the impact of that offset on Public \nLaw 104-107.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont, Senator \nLeahy, has accurately stated our understanding.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I would like to commend the \ndistinguished chairman, Senator Specter, and the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee on \nAppropriations, Senator Harkin, for their guidance and cooperative \nefforts in bringing this continuing resolution to the floor. There were \nextreme differences of opinion on a variety of subjects within this \nlegislation, and both the chairman and ranking member deserve a great \ndeal of credit for their efforts.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to a program that is \nproviding an indispensable service to Americans living underserved \nrural areas. The committee has provided funding above request levels \nfor the Office of Rural Health Policy, and I applaud this decision. \nRural telemedicine is a novel initiative in that it provides people in \nrural communities across the country access to physicians and instant \ndiagnosis. This is a particularly essential program given the declining \nnumbers of doctors who practice general medicine in our Nation's small \ncommunities. Telemedicine research has been ongoing, with specific \nefforts to determine the best and most efficient methods of delivering \nthese services to America's citizens.\n  One of the excellent telemedicine research projects which would have \nbeen funded in 1995 was from Louisiana State University Medical Center \nin New Orleans. LSU went through the competitive process and was highly \nregarded on the merits, and I'm proud of their accomplishments, and the \nwork that they are doing in southeast Louisiana.\n  Mr. President, a number of telemedicine projects were approved last \nyear, but did not receive funding as a result of rescissions. The LSU \nTelemedicine projects was just such a program. In order that LSU \nMedical Center might continue its outstanding work, I would ask the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member, and hope that they agree, \nthat consideration would be given to those programs that, after the \nrequired peer review, should have received funding from the fiscal year \n1995 appropriation, but were not based simply on timing.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague from Louisiana for \nhis comments, and for bringing this component of telemedicine research \nto the subcommittee's attention. The subcommittee adjusted the funding \nlevels for the Office of Rural Health Policy because it felt that \nprograms, such as telemedicine, offer promise for improving services to \nrural communities in the future. There is a need to evaluate how \ntelemedicine projects currently underway or under consideration fit \ninto the overall scheme of health care delivery in the areas being \nserved. Therefore, I think it would be consistent for the Health \nResources and Services Administration to consider previously approved \nprojects when it obligates Rural Health funding.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. Chairman, I concur with your remarks. It would be \nappropriate to continue these efforts to secure effective telemedicine \nservices for rural communities and to use existing, approved projects \nwhere possible.\n\n\n                    hcfa research and demonstrations\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. Chairman, I want to bring to the attention of the \nSenate and the committee language included in the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee Report accompanying H.R. 2127, the 1996 Labor, Health and \nHuman Service, Education Appropriations bill. It is my understanding \nthat unless specifically contradicted, all items in that committee \nreport are incorporated, by reference, in the committee report \naccompanying the continuing resolution now being considered by the \nSenate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SIMON. Accordingly, language included in the Senate committee \nreport under the Health Care Financing Administration Research, \nDemonstrations, and Evaluations account that encourages HCFA to give \n``full and fair consideration'' to a proposal from Northwestern \nMemorial for a ``3-year project to develop a comprehensive health care \ninformation management system'' is incorporated by reference in the \nreport accompanying the continuing resolution now under consideration.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is further correct. This is a project that warrants \nfull and fair consideration by HCFA, which should adhere to the \nintentions of the Senate with regard to this important piece of report \nlanguage.\n  Mr. SIMON. At a time when the Congress is proposing--and HCFA will be \nresponsible for administering--significant reductions in Medicare and \nMedicaid costs, this proposal is particularly timely. Specifically, \nwith the advent of managed care, and the resulting shift of patient \ncare from inpatient acute care to ambulatory and other primary care \nsettings, an integrated health care delivery system is essential. At \npresent, information management systems to measure cost outcomes--and \nachieve cost savings--beyond the acute care setting are not \ncommercially available. The information management system recommended \nin this report language would serve as a prototype for other health \ncare delivery systems, and offers the promise of cutting health care \ncosts while maintaining quality health care.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I share your interest in ensuring that HCFA has the \ninformation necessary to reduce the costs of\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\nhealth-related entitlements while maintaining quality care. I also \nagree that the information management system referenced in the \ncommittee report is precisely the kind of project that HCFA should be \nexploring to achieve these objectives.\n  Mr. SIMON. Thank you for your interest in this important project.\n\n\n                              flint creek\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to clarify for purposes of \nthe Record the amendment that we have just adopted.\n  First, the amendment gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n[FERC] the discretion of whether to transfer the license for the Flint \nCreek project. Second, in determining whether to transfer the license \nthe commission must determine whether the waiver of fees is warranted, \nnecessary and in the public interest.\n  In making these determinations FERC will ensure that the current \nlicensee receives no payment or consideration for the license transfer, \nthat no entity other than a political subdivision of the State of \nMontana would accept the license if made available, and that a fee \nwaiver is necessary in order to transfer the license.\n  Mr. President, the proponents of this amendment inform me that \nwithout a limited fee waiver, the Flint Creek project would be defunct, \nthe dam removed and that, accordingly, the Federal Treasury would \nreceive no fee revenues whatsoever, leaving both the people of the area \nand the Federal Treasury worse off.\n  I trust that FERC will carefully examine the situation and exercise \nits discretion to ensure fairness to the parties in Montana, the \nFederal Treasury and all similarly situated projects. I ask my friend \nfrom Montana, is that a correct reading of the amendment.\n  Mr. BURNS. My friend has described the amendment correctly.\n\n\n                               cdbg funds\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by the \nSenators from South Dakota to earmark $13 million from the CDBG program \nto enable the city of Watertown to replace a failed sewage treatment \nplant without burdening that city with unfair additional debt and \ndevastating economic consequences. This grant will be matched by the \ncity.\n  The city of Watertown participated in an innovative wastewater \ntreatment project which failed. When that city undertook this \ndemonstration, it was with the encouragement of EPA, and with the \nunderstanding that if the plant were to fail, that Federal grant funds \nwould be provided to enable the city to meet its secondary treatment \nresponsibilities.\n  Unfortunately, the plant has failed, and the authorization to make \nsuch grants by EPA also has expired, since Congress has directed that \nhenceforth such assistance only be available in the form of formula \nallocated capitalization of state revolving loan funds. It has been \nargued that we should over-ride this statutory direction and make \nspecific grants to certain communities. Throughout the consideration of \nthis bill I have opposed such earmarks from the EPA state revolving \nloan account, and I remain opposed to the diversion of EPA funding for \nsuch site specific concerns.\n  Mr. President, despite my concern over such use of EPA revolving loan \nfunds, I reluctantly have accepted the argument of the Senators from \nSouth Dakota that this city would be unfairly burdened with a massive \nadditional cost of financing a replacement wastewater treatment plant, \na cost that they were assured previously they would not have to pay. \nMore importantly, this additional cost, necessitated by the failure of \na technology recommended by the Federal Government, will have \ndevastating economic consequences for this city.\n  As such, amelioration of these consequences is one which the HUD CDBG \nprogram was intended to address: that of creating or preserving \nemployment in a community. While I also am generally opposed to such \nearmarks in the CDBG program, this is a program which has such purposes \nunder its current authorization, and as such, is a more appropriate \nmeans of addressing the legitimate concerns of this community.\n\n\nthe committee for minority veterans and the committee on women veterans\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, would the Senator from Missouri, the \nchairman of the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Subcommittee, yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. BOND. I would be happy to yield for a question from the junior \nSenator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Is it the intention of the committee to include the \nCommittee for Minority Veterans and the Committee on Women Veterans \nunder the restrictions placed on the travel budget of the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs?\n  Mr. BOND. No, it was not.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Will the Committee for Minority Veterans and the Committee \non Women Veterans be able to meet their responsibilities, including \ntravel obligations, under the restrictions placed on the Secretary's \ntravel?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, they will. I believe that the ranking member of the \nSubcommittee, the Senator from Maryland, also supports this view.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. That is correct. As a strong proponent of the Committee \non Women Veterans and the Committee for Minority Veterans, I fully \nsupport their efforts and will make every effort to see that their \nactivities are not adversely affected.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I am most grateful for the Senator from Maryland's past \nassistance in providing support and funding for the two centers.\n  As created by Congress, the centers were established to address the \nspecial needs of women and minority veterans overlooked under the \nDepartment's previous structure. Both centers and their respective \nAdvisory Committees have made great strides in identifying and \nassisting minority and women veterans.\n  The Committee for Minority Veterans is required to meet at least \ntwice a year and submit a annual report no later than July 1. The \nCommittee on Women Veterans is scheduled to meet four times during a \nfiscal year and is expected to submit its next annual report in January \n1997. The projected costs for the two committee to hold meetings, \nconduct public hearings, visit VA field facilities, and outreach to \nminority and women veterans are estimated to be over $120,000 for the \nremainder of the fiscal year. I am pleased that the provision in this \nbill will not adversely affect the activities of the Center for \nMinority Veterans and the Center on Women Veterans.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from \nMaryland for their assistance on this matter.\n\n\n                           devils lake basin\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I notice that the chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on VA-HUD and Independent Agencies are on \nthe floor and Senator Dorgan and I would like to engage them in a short \ncolloquy.\n  As you know, two amendments to the omnibus appropriations bill were \nadopted on the floor on Monday providing much needed hazard mitigation \nand disaster relief for the people of the Devils Lake Basin in North \nDakota. As Senator Dorgan and I stated on the floor prior to adoption \nof those amendments, Devils Lake reached a 120-year high water level \nlast year, and the resulting flooding caused more than $35 million in \ndamages. Based on the most recent National Weather Service forecast on \nMarch 1, we anticipate record high lake levels again this year. The \namendments which were adopted will go a long way toward preventing \nanother disastrous flood from occurring. We would like to know if \nadditional assistance might be available to North Dakota through the \nCommunity and Development Block Grant Program.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We note that an additional $100 million dollars is \nprovided for the Community Development Block Grant Program in the \ndisaster supplemental portion, title II, of the pending bill. The State \nof North Dakota, working with the affected counties of Benson and \nRamsey and the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe, have identified many homes that \nwill require relocation or acquisition to prevent them from being \ndamaged by floods later this year. A substantial portion of the \nanticipated $50 million in flood damage could be prevented if homes in \nthe flood plain are acquired or moved prior to the flood. Senator \nConrad and I would like to inquire if CDBG block grant funds have been \nused for acquisition and relocation in the past.\n\n[[Page S2289]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. It is my understanding that CDBG funds have been used for \nacquisition and relocation in the past and would be an allowable use of \nthese funds under HUD guidelines for the CDBG program.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I concur with the chairman of the subcommittee on the \nuse of CDBG funds for acquisition and relocation assistance. If Federal \ndollars can be saved by taking action before flooding occurs, I think \nwe should do so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the chairman and ranking member for their \ncomments. We have one additional question for the chairman and ranking \nmember.\n  Mr. DORGAN. North Dakota has received a Presidentially declared \ndisaster declaration for each of the past 3 years. H.R. 3019 provides \ndisaster assistance for the Pacific Northwest and other recent natural \ndisasters. Could the chairman provide me with his view as to whether \nthe Devils Lake Basin would have eligibility for additional CDBG \nassistance under the ``other recent disasters'' provision in title II \nof H.R. 3019?\n  Mr. BOND. I believe the State of North Dakota would be eligible to \nreceive CDBG funding under title II of this bill, provided the \nadministration concurs with the congressional designation of the \nappropriation as an emergency requirement pursuant to the Balanced \nBudget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, and submission of an \nofficial budget request to this end.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I believe the chairman's interpretation of the \nprovisions in the bill is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the chairman and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee for clarifying the intent of Congress regarding the \nutilization of CDBG funds for flood mitigation efforts. I also want to \nthank the chairman and ranking member of the full committee for their \nhelp throughout this process.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I want to concur with the remarks of Senator Conrad. They \nand their staffs have provided us with invaluable help in our efforts \nto seek assistance to prevent flooding in the Devils Lake Basin in \nNorth Dakota.\n\n\n                  b-52 supplemental funding amendment\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague from North \nDakota and I offered an amendment reprogramming $44.9 million from Air \nForce research and development, R, accounts to operations and \nmaintenance, O, earmarked for retention of our entire fleet of B-52H \naircraft in active status or a fully maintained attrition reserve.\n  Retention of these aircraft makes good sense. The B-52 is currently \nour only dual-capable aircraft, capable of responding anywhere in the \nworld with advanced conventional precision guided munitions or in \nsupport of our nuclear deterrent. The B-52 is our most proven bomber, \nand as a result of consistent upgrades which are continuing, the B-52 \nis a thoroughly modern aircraft. Gen. Michael Low, former Commander of \nthe Air Combat Command, has stated that the B-52's airframe is good \nuntil 2035. The B-52 is also cost effective, making it a good buy as we \nwork to balance the budget.\n  As my colleagues may be aware, the Air Force has announced its \nintention to send up to 28 of these aircraft to the boneyard at Davis-\nMonthan. This is clearly unwise. In the context of great uncertainty \nover Russian ratification of START II, loss of the capability to \nreconstitute the current force structure in a relatively short period \nof time would likely decrease Russia's incentive for ratification. I \nknow that my colleagues shared this concern when they voted to pass the \nfiscal year 1996 Defense Authorization Act, which included a provision \nprohibiting the retirement of any B-52's or any strategic systems, with \nfiscal year 1996 funds.\n  Recent events in the Taiwan Strait and frequent threatening Iraqi \nmilitary maneuvers near Kuwait since the gulf war highlight the wisdom \nof this provision. In an era when we face the possibility of sudden \nmassive aggression that leaves us little time to deploy reinforcements, \nthe B-52's global reach is a valuable capability we ought not \nsacrifice.\n  As many of my distinguished colleagues are aware, the Botton-Up \nReview [BUR] found that 100 deployable conventional bombers are needed \nto win one major regional conflict [MRC] before swinging to another \nMRC. Because of the slow pace of conventional upgrades to the B-1 fleet \nand the continuing production of the B-52, however, we could only \ndeploy 92 global range bombers if we had to go to war today. Sending \ndual-capable B-52's to the boneyard when we are unable to meet our \nrequirements for even one MRC is unwise, if not dangerous.\n  Retention of these proven, cost effective, and highly capable bombers \nis clearly in our interest, and I believe that this amendment is the \nright way to do it. In light of the great budgetary pressure faced by \nthe Air Force in this time of fiscal austerity, I am pleased that a \nportion of the Defense Department's unexpected inflation dividend was \navailable for reprogramming. No other valuable Air Force program will \nbe negatively affected by this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and call on the \nDepartment of Defense to respect Congress's prerogative to determine \nthe structure of our Armed Forces. In particular, I urge the Defense \nDepartment to postpone inactivation of any part of our B-52 force until \nCongress has completed all action on this year's defense budget, \nincluding the reprogramming package currently under development by the \nadministration and supplemental appropriations legislation for fiscal \nyear 1996.\n  I thank my distinguished colleagues for their careful consideration \nof this amendment, and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to explain the amendment that I \nhave offered with Senator Conrad to ensure full funding for the B-52 \nbomber fleet. Let me outline what my amendment would do and then let my \ncolleagues know why the Senate should pass it.\n  We have 94 B-52 bombers in active service in the Air Force today. Our \nexperience in the Vietnam war and the Persian Gulf war shows that the \nB-52 has long been our workhorse bomber. But despite what the B-52 \ncontinues to do for our national defense, the Air Force is considering \ndrawing down the B-52 fleet.\n  I am trying to prevent this from happening, and to keep B-52's up and \nflying. My amendment would provide the Air Force with the funding to \noperate and maintain 94 B-52 aircraft either in active status or in \nattrition reserve. A plane in active status, of course, is part of a \ncombat coded squadron. A plane in attrition reserve is not in a \nseparate squadron but is cycled through active squadrons, and is \nmaintained in flyable condition.\n  In order to pay for full maintenance of the B-52 fleet, my amendment \nwould transfer $44.9 million in Air Force research and development \nfunds to Air Force operations and maintenance. The $44.9 million has \nalready been appropriated in the defense appropriations bill. The money \nis available for transfer because the Defense Department's new \nestimates of inflation led the Department to conclude that it can \naccomplish its Air Force research and development with less money. In \nfact, the Defense Department proposed that this $44.9 million be \nrescinded as part of its supplemental appropriations and rescissions \nrequest.\n  I have run my amendment by the Congressional Budget Office, and CBO \ntells me two things that should cause my colleagues to support my \namendment. First, CBO believes that the $44.9 million funding transfer \nwill enable the Air Force to carry out my amendment's purpose of \nmaintaining 94 B-52's. So this amendment is fully funded. Second, CBO \nhas scored this amendment as saving $4 million in fiscal year 1996 and \nas deficit neutral over the 5 years 1996 to 2000. CBO projects that \nthis amendment would actually save money in this fiscal year and be \ndeficit neutral over the next 5 years.\n  Having described my amendment, let me briefly tell my colleagues why \nI think it is important that we retain our full, 94-plane B-52 fleet.\n\n\n                            start ii treaty\n\n  The most important reason to keep 94 B-52's flying is that Russia has \nnot yet ratified the START II Treaty. START II is the arms control \ntreaty that requires both us and the Russians to cut our nuclear \nstockpiles. It makes no sense to retire strategic weapons systems when \nSTART II has not yet gone into effect. Disarmament should\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\nnot be unilateral. Members of the Russian Duma will doubtless ask \nthemselves why they should ratify START II if the United States is \ncutting its strategic bomber force anyway.\n\n\n                          congressional intent\n\n  Second, Congress has explicitly recognized the force of these START \nII considerations. We wrote a provision into law, section 1404 of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, forbidding the \nretirement of any strategic weapon system this year. We did that \nbecause we knew that we should not cut our nuclear arsenal until Russia \nsubjects itself to the limits in START II. That is why section 1404 \nexplicitly prohibits retiring B-52 bombers or even preparing to retire \nthem. My amendment simply backs up section 1404 with the funding the \nAir Force needs to maintain the full B-52 bomber fleet. I seek to \nenable the Air Force to carry out the intent of Congress.\n\n\n                       capabilities of b-52 fleet\n\n  Third, I would remind my colleagues that B-52 bombers are long-range \nforce projectors. With maximum fuel load, the B-52 can fly 10,000 miles \nwithout in-air refueling, which is over 33 percent further than the B-1 \nor B-2 bombers. With in-air refueling, the B-52 literally has a \nworldwide range. The B-52 has been modified to carry up to 12 air-\nlaunched cruise missiles externally and 8 internally. Alternatively, it \ncan carry up to 50,000 pounds of attack missiles and gravity bombs. A \nbomber of such range and payload is vital in order to project air power \nto areas where the United States lacks prepositioned equipment or bases \ncapable of handling heavy bombers.\n  To take an example, Mr. President, right now we face a crisis in \nSoutheast Asia, in the Taiwan Strait. China is firing live ammunition \nand testing dummy missiles in a way that is calculated to disrupt \nTaiwan's economy and rattle Taiwan's electorate. We have one carrier \ntask force in the area; we are moving a second carrier task force from \nthe Persian Gulf to Southeast Asia in order to keep the peace. Well, \nthe B-52 has already kept the peace in the Persian Gulf. And it can \nkeep the peace in Southeast Asia in one hop if need be. It makes no \nsense to retire B-52's at a moment when our ability to project force \ninto every corner of the world is key to the peace of Southeast Asia.\n\n\n                          bomber study ongoing\n\n  Last, my colleagues will recall that in February President Clinton \nordered the Defense Department to study the future of our long-range \nbomber fleet. The Deep Attack Weapons Mix Study, which is headed by \nUnder Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology Paul Kaminski \nand Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Ralston, \nwill examine both the munitions and the bombers used to strike deep \ninto enemy territory. That study includes a close look at the strategic \nbomber force structure. It seems to me that any retirement of B-52 \nbombers would prejudge the results of the Deep Attack Weapons Mix \nStudy. I think my colleagues will agree that we should ensure that the \nAir Force can await the results of the study before retiring any B-52 \nbombers.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I am asking the Senate to approve an \namendment that is paid for, that fulfills congressional intent, that \nmaintains America's strategic forces, and that keeps a capable bomber \nin the air. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                               americorps\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support the mission of AmeriCorps. I \nbelieve that engaging Americans of all ages to help communities solve \ntheir own problems is a worthy goal.\n  One of the greatest threats facing our cities and towns today is the \nloss of a sense of community responsibility. AmeriCorps invites \nAmericans to put something back into their communities--to reestablish \nthe local ties that have been so important to this country.\n  I am very concerned about the provision in this omnibus \nappropriations bill which terminates AmeriCorps grants through Federal \nagencies. Right now, about half of AmeriCorps participants in my home \nState run through the USDA AmeriCorps Program. This includes the \nVermont Anti-Hunger Corps and a rural development team. These projects \nhave involved nonprofit groups, and a unique partnership of Federal, \nState, and local organizations. All of which have contributed to their \nsuccess.\n  I want to clarify with the Chairman that this language would not \npreclude these local programs currently funded through Federal agencies \nto continue through national direct grants or through State \ncommissions.\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, the Senator is correct. If local programs currently \nbeing funded through Federal agencies are doing a good job, then I \nwould encourage them to either work with national groups to apply for \nfunding or work with the commission in the State in which they reside. \nThese local programs have the experience and expertise to compete very \nwell for AmeriCorps grants. I expect the Corporation for National and \nCommunity Service and the State commissions to take this experience \ninto consideration when reviewing new grantees. The bottom line is that \nwe do not want Federal agencies capitalizing on funds that should be \ngoing directly to nonprofit organizations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chairman Senator Bond. I ask Senator Mikulski \nif this is also her understanding?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I share the concern of the Senator, about the \ntermination of the grants to Federal agencies. Unfortunately, we lost \nthe public relations war in defining how these Federal agency grants \nreally work. These programs are not bloated bureaucracies, but a way \nfor small local programs to benefit from the technical expertise of \nFederal agencies in designing programs to meet their own local needs. I \nwould urge any local program currently being funded through a Federal \nagency to apply through the national direct grants or through their own \nState commissions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank Chairman Bond and Senator Mikulski. I plan to work \nclosely with these Vermont programs so that they can continue to \nproviding services through AmeriCorps. And I appreciate all of the work \nthe Senators have done to come to a bipartisan agreement on funding for \nAmeriCorps. I look forward to continue working with them on this \nimportant issue.\n\n\n                          veterans health care\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we need to take immediate steps to \nimplement a plan to better allocate health care funding among the \nDepartment's health care facilities so that veterans, no matter where \nthey live or what circumstances they face, have equal access to quality \nhealth care.\n  The amendment that I propose here today with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Bob Graham of Florida, will, I hope, finally direct \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs to do the right thing. That is, to \neliminate funding disparities among VA health care facilities across \nthe country.\n  Mr. President, inequity in veterans' access to health care is an \nissue that I originally brought to Secretary Jesse Brown's attention in \nMarch 1994. The Department of Veterans Affairs is currently using an \narchaic and unresponsive formula to allocate health care resources. The \nsystem must be updated to account for population shifts.\n  The veterans population in three States, including Arizona, is \ngrowing, at the same time that it is declining in other parts of the \ncountry. Unfortunately, health care allocations have not kept up with \nthe changes. The impact of disparate funding has been very obvious to \nme during my visits to many VA medical centers throughout the country, \nand particularly in Arizona, and was confirmed by a formal survey of \nthe Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center in Phoenix, which was conducted by \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars [VFW] in April 1994.\n  The problem has been further verified by the General Accounting \nOffice [GAO] in a report entitled ``Veterans Health Care: Facilities' \nResource Allocations Could Be More Equitable.'' The GAO found that the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs continues to allocate funding based on \npast budgets rather than current needs, and has failed to implement the \nResource Planning and Management system [RPM] developed 2 years ago to \nhelp remedy funding inequity.\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\n  Mr. President, the GAO cites VA data that the workload of some \nfacilities increased by as much as 15 percent between 1993 and 1995, \nwhile the workload of others declined by as much as 8 percent. However, \nin the two budget cycles studied, the VA made only minimal changes in \nfunding allocations. The maximum loss to a facility was 1 percent of \nits past budget and the average gain was also about 1 percent.\n  This inadequate response to demographic change over the past decade \nis very disturbing, and, I believe, wrong. To illustrate the problem, I \nwould point out that the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center experienced \nthe third highest workload growth based on 17 hospitals of similar size \nand mission, yet was only funded at less than half the RPM process.\n  Mr. President, the GAO informs me that rather than implementing the \nRPM process to remedy funding inequities in access to veterans health \ncare, the VA has resorted to rationing health care or eliminating \nhealth care to certain veterans in areas of high demand.\n  The GAO says:\n\n       Because of differences in facility rationing practices, \n     veterans' access to care system wide is uneven. We found that \n     higher income veterans received care at many facilities, \n     while lower income veterans were turned away at other \n     facilities. Differences in who was served occurred even \n     within the same facility because of rationing.\n\nThe GAO also indicates that there is confusion among the Department's \nstaff regarding the reasons for funding variations among the VA \nfacilities and the purpose of the RPM system.\n  Mr. President, this problem must be addressed now. This amendment \ncompels the VA to take expeditious action to remedy this serious \nproblem and adequately address the changes in demand at VA facilities.\n  To conclude, I want to reiterate that I find it simply unconscionable \nthat the VA could place the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center at the \nbottom of the funding ladder, when the three VA medical facilities in \nthe State of Arizona must care for a growing number of veterans, and \nare inundated every year by winter visitors, which places an additional \nburden on the facilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the VFW survey and the GAO summary \nreport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Veterans of Foreign Wars of\n\n\n                                            the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 1994.\n     John T. Farrar, M.D.,\n     Acting Under Secretary for Health (10), Veterans Health \n         Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dr. Farrar: A member of my staff, Robert F. O'Toole, \n     Senior Field Representative, conducted a survey of the \n     Phoenix, Arizona, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical \n     Center, on March 14-15, 1994. During his time at the medical \n     center, he was able to talk with many patients, family \n     members and staff. This enabled him to gather information \n     concerning the quality of care being provided and the most \n     pressing problems facing the facility.\n       While those receiving treatment in the clinics and wards \n     felt that the quality was good, they almost all commented on \n     the long waits in the clinics and the understaffing \n     throughout the medical center. In discussing their problem \n     with various staff members, it was noted that nurses were \n     under extreme stress. More than one was observed by Mr. \n     O'Toole in tears when completing their tour. The nursing \n     staff on evening shifts must rush continually through their \n     duties in an attempt to cover all their patients needs due to \n     the shortage in staffing in both support and technical \n     personnel.\n       In attempting to determine the reason for this problem, it \n     became apparent that the station was grossly underfunded. \n     Which means that the staff must either take unwanted \n     shortcuts or continue to work beyond the point expected of \n     staffs at the other medical centers. While it is well \n     understood that the Veterans Health Administration is \n     underfunded throughout the system, it is clear from the \n     comparisons that this facility has not received a fair \n     distribution of the available resources resulting in the \n     deplorable situation now facing the health care team.\n       Another problem in Phoenix that must be addressed is the \n     serious space deficiency, especially in the clinical areas. \n     The ambulatory care area was designed to handle 60,000 annual \n     visits. In fiscal year 1993, the station provided 218,000 \n     annual visits, almost four times the design level. Many \n     physicians are required to conduct exams and provide \n     treatment from temporary cubicles set up inside the waiting \n     rooms. This bandaid approach has added to the already \n     overcrowding.\n       The other problem that we feel should be pointed out is \n     that of the staffing ceiling assigned to the Carl T. Hayden \n     Veterans Medical Center. Currently, the medical center has a \n     FTE of 1530 which is over the target staffing level. Based on \n     available reports, the medical center would need an \n     additional 61 registered nurses just to reach the average \n     Resource Program Management (RPM) within their group. This \n     facility operates with the lowest employee level in their \n     group when comparing facility work loads, and 158th overall. \n     To reach the average productivity level of the Veterans \n     Health Administration medical centers, they would need an \n     additional 348 full-time employees. While it is realized that \n     this station will never be permitted to enjoy that level of \n     staffing, it is felt that they, at the least, should have \n     been given some consideration for their staffing problems \n     during the latest White House ordered employee reductions.\n       To assist the medical center to meet their mandatory work \n     load, and the great influx of winter residents, it is \n     recommended that the $11.4 million which was reported to the \n     Arizona congressional delegation to have been given Phoenix \n     in addition to their FY 94 budget be provided. To enable the \n     station to handle the ever increasing ambulatory work load, \n     the Veterans Health Administration must approve the pending \n     request for leased clinic space in northwest Phoenix and, the \n     implementation plan for the use of the Williams Air Force \n     Base hospital as a satellite outpatient clinic, along with \n     the necessary funding to adequately operate the facility. In \n     addition, VHA should approve and fund, at a minimum, the \n     expansion of the medical centers clinical space onto the \n     Indian School land which was acquired for that purpose.\n       Approval of the above recommendations would make it much \n     easier for this medical center to meet the needs of the ever \n     increasing veteran population in the Phoenix area. There is \n     no indication that the increasing population trends will \n     change prior to the year 2020. This hospital cannot be \n     allowed to continue the downhill slide. The veterans of \n     Arizona deserve a fair deal and the medical staff should be \n     given the opportunity to provide top quality health care in a \n     much less stressful setting.\n       I would appreciate receiving your comments on the Phoenix \n     VA Medical Center at your earliest opportunity.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Frederico Juarbe, Jr.,\n                              Director, National Veterans Service.\n                                 ______\n\n         U.S. General Accounting Office, Health, Education, and \n           Human Services Division,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The Department of Veterans Affairs \n     (VA) is faced with the challenge of equitably allocating more \n     than $16 billion in health care appropriations across a \n     nationwide network of hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes. \n     The challenge is made greater by the shifting demographics of \n     veterans. While nationally the veteran population is \n     declining, veterans have migrated from northeastern and \n     midwestern states to southeastern and southwestern states in \n     the past decade, offsetting veteran deaths in these states.\n       VA has historically based its allocations to facilities \n     primarily on their past funding levels--providing incremental \n     increases to facilities' past budgets. In an effort to \n     improve its planning, allocation, and management processes, \n     VA made a considerable investment in implementing a new \n     system, called the Resource Planning and Management (RPM) \n     system, for use initially in fiscal year 1994. VA considers \n     RPM to be a management decision process to use to formulate \n     its budget, allocate most of its resources, and compare \n     facility performance.\\1\\ As the basis for resource \n     allocation, RPM classifies each patient into a clinical care \n     group, calculates average facility costs per patient, and \n     forecasts future workload. VA envisioned that the system \n     would improve VA's management of limited medical care \n     resources, better define future resource requirements, and \n     enable VA to explore opportunities to improve quality and \n     efficiency in its health care system. This vision included \n     improving the equity of its allocations by more closely \n     linking resources with facility workloads and alleviating \n     inconsistencies in veterans' access to care across the \n     system.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Two recent events could have significant implications for \n     VA's resource allocation system. First, VA is restructuring \n     its organization to establish 22 veterans integrated service \n     networks (VISN) that will replace four regional offices and \n     assume the individual facilities' role as the basic budgetary \n     and planning unit for health care delivery. The new structure \n     will require some change in how resources are allocated.\\2\\ \n     Second, the Senate passed your proposed amendment to the \n     VA appropriations bill that would require VA to develop a \n     plan for the allocation of health care resources among its \n     health care facilities to ensure that veterans have the \n     same access to quality health care.\\3\\\n       Because of your interest in this issue, you asked us to \n     review the equity of VA's resource allocation system, \n     particularly as it related to the allocations made to the \n     Carl T. Hayden Medical Center in Phoeniz, Arizona. More \n     specifically, you asked us to determine the following:\n       To what extent does VA's allocation system provide for an \n     equitable distribution of resources among VA facilities?\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\n       What are the causes of any inequity in the distribution of \n     resources, and what changes, if any, would help ensure that \n     the system more equitably distributes resources?\n       In September 1995, we sent you our preliminary \n     observations.\\4\\ This report presents our final results.\n       To accomplish our objectives, we first needed to apply a \n     definition of the term ``equity.'' We based our evaluation of \n     the equity of the system's distribution on VA's vision for \n     RPM.\\5\\ We considered the following two elements to be \n     characteristics of an equitable system:\n       It provides comparable resources for comparable workload.\n       It provides resources so that veterans within the same \n     priority categories have the same availability of care, to \n     the extent practical, throughout the VA health care system.\n       We then reviewed VA documents and analyzed RPM system data \n     to determine the degree to which these two elements were \n     present. We discussed potential reasons for any inequities in \n     allocations with VA Headquarters, the Boston Development \n     Center, the RPM Committee, and facility officials in several \n     locations. To assess potential changes to address inequities, \n     we discussed such changes with VA officials and reviewed VA \n     documents on its original plans for RPM and minutes of \n     several RPM committees and work groups. Further details of \n     our scope and methodology are in appendix I. We performed our \n     review between December 1994 and October 1995 in accordance \n     with generally accepted government auditing standards.\n\n\n                            results in brief\n\n       The resource allocation system gives VA the ability to \n     identify potential inequities in resource distribution and to \n     forecast workload changes. Data generated by the system show \n     wide differences in operating costs among facilities that VA \n     considers comparable, even after factors such as locality \n     costs and patient mix differences are considered. VA's data \n     also show some facilities' overall patient workloads \n     increasing by as much as 15 percent between 1993 and 1995, \n     and others' workloads declining by as much as 8 percent. \n     However, in the two budget cycles in which RPM has been in \n     effect, VA used it to make only minimal changes in \n     facilities' funding levels--the maximum loss to any facility \n     was about 1 percent of its past budget and the average gain \n     was also about 1 percent. As such, VA's distribution of \n     resources has remained almost exclusively related to \n     incremental changes to the amount that each facility has \n     received in the past.\n       To date, VA has chosen not to use the RPM system to help \n     ensure resources are allocated more equitably. VA officials \n     indicated that larger reallocations were not made during the \n     first 2 years of RPM to allow facilities time to understand \n     the process. VA officials also cited several other reasons \n     that significantly larger reallocations among facilities \n     could not be made. Although VA is taking some actions on \n     these issues, it has not fully addressed concerns that (1) \n     facilities cannot efficiently adjust to large budget changes, \n     (2) VA needs a better understanding of the reasons for the \n     variations, and (3) resources allocated to facilities outside \n     the RPM process should also be considered in judging the \n     equity of distributions. VA's reasons for not using RPM to \n     even out differences in veteran access to care were less \n     clear as there appeared to be confusion within VA about \n     whether the resource allocation system was intended to \n     achieve this goal.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ VA in 1995 operated 172 hospitals, 375 ambulatory \n     clinics, 133 nursing homes, and 39 domiciliaries. For \n     resource allocation purposes, RPM combines certain health \n     care facilities that are managerially associated. In total \n     the RPM system develops allocations for 167 facilities.\n     \\2\\ VA officials indicated that as part of this change, the \n     resource planning and management processes it used would \n     change and the system would be renamed. At the time of our \n     review, the system was known as RPM.\n     \\3\\ On September 26, 1995, the Senate adopted amendment \n     number 2787 to the VA appropriations bill, which was in \n     conference at the time of our review. If it becomes law, the \n     provision would require the Secretary of VA to develop a plan \n     for the allocation of health care resources to ensure that \n     veterans having similar economic status, eligibility \n     priority, and/or similar medical conditions have similar \n     access to care regardless of the region in which the veterans \n     reside. The plan will include, among other things, procedures \n     to identify reasons for variations in operating costs among \n     similar facilities.\n     \\4\\ See VA's Medical Resource Allocation System (GAO/HEHS-95-\n     252R, Sept. 12, 1995).\n     \\5\\ This vision was described in the Secretary's statements \n     to the Congress on RPM and in other VA publications.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am here to offer my enthusiastic support \nas an original cosponsor of Senator McCain's amendment. Mr. President, \nas a nation, we have always been able to come together in times of \ncrisis--especially in times of war.\n  Despite our sometimes vehement disagreements, we as citizens of this \ngreat country have always been able to put partisanship aside when our \nyoung men and women are called to fight for democracy. For this--we can \nall be very proud. But the strength of a nation is displayed not just \nduring war, but also in its aftermath. When the battles have long since \nraged, and the memories of welcome home parades have faded, it is at \nthis time when our Nation can proudly display its commitment to those \nwho fought the battles to keep this country free--our Nation's \nveterans. Mr. President, please take note when I say ``Our Nation's \nVeterans.'' They are not Florida's veterans or Arizona's veterans or \nNew York's veterans. They are our veterans, and we as a nation have a \ncollective responsibility to honor the commitment we made to them. When \nMembers of this honorable body, including my esteemed colleague from \nArizona, volunteered to do battle for America's freedom, no one asked \nwhat geographic region they came from. That question would have been so \ninsignificant as to border on the absurd.\n  Sadly, after our veterans returned home, and it is our turn to honor \nour commitments to them--where they live matters a great deal. Mr. \nPresident, just last month, the General Accounting Office published a \nrather startling report.\n  Allow me to highlight a few of the report's findings.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs has had a system in place for 3 \nyears, known as RPM--Resource Planning and Management--designed to give \nveterans better access to health care regardless of where they live. \nWhile not perfect, the system as designed would go a long way toward \nequal treatment for veterans.\n  However, despite the time, money, and effort put into designing such \na system--VA has chosen not to use it. Between 1993 and 1995, some VA \nfacilities' patient workloads have skyrocketed by as much as 15 \npercent. At other facilities, patient workloads have decreased by 8 \npercent.\n  Despite this wide disparity in patient workload change, the VA has \nused its own resource allocation system to change any given facility's \nbudget by the minuscule total of plus or minus 1 percent.\n  The decision to pay homage to bricks and mortar rather than to our \nNation's veterans has its price--and our Nation's veterans pay it. GAO \nreports that patient workload increases above historical workload are \nfunded at 17 cents on the dollar--so if a veteran moves from New York \nto Florida--he will get 83 percent less care solely because he moved. \nThat is not right.\n  Surely, though, the VA must have compelling reasons for not acting on \nthe RPM system. Surely, there must be terrible consequences should VA \ndecide to forgo the status quo. Again, sadly--no. VA's justifications \nfor inertia are weak--but here they are.\n  First, VA claims that facility managers will have difficulty in \nadjusting to the large budgetary changes that would come about should \nresource allocation become more equitable. Mr. President, isn't \nadjusting to budget fluctuations what makes for good management, and in \nthis case good government? In a private sector system, the chief \nexecutive of the hospital makes budgetary decisions based on \nforecasting patient workload on an annual basis. Why should we demand \nany less from the VA? Further, any difficulties VA facility managers \nhave in adjusting to budgetary changes pale in comparison to the \ndifficulties our veterans face as a result of VA's inertia. This seems \nto me, Mr. President, as a perfect example of the tail wagging the dog.\n  Second, the second justification for failing to treat veterans \nequally is that VA doesn't understand why some facilities are able to \nmake do with less funding while others require more resources for the \nsame number of patients. VA reasons that until it understands why some \nfacilities are more efficient than others, the agency won't implement a \nsystem that achieves fairness. Mr. President, it is a given that \nfacilities which receive more than their share of resources will use \nall of these resources and facilities which receive less than their \nshare will struggle and make do as best they can--rationing care along \nthe way. But there are breaking points for even the most efficient \nfacilities. And the consequences for these facilities fall squarely on \nour Nation's veterans and manifest themselves in concrete ways.\n  For instance, a veteran who would normally have to wait 2 weeks to \nsee an orthopedic surgeon may have to wait 6 months to see one should \nhe choose to retire to Florida and Arizona. Or, a veteran who used to \nget free prescription glasses up North is laughed out of the VA \nfacility down South. Because of this disparity, some\n\n[[Page S2293]]\n\nveterans are forced to move back home to get the care to which they are \naccustomed. Others simply give up in despair. Mr. President, we can \nhelp to rectify this inequity today. Right now. Our amendment would \nsimply mandate that VA develop a plan for their fair allocation of \nresources to ensure that veterans having similar economic status, \neligibility priority, and similar medical conditions have similar \naccess to care regardless of where they live. And in the end, providing \nequal care to all our Nation's veterans is what the VA health care \nsystem is all about.\n  We as politicians can quibble over such terms as construction \nprojects, resource allocation methodology, and patient workload, but \none thing is certain: We all have a stake in honoring our collective \ncommitment to our veterans--and they deserve no less.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the managers' amendment to the omnibus \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1996 includes a provision--added on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Kempthorne--to increase the appropriation \nfor Endangered Species Act listing activities by the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Serivce from $750,001 to $2,000,001. The total amount \navailable for the Fish and Wildlife Service's resource management \nactivities is increased by $1,249,999 to accommodate this addition to \nthe listing account. Senator Kempthrone and I proposed this amendment \nin order to address concerns raised during debate last week on the \nEndangered Species Act listing moratorium.\n  Let us review the bidding.\n  On March 13, the Senate approved a second-degree amendment offered by \nSenator Hutchison and Senator Kempthorne to Senator Reid's underlying \namendment to strike the moratorium on final listings under the \nEndangered Species Act. The Hutchison second-degree amendment imposes a \nmoratorium on final decisions to list species as threatened or \nendangered and on final decisions to designate critical habitat. \nHowever, the Hutchison amendment allows the Fish and Wildlife Service \nto use funds appropriated under the omnibus bill to issue emergency \nlistings, to propose species for listing, and to review and monitor \nspecies on the candidate list.\n  Mr. President, I oppose Senator Hutchison's second-degree amendment \nbecause I believe that a moratorium on adding species to the threatened \nand endangered list is wrong. Thus, I supported Senator Reid's \namendment to strike the provisions that would impose a moratorium on \nadding new species to the threatened and endangered lists. Make no \nmistake about it--I continue to oppose the provision in this bill that \nwould impose a moratorium on final decisions by the Secretary of the \nInterior or the Secretary of Commerce to list a species or to designate \ncritical habitat under the Endangered Species Act.\n  During the March 13 debate on the ESA moratorium, it was pointed out \nthat the second-degree amendment offered by Senators Hutchison and \nKempthorne increased the authority of the Fish and Wildlife Service, as \ncompared to that included in the underlying bill, but provided only $1 \nin new funding. This would have resulted in a difficult situation for \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service as appropriations for listing activities \nwould have been sorely inadequate to meet the needs and requirements of \nthe law. In other words, it would have been nearly impossible for the \nService to perform the tasks that are authorized under the Hutchison \nlanguage--tasks such as decisions on emergency listings or responses to \ncitizen petitions--without an increase in funding. The $1,249,999 that \nis added to the listing account under this amendment is intended to \nprovide the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service with funding necessary to \nperform emergency listings and other listing activities that are \nauthorized under the Hutchison amendment.\n  Mr. President, it was a pleasure to work with Senator Kempthorne and \nSenator Hutchison on this amendment. And, while I oppose the ESA \nlisting moratorium, I believe that--working together to secure \nadditional funding for listing activities--we have improved the \nprospects for orderly, effective research and conservation efforts by \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service. It is my hope that we can continue to \nwork together to enact responsible legislation to reauthorize the \nEndangered Species Act later this year.\n  I would like to thank Senators Hatfield and Gorton and their \nAppropriations Committee staff for their assistance with this \namendment. Also, I very much appreciate the willingness of Senator \nHatfield and of Senator Byrd to include this provision in the managers' \namendment.\n\n\n                      hiv-positive servicemembers\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 1996, which was signed into law by the President on \nFebruary 10, 1996, contains a provision which mandates the discharge of \nevery member of the Armed Forces who is HIV positive within 6 months.\n  At the present time, the services have in place procedures for \nmedically separating HIV-positive personnel who are physically \ndisabled. Those who are not disabled are placed in a nondeployable \nstatus but continue to perform military duties.\n  This is similar to the status of others whose medical condition--such \nas cancer, heart disease, asthma, and diabetes--restrict deployability \nbut not the capability to provide valuable military service.\n  The new procedure would require the Armed Forces to discharge, not \nlater than August 31, 1996, those who are physically capable of \nperforming their military duties and who are, today, providing valuable \nservice to the Nation.\n  The new mandatory discharge policy rejects the judgment of the Armed \nForces that HIV-positive servicemembers should be treated no \ndifferently from others whose medical condition renders them \nnondeployable.\n  That judgment was made by the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Reagan \nadministration, and was recently reemphasized by Secretary of Defense, \nBill Perry, and JCS Chairman, Gen. John Shalikashvili.\n  The new policy represents a sharp break with the traditional military \npractice of considering medical discharge on a case-by-case basis. In \nmy judgment, the new policy is unnecessary, wasteful, unfair, and \nunwise.\n  The new policy is unnecessary because HIV-positive personnel \nrepresent a tiny fraction of our Armed Forces. Out of the 1.4 million \nmembers of the Armed Forces on active duty, only 1,150 are HIV \npositive. That is less than one-tenth of 1 percent.\n  Moreover, these HIV-positive servicemembers constitute only one-fifth \npercent of the 5,000 personnel in the military who are permanently non-\ndeployable for medical reasons.\n  If we can usefully accommodate some 4,000 individuals who are non-\ndeployable for reasons other than HIV, there is no reason why we should \ndischarge the small additional fraction who are HIV positive.\n  The policy is wasteful because it will be throwing away the large \ninvestment the military has made in the training and experience of \nindividuals who can still make a valuable contribution to the Armed \nForces. Why throw away that investment at the peak of an individual's \ncareer?\n  Not only will the new policy waste our recruitment and training \ndollars, it will throw away invaluable experience.\n  Consider the case of the sergeant who has been married for 10 years, \nwho has a child, and who is HIV positive. His service record is full of \nhonors, including an award for automating a warehouse system that saved \nthe Navy an estimated $2 million over a 2-year period.\n  He has 12 years of service and has been HIV positive for 5 \nyears. There is reasonable likelihood that he could serve for many more \nyears, with the potential to develop systems that will save millions \nmore for the Navy.\n\n  This new policy will deprive him of his livelihood and deprive the \ntaxpayers of the contributions that he can make to greater efficiency \nand savings.\n  The new policy is unfair because it will leave many servicemembers \nwithout employment for themselves and health care for their families. \nThere is a sergeant with 13 years of service who is married, with three \nchildren. He is HIV positive, as is his wife and two of the three \nchildren.\n  Under the new policy, he is the only one of the family who will \nretain a right to DOD medical care. His family, including his HIV \npositive wife and two HIV positive children, will be excluded from any \nDOD health care.\n\n[[Page S2294]]\n\n  As a result of the bill, he will be discharged from service, lose his \nemployment, loss his retirement potential, and lose his family's \nmedical care.\n  This is an individual who is perfectly capable of performing military \nduties, yet we are going to throw away our investment in him and place \nhim in dire financial straits--even though those who are non-deployable \nfor reasons other than HIV will remain in service. That is unfair.\n  The new policy is unwise, because it could undermine the traditional \ndoctrine of judicial deference to Congress in the realm of military \npersonnel policy.\n  In a 1994 essay in the Wake Forest Law Review, I examined the Supreme \nCourt's precedents and concluded that the Court's jurisprudence \nreflected ``the highest degree of deference to the role of Congress and \nrespect for the judgment of the Armed Forces in the delicate task of \nbalancing the interests of national security and the rights of military \npersonnel.''\n  I also noted, however, that the Supreme Court emphasized that \nCongress is not free to disregard the Constitution when it acts in the \narea of military affairs. Consequently, it is essential that Congress \nact with care when it establishes procedures that would impose \nconditions on military service that would be constitutionally \nimpermissible in civilian life.\n  In the case of the new HIV discharge policy, we have not acted with \ncare. It is instructive to contrast the development of the new policy \nwith the process followed in 1993 when the legislative and executive \nbranch considered the policy on homosexuality in the Armed Forces.\n  In February 1993, Congress rejected an amendment that would have \nimposed a policy without any hearings of deliberation. Instead, we \nprovided for a 6 month detailed review within the executive branch and \nCongress.\n  That period provided an opportunity for the Department of Defense and \nCongress to hold hearings, receive testimony from the members of the \nArmed Forces, legal and academic experts, and interested members of the \npublic. The Senate Armed Services Committee alone complied a record of \nmore than 1,000 pages in testimony.\n  The hearing process and DOD reviews in 1993 were followed by \nthe development of a proposed DOD policy and specific legislation, \nincluding detailed legislative findings. The findings focused on clear \nexpert testimony on the impact on unit cohesion, morale, discipline, \nand military effectiveness.\n\n  The civilian and military leadership of the Department of Defense \nsupported the legislation; it was overwhelmingly approved after \nthorough debates in both the House and the Senate, was signed into law \nby the President, and has been defended by the Department of Justice in \nthe face of several legal challenges.\n  Although there may be disagreement on the merits of the 1993 policy, \nthe process ensured careful and thorough review by the legislative and \nexecutive branches of the relevant policy and constitutional issues. \nThe process was designed to provide for careful and thorough review. \nThe contrast to the development of the new HIV policy could not be more \nstriking.\n  There has been no review within the executive branch. In fact, the \nmilitary leadership views the policy as unnecessary and unfair.\n  The House did not develop a detailed legislative record, and the \nprovision was not even included in the Senate-passed bill.\n  There is not a clearly articulated legislative basis for treating \nHIV-positive personnel in a manner that differs from the treatment of \nother nondeployables.\n  In the absence of careful legislative consideration, it could be \ndifficult for the new policy to survive a constitutional challenge--\nparticularly in terms of the weak arguments for the policy.\n  Supporters of the provision have relied primarily on three reasons to \njustify the provision.\n  First, they believe that the retention of HIV-positive personnel \ndegrades unit readiness. There has been no showing, however, that the \nsmall fraction of nondeployable personnel who are HIV positive have a \nsignificantly greater impact in this regard than the large number of \npersons who are nondeployable for other reasons.\n  The second reason given for the policy is to establish deployment \nequity on the grounds that if a person is nondeployable, other \nservicemembers stand a greater risk of deployment. That concern might \nbe appropriate if the numbers were significantly greater and if the HIV \npositive personnel were the only nondeployables. For example, if the \nnumber of HIV positive personnel in the Marine Corps were to become a \nsignificant percentage, then the HIV policy would have to be \nreconsidered together with the policies that retain servicemembers who \nare medically nondeployable for reasons such as cancer, diabetes, \nasthma, and heart disease.\n  This however, is not the case today. The numbers are tiny and the \npersons who are nondeployable for other reasons greatly outnumber those \nwho are HIV positive.\n  The third rationale offered by supporters of the policy is that \ndischarge is warranted because, it is asserted, persons who are HIV \npositive likely contracted the infection through sexual misconduct or \ndrug abuse.\n  There are two problems with this argument. First, it ignores the \nwell-established medical fact that HIV can and often is \ntransmitted through actions that do not involve military misconduct, \nsuch as blood transfusions and heterosexual conduct.\n\n  Second, there are ample administrative and judicial procedures in the \nArmed Forces to discipline those who engage in misconduct involving sex \nand drugs. The record does not establish a military need to discharge \nall who are HIV positive in order to maintain good order and \ndiscipline.\n  The administration, believing the new provision to be \nunconstitutional, has determined that it will obey the law but not \ndefend it in court.\n  As a result, the judiciary will be thrust into the midst of a \nconstitutional debate on a controversial military personnel matter with \na sparse legislative record and a severe split between Congress and the \nPresident.\n  It is an invitation to undermine the doctrine of deference, which has \nserved so well and so long to ensure that the Armed Forces have the \ntools necessary to maintain good order and discipline without \ninterference from the courts.\n  For that reason alone, the provision should be repealed.\n  This provision was not part of the Senate-passed authorization bill. \nI opposed this provision during the conference with the House of \nRepresentatives on the authorization bill and I spoke out against it on \nthe floor of the Senate during debate on the conference report.\n  Today, I support the amendment that would repeal this provision.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, despite my objections to the omnibus \nappropriations bill, I am pleased that it includes an amendment \noverturning the prohibition on military service by HIV-positive \npersonnel. As my colleagues are aware, this grossly unfair prohibition \nwas established in the fiscal year 1996 DOD authorization bill and will \nbecome effective this summer.\n  I opposed the fiscal year 1996 DOD authorization bill largely because \nof this provision. The day the Senate approved that provision, I vowed \nto mount an effort for repeal. I am pleased that today, the full Senate \nhas joined in that fight.\n  The policy now in effect--developed in the Reagan and Bush \nadministration--works well. The amendment contained in this bill \nreinstates the current policy, in which military personnel who test \npositive for the HIV virus are permitted to keep their jobs, so long as \nthey are physically able.\n  Currently, HIV-positive personnel are treated in the same manner as \nother soldiers with chronic ailments such as diabetes and heart \ndisease. Only about 20 percent of the roughly 6,000 worldwide \nnondeployable troops are HIV positive.\n  Dismissing all HIV-positive soldiers makes no sense. Why should the \nPentagon fire military personnel who perform their duties well and \nexhibit no signs of illness? This would waste millions of tax dollars \nin unnecessary separation and retraining costs.\n  Backers of this provision argue that HIV-provision personnel degrade \nreadiness because they are not eligible for worldwide deployment. This \nargument is absurd. Can anyone seriously contend that about 1,000 \npersonnel--less than 0.1 percent of the active force--could have a \nmeaningful impact on readiness?\n\n[[Page S2295]]\n\n  Assistant Secretary of Defense Fred Pang clearly expressed the \nDepartment's position, writing,\n\n       As long as these members can perform their required duties, \n     we see no prudent reason to separate and replace them because \n     of their antibody status. However, as with any Service \n     member, if their condition affects their performance of duty, \n     then the Department initiates separation action . . . the \n     proposed provision would not improve military readiness or \n     the personnel policies of the Department.\n\n  Lt. Gen. Theodore Stroup, Jr., Army Deputy Chief of Staff for \nPersonnel has echoed these sentiments, writing,\n\n       It is my personal opinion that HIV-infected soldiers who \n     are physically fit for duty should be allowed to continue on \n     active duty.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a column I wrote on this subject for the \nLos Angeles Times be printed at this point in the Record.\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Feb. 6, 1996]\n\n                   Congress Misses the ``Magic'' Show\n\n\n   military: a bill ousting the hiv-positive has nothing to do with \n                 readiness; it's simply discrimination\n\n                           (By Barbara Boxer)\n\n       Americans cheered last week as Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson \n     triumphantly returned to the Los Angeles Lakers. In just 27 \n     minutes, he scored 19 points and dispelled any remaining \n     doubt about his ability to compete at the highest level.\n       To their credit, Magic's fans, coaches, teammates and even \n     his NBA opponents welcomed him back with open arms. Imagine \n     how absurd it would be if Congress, just as Magic \n     demonstrated his Hall of Fame talent, passed a law requiring \n     the NBA to fire all basketball players who have the HIV \n     virus.\n       This past week, Congress did something just that absurd.\n       A little-noticed provision of the annual military spending \n     bill requires the Pentagon to fire all soldiers, sailors and \n     Marines who test positive for the HIV virus, even if they \n     perform their duties as skillfully as Magic Johnson makes a \n     no-look pass. The military strongly objected to this \n     provision, but Congress did not care. The president has \n     called the new policy unfair, but because it is part of a \n     larger bill that includes urgently needed funding for our \n     troops in Bosnia, he will sign it into law.\n       Under current policy, military personnel with the HIV virus \n     are permitted to remain in the services as long as they are \n     able to perform their duties. If their health deteriorates, \n     the military initiates separation procedures and provides \n     disability benefits and continued health insurance coverage \n     for them and their dependents. So they can remain near health \n     care providers, military personnel with HIV are placed on \n     ``worldwide nondeployable status,'' which means that they \n     cannot be sent on overseas missions. Soldiers with other \n     serious chronic illnesses, such as severe asthma, cancer and \n     diabetes are also nondeployable. In fact, only about 20 \n     percent of the more than 5,000 nondeployable personnel are \n     infected with HIV.\n       The congressional authors of the new policy, led by Rep. \n     Robert K. Dornan of Orange County, argue that nondeployable \n     personnel degrade military readiness because they cannot be \n     sent overseas. However, their true motive appears to be less \n     lofty than protecting the readiness of our forces. The new \n     policy irrationally singles out military personnel with HIV. \n     If backers truly believe that nondeployable personnel harmed \n     readiness, why wouldn't they seek to oust soldiers with \n     diabetes and asthma? The only conceivable answer is that \n     readiness is not their real motivation. Their motivation is \n     discrimination, pure and simple.\n       Can anyone seriously contend that 1,059 HIV-positive \n     soldiers--less than 0.1 percent of the total force--can \n     meaningfully affect readiness? The Pentagon doesn't think so. \n     Its top personnel policy expert, Assistant Defense Secretary \n     Fred Pang, recently wrote that ``as long as these members can \n     perform their required duties, we see no prudent reason to \n     separate and replace them . . . The proposed provision would \n     not improve military readiness or the personnel policies of \n     the department.''\n       If Magic Johnson can run and leap with the best of them, \n     why can't a military clerk file with the best of them, or a \n     military driver drive with the best of them?\n       Perhaps the worst aspect of the new policy is its total \n     rejection of the compassion and camaraderie for which the \n     armed forces are rightfully praised. The United States of \n     America does not kick its soldiers when they are down. We \n     have a proud tradition of standing by those courageous enough \n     to dedicate their careers to the defense of our nation. That \n     tradition will end the day this new policy is enacted.\n       Military personnel discharged under the new policy will \n     lose their jobs even if they exhibit no signs of illness. \n     They will lose their right to disability benefits and their \n     spouses and children will lose their health care coverage. \n     This policy is worse than wrong, it is un-American.\n       The same day that President Clinton signs the bill that \n     includes this new policy, a bipartisan group of senators will \n     introduce legislation to repeal it. The president and our \n     senior military leaders support repeal. Despite their strong \n     support, the odds are unclear. But I am certain about one \n     thing: Those who vote ``no'' should take a good look in the \n     mirror.\n\n\n                         disaster-related funds\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, my amendment will require that any \ndisaster-related funds earmarked in this bill for specific projects by \nFederal agencies will be allocated according to the established, \npriority-based procedures of those agencies.\n  This amendment would ensure that funds disaster-related funding \nallocated by the Economic Development Administration, the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, the Small Business Administration, and the National Park \nService, will be awarded based on need--and not according to \nunauthorized earmarks.\n  This amendment will not reduce the funding in this bill, nor direct \nthese agencies to give preferential priority to any particular project, \nState, or region of the country.\n  This proposal is entirely fair and equitable to all of the States and \ncommunities that we represent. It plays no favorites, and offers no \nadvantages to individuals who may be well-intentioned in their desire \nto receive funding for a local project. This amendment will simply \nensure that taxpayer funding made available under this appropriations \nbill will be spent according to recognized priorities, as opposed to \ncongressionally mandated earmarks.\n  Let me discuss just one example of what I believe is an inappropriate \nexpenditure of taxpayer dollars that was added to the legislation \nbefore us. Last week, an amendment was offered to this bill, and \nadopted without a recorded vote, that would provide a total of $13.8 \nmillion for an unauthorized flood control project.\n  That amendment directs the Economic Development Administration [EDA] \nto spend $10 million for flood control work at Devil's Lake Basin in \nNorth Dakota; it also directs the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to \nspend $3.8 million for related work at Devils Lake Basin. The \napproximately $14 million in new taxpayer dollars for this project was \nnot requested by the agencies to be funded in this bill, nor was the \nproject subjected to any competitive evaluation process by the EDA or \nHUD.\n  Mr. President, I don't think this is how the Senate should be doing \nbusiness. And I definitely don't think this is how we should be \nspending taxpayer's dollars, at a time when we have scarce resources \nwith which to address many serious disaster needs across the country.\n  I believe earmarking funds for a specific project is unfair, \nespecially with respect to vital flood control programs. It clearly \nundermines the competitive-review process that ensures that the most \nurgent needs of distressed cities and townships all across America are \nproperly addressed.\n  While I'm sure that this situation in North Dakota is worthy of \nattention, we have no way of knowing that it represents the most \nserious need for Federal emergency assistance.\n  As most of my colleagues are aware, the Economic Development \nAdministration [EDA] provides grants for infrastructure programs and \ncommunity projects in economically distressed areas. In doing so, the \nEDA is barraged with hundreds and hundreds more requests for Federal \naid than they can possibly fulfill. In fact, Mr. President, the EDA has \nsuch a backlog on official funding requests that they stopped accepting \nadditional applications almost a year ago.\n  The EDA makes its funding awards through its regional offices on a \ncompetitive, agency-review basis. Right now the EDA has almost 600 \nfunding requests awaiting final decisions--600. These requests \nrepresent the pleas of communities across the United States for help \nfrom the Federal Government due to military base closures, job losses, \nnatural disaster, and declining local economies. Nationally, the EDA \nhas received over $320 million in community-based funding requests that \nlocal officials and residents are anxiously awaiting an answer on.\n  Clearly, the EDA has an extremely difficult task in deciding which \nprojects to fund. They do so by considering factors such as an areas' \nper capita income; unemployment rate; the local poverty level; the loss \nof population in the community; and the general distress level of \nresidents in the area. There will always be more disappointed \napplicants than there are\n\n[[Page S2296]]\n\nwinners in a competitive system, but at least the EDA is utilizing a \nset of economic criteria to ensure that the taxpayer dollars it \nadministers are scrutinized, and flow to the projects which represent \ntruly compelling needs.\n  Mr. President, we have before us a mammoth new appropriations bill \nwhich presents an inviting target for Members to evade this competitive \nsystem, and bypass its reasonable guidelines for the expenditure of \ntaxpayer dollars. The earmark added to this bill effectively sweeps \naside higher priority requests, and arbitrarily puts one unauthorized \nproject at the head of the line. Instead of a community receiving flood \ncontrol assistance because it's needs are urgent and meritorious, this \none project will prevail over hundreds of others because it secured \npolitical support. Well intentioned support, I'm sure, but unfair \nnonetheless.\n  As I have said many times on this floor, Mr. President, during one of \nmy many unsuccessful attempts to curb the Congress's seemingly \nunquenchable thirst for more spending, my criticisms about this \nspecific project is about process. I in no way contend that the Devils \nLake Basin flood control program is unnecessary. I fully recognize that \nthe Senators from North Dakota are affirmatively responding to requests \nfor assistance from some of their constituents.\n  What I do contend is that the Senate should not respond to such \nrequests--requests that all 100 Members of this body receive on a daily \nbasis--in a manner that circumvents a thorough, merit-based process, \nand substitutes quick-and-easy earmarks in yet another emergency \nspending bill.\n  While I am opposed to the Senate again condoning what I feel is an \nindefensible process, let me state that I have not offered this \namendment out of any respect for endless bureaucratic analysis; I offer \nit because there are dire problems facing our communities and the \ntaxpayers who support them, and it is wrong to subvert their efforts to \nplay by the rules when they are in need of Federal disaster aid.\n  Again, I don't question the possible benefits of the Devil's Lake \nBasin project. I do question the wisdom in the Senate boosting it to \nthe head of the line for funding from the Economic Development \nAdministration, when there are 84 other project's among North Dakota's \nneighboring States that are also anxiously awaiting funding. Unlike \nDevil's Lake Basin, however, these communities are properly competing \nfor funding from the EDA for their disaster needs.\n  I have been advised by the EDA, Mr. President, that they did not \nrequest funding for the Devil's Lake Basin project, nor have the \nproject's sponsors officially filed a request for funds with the EDA's \nDenver Regional Office, which allocates funding to North Dakota and \nnine other Western and Midwestern States. Therefore, dozens of \ncommunities in States such as Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota, \nIowa, Wyoming, and Utah will continue to have their needs go \nunaddressed by EDA, while $10 million in new moneys they might have \ncompeted for will instead be diverted to a single project.\n  I am not talking about mere pennies, either. The total earmark for \nthe Devils Lake Basin project in this bill is larger than the entire \nexpected budget of the EDA's Denver Regional Office for fiscal year \n1996. This one project will receive almost $13 million in Federal aid, \nwhile 84 communities in the above 9 States will have to compete with \neach other for the $11 million that the Denver office is anticipating \nfor this year. Without a doubt, a number of these requests are \nemergency projects.\n  Regrettably, many communities who have developed meritorious \nproposals, and are willing to play by the rules by competing for scarce \ntaxpayer dollars, will never get a dime from the EDA.\n  Obviously, Mr. President, every Senator in this body is interested in \nreceiving Federal funds for infrastructure and disaster aid for their \nState. I'm certainly no exception. Arizona has over $6 million in \nrequests pending with the EDA, some of which have been pending for \nseveral years. For Arizona to even have a chance at having one project \nfunded, communities in my State must compete with 115 requests from \nseven other States in Region 7, which includes California, Idaho, \nAlaska, and Hawaii. These States currently have over $100 million in \nrequests pending at the EDA. Most of these will be rejected due to the \nintense competition, yet Devils Lake Basin is guaranteed $10 million \nwithout having to face any competition.\n  The $3.8 million earmark for the Devils Lake Basin project in this \nbill from the Fish and Wildlife Service is similar in the respect that \nit was not officially requested by the agency, in its submission to the \nAppropriations Committee for inclusion in this bill. There are other \nearmarks in the bill, as well.\n  The amendment I am offering is very simple, and entirely fair to \nevery Member of this body, and every State in our Nation. It simply \nsays that funding provided in this bill to the EDA, the Fish and \nWildlife Service, HUD, and other agencies will be awarded according to \nthe established prioritization process of those agencies.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep concern about \nthe title VIII of the pending appropriations bill, the so-called Prison \nLitigation Reform Act [PLRA].\n  Its proponents say that the PLRA is merely an attempt to reduce \nfrivolous prisoner litigation over trivial matters. In reality, the \nPLRA is a far-reaching effort to strip Federal courts of the authority \nto remedy unconstitutional prison conditions. The PLRA is itself \npatently unconstitutional, and a dangerous legislative incursion into \nthe work of the judicial branch.\n  In my view, the effort to enact this proposal as part of an omnibus \nappropriations bill is inappropriate. Although a version of the PLRA \nwas introduced as a free-standing bill and referred to the Judiciary \nCommittee, it was never the subject of a committee mark-up, and there \nis no Judiciary Committee report explaining the proposal. The PLRA was \nthe subject of a single hearing in the Judiciary Committee, hardly the \ntype of thorough review that a measure of this scope deserves.\n  At the hearing, Associate Attorney General John Schmidt expressed \nserious concerns about the feasibility and consequences of the PLRA. \nWhile Mr. Schmidt did not take issue with provisions in the PLRA that \nmerely seek to curb frivolous prison litigation, he noted that other \naspects of the proposal would radically and unwisely curtail the power \nof the Federal courts to remedy constitutional and statutory violations \nin prisons, jails, and juvenile detention facilities.\n  I understand that my colleague from Illinois intends to include \nrelevant excerpts of Mr. Schmidt's testimony in the Record, but I will \njust highlight several of the objections that he raised, all of which I \nshare. Mr. Schmidt observed that:\n\n       The effort to terminate all existing consent decrees \n     ``raise[s] serious constitutional problems'' under doctrines \n     reaffirmed by the Supreme Court as recently as this year;\n       Provisions limiting the power of federal courts to issue \n     relief in prison conditions cases would ``create a very \n     substantial impediment to the settlement of prison conditions \n     suits--even if all interested parties are fully satisfied \n     with the proposed resolution.'' ``This would result in \n     litigation that no one wants . . . and could require judicial \n     resolution of matters that would otherwise be more promptly \n     resolved by the parties in a mutually agreeable manner'';\n       The proposal to terminate relief two years after issuance \n     is misguided because, in those cases where the problems have \n     not been remedied, the ``Justice Department and other \n     Plaintiffs would have to refile cases in order to achieve the \n     objectives of the original order, and defendants would have \n     the burden of responding to these new suits. Both for reasons \n     of judicial economy, and for the effective protection of \n     constitutional rights, we should aim at the resolution of \n     disputes without unnecessary litigation and periodic \n     disruption of ongoing remedial efforts.''\n\n  All of these problems remain in the legislative language before us \ntoday.\n  In addition, I call to the attention of my colleagues an assessment \nprepared by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts dated \nJune 21, 1995. The Office found that the ``potential annual resource \ncosts of [the bill] could be more than $239 million and 2,096 \npositions, of which at least 280 would be judicial officers--Article \nIII judges and/or magistrate judges.'' The bill appropriates no funds \nto the Federal judiciary to offset this enormous fiscal impact.\n  Finally, I note with great concern that the bill would set a \ndangerous precedent for stripping the Federal courts of the ability to \nsafeguard the\n\n[[Page S2297]]\n\ncivil rights of powerless and disadvantaged groups.\n  I do not intend to offer an amendment to this bill, because it is \nclear that a majority of the Senate would not vote to strike the \nprovision, and I do not believe the Senate is positioned to consider \ndetailed improvements to the PLRA during debate on this omnibus \nappropriations bill. But the abbreviated nature of the legislative \nprocess should not suggest that the proposal is noncontroversial in \nCongress.\n  It is my hope that after the President vetoes this bill, as I expect \nhe will, that the administration seek to negotiate changes in the PLRA \nthat remedy the profound constitutional, fiscal, and practical problems \noutlined by Mr. Schmidt and other experts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter sent by myself and \nfour other Senators to the Attorney General on this subject be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 1996.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General of the United States, Department of Justice, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Attorney General: We write to express our \n     concern about aspects of the Prison Litigation Reform Act \n     (PLRA), which has passed Congress as title VIII of the \n     Commerce, State, and Justice Departments Appropriations bill. \n     President Clinton vetoed this appropriations bill on December \n     18, but it is our understanding that issues such as the PLRA \n     may be the subject of negotiations between the Administration \n     and members of the Appropriations Committees in the coming \n     weeks.\n       We do not take issue with provisions in the PLRA that \n     merely seek to curb frivolous prison litigation. But in other \n     respects, the PLRA is far reaching legislation that would \n     unwisely reduce the power of the federal courts to remedy \n     constitutional and statutory violations in prisons, jails, \n     and juvenile detention facilities.\n       PLRA was considered as one of many issues on the \n     appropriations bill. For this reason, PLRA passed on a voice \n     vote following relatively brief debate. But the manner in \n     which the bill passed the Senate should not suggest to you \n     that the Senate considers the proposal to be entirely \n     noncontroversial.\n       In particular, we share some of the concerns that Associate \n     Attorney General John R. Schmidt raised in his testimony \n     before the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 27, 1995. Mr. \n     Schmidt noted that provisions limiting the power of federal \n     courts to issue relief in prison conditions cases would \n     ``create a very substantial impediment to the settlement of \n     prison conditions suits--even if all interested parties are \n     fully satisifed with the proposed resolution.'' ``This would \n     result in litigation that no one wants . . . and could \n     require judicial resolution of matters that would otherwise \n     be more promptly resolved by the parties in a mutually \n     agreeable manner.''\n       Mr. Schmidt also pointed out that the proposal to terminate \n     relief two years after issuance is troublesome because, in \n     those cases where the problems have not been remedied, the \n     ``Justice Department and other Plaintiffs would have to \n     refile cases in order to achieve the objectives of the \n     original order, and defendants would have the burden of \n     responding to these new suits. Both for reasons of judicial \n     economy, and for the effective protection of constitutional \n     rights, we should aim at the resolution of disputes without \n     unnecessary litigation and periodic disruption of ongoing \n     remedial efforts.''\n       These problems have not been remedied by the changes made \n     to the proposal since Mr. Schmidt's testimony.\n       We also call to your attention an assessment prepared by \n     the Administrative Office of the United States Courts dated \n     June 21, 1995. The Office found that the ``potential annual \n     resource costs of [the bill] could be more than $239 million \n     and 2,096 positions, of which at least 280 would be judicial \n     officers (Article III judges and/or magistrate judges).'' The \n     bill appropriates no funds to the federal judiciary to offset \n     this enormous fiscal impact.\n       We suggest that the Administration negotiate changes in the \n     PLRA that remedy the serious fiscal and practical problems \n     outlined by Mr. Schmidt and other experts.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Fred Thompson.\n     Jim Jeffords.\n     Ted Kennedy.\n     Joe Biden.\n     Jeff Bingaman.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I join Senator Kennedy in raising my strong \nconcerns about the Prison Litigation Reform Act, a section of S. 1594. \nIn attempting to curtail frivolous prisoner lawsuits, this legislation \ngoes much too far, and instead may make it impossible for the Federal \ncourts to remedy constitutional and statutory violations in prisons, \njails, and juvenile detention facilities. No doubt there are prisoners \nwho bring baseless suits that deserve to be thrown out of court. But \nunfortunately, in many instances there are legitimate claims that \ndeserve to be addressed. History is replete with examples of egregious \nviolations of prisoners' rights. These cases reveal abuses and inhumane \ntreatment which cannot be justified no matter what the crime. In \nseeking to curtail frivolous lawsuits, we cannot deprive individuals of \ntheir basic civil rights. We must find the proper balance.\n  My colleague from Illinois, Associate U.S. Attorney General John \nSchmidt, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 27, \n1995, and raised numerous concerns about this legislation. I have \nincluded a copy of his comments for my colleagues to review. I should \nalso note that at the same hearing, former Attorney General Barr of the \nBush administration, agreed with the assertion that there are \nconstitutional problems with the bill as drafted which have not yet \nbeen addressed.\n  As outlined in Mr. Schmidt's testimony, the bill has so many problems \nthat I cannot list them all here. So let me describe just a few. First, \nthe bill severely limits the options available to States and courts in \nremedying legitimate complaints. For example, the bill makes it \nvirtually impossible for States to enter into consent decrees even when \nthe consent decree may well be in the State's best interest for both \nfiscal and policy reasons. Similarly, this legislation, by creating new \nand burdensome standards of review, would effectively prohibit courts \nfrom placing population caps on prisons. Prison overcrowding obviously \ncreates a serious threat to the general public, as well as to prison \nstaffs and the inmates themselves. We must not exacerbate this problem. \nFurthermore, the bill places undue burdens on States and courts by \nrequiring that relief be terminated 2 years after issuance even in \ncases where the problems have not been remedied\n  I am very discouraged that this legislation was considered as one of \nmany issues on an appropriations bill. Legislation with such far \nreaching implications certainly deserves to be thoroughly examined by \nthe committee of jurisdiction and not passed as a rider to an \nappropriations bill. I urge the White House to carefully review these \nprovisions and work with Congress to make the necessary changes to \nremedy the myriad of constitutional and practical problems found in \nthis far-reaching legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the relevant portions of Mr. Schmidt's \ntestimony be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the testimony was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Testimony of John Schmidt\n\n\n                reforms relating to prisoner litigation\n\n       The Department also supports improvements of the criminal \n     justice system through the implementation of other reforms. \n     Several pending bills under consideration by the Senate \n     contain three sets of reforms that are intended to curb \n     abuses or perceived excesses in prisoner litigation or prison \n     conditions suits.\n       The first set of provisions appears in title II of H.R. 667 \n     as passed by the House of Representatives, and in Sec. 103 of \n     S. 3. These provisions strengthen the requirement of \n     exhaustion of administrative remedies under the Civil Rights \n     of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA) for state prisoner \n     suits, and adopt other safeguards against abusive prisoner \n     litigation. We have endorsed these reforms in an earlier \n     communication to Congress.\\1\\ We also recommend that parallel \n     provisions be adopted to required federal prisoners to \n     exhaust administrative remedies prior to commencing \n     litigation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Letter of Assistant General Shalla F. Anthony to \n     Honorable Henry J. Hyde concerning H.R. 3, at 17-19 (January \n     26, 1995).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The second set of provisions appears in a new bill, S. 866, \n     which we have not previously commented on. The provisions in \n     this bill have some overlap with those in Sec. 103 of S. 3 \n     and title II of H.R. 667, but also incorporate a number of \n     new proposals. We support the objectives of S. 866 and many \n     of the specific provisions in the bill. In some instances, we \n     have recommendations for alternative formulations that could \n     realize the bill's objectives more effectively.\n       The third set of provisions appears in S. 400, and in title \n     III of H.R. 667 as passed by the House of Representatives, \n     the ``Stop Turning Out Prisoners'' (STOP) proposal. The \n     Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 enacted \n     18 U.S.C. 3626, which limits remedies in prison conditions \n     litigation. The STOP proposal would amend this section to \n     impose various additional conditions and restrictions. We \n     support the\n\n[[Page S2298]]\n\n     basic objective of this legislation, including particularly \n     the principle that judicial caps on prison populations must \n     be used only as a last resort when no other remedy is \n     available for a constitutional violation, although we have \n     constitutional or policy concerns about a few of its specific \n     provisions.\n\n      A. The Provisions in Sec. 103 of S. 3 and H.R. 667 title II\n\n       As noted above, we support the enactment of this set of \n     provisions.\n       The Civil Rights of Institutionalized Person Act (42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1997e) currently authorizes federal courts to suspend \n     Sec. 1983 suits by prisoners for up to 180 days in order to \n     require exhaustion of administrative remedies. Section \n     103(a)-(b), (e) of S. 3 strengthens the administrative \n     exhaustion rules in this context--and brings it more into \n     line with administrative exhaustion rules that apply in other \n     contexts--by generally prohibiting prisoner Sec. 1983 suits \n     until administrative remedies are exhausted.\n       As noted above, we recommend that this proposal also \n     incorporate a rule requiring federal prisoners to exhaust \n     administrative remedies prior to commencing litigation. A \n     reform of this type is as desirable for federal prisoners as \n     the corresponding strengthening of the exhaustion provision \n     for state prisoners that now appears in section 103 of S. 3. \n     We would be pleased to work with interested members of \n     Congress in formulating such a provision.\n       Section 103(c) of S. 3 directs a court to dismiss a \n     prisoner Sec. 1983 suit if the court is satisfied that the \n     action fails to state a claim upon which relief can be \n     granted or is frivolous or malicious. A rule of this type is \n     desirable to minimize the burden on states of responding \n     unnecessarily to prisoner suits that lack merit and are \n     sometimes brought for purposes of harassment or recreation.\n       Section 103(d) of S. 3 deletes from the minimum standards \n     for prison grievance systems in 42 U.S.C. 1997e(b)(2) the \n     requirement of an advisory role for employees and inmates \n     (at the most decentralized level as is reasonably \n     possible) in the formulation, implementation, and \n     operation of the system. This removes the condition that \n     has been the greatest impediment in the past to the \n     willingness of state and local jurisdictions to seek \n     certification for their grievance systems.\n       Section 103(f) of S. 3 strengthens safeguards against and \n     sanctions for false allegations of poverty by prisoners who \n     seek to proceed in forma pauperis. Subsection (d) of 28 \n     U.S.C. 1915 currently reads as follows: ``The court may \n     request an attorney to represent any such person unable to \n     employ counsel and may dismiss the case if the allegation of \n     poverty is untrue, or if satisfied that the action is \n     frivolous or malicious.'' Section 103(f)(1) of S. 3 amends \n     that subsection to read as follows: ``The court may request \n     an attorney to represent any such person unable to employ \n     counsel and shall at any time dismiss the case if the \n     allegation of poverty is untrue, or if satisfied that the \n     action fails to state a claim upon which relief may be \n     granted or is frivolous or malicious even if partial filing \n     fees have been imposed by the court.''\n       Section 103(f)(2) of S. 3 adds a new subsection (f) to 28 \n     U.S.C. 1915 which states that an affidavit of indigency by a \n     prisoner shall include a statement of all assets the prisoner \n     possesses. The new subsection further directs the court to \n     make inquiry of the correctional institution in which the \n     prisoner is incarcerated for information available to that \n     institution relating to the extent of the prisoner's assets. \n     This is a reasonable precaution. The new subsection concludes \n     by stating that the court ``shall require full or partial \n     payment of filing fees according to the prisoner's ability to \n     pay.'' We would not understand this language as limiting the \n     court's authority to require payment by the prisoner in \n     installments, up to the full amount of filing fees and other \n     applicable costs, where the prisoner lacks the means to make \n     full payment at once.\n\n                               B. S. 866\n\n       Section 2 in S. 866 amends the in forma pauperis statute, \n     28 U.S.C. 1915, in the following manner: (1) The authority to \n     allow a suit without prepayment of fees--as opposed to \n     costs--in subsection (a) is deleted. (2) A prisoner bringing \n     a suit would have to submit a statement of his prison account \n     balance for the preceding six months. (3) A prisoner would be \n     liable in all cases to pay the full amount of a filing fee. \n     An initial partial fee of 20% of the average monthly deposits \n     to or average monthly balance in the prisoner's account would \n     be required, and thereafter the prisoner would be required to \n     make monthly payments of 20% of the preceding month's income \n     credited to the account, with the agency having custody of \n     the prisoner forwarding such payments whenever the amount in \n     the account exceeds $10. However, a prisoner would not be \n     barred from bringing any action because of inability to pay \n     the initial partial fee. (4) If a judgment against a prisoner \n     includes the payment of costs, the prisoner would be \n     required to pay the full amount of costs ordered, in the \n     same manner provided for the payment of filing fees by the \n     amendments.\n       In essence, the point of these amendments is to ensure that \n     prisoners will be fully liable for filing fees and costs in \n     all cases, subject to the proviso that prisoners will not be \n     barred from suing because of this liability if they are \n     actually unable to pay. We support this reform in light of \n     the frequency with which prisoners file frivolous and \n     harassing suits, and the general absence of other \n     disincentives to doing so.\n       However, the complicated standards and detailed numerical \n     prescriptions in this section are not necessary to achieve \n     this objective. It would be adequate to provide simply that \n     prisoners are fully liable for fees and costs, that their \n     applications must be accompanied by certified prison account \n     information, and that funds from their accounts are to be \n     forwarded periodically when the balance exceeds a specified \n     amount (such as $10) until the liability is discharged. We \n     would be pleased to work with the sponsors to refine this \n     proposal.\n       In addition to these amendments relating to fees and costs, \n     Sec. 2 of S. 866 strengthens 28 U.S.C. 1915(d) to provide \n     that the court shall dismiss the case at any time if the \n     allegation of poverty is untrue or if the action is frivolous \n     or malicious or fails to state a claim. This is substantially \n     the same as provisions included in Sec. 103 of S. 3 and title \n     II of H.R. 667, which we support.\n       Section 3 of S. 866 essentially directs courts to review as \n     promptly as possible suits by prisoners against governmental \n     entities or their officers or employees, and to dismiss such \n     suits if the complaint fails to state a claim or seeks \n     monetary relief from an immune defendant. This is a desirable \n     provision that could avoid some of the burden on states and \n     local governments of responding to nonmeritorious prisoner \n     suits.\n       Section 6 provides that a court may order revocation of \n     good time credits for federal prisoners if (1) the court \n     finds that the prisoner filed a malicious or harassing civil \n     claim or testified falsely or otherwise knowingly presented \n     false evidence or information to the court, or (2) the \n     Attorney General determines that one of these circumstances \n     has occurred and recommends revocation of good time credit to \n     the court.\n       We support this reform in principle. Engaging in malicious \n     and harassing litigation, and committing perjury or its \n     equivalent, are common forms of misconduct by prisoners. Like \n     other prisoner misconduct, this misconduct can appropriately \n     be punished by denial of good time credits.\n       However, the procedures specified in section 6 are \n     inconsistent with the normal approach to denial of good time \n     credits under 18 U.S.C. 3624. Singling out one form of \n     misconduct for discretionary judicial decisions concerning \n     denial of good time credits--where all other decisions of \n     this type are made by the Justice Department--would work \n     against consistency in prison disciplinary policies, and \n     would make it difficult or impossible to coordinate sanctions \n     imposed for this type of misconduct with those imposed for \n     other disciplinary violations by a prisoner.\n       We accordingly recommend that Sec. 6 of S. 866 be revised \n     to provide that (1) a court may, and on motion of an adverse \n     party shall, make a determination whether a circumstance \n     specified in the section has occurred (i.e., a malicious or \n     harassing claim or knowing falsehood), (2) the court's \n     determination that such a circumstance occurred shall be \n     forwarded to the Attorney General, and (3) on receipt of such \n     a determination, the Attorney General shall have the \n     authority to deny good time credits to the prisoner. We would \n     be pleased to work with the sponsors to refine this proposal.\n       Section 7 of S. 866 strengthens the requirement of \n     exhaustion of administrative remedies under CRIPA in prisoner \n     suits. It is substantially the same as part of Sec. 103 of S. \n     3, which we support.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ However, there is a typographic error in line 22 of page \n     8 of the bill. The words ``and exhausted'' in this line \n     should be ``are exhausted.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                         C. The STOP Provisions\n\n       As noted above, we support the basic objective of the STOP \n     proposal, including particularly the principle that \n     population caps must be only a ``last resort'' measure. \n     Responses to unconstitutional prison conditions must be \n     designed and implemented in the manner that is most \n     consistent with public safety. Incarcerated criminals should \n     not enjoy opportunities for early release, and the system's \n     general capacity to provide adequate detention and \n     correctional space should not be impaired, where any feasible \n     means exist for avoiding such a result.\n       It is not necessary that prisons be comfortable or \n     pleasant; the normal distresses and hardships of \n     incarceration are the just consequences of the offenders' own \n     conduct. However, it is necessary to recognize that there is \n     nevertheless a need for effective safeguards against inhuman \n     conditions in prisons and other facilities. The \n     constitutional provision enforced most frequently in prison \n     cases is the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and \n     unusual punishment. Among the conditions that have been found \n     to violate the Eighth Amendment are excessive violence, \n     whether inflicted by guards or by inmates under the \n     supervision of indifferent guards, preventable rape, \n     deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, and lack of \n     sanitation that jeopardizes health. Prison crowding may also \n     be a contributing element in a constitutional violation. For \n     example, when the number of inmates at a prison becomes so \n     large that sick inmates cannot be treated by a physician in a \n     timely manner, or when crowded conditions lead to a breakdown \n     in security and contribute to violence against inmates, the \n     crowding can be addressed as a contributing cause of a \n     constitutional violation. See generally Wilson v. Seiter, 501 \n     U.S. 294 (1991); Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337 (1981).\n\n[[Page S2299]]\n\n       In considering reforms, it is essential to remember that \n     inmates do suffer unconstitutional conditions of confinement, \n     and ultimately must retain access to meaningful redress when \n     such violations occur. While Congress may validly enact \n     legislative directions and guidance concerning the nature and \n     extent of prison conditions remedies. It must also take care \n     to ensure that any measures adopted do not deprive prisoners \n     of effective remedies for real constitutional wrongs.\n       With this much background, I will now turn to the specific \n     provisions of the STOP legislation.\n       The STOP provisions of S. 400 and title III of H.R. 667--in \n     proposed 18 U.S.C. 3626(a)--provide that prospective relief \n     in prison conditions suits small extend no further than \n     necessary to remove the conditions causing the deprivation of \n     federal rights of individual plaintiffs, that such relief \n     must be narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means of \n     remedying the derivation, and that substantial weight must be \n     given to any adverse impact on public safety or criminal \n     justice system operations in determining intrusiveness. They \n     further provide that relief reducing or limiting prison \n     population is not allowed unless crowding is the primary \n     cause of the deprivation of a federal right and no other \n     relief will remedy that deprivation.\n       Proposed 18 U.S.C. 3626(b) in the STOP provisions provides \n     that any prospective relief in a prison conditions action \n     shall automatically terminate after two years (running from \n     the time the federal right violation is found or enactment of \n     the STOP legislation), and that such relief shall be \n     immediately terminated if it was approved or granted in the \n     absence of a judicial finding that prison conditions violated \n     a federal right.\n       Proposed 18 U.S.C. 3626(c) in the STOP provisions requires \n     prompt judicial decisions of motions to modify or terminate \n     prospective relief in prison conditions suits, with automatic \n     stays of such relief 30 days after a motion is filed under 18 \n     U.S.C. 3626(b), and after 180 days in any other case.\n       Proposed 18 U.S.C. 3626(d) in the STOP provisions confers \n     standing to oppose relief that reduces or limits prison \n     population on any federal, state, of local official or unit \n     of government whose jurisdiction or function includes the \n     prosecution or custody of persons in a prison subject to \n     such relief, or who otherwise may be affected by such \n     relief.\n       Proposed 18 U.S.C. 3626(e) in the STOP provisions prohibits \n     the use of masters in prison conditions suits in federal \n     court, except for use of magistrates to make proposed \n     findings concerning complicated factual issues. Proposed 18 \n     U.S.C. 3626(f) in the STOP provisions imposes certain \n     limitations on awards of attorney's fees in prison conditions \n     suits under federal civil rights laws.\n       Finally, the STOP provisions provide that the new version \n     of 18 U.S.C. 3626 shall apply to all relief regardless of \n     whether it was originally granted or approved before, on, or \n     after its enactment.\n       The bills leave unresolved certain interpretive questions. \n     While the revised section contains some references to \n     deprivation of federal rights, several parts of the section \n     are not explicitly limited in this manner, and might be \n     understood as limiting relief based on state law claims in \n     prison conditions suits in state courts. The intent of the \n     proposal, however, is more plausibly limited to setting \n     standards for relief which is based on claimed violations of \n     federal rights or imposed by federal court orders. If so, \n     this point should be made clearly in relation to all parts of \n     the proposal.\n       A second interpretive question is whether the proposed \n     revision of 18 U.S.C. 3626 affects prison conditions suits in \n     both federal and state court, or just suits in federal court. \n     In contrast to the current version of 18 U.S.C. 3626, the \n     proposed revision--except for the new provision restricting \n     the use of masters--is not, by its terms, limited to federal \n     court proceedings. Hence, most parts of the revision appear \n     to be intended to apply to both federal and state court \n     suits, and would probably be so construed by the courts. To \n     avoid extensive litigation over an issue that goes to the \n     basic scope of the proposal, this question should be clearly \n     resolved one way or the other by the text of the proposal.\n       The analysis of constitutional issues raised by this \n     proposal must be mindful of certain fundamental principles. \n     Congress possesses significant authority over the remedies \n     available in the lower federal courts, subject to the \n     limitations of Article III, and can eliminate the \n     jurisdiction of those courts altogether. In the latter \n     circumstance, state courts (and the U.S. Supreme Court on \n     review) would remain available to provide any necessary \n     constitutional remedies excluded from the jurisdiction of the \n     inferior federal courts. Congress also has authority to \n     impose requirements that govern state courts when they \n     exercise concurrent jurisdiction over federal claims, see \n     Fielder v. Casey, 487 U.S. 131, 141 (1988), but if Congress \n     purports to bar both federal and state courts from issuing \n     remedies necessary to redress colorable constitutional \n     violations, such legislation may violate due process. See, \n     e.g., Webster v. Dob, 486 U.S. 592, 603 (1988); Bowen v. \n     Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 681 \n     n.12 (1986); Bartlett v. Bowman, 816 F.2d 695, 703-07 \n     (D.C. Cir. 1987). We therefore examine the proposal's \n     various remedial restrictions from that perspective.\n       Proposed 18 U.S.C. 3626(a)(1) in the proposal goes further \n     than the current statute in ensuring that any relief ordered \n     is narrowly tailored. However, since it permits a court to \n     order the ``relief . . . necessary to remove the conditions \n     that are causing the deprivation of . . . Federal rights,'' \n     this aspect of the proposal appears to be constitutionally \n     unobjectionable, even if it constrains both state and federal \n     courts.\n       Proposed 18 U.S.C. 3626(a)(2) bars relief that reduces or \n     limits prison population unless crowding is the primary cause \n     of the deprivation of a federal right and no other relief \n     will remedy the deprivation. We strongly support the \n     principle that measures limiting prison population should be \n     the last resort in prison conditions remedies. Remedies must \n     be carefully tailored so as to avoid or keep to an absolute \n     minimum any resulting costs to public safety. Measures that \n     result in the early release of incarcerated criminals, or \n     impair the system's general capacity to provide adequate \n     detention and correctional space, must be avoided when any \n     other feasible means exist for remedying constitutional \n     violations.\n       Certain features of the formulation of proposed 18 U.S.C. \n     3626(a)(2) however, raise constitutional concerns. In certain \n     circumstances, prison overcrowding may result in a violation \n     of the Eighth Amendment, see Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337 \n     (1981). Hence, assuming that this provision constrains both \n     state and federal courts, it would be exposed to \n     constitutional challenge as precluding adequate remedy for a \n     constitutional violation in certain circumstances. For \n     example, severe safety hazards or lack of basic sanitation \n     might be the primary cause of unconstitutional conditions in \n     a facility, yet extreme overcrowding might be a substitute \n     and independent, but secondary, cause of such conditions. \n     Thus, this provision could foreclose any relief that reduces \n     or limits prison population through a civil action in such a \n     case, even if no other form of relief would rectify the \n     unconstitutional condition of overcrowding.\n       This problem might be avoided through an interpretation of \n     the notion of a covered ``civil action'' under the revised \n     section as not including habeas corpus proceedings in state \n     or federal court which are brought to obtain relief from \n     unconstitutional conditions of confinement. See e.g., Preiser \n     v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 499 (1973). However, this depends \n     on an uncertain construction of the proposed statute, and the \n     proposal's objectives could be undermined if the extent of \n     remedial authority depended on the form of the action (habeas \n     proceedings vs. regular civil action). Since the relief \n     available in habeas proceedings in this context could be \n     limited to release from custody, reliance on such proceedings \n     as an alternative could carry heavy costs in relation to this \n     proposal's evident objective of limiting the release of \n     prisoners as a remedy for unconstitutional prison \n     conditions.\n       A more satisfactory and certain resolution of the problem \n     would be to delete the requirement in proposed 18 U.S.C. \n     3626(a)(2) that crowding must be the primary cause of the \n     deprivation of a federal right. This would avoid potential \n     constitutional infirmity while preserving the requirement \n     that prison caps and the like can only be used where no other \n     remedy would work.\n       Proposed 18 U.S.C. 3626(b)--which automatically terminates \n     prospective relief after two years, and provides for the \n     immediate termination of prospective relief approved without \n     a judicial finding of violation of a federal right--raises \n     additional constitutional concerns. It is possible that \n     prison conditions held unconstitutional by a court may \n     persist for more than two years after the court has found the \n     violation, and while the court order directing prospective \n     relief is still outstanding. Hence, this provision might be \n     challenged on constitutional grounds as foreclosing adequate \n     judicial relief for a continuing constitutional violation.\n       However, we believe that this provision is constitutionally \n     sustainable against such a challenge because it would not cut \n     off all alternative forms of judicial relief, even if it \n     applies both to state court and federal court suits. The \n     possibility of construing the statute as not precluding \n     relief through habeas corpus proceedings has been noted above \n     (as has the possibility that habeas may provide only limited \n     relief), More importantly, the section does not appear to \n     foreclose an aggrieved prisoner from instituting a new and \n     separate civil action based on constitutional violations that \n     persisted after the automatic termination of the prior \n     relief.\n       A more pointed constitutional concern arises from the \n     potential application of the restrictions of proposed 18 \n     U.S.C. 3626(b) to terminate uncompleted prospective relief \n     ordered in judgments that became final prior to the \n     legislation's enactment. The application of these \n     restrictions to such relief raises constitutional concerns \n     under the Supreme Court's recent decision in Plauty, \n     Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 115 S.Ct. 1447 (1995). The Court held \n     in that case that legislation which retroactively interferes \n     with final judgments can constitute an unconstitutional \n     encroachment on judicial authority. It is uncertain whether \n     Plaut's holding applies with full force to the prospective, \n     long-term relief that is involved in prison conditions cases. \n     However, if the decision does fully apply in this context, \n     the application of proposed 18 U.S.C. 3626(b) to orders in \n     pre-enactment final judgments would raise serious \n     constitutional problems.\n       While we believe that most features of that STOP proposal \n     are constitutionally sustainable, at least in prospective \n     effect, we find two aspects of the legislation to be \n     particularly problematic for policy reasons.\n\n[[Page S2300]]\n\n       First, the proposal apparently limits prospective relief to \n     cases involving a judicial finding of a violation of a \n     federal right. This could create a very substantial \n     impediment to the settlement of prison conditions suits--\n     even, if all interested parties are fully satisfied with the \n     proposed resolution--because the defendants might effectively \n     have to concede that they have caused or tolerated \n     unconstitutional conditions in their facilities in order to \n     secure judicial approval of the settlement. This would result \n     in litigation that no one wants, if the defendants were \n     unwilling to make such a damaging admission, and could \n     require judicial resolution of matters that would otherwise \n     be more promptly resolved by the parties in a mutually \n     agreeable manner.\n       Second, we are concerned about the provision that would \n     automatically terminate any prospective relief after two \n     years. In some cases the unconstitutional conditions on which \n     relief is premised will not be corrected within this \n     timeframe, resulting in a need for further prison conditions \n     litigation. The Justice Department and other plaintiffs, \n     would have to refile cases in order to achieve the objectives \n     of the original order, and defendants would have the burden \n     of responding to these new suits. Both for reasons of \n     judicial economy, and for the effective protection of \n     constitutional rights, we should aim at the resolution of \n     disputes without unnecessary litigation and periodic \n     disruptions of ongoing remedial efforts. This point applies \n     with particular force where the new litigation will revisit \n     matters that have already been adjudicated and resolved in an \n     earlier judgment.\n       Existing law, in 18 U.S.C. 3626(c), already requires that \n     any order of consent decree seeking to remedy an Eighth \n     Amendment violation be reopened at the behest of a defendant \n     for recommended modification at a minimum of two year \n     intervals. This provision could be strengthened to give \n     eligible intervenors under the STOP proposal, including \n     prosecutors, the same right to periodic reconsideration of \n     prison conditions orders and consent decrees. This would be a \n     more reasonable approach to guarding against the unnecessary \n     continuation of orders than imposition of an unqualified, \n     automatic time limit on all orders of this type.\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2285-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2300-S2302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMON SENSE PRODUCT LIABILITY REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconference report on H.R. 956, the Common Sense Product Liability \nReform Act.\n  The legislation is modest in its reach, but it includes long-overdue \nchanges, and it pulls together commonsense reforms that command broad \nsupport in this Congress.\n  Nonetheless, President Clinton announced that he will veto the bill \nand if, indeed, he does veto this legislation, he will line up with the \nspecial interests--the trial lawyers--rather than the American people.\n  The President refused to buck the trial lawyers last year, also, and \nhe vetoed securities litigation reform. His veto was overridden by a \nbipartisan vote. The senior Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, \nbrought strong support from the other side of the aisle, and we \noverrode the veto. It was not a radical bill. It was a balanced bill, \nmodest reform. But the trial lawyers handed him the veto pen, and, \npolitical considerations at the forefront, he signed on the dotted line \nto veto securities reform.\n  Likewise, the Product Liability Reform Act is not radical \nlegislation, as Presidential campaign aides insist. It addresses some \nof the principal abuses--our efforts to pass an expansive bill failed--\nand it, too, has a broad base of support. Just look at the bipartisan \nleadership on this bill. But despite the consensus for the bill, \nPresident Clinton again will do the trial lawyers' bidding, and he \ninsists that he will veto yet another reform measure.\n  The argument that this legislation goes too far just does not hold \nup. The conference report was hammered out with the 60 votes for \ncloture in mind. It is, by definition, a consensus bill. So, let the \nfacts be clear, this veto is not about consumer protection--the trial \nlawyers are worried about changes to a legal racket that took them \nyears to build--it is about political considerations in an election \nyear.\n  So, despite all the White House rhetoric about wages and growth, the \nPresident will take a stand for growth, but it will not be for growth \nin jobs. No, it will be for continued growth in the frivolous lawsuits \nthat swell court dockets and cost American jobs.\n  The American tort system is far and away the most expensive of any \nindustrialized country. It cost $152 billion in 1994. This is \nequivalent to 2.2 percent of the gross domestic product. This has \nserious economic implications, and, in fact, it is estimated that the \nlegal system keeps the growth of our gross domestic product \napproximately 10 percent below its potential.\n  We have heard a lot of discussion about economic growth, but I \nbelieve that a good legal reform bill is, in effect, a growth bill.\n  The costs of these baseless lawsuits are profound--lost jobs, good \nproducts withdrawn from the market, medical research discontinued, and \nlimited economic growth--all because our tort system is far too \nexpensive.\n  We do not have the votes for general legal reform in this Chamber. I \nwish we did. However, we do have the votes for limited product \nliability reform, and we now have a bill that addresses the principal \nabuses.\n  President Clinton will be forced to choose sides on this bill. I hope \nhe will reconsider his announcement and line up with the American \nworkers rather than the trial lawyers. This bill will reduce the costs \nof frivolous lawsuits--the cases that compel companies to settle rather \nthan risk ruin in the hands of juries run amok--and it will boost \ncapital investment in our factories. Consequently, this legislation \nwill generate jobs--manufacturing jobs--and strengthen our industrial \nbase. This is good economics, and, Mr. President, it is good for the \nworking people of this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, for the better part of an hour we have \nnotified Members through the communication system that we are ready to \ngo to third reading and finalize, first of all, the managers' package--\nfor the better part of an hour. And I think it has now reached a \nreasonable period of time to bring this to a halt.\n  So I want to say that at 5:05--in 15 minutes--I will ask for the \nlifting of the quorum and the Chair will put the question. So that will \nmean we have waited for an hour and 10 minutes for anyone to exercise \ntheir parliamentary right. I think that is a fairly good test of \nknowing if anyone is interested in doing so. Then we will move to the \nthird reading following the adoption of the managers' package.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, may I proceed for 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in response to my distinguished friend \nfrom North Carolina--and I know North Carolina very well--I would \nchallenge the distinguished Senator to name the industry that refused \nto come to North Carolina, or to Tennessee, on account of product \nliability. Specifically, the State of North Carolina, as well as my \nState of South Carolina, has foreign industry galore. They talk about \nthe international competition, and within that international \ncompetition we just located, with respect to investment Hoffman LaRoche \nfrom Switzerland, the finest medical-pharmaceutical facility that you \ncould possibly imagine; with respect to the matter of photographic \npapers, Fuji has a beautiful new plant there; and we have Hitachi, a \ncoil roller bearings, and we have over 40 industries from Japan and 100 \nfrom Germany. The distinguished Presiding\n\n[[Page S2301]]\n\nOfficer has 98 Japanese plants in Tennessee. In my 35 years dealing \nwith industry and bringing industry into South Carolina, they have yet \nto mention product liability.\n  Now, let us get to the trial lawyers. Bless them, because if there is \na lazy crowd of bums, it is the corporate lawyers that sit downtown \nhere and infest this particular democratic body with billable hours--\nbillable hours. All they have to do is get up and see a Senator, and \nthey send a bill. All they have to do is sit down and say something, \nand it is $200, $300, $400, or $500 an hour--the whole crowd up here in \nWashington. They have hardly ever tried a case in court.\n  Let us go right to the particular product liability cases. The \nAmerican trial bar association--the American Bar Association--is \nopposed to this measure. The Senator from North Carolina should know \nthat. The Association of State Legislators have opposed it. The \nAssociation of State Supreme Court Judges have opposed it. The \nattorneys general have come here and law professors from all around the \ncountry have come here to oppose it. The reason they have come is that \nthis is the most dastardly measure you could possibly imagine.\n  Talk about balancing how they got together, why not apply this bill \nto the manufacturing? It is all applied to the injured parties who have \ndifficulty getting a lawyer in the first instance. You have to have a \nchance to get in court, not just your day in court. But to get to \ncourt, you have to be willing to take on the expenses--not billable \nhours, but the risk of winning or losing. Under the contingency \narrangement unless 12 jurors find in their behalf and the courts of \nappeal affirm that particular finding, you don't get paid. So it is not \nwilly-nilly.\n  They mention a coffee case--they have anecdotal nonsense--the coffee \ncase in New Mexico where the lady dropped the hot coffee. She got \nthird-degree burns. She went to the hospital for an extended period of \ntime. But the trial judge cut back on that particular award. They never \nmentioned that. We have a good judiciary there in the State of New \nMexico.\n  So we can go into these cases. But to come here, as I heard one \nparticular statement just earlier this afternoon, that the President of \nthe United States was threatening a veto because he was bankrolled by \nthe trial lawyers--I wish every one would look up and see the Senator \nwho made that statement. He is an expert in bankrolling.\n  That is all I can say.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to say to my friend, Senator \nHollings, that he mentioned New Mexico and the McDonald case. I do not \nknow how this story will strike you, but about 10 days after that \nevent--and the paper was full of the stories--I pulled into a \nMcDonald's in downtown Albuquerque on my way to Santa Fe in the car. \nAnd we pulled up to the drive-in window to get coffee, and in the \nprocess talking to the nice lady working for McDonald's, we asked for \nthe coffee. She had it ready. Just as we started to leave, I was \nsitting in the front seat with one of my staff men right here. We were \nlooking at her, and she was smiling heavily--almost laughing. I said, \n``What is the matter, ma'am?'' We had been talking about the case \nbefore. She said, ``Well, last night a truck came by here and the man \nin the driver's seat sitting right here close to me said, `Don't bother \nwith the cup. Just pour it in my lap.' '' [Laughter.]\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask that I might proceed for 3 minutes \nas if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to take a moment of the Senate to \ndiscuss further the matter that the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina brought up, namely, the product liability reform conference \nreport.\n  I want to take a moment to discuss an important matter that today or \ntomorrow will come before the Senate: namely, the product liability \nreform conference report. I must say that I was sorely disappointed to \nread over the weekend that the President has issued a veto threat for \nthis carefully balanced, carefully drafted, well-thought-out measure. I \nfind it hard to believe the President's advisors could come up with a \ncredible basis for objecting to this commonsense bill. I strongly urge \nthe President to reconsider.\n\n\n               senate history re product liability reform\n\n  This issue is not a new one, and this legislation was not drafted in \na hasty or casual manner. Indeed, it is the cumulation of more than a \ndecade's worth of hard work. Let me outline the enormous time and \nenergy that has been expended on behalf of this bill by its Senate \nsponsors:\n  I would like to just briefly outline what is going into this bill. No \none can suggest that this is a will-o'-the-wisp piece of legislation \nthat just suddenly came out of nowhere. In 1981, legislation was \nintroduced similar to the bill that was finally approved and comes from \nthe conference today or this week. It was introduced in 1981.\n  In the 97th Congress (1981-82), S. 2631 was introduced by Senator \nKasten and others. It was reported by the Commerce Committee but never \ntaken up by the Senate. In the 98th Congress (1983-84), Senators \nKasten, Percy, and Gorton again introduced product liability \nlegislation (S. 44), and again it was reported by Commerce. And again \nit saw no further action.\n  In the 99th Congress (1985-86), Senator Kasten introduced a revised \nversion of his product liability reform proposal (S. 100). This bill \nwas defeated on a tie vote in Committee. However, a host of \nfreestanding amendments were considered during hearings. Eventually an \noriginal Committee bill (S. 2760) was sent to the floor, where the \nSenate voted overwhelmingly to consider it. Yet notwithstanding the \nstrong votes, the bill was returned to the calendar and the Senate \nrecessed for the year.\n  In every Congress we have worked on this particular piece of \nlegislation.\n  In the 100th Congress (1987-88), Senators Kasten, Pressler, \nRockefeller, and Danforth, soldiering on, introduced two more revised \nbills (S. 666, S. 711), neither of which was taken up by the Committee \nor the Senate. In the 101st Congress (1989-90), ever hopeful, Senators \nKasten, Gorton, Pressler, and Rockefeller introduced their bill. S. \n1400 won Committee approval, but was blocked from Senate consideration.\n  In the 102d Congress (1991-92), Senators Kasten and Rockefeller led a \nbipartisan group in introducing S. 640. The bill was favorably \nreported, but was stalled for 7 months by liability reform opponents. \nTo force floor action, S. 640 was offered as an amendment to the then-\npending motor-voter bill. But cloture failed, and subsequently the \namendment was sent to Judiciary for further hearings. However, \nproponents were able to win a commitment from the Democratic leader to \nbring the bill up later. That fall, the Senate witnessed an \nextraordinary effort by bill opponents to stymie the bill by forcing \nthe Senate to hold three back-to-back cloture votes, each of which fell \nat least 2 votes short of the 60 needed. The end result? That bill also \ndied.\n  How about the 103d Congress? Anything better? Not much. S. 687 was \nintroduced in March 1993 with Senators Rockefeller and Gorton again \nbravely leading the charge. After a hearing and the strongest committee \nvote yet, 16 to 4, the bill went to the floor, but again the opponents \nstopped its momentum with two cloture votes, and that killed the bill \nfor the rest of the 103d.\n  Now we come to the 104th Congress, some 15 years after the first \nKasten bill was presented. Prospects seemed pretty good. Supporters had \ngained new adherents on both sides of the aisle. Product liability and \ntort reform had caught the public's attention and support. The \nlegislation in itself had plenty of time to ripen. After all, there had \nbeen countless hearings and enormous opportunity for public comment.\n  To their credit, the sponsors continued to take all legitimate \nconcerns into account and came up with reasonable responses to those \nquestions raised.\n  Will this be the year of product liability reform? Well, let us see. \nS. 565 was introduced in March 1995, a year ago, by Senators Gorton, \nRockefeller, Pressler, Lieberman, and others, and a large bipartisan \ncoalition. The bill was reported in April. The committee took up the \nbill in late April and began voting on amendments. A total of \nfour cloture votes were held on or in relation to the bill, with the \nfourth vote in this grueling\n\n[[Page S2302]]\n\nprocession being ultimately successful. On May 10, with bipartisan \nsupport, the bill as amended passed the Senate, 61-37. Now the \nconference report is finally before us. But now we learn that all this \nwork is for naught--for notwithstanding the views of some of his \nadvisors and the strong support of many Democrats, the President has \ndecided to veto this bill.\n\n  Frankly, I believe this bill has seen more roadblocks in the last \ndecade than practically any other bill we have seen. I venture to guess \nthat product liability has been subject to more cloture votes than any \nother bill: two in 1986, three in 1992, two in 1993, and four in 1995.\n  Yet, it seemed we were close to beating that gridlock with this new \nCongress. The drafting of the bill was bipartisan from Day One. The \nWhite House was well aware of what was going on, watching closely as \nthe Senate took up the bill and began adding amendments. Indeed, I \nunderstand from the key Republican and Democratic sponsors of the bill \nthat it was the administration that, during the Senate debate in May, \nquite helpfully suggested the addition of the so-called additur \nprovision to the final version of the Senate bill--the provision that \nhelped the bill win final approval by that 61 to 37 margin.\n\n\n                            the veto threat\n\n  What, then, happened to change the White House attitude? Did the bill \nchange drastically in conference? The answer is no, hardly at all. It \nwas clear to all that the House broader tort reform bill would not win \nadministration approval. Therefore, to their credit, the conferees were \ncareful to stick closely to the Senate version. The bill that we will \nvote on is virtually identical to the Senate-passed bill that won such \nstrong approval.\n  What, then, has caused the President to issue the veto threat? I \ncannot believe he is personally opposed to a Federal liability law, for \nas Governor he sat on the National Governors' Association Committee \nthat drafted the NGA's first resolution favoring Federal liability \nreform.\n  Here in my hand I have the letter to Senator Dole stating the veto \nthreat. The reasons for the veto are couched very carefully but do not \nstand up to close scrutiny. First, we are told the bill is an \n``unwarranted intrusion on state authority''--yet in this case, the \nneed for a uniform product liability law--not 50 separate laws--is so \nwarranted that the NGA enthusiastically supports this measure. Second, \nwe are told the bill would ``encourage wrongful conduct'' because it \nabolishes joint liability. But that deduction stretches credibility; \nmoreover, joint and several liability remains for economic damages. \nThird, the letter accuses the bill of ``increas[ing] the incentive to \nengage in the egregious misconduct of knowingly manufacturing and \nselling defective products--a charge that makes no sense--and then goes \non to say that the additur provision the White House itself asked for \ndoes not take care of this alleged problem.\n  None of these three statements accurately represents what this \nbalanced, bipartisan conference report would do. They are merely there \nfor cover, to allow a veto to proceed. That is a shame. I am inclined \nto agree with my friend from West Virginia, who has worked so long on \nthis bill, when he says with regret that ``special interest and \nobvious, raw political considerations in the White House are overriding \nsound and reasonable policy judgment.''\n\n\n              the 1996 product liability conference report\n\n  No question about it--this bill is sound and reasonable policy. Let \nme quickly outline its key provisions.\n  Under this bill, those who sell, not make, products are liable only \nif they did not exercise reasonable care; if they offered their own \nwarranty and it was not met; or they engaged in intentional wrongdoing. \nIn other words, they cannot be caught up in a liability suit if they \ndid not do anything wrong. That concept should sound familiar to most \nAmericans.\n  Also under this bill, if the injured person was under the influence \nof drugs or alcohol, and that condition was more than 50 percent \nresponsible for the event that led to their injury, the defendant \ncannot be held liable. Likewise, if the plaintiff misused or altered \nthe product--in violation of instructions or warnings to the contrary, \nor in violation of just plain common sense--damages must be reduced \naccordingly. Of all the provisions in the bill, it seems to me these \nare the ones that are the most obvious. Why on earth should we blame \nthe manufacturer for behavior that everyone knows would place the \nproduct user at risk? Is that fair? No. Does that not contradict our \nnotion of an individual's personal responsibility? Yes. This provision \ngoes a long way toward ensuring that freely undertaken behavioral \nchoices are taken into account in liability actions.\n  Regarding time limits, the bill allows injured persons to file an \naction up to 2 years after the date they discovered, or should have \ndiscovered, the harm and its cause. For durable goods, actions may be \nfiled up to 15 years after the initial delivery of the product. These \nprovisions are fair, providing some certainty with regard to liability \nexposure while at the same time protecting consumers who have been \nharmed.\n  Either party may offer to proceed to voluntary nonbinding alternative \ndispute resolution. Simple, but again, it makes sense.\n  Now the most controversial element of the bill: punitive damages. Let \nme remind my colleagues that these damages are separate and apart from \ncompensatory damages. Compensatory damages are meant to make the \ninjured party whole, by compensating him or her for economic and \nnoneconomic losses; punitives are meant to deter and punish. Under the \nbill, punitives may be awarded if a ``clear and convincing evidence'' \nstandard proving ``conscious, flagrant indifference to the right of \nsafety of others'' is met. The amount awarded may not exceed two times \nthe amount awarded for compensatory loss, or $250,000--whichever is \ngreater--for small business, whichever is less. At the suggestion of \nthe White House, a further provision was included: If the court finds \nthe award to be insufficient, it may order additional damages.\n  Again, this compromise seems to make sense. It sets a framework for \npunitive damage awards in which the level of punitives is tied to the \nharm actually suffered by the plaintiff, with the ability to go beyond \nthe cap in truly egregious cases. This compromise cap helps resolve the \nproblem of arbitrary and inconsistent awards, while at the same time \nensuring that punitive awards will not be meaningless inproportion to \nthe injury suffered. The Washington Post calls this approach an \nimportant first step that creates some order and boundaries.\n  Each of the provisions I have outlined make eminent sense. Each helps \nprovide certainly in an area where there now, notoriously, is none. \nThat is why Senator Rockefeller says the conference report ``delivers \nfair and reasonable legal reform'' that ``would make American industry \nand American workers more competitive.'' He is absolutely right.\n  I pay my compliments to Senators Rockefeller, Gorton, Pressler, and \nLieberman. They have worked tirelessly for years and years to enact \nmeaningful and fair product liability reform. They have done this \nNation a great service. And their work should not be for naught.\n  Thus, I urge the President to reconsider his position, and join the \nbipartisan coalition supporting this critically important legislation. \nI urge him to disregard the powerful political constituencies aligned \nagainst this bill. I urge him to sign this bill into law.\n  Mr. President, I hope that this laborious marathon that we have been \nengaged in to see product liability reform passed here will finally \nsucceed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2300-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2302-S2309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BALANCED BUDGET DOWNPAYMENT ACT, II\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

Mr. President, last week I offered an amendment to \nprohibit funding under the District of Columbia provisions of H.R. 3019 \nwhich would directly or indirectly serve to implement or enforce the \nlifting of taxicab reciprocity agreements--which have served well for \n50 years--in the Washington, DC, Metropolitan area.\n  I am pleased to report that that legislative action, at this time, is \nno longer necessary, and that my Amendment No. 3523 therefore has been \nwithdrawn.\n  As a result of direct negotiations which have been taking place \nbetween myself and officials of the District government, I today \nreceived an assurance that hopefully will be in the best interests of \nnorthern Virginia consumers and businesses. The longstanding taxicab \nreciprocity agreements between the District, Virginia, and Maryland \nhave been preserved for a period of 90 days, during which time there \nwill be an opportunity for continued negotiations.\n  It had been my grave concern, and that of my constituents, that the \nFebruary 6 decision of the D.C. Taxicab Commission to unilaterally \nterminate reciprocity agreements of nearly 50 years standing would have \nbeen highly disruptive to local commerce and transportation services in \nMetropolitan Washington. We must approach all forms of transportation \namong Virginia, the District, and Maryland as regional. Metrorail is a \nprime example.\n  Working with my northern Virginia colleague, Congressman Tom Davis, \nand our valued constituents, Charles King of Arlington Red Top Cab, \nRobert Werth of Alexandria Yellow Cab, and Bob Woods of Alexandria \nDiamond Cab, we have secured from the District government a firm \ncommitment that the status-quo in taxicab reciprocity will be preserved \nfor 90 days.\n  Furthermore, during this time period, the District has pledged to \nwork with its partners in the Metropolitan Washington Council of \nGovernments [COG] to pursue an equitable and fair new reciprocity \nagreement to replace the one of 50 years.\n  Assuming this can be done, this is a far more preferable and \nreasonable process that either unilateral action by one party --the \nDistrict, or by Congressional action at this time.\n  The possibility of taxicab reciprocity termination has been a serious \nissue for my constituents in northern Virginia. Taxicab services in \nArlington and Alexandria estimate that at least 10 percent of their \nbusiness is conducted under the nearly 50-year-old taxicab reciprocity \nagreement.\n  On the other side of the issue, I understand that District taxi \nservices have complaints that suburban companies may not be complying \nwith the letter of the reciprocity agreement. Those issues also need to \nbe addressed. We should not, ``however, throw the baby out with the \nbath water.''\n  In closing, I would just like to add a few words about the countless \nvisitors we have each year coming to the Metropolitan Washington \nregion. They expect and deserve public transportation services of the \nhighest quality and safety.\n  Furthermore, I believe the District is taking the correct steps in \nmodernizing their fare systems with meters, as in other major American \ncities. As a part of modernization, however, it is essential that \nreciprocal taxicab agreements be maintained.\n  I welcome the news that the District government will preserve the \ncurrent taxicab reciprocity agreement for 3 months while this matter is \nconsidered among the members of the Metropolitan Washington Council of \nGovernments.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for their kind cooperation in this \nmatter.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3494\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern with \nAmendment No. 3494 which was accepted on March 14 after it was offered \nby my friend from Idaho, Senator Craig. Amendment No. 3494 earmarks, \nfrom Legal Services Corporation funds, a payment of $250,000 to an \nIdaho family, Leeland and Karla Swenson, for attorneys fees and \nexpenses they encountered when their adoption of a Lakota Sioux Indian \nchild ran afoul of the requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act.\n  First, let me say, I understand the difficulty the Swenson family had \nwith that case, and I understand why Senator Craig wants to try to help \nthem. But I oppose this kind of earmark of funds for the private relief \nof certain individuals because it bestows Federal funds without any \nlegislative record, without any reliable accounting of costs, and \nwithout any reasonable factual inquiry.\n  My colleagues should note that the Idaho State courts twice refused \nto award the Swensons their attorneys fees and expenses in this case. \nIn their sworn affidavit filed with the court seeking fees and \nexpenses, the Swenson attorneys sought $103,000, not the $250,000 \nprovided by Amendment No. 3494. The $103,000 figure was based on an \nhourly rate of $150. Even the $103,000 figure is a mystery, as it is \nbased on an hourly rate that is nearly double the hourly rate these \nsame lawyers sought from the court 2 years earlier in the same case.\n  I don't know the Idaho courts' reasons for denying these attorneys' \nclaims for fees and expenses, but I know the U.S. Senate has absolutely \nno reasons on the record for awarding $250,000 in fees and expenses to \nthese attorneys. We don't know what they did. We don't know what is a \nreasonable hourly fee. And we don't know how much the lawyers have \nalready received in payment.\n  News accounts report that a local group raised, through a benefit \nauction, $60,000 to help pay the lawyer fees and expenses. The same \naccounts report that the lawyers have agreed to reduce their fees to \nthe amounts raised.\n  Much has also been made of the fact that the Swenson family auctioned \noff their dairy farm equipment in order to pay back money they borrowed \nto pay legal expenses. But it appears that passion may have exaggerated \nsome of the story told about this case. Rather than being forced to \nsell their family farm, the Swenson family held a public auction \nearlier this month to sell off farm equipment and animals they had used \nin their dairy operations. Leeland Swenson continues, with his father, \nto own and operate their family farm and maintain a substantial cattle \nand crop operation. The Senate has been told the Swenson family is \nbankrupt, but there has been no evidence offered that they have filed \nfor bankruptcy.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me be clear. I respect the motivation behind \nthe effort made by my friend from Idaho, Senator Craig, even as I \nbelieve it to be a seriously misguided earmark of Federal funds without \nreliable justification and documentation.\n  I do not seek to debate or examine the facts of the Indian child \nwelfare case that gave rise to this amendment. That case took 6 years \nto resolve.\n  Mr. President, my point is that the earmark in this amendment appears \nto be without sound basis in fact. The earmark is actually a private \nrelief bill in\n\n[[Page S2304]]\n\nthe nature of an appropriations amendment, but it has escaped even the \nminimal scrutiny the Senate gives to private relief bills. There are \nmore than 45 private relief bills pending before the Senate today. No \nprivate relief bills have been passed in the 104th Congress. So I must \nask the Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig, why has this matter been \nleapfrogged in front of all the others? And with neither a committee \nreferral nor review to ensure against undue enrichment?\n  Mr. President, I do not think this earmark for lawyers fees can or \nshould survive careful scrutiny. I understand from discussions with \nSenator Craig that in his view the language of the amendment does not \nprovide for an automatic payment of $250,000 but instead would pay up \nto $250,000 of actual legal fees and expenses related to this case.\n  If our colleagues on the conference committee do not recede to the \nHouse and drop this amendment altogether, Mr. President, at the very \nleast I would hope that they clarify the bill language so that it only \npays ``up to'' $250,000 for actual legal fees and expenses. Even then I \nam unclear who will decide what is actual. I ask unanimous consent that \na copy of an article from the Idaho Press-Tribune dated February 23, \n1996 as well as a copy of an Associated Press article dated March 15, \n1996 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Rapid City Journal, Mar. 15, 1996]\n\n                Senate Votes To Pay Couple's Legal Bills\n\n       Washington.--The government may pay the legal bills of a \n     couple who lost their farm after a child custody battle with \n     the Oglala Sioux Tribe of South Dakota.\n       The Senate voted Thursday to take $250,000 from the Legal \n     Services Corp.'s 1996 budget to pay the couple's legal fees \n     and expenses. Legal Services subsidizes the Idaho legal-aid \n     agency that represented the South Dakota tribe in the long \n     court fight.\n       The Leland Swenson family of Nampa, Idaho, adopted the \n     half-Indian child six years ago, but the tribe sued to gain \n     custody under a law that allows tribes to intervene in \n     adoption cases involving their members. The Idaho Supreme \n     Court ruled against the tribe, and the adoption was made \n     final last month.\n       The family sold its dairy farm and equipment to pay back \n     family, friends and banks who lent them money during the \n     legal wrangling.\n       ``They bankrupted this family in an attempt to gain custody \n     of this child,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho. ``The family \n     won, the happy ending is here, but the family is bankrupt.''\n       Attorneys with Idaho Legal Aid Services which represented \n     the tribe, said the couple's legal fees did not exceed \n     $100,000, and half of that was paid from a benefit auction \n     last year. Aides to Craig said the $250,000 figure was based \n     on a request by Nampa's mayor.\n       ``The tribe was eligible for our services. We get special \n     money to handle that kind of case,'' said Ernesto Sanchez, \n     executive director of Idaho Legal Aid. ``We were doing what \n     we thought we were supposed to be doing.''\n       The Swenson family's compensation was added to a $160 \n     billion bill that would fund government operations through \n     next September. The House does not have a similar provision \n     in its version of the bill.\n       The custody battle stems from passage of the 1978 Indian \n     Child Welfare Act, which was intended to stop the practice of \n     taking Indian children off reservations. At one time, an \n     estimated one in four Indian children was adopted or living \n     in an institution or foster care.\n       Adoption advocates complain that tribes are now using the \n     law to seize children with Indian ancestry or connections to \n     a reservation.\n       Casey Swenson was born in September 1989 to a non-Indian \n     mother and a father who is an Oglala Sioux. Court records \n     said the father refused to acknowledge the child, wouldn't \n     pay support and has taken no part in the court proceedings.\n       The tribe should have used its own attorneys on the case, \n     Craig said.\n       ``I think this sends a clear message to legal services. Do \n     what the law intended you to do,'' Craig said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Idaho Press--Tribune, Feb. 23, 1996]\n\n                      Casey's Adoption Final Today\n\n                          (By Sherry Squires)\n\n       Nampa.--A six-year drama ended today for the Swenson family \n     and the community that supported them.\n       The last of countless court hearings was held at 11 a.m., \n     finalizing Leland and Karla Swenson's adoption of Casey.\n       The biological son of an Oglala Sioux Indian father and \n     white mother, Casey has lived with adoptive parents Leland \n     and Karla Swenson since the day after he was born.\n       The Oglala Sioux tribe fought for six years to move Casey \n     to the Pine Ridge, S.D., reservation where they live.\n       But the Idaho Supreme Court ruled in September that Casey \n     would stay with his adoptive parents. The court required one \n     final hearing to take place. Casey's birth mother had to \n     appear today before a judge and voice her wishes to allow the \n     Swensons to adopt Casey.\n       The Oglala Sioux Tribe did not appeal the Supreme Court \n     ruling. The deadline passed in late * * *\n       ``The worth of Casey's life is infinite to us.'' Leland \n     said ``We'd do it all again in a second. I wouldn't even \n     hesitate.''\n       The Swensons are parents to Casey and 15-month-old Anna \n     Lee, whom they also adopted.\n       It was from Casey that the Swensons said they mustered the \n     courage to adopt again.\n       ``We had prayed about it a lot,'' Karla said. ``We believed \n     Casey would stay with us no matter what.''\n       ``He's always talked about a little sister.'' Leland said. \n     ``We decided he shouldn't suffer because of the \n     circumstances. Now he talks about a little brother, and it \n     scares me to death.''\n       Before Anna Lee's adoption when the Swensons were still \n     searching for a daughter to adopt, they were notified that a \n     little girl had been found for them.\n       ``It was very, very scary with Anna Lee,'' Karla said.\n       But her adoption went smoothly and has been finalized.\n       Adoption rules generally only allow a family to adopt two \n     children. But occasionally some families can adopt another.\n       The Swensons said they'd adopt again if given the chance.\n       With Casey's ordeal behind them, the Swensons plan to \n     continue to tell their story and work for reform of the \n     Indian Child Welfare Act at the national level.\n       ``We would like to see adoption laws changed so they \n     protect the child and not the birth parents,'' Karla said.\n       They have tried to settle into the security that Casey will \n     stay with them. The worry still comes and goes. But it never \n     goes away.\n       ``After living with that so long, it becomes a way of \n     life,'' Leland said. ``I don't know how long it will take. \n     We're always going to be looking over our shoulder.''\n       But Casey has stopped looking over his, his parents said.\n       They believe that is partly because he was diagnosed with \n     Attention Deficit Disorder two years ago.\n       The disorder often causes learning and behavioral problems \n     in children. The children are at or above average \n     intelligence levels, but they sometimes suffer from poor \n     memory, a short attention span and hyperactivity.\n       The Swensons believe the disorder has sheltered Casey. \n     Without it his understanding may have been better, and his \n     fears greater.\n       He was hesitant to go to court again today.\n       ``He doesn't understand why he has to do this again,'' \n     Karla said. ``I told him he has to adopt us this time.''\n       The Swensons' personal future is somewhat uncertain.\n       The family will sell all of their dairy equipment at a \n     March 2 auction. They sold their dairy Thursday.\n       Leland will help farm 61 acres that his father owns, but he \n     also is looking for full-time work.\n       They hope the proceeds from the auction will allow them to \n     pay the nearly $100,000 they owe to family, friends and banks \n     who helped them pay legal expenses.\n       The Swensons' attorney, Carolyn Steele of Boise, accepted \n     what they could pay as full payment for legal fees.\n       ``She has been a very good friend to us,'' Leland said. ``I \n     want people to know there are some good attorneys out there. \n     In our eyes, she's the best. She wasn't in it for the money. \n     She sacrificed a lot to see this to the end.''\n       and the Swensons said they owe a lot to a community that \n     supported them to the end.\n       An auction held a year ago also helped them pay legal \n     expenses.\n       ``A lot of the people who came couldn't afford to be \n     there,'' Leland said. ``With all the garbage that goes in \n     this world, there's a lot of wonderful people still out \n     there.''\n       ``Everyone in Nampa was in our boat with us,'' Karla said, \n     ``and probably Caldwell, too.''\n       The couple said this week they now just want a new start.\n       ``We appreciate that people are concerned,'' Leland said. \n     ``But I want them to know we're going to be OK.''\n       ``We feel like we still have the most important thing of \n     all. That's our precious family. That's all that matters.''\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will vote against H.R. 3019, the omnibus \nconsolidated rescissions and appropriations bill, because it fails on \nthree counts.\n  First, it provides too little for critical national priorities, \nespecially education, anticrime efforts, and environmental protection;\n  Second, it contains dangerous and misguided legislative riders that \nthreaten our Nation's environment and natural resources; and\n  Third, it undermines a woman's constitutional right to choose.\n\n\n                         underfunded priorities\n\n  Though some funds for environmental protection were added to the \nRepublican bill by the Bond-Mikulski\n\n[[Page S2305]]\n\namendment, the bill still leaves critical programs underfunded and \nunable to meet current needs. Superfund cleanup grants, Safe Drinking \nWater revolving fund, EPA enforcement budget, Clean Water revolving \nfund, national parks budget--all will receive less than they need, and \nmost will receive less in real terms in fiscal year 1996 than in 1995, \neven though needs are greater.\n  For education, again, even though funds were restored to the bill by \nthe Specter-Harkin amendment, the bill still underfunds critical \nelementary and secondary education programs, including Title 1 for \ndisadvantaged children, Goals 2000, School-to-Work, Safe and Drug-Free \nSchools, and Summer Jobs for Youth.\n  The bill proposes to dismantle one of the most effective \ncrimefighting programs Congress has ever passed--the Community Policing \nServices [COPS] Program, established in the 1994 Violent Crime Control \nAct. This program was intended to give local police forces 100,000 more \ncops on the beat. Thirty-three thousand has already been dispatched in \nlocal communities across the Nation, and the crime rate in many cities \nis dropping. H.R. 3019 would replace COPS with a block grant program \nthat force police officers on the beat to compete with other law \nenforcement programs for limited funds.\n\n\n                            dangerous riders\n\n  H.R. 3019 contains many legislative riders that President Clinton has \nvetoed in the past because they threaten the environment and our \nNation's precious natural resources.\n  These provisions would: Block new drinking water standards; prohibit \nthe EPA from enforcing a rule on reformulated gasoline; boost logging \nlevels in the Tongass National Forest; prohibit the listing of new \nendangered species; undermine wetland protection; prohibit the issuance \nof new energy efficiency standards; limit the listing of new Superfund \nsites, and prohibit the Park Service from fully implementing the \nCalifornia Desert Protection Act regarding the Mojave Preserve.\n  The bill also urges the EPA to consider relaxing toxic air standards \nfor certain industries, exempt some industries from requirements for \nrisk management plans, including measures to prevent accidental \nchemical releases, and urges EPA not to expand the Toxic Release \nInventory, one of the Nation's most successful nonregulatory public \ndisclosure initiatives ensuring community right-to-know about toxic \nchemicals that are being released into the environment.\n\n\n                         limits right to choose\n\n  The bill continues the ban on the use of the District of Columbia's \nlocally raised funds to pay for abortions. There are over 3,000 \ncounties and 19,000 cities in the United States, but only the District \nof Columbia is forced to submit to such a cruel and arbitrary \nrestriction.\n  The bill also allows ob-gyn residency programs that lose their \naccreditation because of failure to provide abortion training to \ncontinue to receive Federal funds as if they were accredited. This is a \nterrible setback for women's health. This amendment invites protesters \nto target hospitals and pressure them to stop training doctors in \nprocedures that may be vitally needed to preserve the health of female \npatients.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to announce my support for \nthe Senate version of H.R. 3019. I do not make this decision lightly, \nnor do I make it with great comfort. Rather, I support this bill \ngrudgingly, because it is in the interest of my constituents that \nCongress act to complete the fiscal year 1996 budget process.\n  I am voting in favor of H.R. 3019 for three reasons. First, this bill \ncontains critical Federal relief for flood victims throughout the \nNorthwest; the Government has made promises to help people recover from \nthe damage, and this bill delivers on that promise. Second, the Senate \ntook the high road on funding for several critical programs emphasizing \neducation and the Environmental Protection Agency; I'm pleased we were \nable to add back $2.7 billion in funding for the Department of \nEducation, and over $700 million for EPA. Third, and finally, this \nCongress has an obligation to complete the people's business. We are \nnow 6 months into fiscal year 1996, and five appropriations bills \nremain unsigned. By passing this bill today, we are finally able to \nmove the process forward and see a light at the end of the tunnel on \nthis year's budget.\n  I want to be very clear about the merits of this bill: while it was \nimproved in some respects during the floor debate, it still has many \nserious problems. The salvage timber provisions are inadequate. The \nrestrictive language on reproductive freedom is a serious problem for \nwomen everywhere. The funding levels in general do not even meet fiscal \nyear 1995 levels for critical programs in education and other important \nchildren's services. There are riders on fisheries management, tribal \nappropriations, and endangered species protection that need serious \nrevisions. And, the Columbia Basin ecosystem assessment language, while \nfavorably revised since the original Interior appropriations bill, \nstill must be strengthened.\n  In short, Mr. President, there are still a lot of problems with this \nbill, and I will continue to attempt to address them as we move in a \nconference committee. And I want to make one thing very clear right \nnow: I cannot support a conference report that moves significantly \ntoward the House bill. That version of H.R. 3019 is laden with riders \nthat I believe are not remotely in the public interest. In addition, \nthe funding levels on education and other programs are simply \nunacceptable. If the conference report does not substantially reflect \nthe Senate numbers on education, it will be very difficult for me to \nsupport it.\n  In general, Mr. President, I have been deeply concerned about the way \nthis Congress has handled the fiscal year 1996 appropriations process. \nWe have seen too many riders, too many cuts poorly thought out, and too \nmuch delay in finishing what should have been done last September. This \nhasn't been the case with every bill to be sure. But the remaining five \nbills have been the unfortunate victims of too much politicking. I \nsincerely hope we can come together in conference, smooth out the \nremaining rough edges, and finish the people's business.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the omnibus \nappropriations bill. I particularly want to thank Senators Hatfield and \nGorton for their leadership and assistance in meeting the critical \nneeds of Idaho as a result of the floods. I have always voted on the \nSenate floor to provide disaster aid to other regions of the country in \ntimes of need. I now ask my colleagues to support the Northwest victims \nwith the same compassion. This is not a partisan issue, quite the \ncontrary. This is an American issue of restoring hope to families who, \nin some cases, have lost everything they own.\n\n\n                     flood damage to infrastructure\n\n  I was in my home State of Idaho during this disaster and I saw first \nhand its devastation. I witnessed flood-damaged homes and churches \nwhich had to be destroyed before they were swept downstream and knocked \nout bridges. I watched entire communities having their heart and soul \ntaken from them. I know other communities in the Northwest suffered \nthrough the same anguish that Idaho towns did.\n  In fact, for some communities the pain and suffering continues. The \ntown of St. Maries, home to 2,500, still has portions of the city under \nmore than 2 feet of water. The Federal Emergency Management Agency \nestimates that the Idaho clean up costs will exceed $13 million but \ncomplete surveys cannot be done until the water recedes. These folks \nneed help, and they need it now. That is why we must pass this \nappropriation bill as quickly as possible. I want to thank Senator \nHatfield for including my language in this bill that will provide \nfunding to rebuild damaged levees in towns like St. Maries.\n  We must repair and strengthen these levees now so we can avoid \nsimilar flood events when the spring run-off occurs.\n\n\n             environmental damage as a result of the Floods\n\n  It will be some time before we know the full impact from the \ndisaster. Although we all rightfully focus on the human impacts of acts \nof nature, there is another impact which deserves our attention. The \nenvironmental impact of the flood should not be neglected.\n  In our region, we have spent considerable sums to preserve anadromous \nfish, protect wildlife and conserve the environment. The natural \nresources of the Pacific Northwest are our heritage and legacy to \nfuture generations. If\n\n[[Page S2306]]\n\nthat investment has been compromised by the floods we should be \ninformed of it at the earliest opportunity.\n  While streams remain swollen and snowpack continues on the ground, we \nmay not have had sufficient opportunity to discern the true impact of \nthe environmental damage of the flood. The several Federal agencies \ncharged with assessing the damage need our support. That's why I have \nasked to have included in this emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill the inclusion of $1,600,000 for the Fish and Wildlife Service to \nimplement fish and wildlife restoration activities and provide \ntechnical assistance to FEMA, NCRS, the Corps of Engineers and the \nStates.\n  I want to thank Senators Hatfield and Gorton for agreeing with me \nthat wise stewardship of the land is our responsibility. Although the \nmajority of the funds available under this bill are for human needs as \na result of the flood the environmental needs are not being ignored.\n\n\n              safe drinking water act--revolving loan fund\n\n  This budget bill contains the second critical element of our effort \nto reauthorize and improve the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  Last November, the Senate unanimously passed legislation to overhaul \nthe Federal Safe Drinking Water Act. That legislation included \nauthorization, for the first time, of a State revolving loan fund for \ndrinking water infrastructure. Today, by voting to support this budget, \nwe will effectively set aside up to $900 million in 1996 to make that \nState revolving loan fund a reality. If the Safe Drinking Water Act is \nreauthorized before June 1 of this year, these funds will be available \nto States and local drinking water systems to construct or upgrade \ntheir treatment and water distribution systems.\n  States and local governments have a significant responsibility under \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act to provide safe and affordable drinking \nwater every day. This revolving loan fund will help communities, \nparticularly small and rural communities, across the country meet this \nresponsibility.\n\n\n                          hornocker institute\n\n  Among other things, this omnibus budget bill includes approximately \n$500 million in funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service for fiscal \nyear 1996. Of this amount, almost $35 million has been appropriated for \nrecovery activities under the Endangered Species Act. In conducting \nthese very important activities, I strongly urge the Fish and Wildlife \nService to fund two ongoing research projects on gray wolves that are \nbeing conducted by the Hornocker Wildlife Research Institute at the \nUniversity of Idaho.\n  As part of its recovery effort for the endangered gray wolf, the Fish \nand Wildlife Service has been artificially introducing gray wolves into \nYellowstone National Park in Montana, Wyoming, and portions of central \nIdaho. Early studies, however, have shown that introducing the gray \nwolves is having an impact on the existing mountain lion population. \nThe studies indicate that the wolf and the mountain lion are direct \ncompetitors, with the wolf emerging as the dominant predator, \njeopardizing the mountain lion young and forcing the mountain lion into \nareas occupied by humans. This is obviously an issue of significant \nconcern for the citizens of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, whose lives and \nlivelihoods may be threatened by displaced mountain lions.\n  The Hornocker Institute has been doing research on the interaction \nbetween the gray wolf and the mountain lion for the past several years \nand has been cited as the world authority on mountain lions. The \nInstitute's early research on mountain lions played a critical role in \nshaping the policy on how mountain lions should be managed in the West. \nTo continue its important research that will guide future policy on the \nmanagement of the gray wolf and mountain lion populations, the \nHornocker Institute needs $300,000 annually over the next 5 years. The \nSenate Appropriations Committee recognized the value of the institute's \nefforts and urged the Fish and Wildlife Service to support the \ninstitute's research.\n  I am disappointed that the bill does not earmark funds specifically \nfor this important research, but it is my strong hope that the Fish and \nWildlife Service will be guided by the Appropriations Committee's \nrecommendations and provide much-needed funds for the Hornocker \nInstitute to continue its research efforts.\n\n\n                             timber salvage\n\n  I also joined my colleagues in support of wise, balanced management \nof our national forests. The issue at stake--managing for healthy, \nproductive forests. The Murray amendment would have eliminated the one \ntool that is working; the one tool that is helping Idaho's economy and \nIdaho's environment recover from devastating fires which burned nearly \n589,000 acres--919 square miles--of forest land in Idaho 2 years ago. \nThat's a charred area that would cover three-fourths of the entire \nState of Rhode Island.\n  This amendment would leave that dead and dying timber to rot --adding \nfuel to future devastating fires and denying Idaho's struggling rural \ncommunities from accessing those resources.\n  Have we come to a point where it is no longer politically correct to \nharvest a tree? Gifford Pinchot, the father of the Forest Service and \nadvisor to the creator of our National Park and Forest System, Teddy \nRoosevelt, was adamant that our Federal forests not be ``preserves'', \nbut ``reserves'' managed for the best good of the public. He \nspecifically viewed timber harvest as a central part of forest \nmanagement.\n  A century of fire suppression activities has left our Nation's \nforests primed for massive, catastrophic fires. It is not a question of \nif, but when, our forests will burn again. And unsalvaged, unthinned \nburned areas are one of the tinderboxes we can point to. We have so \nmany tall, dry, match sticks covering the hillsides, waiting for \nanother lightning strike. Without restoration, those trees will burn \nagain, and without replanted cover, these watersheds are vulnerable to \nmassive soil erosion.\n  This amendment would have been a huge setback in this Congress' \nattempt, and the need to correct Federal timber policy. At some point \nwe have to decide if we are going to let the folks we hired to manage \nour forests do their job. I supported the salvage provision last year \nbecause it did exactly that--it brought management decisions back to \nthe local level, and gave local managers the flexibility to meet \nfederal environmental policy goals within the timeframe dictated by \nemergency salvage conditions.\n\n\n                        endangered species act.\n\n  As chairman of the Drinking Water, Fisheries and Wildlife \nsubcommittee I have held a number of field hearings as well as hearings \nhere in the Nation's Capital to look at the current Endangered Species \nAct and to identify ways to improve the act.\n  It is clear, from the testimony we gathered, that the Endangered \nSpecies Act has not accomplished what Congress intended when it was \nwritten more than 20 years ago. And, it's clear that it is possible to \nachieve better results for species by improving the ESA.\n  The Endangered Species Act needs to be carefully reviewed, debated, \nand rewritten so that it accomplishes its fundamental purpose--to \nconserve species. We can't wait any longer.\n  The original reasons for the moratorium remain valid. Until the \nEndangered Species Act is reformed to accomplish what it was intended \nto do, there is no reason to add more species to it.\n  Last month, the President was in Idaho addressing the needs of flood \nvictims in the northern part of my State. And during the course of his \nvisit we had a good discussion about the need to reform the Endangered \nSpecies Act. Working off of the cooperation between Federal, State and \nlocal governments who were working together to help flood victims, the \nPresident acknowledged that we need to establish the same sort of \npartnership to reform the Endangered Species Act.\n  I want to take this opportunity to complement Senator Reid, the \nranking member of our Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife, who has \nnot only acknowledged the need to work together to reform the \nEndangered Species Act, but has committed the time to make that reform \nhappen. Working together, we may find a solution to the problems of the \nact by restoring the promise of the act. But others need to participate \nin true bipartisan discussions if they are serious about reform; they \nneed to come to the table.\n\n[[Page S2307]]\n\n  I want to move forward this year with the kind of a bipartisan bill \nthat will incorporate the very real changes that everyone agrees are \nneeded. Until then it only seems appropriate that the time-out \nrepresented by the moratorium is the best way to encourage everyone to \nstay at the table.\n  Perhaps the administration agrees. The moratorium was not in force \nduring certain periods between continuing resolutions during 1995. The \nSecretary announced that he was not going to rush through various \nlisting packages or critical habitat designations during that time. \nInstead, he honored the intent of the moratorium. Why honor the intent \nof the moratorium when it did not apply, and now seek to overturn it \nduring an emergency bill?\n  There is an emergency in America concerning the Endangered Species \nAct. And from the view of my State, that need must be addressed by \nreform, not just adding more species to the list. If there is an \nemergency with regards to a particular species as a result of this \nmoratorium, let's address that, but let's not simply bring more species \nunder the umbrella of this Act, which is not recovering species in the \nfirst place.\n  It is evident to me that if we are to move forward to a safer, \ncleaner, healthier future, we have to change the way Washington \nregulates laws like the Endangered Species Act. States and communities \nmust be allowed, even encouraged, to take a greater role in \nenvironmental regulations and oversight. After all, who knows better \nabout what each community needs, a local leader or someone hundreds of \nmiles away in Washington, DC?\n  There are national environmental standards that must be set in the \nEndangered Species Act, and the Federal Government must make that \ndetermination, but Federal resources must be targeted and allocated \nmore effectively, and that's why we must have a greater involvement by \nState and local officials.\n  The improvements we need in Washington go beyond State and local \ninvolvement. We need to plan for the future of our children, not just \nfor today. Science and technology are constantly changing and \nimproving. In the case of the Endangered Species Act, the Federal \nGovernment hasn't kept up with these improvements, and old regulations \nhave become outdated and don't do the best job they can. That is why I \nwant to reform the Endangered Species Act.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, I think the moratorium on listings is \nthe best tool we have to ensure that we continue to work toward \nmeaningful reform of the Endangered Species Act.\n\n\n                    the clean water act 404(c) rider\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks about \none of the environmental provisions in the Hatfield Substitute to H.R. \n3019, the Omnibus Appropriations and Rescissions Bill. I applaud the \ngood work of Chairman Hatfield and Ranking Member Byrd and the other \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee in negotiating this \ncomprehensive measure.\n  I am deeply troubled, however, by the committee's decision to \nmaintain the rider that bars the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] \nfrom using any of its fiscal year 1996 funds to implement Section \n404(c) of the Clean Water Act.\n  Since its enactment in 1972, Section 404 of the Clean Water Act has \nplayed a key role in the progress we have made toward achieving the \nact's purpose, which is ``to maintain the chemical, physical, and \nbiological integrity of the Nation's waters.'' Section 404(c) \nauthorizes the EPA to prohibit the disposal of dredged or fill material \ninto the Nation's waters, including wetlands, if doing so would harm \nespecially significant resources.\n  The proponents of this rider assert that it would eliminate the \nconfusion caused by the ``duplicative roles'' of EPA and the Army Corps \nof Engineers in administering the Federal Wetlands Program. The problem \nwith this logic is that, every year, the Corps of Engineers itself \nsponsors water resource projects that require the disposal of hundreds \nof millions of cubic yards of dredge and fill material. Without EPA \noversight, the corps would have no check on the environmental impact of \nthese activities. In other words if the rider barring EPA oversight is \nenacted into law, who oversees what the corps does?\n  Moreover, the Corps of Engineers supports EPA's role in the veto of \nits wetlands permit decisions. I would like to quote a statement made \nin a letter written March 13, 1996, by Secretary of the Army Togo West \nand EPA Administrator Carol Browner. The letter states: ``We want to \nemphasize unequivocally that Section 404(c) provides an essential link \nbetween our agencies in the implementation of the Section 404 program \nand contributes significantly to our effective protection of the \nNation's human health and environment.'' I could not have said it \nbetter myself. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter \nwritten by Administrator Browner and Secretary West be printed in the \nRecord following this statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, EPA has used its 404(c) authority only 12 \ntimes in the history of the Clean Water Act. It is hardly a waste of \nGovernment resources. Moreover, these veto actions, although \ninfrequent, have protected almost 7,300 acres of wetlands, including \nsome of the Nation's most valuable wetlands in the Florida Everglades \nand near the lower Platte River.\n  Aside from the fact that this rider is unsound policy, the \nappropriations process simply is not the proper context to raise \ncomplex legislative issues such as EPA's role in the Federal Wetlands \nProgram. Rather, the appropriate forum for such issues is the ongoing \nClean Water reauthorization process. The Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works has held four hearings on section 404, and two additional \nhearings on Clean Water Act reauthorization. In fact, the committee \nconducted a hearing on wetlands mitigation banking just last week. I \nhave been working closely with Senator Faircloth, who is chairman of \nthe relevant subcommittee, and other members of the committee, to \nachieve meaningful reform of the Federal Wetland Program.\n  Although I do not intend to offer an amendment, I strongly urge the \ncommittee members to drop this controversial provision from the \nappropriations bill. The removal of this provision would increase the \nlikelihood that Congress will bring closure to the precarious budgetary \nsituation for fiscal year 1996.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Department of the \n           Army,\n                                                   March 13, 1996.\n     Mr. Robert G. Szabo,\n     The National Wetlands Coalition,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Szabo: We read with concern your January 22, 1996, \n     letter to President Clinton regarding his veto of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) appropriations bill, \n     in part, because the bill would have eliminated EPA's \n     authority under Clean Water Section 404(c). As the \n     President's veto message stated, this provision would \n     preclude EPA ``from exercising its authority under the Clean \n     Water Act to prevent wetlands losses.'' As the national \n     program managers of the agencies charged with the \n     administration of Clean Water Act Section 404, we appreciate \n     the opportunity to respond to your letter on behalf of the \n     Clinton Administration.\n       We want to emphasize unequivocally that Section 404(c) \n     provides an essential link between our agencies in the \n     implementation of the Section 404 program and contributes \n     significantly to our capacity to ensure effective protection \n     for the nation's human health and environment. The decision \n     of Congress in 1972 to establish joint administration of \n     Section 404 explicitly recognized the advantages of \n     integrating the Corps of Engineers historical role in \n     protecting the navigational integrity of the nation's waters \n     with EPA's responsibilities for achieving the broader \n     environmental goals of the Clean Water Act. The value and \n     logic in this decision remains valid today and we, therefore, \n     cannot agree with the conclusion in your letter that EPA's \n     authority under Section 404(c) is not justified.\n       We strongly agree that implementation of Section 404(c), \n     like the Section 404 program itself, requires a balance to \n     ensure protection of the nation's waters while effectively \n     guarding the property rights of private landowners. The \n     President's Wetlands Plan, developed in 1993, reflects this \n     commitment to make the Section 404 program more fair and \n     flexible. Many of the constructive improvements identified in \n     the President's Wetlands Plan have been implemented, and \n     tangible benefits of these actions are being realized. \n     Moreover, information collected as part of a recent Corps of \n     Engineers survey of their field offices demonstrates that \n     EPA's Section 404(c) authority is not being used in a \n     threatening way, but constructively and with considerable \n     discretion. Repeal of\n\n[[Page S2308]]\n\n     EPA's Section 404(c) authority is unnecessary to make the \n     Section 404 program more fair and flexible but would \n     invariably erode its ability to protect human health and the \n     environment. We cannot support this result.\n       The organizations which, with you, signed the letter to the \n     President represent an important cross section of the nation, \n     and we appreciate your vital interest in this issue. Our \n     challenge is to identify improvements to the Section 404 \n     program that address legitimate concerns without weakening \n     its environmental protections. We look forward to working \n     with you as we meet that challenge.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Carol M. Browner,\n                                                    Administrator.\n                                                Togo D. West, Jr.,\n                                            Secretary of the Army.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I want to say at the outset that \nhostage taking and legislative blackmail is not the way to arrive at \nthe kind of solution we need to solve our budget problems. While I \nsupport this bill's goal to provide funding for Federal agencies for \nthe remainder of the fiscal year 1996, I have several reservations \nabout the bill.\n  I am a firm believer in tightening our Government's fiscal policies \nand will continue to work toward that end. I am convinced that \nrestoring budget discipline will help ensure that our children--and \nfuture generations--will be able to achieve the American Dream. We have \nan obligation to our children to protect their future opportunities, \nand not to leave them a legacy of debt. But this bill does not do \nenough to protect American priorities.\n  The President reviewed this bill and found that it was lacking $8 \nbillion in funding for priorities important to Americans: Efforts to \nprotect the environment, efforts to help educate our children, and \ninitiatives that will help keep our streets safe. Rather than working \nin a bipartisan manner toward a bill that the President could sign, \nhowever, this bill is designed to draw a Presidential veto. This is \nunfair to our students who want to pursue educational opportunities. It \nis unfair to all Americans who want to live in a clean and safe \ncommunity. It is unfair to Government employees who want to work. And \nit is unfair to all others who depend upon the appropriations contained \nin these bills.\n  We made some strides to add funding for education by passing a \nbipartisan amendment last week, but we have not done enough to restore \nfunding for other priorities such as environmental cleanup. The bill \ndoes contain a contingency fund of $4.8 billion in additional funding, \nbut this is an illusory commitment because it is contingent on budget \nagreements not yet achieved. The contingency plan holds American \npriorities hostage.\n  The American people sent us a clear message after the last budget \ncrisis--do not risk shutting the Federal Government by promoting an \nextreme set of budget priorities. This message has apparently gone \nunheard. The continuing resolution before us does not seek balance, or \nmoderation, and it does not even pretend to resolve the important \nappropriation issues we should have resolved months ago.\n  Of the 13 appropriations bills Congress is supposed to pass every \nyear, 5 are still undone even though the fiscal year is almost half \nover. Several Federal Cabinet departments have been without fully \napproved spending plans. Now, nearly 6 months into the fiscal year, we \nare considering a 10th extension.\n  The activities financed by these uncompleted appropriation bills, or \nwhat is also known as domestic discretionary spending, is but a part of \nFederal spending that underlie our Government's budget problems. \nDomestic discretionary spending has not grown as a percentage of the \nGDP since 1969, the last time we had a balanced budget. Domestic \ndiscretionary spending comprises only one-sixth of the $1.5 trillion \nFederal budget, and it is steadily declining.\n\n  Every dollar of Federal spending must be examined to see what can be \ndone better, and what we no longer need to do. However, the budget \ncannot be balanced simply by whacking away at domestic discretionary \nspending. To suggest to the American people that by cutting \ndiscretionary spending we will achieve budgetary integrity is to \nperpetuate a fraud.\n  The budget proposed by the majority party calls for $349 billion in \nsavings from discretionary spending, but that comes from a portion of \nthe budget that constitutes only 18 percent of the overall Federal \nbudget--the part of spending that is not growing and the part of the \nbudget that funds education and police and basic services we all count \non. This part of the budget is not the major source of our deficit \nproblem. We need to focus our savings on those areas of the budget that \ndon't conflict with our priorities and values.\n  How we bring back fiscal discipline makes a real difference. If we \ncare about our children, if we care about our future, if we care about \nour Nation and ensuring an opportunity for every American to achieve \nthe American Dream, we cannot abandon our commitment to education, \naccess to health care, and to creating economic opportunity.\n  Mr. President, we need to move to a balanced budget. And we need to \ndo it in a way that does not sacrifice the long-term goals of the \nAmerican people to achieve illusory short-term cuts. We need a budget \nthat restores fiscal discipline to the Federal Government. We need a \nbudget based on the realities facing Americans. Most importantly, we \nneed a budget for our future.\n  As this bill makes disproportionate cuts in programs important to the \nAmerican people, I will vote against this bill. I urge my colleagues to \nwork together to develop the kind of overall permanent budget agreement \nthat the American people want and deserve.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am sorry that I cannot vote for this \nappropriations bill today. We must move quickly to resolve the issues \nthat still remain from last year's prolonged, confrontational, and, in \nthe end, fruitless budget debates. But this bill will not advance that \ncause.\n  This bill, despite the best efforts of the distinguished leaders of \nthe Appropriations Committee, still falls short. I am heartened that a \nmajority of the Senate was moved to approve more adequate funding for \nour Nation's educational system. There is certainly no higher priority \nfor us than preparing our country's young people for the future.\n  But that is not the only priority our country has, Mr. President, nor \nis it our only responsibility here in Congress. And, I am sorry to say, \nI find that this bill does not fulfill those responsibilities.\n  Our attempts to provide more support for the infrastructure \ninvestments we need for cleaner air and water were an inadequate step \nin the right direction. And we failed to meet our responsibility to \nmaintain our country's hard-won superiority in high-technology research \nand development.\n  It is surely a false economy if we claim that we must sacrifice clean \nair and clean water, that we must roll back the progress we have made \nin advanced technologies, to balance the budget.\n  That is simply not the case. Amendments that provided more adequate \nsupport for those key national priorities at the same time specified \nthe savings from other parts of the budget needed to neutralize their \nimpact on the deficit.\n  Mr. President, we could have met those responsibilities and still \nkept within the tight spending limits set by this bill. But we chose \nnot to, Mr. President. And if the Senate bill falls short, Mr. \nPresident, the version of this legislation passed by the House, I fear \nis even worse.\n  But, Mr. President, I must oppose this omnibus appropriations bill \nfor one overriding reason--this bill slashes the effort to add 100,000 \nmore police to our Nation's streets. This is the single-most-important \ncrime-fighting initiative the Federal Government has undertaken in \ndecades and I will not be party to any effort to go back on our word to \nadd 100,000 police officers to the streets and neighborhoods all across \nAmerica.\n  I have spoken with the White House and the President agrees that the \nonly course to take on the 100,000 cops program is unequivocal and \nunwavering support for adding 100,000 cops to our streets--all \ndedicated to community policing. This program is working--more than \n33,000 police have already been funded.\n  What is more, the results of community policing speak for \nthemselves--more cops mean less crime.\n\n  To cite just one specific example--look what has happened in New York \nCity. More police devoted to community policing has proven to mean less\n\n[[Page S2309]]\n\ncrime--in the first 6 months of 1995 compared to the first 6 months of \n1994: murder is down by 30 percent; robbery is down by 22 percent; \nburglary is down by 18 percent; and car theft is down by 25 percent.\n  In the face of that success in fighting America's crime epidemic, it \nwould be folly to go back on our commitment to adding 100,000 cops. \n``If it ain't broke, don't fix it''--as a former President used to say.\n  That, unfortunately, is exactly what the latest continuing resolution \nproposes to do--instead of fully funding the President's request for \nthe 100,000 cops program, this latest proposal would slash the 1996 \nrequest for the cops program to $975 million--about one-half the $1.9 \nbillion request.\n  Not only is the 100,000 cops program subject to extreme cuts--but the \nlatest continuing resolution also takes nearly $813 million that was \nsupposed to go to the 100,000 cops program to fund a so-called law \nenforcement block grant program.\n  What is wrong with this approach?\n  First, this so-called law enforcement block grant is written so \nbroadly that the money could be spent on everything from prosecutors to \nprobation officers to traffic lights or parking meters--and not a \nsingle new cop.\n  Second, this block grant has never been authorized by the Senate. So, \nlet's be clear on what is being done here. What this continuing \nresolution does is take a crime bill that has been passed only by the \nHouse, whose funds have been authorized only by the House, whose block \ngrant idea has already been rejected by the Senate, and incorporate it \ninto an appropriations bill so it is passed and funded--all in one fell \nswoop.\n  Mr. President, if we are going to legislate by fiat like this, then \nwe might as well do away with committees, with hearings, with \nsubcommittee markups, with full committee markups, and with careful \nconsideration of authorizing legislation. We could simply do all the \nSenate's business on appropriations bills or continuing resolutions.\n  I, for one, happen to believe that's a terrible way to proceed and I \nbelieve that's reason enough to oppose this bill.\n  If the Republicans want to change the crime bill, they have the right \nto try--but let's do it the right way and then let's vote on it. Wiping \nout major pieces of the most significant anti-crime legislation ever \npassed by the Congress on an appropriations bill makes a mockery of our \nSenate process. The importance of the programs we are considering, not \nto mention the perception of our institution, demands better.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                 Vote on Amendment No. 3466, as amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to the \nsubstitute amendment, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 3466), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

I want \nto commend particularly the leadership that has been so important in \ngetting us to this particular point. I hope that all of you will say \nyour prayers, and include the Appropriations Committee, as it now goes \nto conference with the House of Representatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2302-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2309-S2322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY FAIRNESS ACT OF 1995\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport S. 942.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 942) to promote increased understanding of \n     Federal regulations and increased voluntary compliance with \n     such regulations by small entities, to provide for the \n     designation of regional ombudsmen and oversight boards to \n     monitor the enforcement practices of certain Federal agencies \n     with respect to small business concerns, to provide relief \n     from excessive and arbitrary regulatory enforcement actions \n     against small entities, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill.\n\n[[Page S2310]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I intend to support the small business \nregulatory fairness bill, S. 942, as modified by the managers' \namendment.\n  This bill is a testament to the good work that occurred at the White \nHouse Conference on Small Business organized here in Washington last \nJune. This national conference was the final step in a grassroots \npublic discourse about small business needs and concerns that involved \nmore than 21,000 small business people participating in 59 State \nconferences across the country. Starting with more than 3,000 issue \nrecommendations at the State level, regional groups shaved the list to \na set of 293 concerns. And finally, the White House Conference focused \non 60 specific recommendations that might substantially improve the \nenvironment for the growth and success of small business activity.\n  I think that the work of the White House Conference has given us a \ngood roadmap of items to debate and discuss which directly impact our \nNation's economic health. One of the major concerns of small business \nowners today is simply complying with Federal regulations, being able \nto understand the regulations--which are often extraordinarily complex, \nand not falling subject to arbitrary enforcement and penalties. It is \nimportant that our Government be accountable to those it governs and \nmust avoid arbitrary and ad hoc enforcement.\n  Mr. President, this legislation requires that Federal agencies \nproduce small entity-compliance guides that outline in simple, \nunderstandable language what is required from small businesses. This is \na commonsense adjustment in which both Federal regulators and small \nfirms win. Furthermore, this act creates five-person regional citizen \nsmall business review boards in each of the 10 Government regions \ncovered by the Small Business Administration. This measure gives small \nbusiness a voice at the table when Federal guidelines are discussed, \nand this is as it should be.\n  Also central to this act is the creation of more cooperative and less \npunitive regulatory environment between agencies and small business \nthat is less threatening and more solution-oriented than we have \nachieved in the past. And equally important are provisions in this \nlegislation making Federal regulators more accountable for enforcement \nactions by providing small businesses a meaningful opportunity for \nredress of excessive or arbitrary enforcement activities.\n\n  As our Nation's larger firms continue a process of downsizing, \nrestructuring, and outsourcing, our small business sector will continue \nto grow rapidly and will continue to be the major jobs generator for \nthe country. It is crucial that the Federal Government do what it can \nto help small businesses thrive in a regulatory environment that is \nwell defined and user friendly rather than to suffer because of \nuncertainty and unclear codes.\n  I am frequently visited by small business people and groups from my \nown State of New Mexico and am very much pleased by their attention to \nthe debates that occur in Washington about legislation that might \nimpact them and their companies. These firms typically don't have a \nstaff section designed to study the tax implications of everything we \ndo here in this Chamber; nor do they have the time and personnel to \ndevote to close monitoring of our legislative activities. But still, \ntens of thousands of small business people in the Nation do invest time \nand become personally involved with the legislative process and have \ncommitted themselves to improving the interaction between Government \nand the small business sector.\n  I would like to mention one example from New Mexico, a person who \ndemonstrates well a combination of entrepreneurial excellence, \ncommunity concern and strong civic involvement. Ioana McNamara, the \npresident and founder of an Albuquerque-based small business called \nWall-Write, was one of those who participated from New Mexico in the \nWhite House Conference on Small Business. I want to publicly commend \nher for getting involved and working on these issues. She and others \nfrom the New Mexico small business delegation, including another small \nbusiness person--Diane Denish--who served as the delegation chair for \nthe White House Conference--have done a great deal to make sure that \nsmall firms in New Mexico do their part to achieve a more productive \nrelationship between Government and business.\n  Clearly, people like Ioana McNamara and Diane Denish have more than \nenough to do in growing their businesses without paying attention to \nwhether this Chamber is about to do something that harms or helps their \nbusinesses--but they have decided to do what they can to help implement \nthe measures decided on at the White House Conference. I think our \nNation should express its gratitude to these people and the thousands \nof others who participate in the making of good policy.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \nFairness Act, represents an opportunity to change not only the \nregulatory burden on small business, but more importantly, to begin to \nchange the way all Federal agencies, including the Internal Revenue \nService [IRS], deal with small business. I am pleased to be a cosponsor \nof the bill.\n  In far too many cases, the Federal Government has acted as the judge, \njury, and executioner for small businesses. Testimony before the Small \nBusiness Committee indicated many small businesses fear agencies like \nthe IRS will levy huge fines on them for failure to comply with minor \nrules and regulations--of which they may be entirely ignorant. The \nFederal Government must become a partner in the growth and development \nof small businesses, not an adversary.\n  While not perfect, this legislation includes a number of provisions \nwhich will ease regulatory burdens and give small businesses some \nrecourse when Federal bureaucrats are over zealous in the exercise of \ntheir power.\n  The bill requires agencies to publish in plain English a guide to \nassist small business in complying with regulations. Federal \nregulations are often too difficult for anyone to understand, let alone \na small businessperson who is trying to run his or her business. It \nwill also allow Small Business Development Centers to offer assistance \nto small businesses in complying with Federal regulations.\n  The bill would also establish an ombudsman to help small businesses \nget fair and legal treatment from the Government if they have been \ntreated unfairly. The ombudsman would also assist small businesses in \nrecovering legal fees as a result of unfair Government actions.\n  Under the bill, Federal agencies would be required to waive civil \npenalties for first violations by small businesses that do not \nconstitute a serious threat to public health, safety, or the \nenvironment.\n  The bill provides that small business representatives are to be \nconsulted in Federal agency rulemaking decisions that would have a \nsignificant impact on small businesses so that small business interests \nwould be considered at the outset in the development of regulations.\n  While these reforms will not end the difficulties many small \nbusinesses face in complying with Federal regulations, they should help \nease the burden. I hope this legislation will mark the beginning of a \nnew era of better relations between Government and small business. The \nFederal Government should be working in partnership with small \nbusinesses--not at cross-purposes with them.\n  I am proud to support this legislation and would like to thank the \nchairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator Bond, and the ranking \nmember Senator Bumpers along with their staffs for their effort in \nproducing this legislation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend Senator Bond for his leadership on small business issues, and \nlend my support to the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Act, which \nwill lessen regulatory burdens imposed on small businesses by Federal \nagencies.\n  Mr. President, I have talked with many small business owners in my \nhome State and one thing they all tell me is how difficult and costly \nit has become to comply with many of the Federal regulations imposed \nupon the. Among other things, this legislation will require agencies to \npublish materials in plain language to help small businesses comply \nwith regulations.\n\n[[Page S2311]]\n\nThe bill will also enhance the small business communities' voice with \nthe Small Business Administration by providing them a role in \ndetermining future regulations.\n  When I was growing up, my father ran a small business in Bothell, WA. \nI know the time and energy small business people put into their \ncompanies. And, throughout my term, I have worked to reform a \nGovernment that continues to hamper small business owners.\n  I was a cosponsor of the S-Corporation Reform Act of 1993, and \nreturned as a cosponsor of S. 758 last year, which would remove \nobsolete provisions from the tax code, making it easier for small \nbusinesses to raise capital. I cosponsored the Family Health Insurance \nProtection Act which would provide health insurance market reform for \nsmall businesses and families. And, on the first full day of this \nCongress, I introduced the American Family Business Preservation Act \nwhich would reduce the rate of estate tax imposed on a family owned \nbusiness, encouraging families to keep their businesses intact. And, as \nmany of my colleagues will remember, last Congress, we fixed a problem \nthat has been plaguing small businesses that wanted to refinance their \nSBA 503 loans. Now, many small businesses in Washington State and \nacross the country will be able to refinance their 503 loans.\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe Government cannot solve every \nproblem in this country, but it can foster a healthy economic \nenvironment in which all businesses may prosper. I encourage each of my \ncolleagues to support S. 942. The Small Business Regulatory Fairness \nAct continues our work by reducing redtape and making it easier for our \nsmall businesses to comply with often burdensome Federal regulations. I \nbelieve this is the type of reform our small businesses want and \ndeserve.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I support the managers' amendment to S. \n942, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. I have \nbeen a long supporter of regulatory reform, and I believe this \nlegislation provides significant regulatory relief to small businesses, \nsmall governments, and other small entities.\n  I congratulate the managers of this bill--Senator Bond, chairman of \nthe Small Business Committee, and Senator Bumpers, Ranking Democrat on \nthe committee--for their efforts to craft a workable bill. I know they \nhave consulted frequently with other members, the small business \ncommunity, and the administration to address concerns and improve the \nlegislation. In the midst of contentious debate about other regulatory \nreform issues, Senator Bond and Senator Bumpers have put together a \nregulatory reform bill that will provide significant relief to small \nbusiness. This legislation should get broad bipartisan support in both \nthe Senate and House, and I am sure will soon be signed into law.\n  The purposes of this legislation are important and I support them. \nSome of the details, however, still concern me. For example, the bill \nprovides for judicial review of Regulatory Flexibility Act decisions. \nThis will put needed teeth into the Reg Flex Act and ensure that \nagencies prepare required regulatory impact analyses and pay more \nattention to the special impact of their rules on small business and \nother small entities, such as local governments. I am concerned, \nhowever, that these judicial review provisions may be overly broad and \nwill lead to unnecessary litigation. Only time will tell whether my \nconcern is well founded. At this point, I am prepared to give the new \nprovisions the benefit of some doubt.\n\n  The bill also establishes a small business ombudsman process to help \nimprove cooperation between regulatory agencies and regulated \nbusinesses. I support this idea. But, I am concerned that the \nimplementation process, with its Small Business Fairness Boards, will \nend up creating a one-sided record of complaints that will distort the \nbroad public mission of our agencies. Our agencies should not be viewed \nas the enemy when they carry out the laws passed by the people's \nrepresentatives in Congress. I am happy, at least, that in the final \nversion of the bill before us, the Ombudsman will focus on general \nagency enforcement activity and not attempt to evaluate or rate the \nperformance of individual agency personnel.\n  Finally, the legislation creates small business review panels to \nensure that small business perspectives are fully considered by \nagencies during rulemaking. Again, I support the important purpose of \nensuring that agencies hear the voices of the little guys who do not \nalways get through the maze of agency process and the larger more \norganized commenters. It is, however, important to ensure that this \nopportunity for comment does not create a precedent of giving special \nleverage to one segment of the public. I am, at least, heartened by the \nfact that review panel comments on an agency proposed rule will go into \nthe public record, and that other interested parties will have an \nopportunity to respond to those comments before the agency makes its \nrulemaking decision. The fact that these review panels, as well as the \nFairness Boards, will be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act \n[FACA] and the Government in the Sunshine Act will also help ensure \nthat the new process will be open to the public.\n  On balance, I believe the managers' amendment should be supported. \nAgain, I commend Senator Bond and Senator Bumpers for their openness to \nconcerns about the bill. Since we first saw drafts a week or so ago, \nsignificant changes and improvements have been made. Given these \nchanges, I will vote for the managers amendment. But given my concerns, \nlet me also say that these provisions should not be modified by the \nHouse. If they are made more onerous, then they should not be \nsupported. If House action leads to changes in conference, then the \nSenate should say no to the conference report.\n  Let me clear up one fact about this legislation. A week and a half \nago, on Thursday, March 7, 1996, Senator Bond stood here on the floor \nand described his hopes for a bipartisan agreement on this legislation. \nOur Minority Leader, Senator Daschle, agreed, saying that Democrats \nhoped to provide broad, if not unanimous, support for the final bill. \nUnfortunately, several other of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle then went on to accuse Democrats of delaying the bill and even of \nengaging in a filibuster. That could not be further from the truth.\n  When the Small Business Committee considered the legislation on \nWednesday, March 6, there was general agreement that a managers' \namendment would be prepared for the bill. On the 7th, as we waited to \nsee the proposed amendment, we were surprised to hear our Republican \ncolleagues accusing Democrats of holding up the bill. As it turned out, \nI did not see the final proposed manager's amendment for another whole \nweek--March 14, an entire week after Thursday the 7th. Far from \nDemocrats holding up this legislation, the fact is that the managers of \nthis bill were not ready to bring the bill to the floor until at least \na full week after we were being accused of delay. I am definitely not \ncriticizing the managers. Their careful deliberations are to be \ncommended. But certainly, other Senators should not be falsely accused \nof delaying the bill, when they were only waiting to see the results of \nthose deliberations.\n  I hope I have set the record straight. There was never a filibuster \non this legislation. We are happy there is finally an agreement on the \nmanagers' amendment. We are pleased that we now have it and can move \nforward and quickly pass the legislation.\n  I must say though, that once again, I am very disappointed in the \nrhetorical excesses of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nRather than even admit to working cooperatively, which is the case with \nthe bipartisan bill before us, they tried to mislead the public about \nthe status of this legislation. There certainly are enough instances \nwhere we honestly disagree, but here where we are working together, \nthere is nothing to disagree about.\n  We need more of the bipartisan cooperation seen in the work of \nSenators Bond and Bumpers and the other members of the Small Business \nCommittee on this legislation. We need much less of partisan sniping.\n\n            The Nickles-Reid Congressional Review Amendment\n\n  S. 942 comes to the floor with an agreement to consider one other \namendment. This is the Nickles-Reid Congressional Review legislation \nand I urge my colleagues to support this\n\n[[Page S2312]]\n\namendment. We passed this legislation last year, as a substitute to the \nRegulatory Moratorium. Congressional Review will create more work for \nus, but its expedited legislative veto process will ensure \ncongressional accountability for Federal agency rules. I believe we \nneed this process so that we can do our part for regulatory reform.\n  I have always been struck when in hearings, agency officials--under \nsuccessive administrations--have pointed out that most agency \nregulations are strictly required by laws passed by Congress. The \nNickles-Reid Congressional Review process will close the loop, so that \nwhen an agency issues a rule that some may oppose, we will have an \nopportunity to consider it in the context of the law and determine its \nreasonableness. This will not only help with accountability for \nindividual rules, but will also help us identify specific statutory \nprovisions that need revision. For these reasons, I am happy to support \nthe Nickles-Reid amendment, and urge my colleagues to do so, as well.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  With the combination of Small Business Regulatory Fairness and \nCongressional Review, we have significant bipartisan regulatory reform \nlegislation. It should be passed by the House and be signed into law by \nthe President.\n  Our job as legislators is to create laws that can work and can \nimprove conditions in our country. Some have wanted to bull through and \nlegislate now on a larger regulatory reform package. The truth is that \nthere is simply too much there that is unsettled and about which too \nmany do not agree. Now is the time to move legislation that can work \nand that will improve the regulatory process.\n  If in the quiet of committee we can return to the other regulatory \nreform issues of cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment, I think we \nshould. But for now, let us work together on bills such as the \nlegislation before us today that can pass and should pass.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 942, the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act.\n  Mr. President, America's small businesses badly need relief from \nexcessive and unnecessary regulations. For years, those of us on the \nSmall Business Committee have heard first hand from men and women in \nsmall businesses about the disproportionate regulatory burden they \nface. This burden was confirmed late last year in a report by the Small \nBusiness Administration's Office of Advocacy. Among other things, the \nreport found that while small businesses employ 53 percent of the \nworkforce, they bear 63 percent of total business regulatory costs.\n  The annual average cost of regulation, paperwork, and tax compliance \nfor small businesses is about $5,000 per employee. By contrast, the \ncomparable burden for businesses with over 500 workers is $3,400 per \nemployee. This difference is significant. Big businesses already enjoy \na competitive advantage over their smaller counterparts because of \neconomies of scale. The Federal Government should not further \ndisadvantage small businesses by imposing uniform regulations where \ntiering the regulation to account for business size would be just as \neffective.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us will give teeth to the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act Congress passed in 1980. That act, known as the Reg \nFlex Act, requires agencies to assess the effects of their proposed \nrules on small entities. Based on this assessment, agencies either have \nto conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis describing the impact on \nsmall entities, or they must certify that their rule will not have a \nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\n  Despite Congress's best intentions, agencies all too often have \nrefused to comply with the Reg Flex Act. Unfortunately, there is \nnothing small businesses can do currently to enforce compliance. S. 942 \nwould correct this problem. The bill would enable small businesses to \ntake agencies to court to challenge an agency's determination. This \nshould provide the spur necessary to ensure much greater compliance in \nthe future.\n  In addition, this bill will require agencies to publish compliance \nguides for small businesses. In the study commissioned by SBA, 94 \npercent of small businesses said that it was unclear what they had to \ndo to be in compliance with regulations. By providing easily understood \nexplanations of regulations, agencies will ensure greater compliance. \nIn addition, the bill directs agencies to provide informal guidance to \nsmall businesses about what is required of them to be in compliance.\n  In the case of regulations for which a regulatory flexibility \nanalysis is required, small businesses will now be part of the \nrulemaking process by providing advice and recommendations to agencies \nbefore proposed and final rules are issued. To further help small \nbusinesses make their way through complicated regulations, the bill \npermits Small Business Development Centers and Manufacturing Technology \nCenters to offer regulatory compliance assistance and onsite \nassessments for small businesses.\n  Finally, Mr. President, S. 942 makes it easier, in certain instances, \nfor small businesses to obtain attorneys fees from the government for \nclaims upon which they prevail. I had serious concerns about the \nlanguage we considered in the Small Business Committee mark up, which \nmodified the so-called Equal Access to Justice Act. I did, however, \nhave the assurance of the Senator from Missouri that our offices would \nchange these provisions so that we would not be rewarding companies \nwith attorneys fees when they violated the law, because, for example, \nthey prevailed on 1 of 10 claims. I believe the new language contained \nin sections 301 and 302 accomplishes the goal of aiding firms that had \nto fight the Government on meritless suits, while protecting taxpayers \nfrom paying the attorneys fees for companies that have broken the law.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Bond and his staff for their \nwillingness to adopt recommended changes suggested by myself and other \nmembers of the Small Business Committee. Most Members of this body \nexpress their desire to work with their colleagues across the aisle, \nbut those expressions often prove hollow. In this case, however, I am \nhappy to say that S. 942 is truly a bipartisan bill and I hope we will \nhave many more such bills before the end of the 104th Congress.\n  I also want to acknowledge the work of the Clinton Administration's \n``Reinventing Government'' initiative and last year's White House \nConference on Small Business. Their efforts laid the groundwork for the \nlegislation we are considering today.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Bond and Small Business Committee \nstaffers Keith Cole and John Ball for their assistance on this \nlegislation, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting S. \n942.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, no one more strongly supports the goals \nsought by the statutes and regulations of this country than I do.\n  I come from a beautiful State blessed with resources that I have \nworked to see used productively and conserved wisely, I myself enjoy \nthe great outdoors in Alaska, along with my family, and intend to have \nthese same kinds of experiences enjoyed by my children and \ngrandchildren; I have been a banker, where it has been my privilege to \nsee individuals succeed in small business; I have seen first hand how \nissues like safety and worker protection go hand in hand with ensuring \nthat success, but there is no doubt that achieving better protection of \nhuman health and the environment can only happen if we regulate \nsmarter.\n  Individuals and businesses, big and small, spend too much time trying \nto comply with too much paperwork, and too much regulation from too \nmany Washington bureaucrats. For example: above-ground storage tanks \nmust comply with five different regulations that each require a \nseparate spill prevention plan; this means that a business with tanks \nfiles five different sets of plans--one to the State, and two each to \nthe EPA and the Coast Guard.\n  If you buy a business that was once registered to produce pesticides, \neven if you don't produce pesticides, or never have, the EPA will still \nwant you to send in annual production reports with zeros filled in. If \nyou don't, you can be sued and potentially fined. For just one statute, \nthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, EPA has issued 17,000 pages \nof regulations and proposed regulations. The volume I'm holding has \nover 1,000 pages, and on any one of\n\n[[Page S2313]]\n\nthem is a place where a small business can get tripped up. By the way, \nthis is one volume of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations. \nTitle 40 deals with environmental protection. Title 40 has 20 more \nvolumes like this one. And its only title 40.\n  The Code of Federal Regulations occupies an entire 4 foot by 8 foot \nbookcase in the Senate library. A copy of the code costs almost $1,000, \nand is updated four times a year. Even if a small business could afford \nto buy it, it would be impossible to read it all. Why do we want to \nforce every business in America to have to keep a battery of lawyers \naround just to advise about the overwhelming details in the Code of \nFederal Regulations?\n  Now, usually when I describe these examples, I talk about Anchorage, \nAK. There, fish guts were added to the waste water to comply with \nregulations that require a certain amount of organic waste removed \nduring sewage treatment. The water was too clean, so material had to be \nadded just to comply with the requirement to get a minimum amount out. \nBut I am happy to say that today I am no longer using that example. It \nseems that in response to a lawsuit, EPA announced its intention to \nlift some of the restrictions on sewage treatment plants such as the \none in Anchorage.\n  EPA states, ``This change would provide the affected municipalities \nwith additional flexibility and, in some cases, cost savings without \ncompromising environmental quality.''\n  If we are to move forward to a safer, cleaner, healthier future, we \nhave to change the way Washington regulates. This bill is a positive \nand helpful step in that direction. S. 942 will ensure small business \nparticipates in rulemaking. This in turn will mean that rules will take \nsmall business needs into consideration before a rule is enacted. The \nbill also allows judicial review of regulations for compliance with the \n16-year-old Regulatory Flexibility Act. A court can now examine whether \nagencies considered adverse impacts to Small Business when it writes \nregulations, and determine if an agency acted in an arbitrary manner. \nPenalty waivers and reductions when appropriate for small business \nviolations. Recovery of attorney's fees when small business is forced \ninto defensive litigation due to enforcement excesses. Comprehensive \nregulatory reform will continue to be a high priority for this Senator.\n  As science and technology continue to change, we must have a Federal \nGovernment that can be responsive to such changes. We need to plan for \nthe future, not just for today, and that means a regulatory system that \ncan keep up with improvements.\n  Four fundamental changes to the regulatory system will have to occur \nto ensure those improvements in the future. First, we must do a \nthorough review of existing regulations in place, decide what we need \nand what we don't, and avoid adding any more we don't need; second, \nWashington should be required to disclose the expected cost of current \nand new regulations. The public has a right to know what laws and \nregulations cost; third, when making regulatory decisions, the \nGovernment should use best estimates and realistic assumptions rather \nthan worst case scenarios advanced by extremists; and fourth, new \nregulations should be based on the most advanced and credible \nscientific knowledge available.\n  Common sense must be returned to regulating. I applaud Senators Bond \nand Bumpers, and all those who worked to bring this bill to the floor. \nIt is an important first step toward a safer, cleaner, healthier \nfuture.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to vote for this \nbill, reported out of the Small Business Committee 2 weeks ago. I \ncommend Chairman Bond for moving the bill through our Committee, as \nwell as ranking member Senator Bumpers. I appreciate the cooperation of \nboth in working with me and my staff to help ensure that the easing of \nregulatory burden accomplished in this bill, which is needed and \ndesirable, will not turn back the clock in the area of necessary \nenforcement of worker safety laws and regulations when there are \nserious violations.\n  The bill provides judicial review for agency actions under the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act. And it would require agencies to publish \nplain-English compliance guides to help small business meet Government \nrules. I appreciate that the Senate is taking this positive, bipartisan \naction in the area of regulatory reform policy with a bill that came \nfrom the Small Business Committee. It brings badly needed common sense \nto regulations affecting small businesses.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we take this step on a key item \nfrom the agenda of the White House Conference on Small Business. \nMinnesota delegates to the White House Conference selected this issue, \nas expressed in a Conference resolution, to be one of their top \npriorities.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I strongly support the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. Small business is overloaded with \nunreasonable regulatory requirements and paperwork. We are long overdue \nin doing something about it.\n  This legislation will help small business in several major ways. \nFirst, it provides judicial review of the Regulatory Flexibility Act to \nensure that agencies will consider the impact of regulations on small \nbusinesses, small towns, and nonprofit organizations. The Reg-Flex Act \nhas been on the books for 16 years, but agencies have ignored it \nbecause it could not be enforced in court. We are putting an end to \nthat.\n  Second, this legislation helps small business to participate in the \nfederal regulatory process. Third, it provides an opportunity for small \nbusinesses to redress arbitrary Government enforcement actions.\n  In addition, Senator Nickles is adding a provision that would allow \nCongress to review new rules under expedited procedures. This can \nprovide redress for both big and small business, governments, and non-\nprofit organizations. If a rule is unreasonable, Congress will have an \nopportunity to veto it.\n  Mr. President, small business is critical to the well-being of the \ncountry and my home State of Alaska. Over 99 percent of Alaska's \nbusinesses are small businesses. They are the largest employers of \nminorities, women, and youth in Alaska. Alaska boasts a higher \npercentage of women-owned businesses than any State. Small business \ncreates new jobs, is a crucial source of entrepreneurial innovation, \nand makes the American dream a reality for countless Americans.\n  Federal bureaucrats must be more sensitive to the devastating impact \nthat overregulation can have on small business. About 65 percent of \nAlaska's small businesses employ one to four employees. Many could \ndrown unless we stem the rising tide of federal rules and redtape. I \ncongratulate Senator Bond and my other colleagues who have promoted \nthis important legislation.\n\n\n                      small business review panels\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Let me make sure I understand how the Small Business \nReview Panels will work. Before the publication of an initial \nregulatory flexibility analysis for a proposed EPA or OSHA rule, the \nSBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy will gather information from \nindividual representatives of small businesses, and other small \nentities such as small local governments, about the potential impacts \nof that proposed rule. That information will then be reviewed by a \npanel composed of members from EPA or OSHA, OIRA, and the Chief \nCounsel. The panel will then issue a report on those individual's \ncomments, which will become part of the rulemaking record. Then, after \nthe proposed rule is published in the Federal Register and prior to the \npublication of a final regulatory flexibility analysis, a second review \npanel will be convened, and again it will review and report on the \nindividual's comments on the proposed rule. Is this correct?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes; my colleague from Ohio has correctly summarized the \nreview panel process.\n  Mr. GLENN. Good, now let me ask specifically with regard to the first \nreview panel stage: I trust that it is the managers' intention that the \nreview panel's report and related information be placed in the \nrulemaking record in a timely fashion so that others interested in the \nproposed rule may have a reasonable opportunity to review that \ninformation and submit their own responses to it before the close of \nthe agency's public comment period for the proposed rule.\n\n[[Page S2314]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct.\n  Mr. GLENN. Good. Now, let me ask about the second review panel stage: \nI trust that it is the managers' intention that should an agency decide \nto significantly modify a proposed final rule on the basis of the \npanel's report, the agency will reopen the rulemaking proceeding and \nallow public comment on the newly revised proposal. I believe that not \nto do so would be to overturn longstanding rules against ex parte \ncommunications. Again, securing meaningful input from small entities \nshould not be at the price of undercutting the openness and fairness of \nthe Government decisionmaking process.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree. Again, our purpose is to ensure that the concerns \nof small business and other small entities be fully and carefully \nconsidered by rulemaking agencies. If those concerns lead to a \nsignificant change in the regulatory proposal, the process should be \nreopened to allow all interested parties to comment on the revised \nproposal.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Senator very much. I am glad that we agree on \nhow this process will work.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one of the proposals we have before us, in \nS. 942, would establish an ombudsman in the Small Business \nAdministration. That ombudsman would solicit information from small \nbusinesses on Federal regulatory enforcement practices and develop \nratings of how well Federal agencies perform their enforcement duties. \nThe ombudsman would have the ability to refer serious cases of abuse to \nan agency's inspector general.\n  This provision seeks to make regulatory agencies more responsive to \nthe concerns of small businesses by giving small businesses a means to \nrespond to excessive regulatory enforcement practices. While I firmly \nbelieve that we need to fight for fundamental change in the culture of \nsmall business regulation, I question whether this proposal, although \nwell-intentioned, is the best catalyst for affecting that change.\n  I am concerend that the Small Business Committee did not fully \nconsider other options that could provide a better mechanism for giving \nsmall businesses a stronger voice within agencies that regulate them. \nIn particular, I think the committee should have taken more time to \nlook at the pros and cons of placing an ombudsman in each regulatory \nagency, rather than relying on a lone ombudsman in the Small Business \nAdministration to cover all agencies.\n\n  I have been working for the past several months on a proposal that \nwould create an office of ombudsman in each major regulatory agency. My \nproposal would give the ombudsman sufficient authority within the \nagency to solve problems and sufficient independence from the \nregulatory structure to act fairly. The ombudsman would be the mediator \nor honest broker between the small business who is the subject of an \ninspection or enforcement action and the regulatory apparatus of the \nagency.\n  This was a recommendation of the Administrative Conference of the \nUnited States back in 1990, and I think it makes a lot of sense. I \nbelieve that much of the dissatisfaction of the regulated public with \nregulations is not only with the content of some of our regulations but \nalso with the way in which they are enforced. Agencies often view a \nsmall business as a violator to be caught instead of as a company to be \nhelped into compliance. And that's a big difference. The ombudsman \nwould be there to put a friendly place--the spirit of cooperation--on \nthe implementation of regulatory requirements.\n  I agree that we need to give small businesses a stronger voice in the \nagencies that regulate them, but we must make sure that agencies are \nready and willing to listen. That's why we need to consider placing an \nombudsman in each agency and not just rely on a single ombudsman in the \nSmall Business Administration.\n  Mr. President, I have a number of concerns about placing a lone \nombudsman in the Small Business Administration.\n  First, the ombudsman would be responsible for soliciting comments \nabout and developing ratings of programs and offices in each Federal \nagency that regulates the small business community. Carrying out this \nresponsibility would require the ombudsman to become familiar with the \noperations of hundreds of programs in dozens of agencies. That's just \nnot a reasonable expectation.\n  Second, ombudsmen have traditionally been neutral officials who field \ncomplaints and recommend solutions to individual disputes between the \nGovernment and the regulated public. The broad jurisdiction of the \noffice proposed in this bill would prohibit the ombudsman from focusing \non the day-to-day problems small businesses face in dealing with agency \nregulators. The EPA Small Business ombudsman fields thousands of such \ninquiries every year, and that's just for one agency. Rather than \ninvestigating and mediating individual disputes himself or herself, the \nombudsman would have to refer alleged cases of agency misconduct to the \ninspector general of the relevant agency.\n  In other words, the ombudsman wouldn't receive information for the \npurpose of mediating disputes, solving problems, and fostering \ncollaboration between agencies and regulated parties. Instead the \nombudsman would receive information primarily for assessing agency \nperformance. That doesn't help get immediate and specific problems \nsolved.\n  At the hearing on S. 942 in the Small Business Committee, several \nrepresentatives of the small business community said that they would \nprefer to have a single ombudsman in the Small Business Administration \nrather than an ombudsman in each individual regulatory agency. They \nargued that agency ombudsmen could be influenced by internal agency \npolitics and that, because of this, small businesses would be \nsusceptible to intimidation by regulators if they came forward with \ncomplaints. While I understand the reluctance of small businesses to \ncomplain directly to an agency official about inappropriate regulatory \npractices, I believe that ombudsmen in regulatory agencies can be given \nsufficient independence from the regulatory structure to act fairly and \nto assure regulated parties that their inquiries will not be used \nagainst them.\n  One witness, Wendy Lechner from the Printing Industries of America, \nmade a point of praising the work of the Small Business Ombudsman at \nthe Environmental Protection Agency and recommended that such ombudsman \nprograms should be replicated throughout the regulatory agencies. The \nEPA office is one of approximately half a dozen ombudsman offices \noperating throughout the Federal Government that address disputes \nbetween agencies and the regulated public. By and large, these \nombudsmen have improved communications between the agencies and \nregulated parties, uncovered systemic problems and chronic abuses in \nthe regulatory process, and saved valuable resources through informal \ndispute resolution that otherwise would have been wasted on the costs \nof formal legal proceedings.\n  Mr. President, I do not think the ombudsman provision in S. 942 \nsolves the enforcement problem for small businesses. I will continue to \nwork on legislation that would place an ombudsman in each regulatory \nagency. I think such an approach would foster collaboration between \nsmall businesses and the agencies that regulate them and achieve better \nresults.\n  I commend the chairman and ranking Democrat on the Small Business \nCommittee for their hard work on this bill and look forward to working \nwith them as my ombudsman proposal is developed.\n\n\n     the small business regulatory enforcement fairness act of 1996\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know I do not have to tell you that \nsmall businesses create most of the jobs in America. Small businesses \nare the engine that keep the American economy running. I know that in \nmy State small businesses make up 85 to 90 percent of private \nemployers. In that regard, I have created a New Mexico small business \nadvisory board.\n  I have also participated in Small Business Committee field hearings \nthroughout my State. Indeed, I was privileged to have had the chairman \nof the Small Business Committee, Senator Bond, come out to New Mexico \nand hear from those New Mexico small businesses firsthand at a Small \nBusiness Committee field hearing in Albuquerque.\n  Mr. President, what we found was that almost all of the small \nbusiness owners we talked to--who are the people who create almost all \nof the private sector jobs in my State--told us just\n\n[[Page S2315]]\n\nhow smothering the explosion in Federal regulations has become.\n  In particular, those small business owners identified the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency [EPA] as the two Federal agencies which \npromulgate the most unreasonable and burdensome regulations. Mr. \nPresident, these small business painted a picture of the Federal \nbureaucracy at its worst: arrogant, unresponsive, inefficient, and \nunaccountable.\n  Further, Mr. President, because a great number of new businesses are \nbeing started by women, some of the most vocal critics of EPA's and \nOSHA's unreasonable regulations are women-owned businesses.\n  I believe one of the biggest reasons for these bureaucratic problems \nis that small businesses are just not adequately consulted when \nregulations affecting them are being proposed and promulgated. I am not \nalone in this belief. In 1994 five agencies--including the Small \nBusiness Administration, EPA, and OSHA--held a small business forum on \nregulatory reform, and they came up with some conclusions about the \nproblems with the current regulatory process.\n  Let me quote from the administration's own report summarizing the \nprincipal concerns identified at the forum:\n\n       Concern: ``The inability of small business owners to \n     comprehend overly complex regulations and those that are \n     overlapping, inconsistent and redundant;''\n       Concern: ``The need for agency regulatory officials to \n     understand the nuances of the regulated industry and the \n     compliance constraints of small business;''\n       Concern: ``The perceived existence of an adversarial \n     relationship between small business owners and federal \n     agencies;''\n\n  And finally, Mr. President, and I think most important:\n\n       Concern: ``The need for more small business involvement in \n     the regulatory development process, particularly during the \n     analytic, risk assessment and preliminary drafting stages.''\n\n  Mr. President, this is the agencies' own report on the problems with \nthe regulatory process.\n  During the floor debate on last year's regulatory reform bill, \nChairman Bond and I successfully added an amendment that would have \nsquarely addressed those concerns. That amendment had the support of \nthe National Federation of Independent Business, and was accepted by \nthe Senate. As we all know, however, the broader regulatory bill did \npass.\n  That is why I am so happy to have worked with Chairman Bond to ensure \nthat my small business advocacy panel initiative was included as a \nsection of the bill we are about to vote on today, the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996. The small business \ncommunity has no greater champion than my good friend from Missouri, \nand I am proud to be associated with his outstanding bill.\n  Mr. President, the structure and process of these advocacy panels is \nas follows:\n  First, prior to publication of an initial regulatory flexibility--reg \nflex--analysis, an agency would notify the Chief Counsel for Advocacy \nof the Small Business Administration of potential impacts of a proposed \nrule on small business.\n  Second, the Chief Counsel would identify individual representatives \nof small business for advice and recommendations about the proposed \nrule.\n  Third, the agency would convene a review panel consisting of \nrepresentatives of the agency, the Office of Information and Regulatory \nAffairs, and the Chief Counsel, to review the information collected on \nthe impact of the proposed rule on small business.\n  Pursuant to the information obtained at the review panels, and where \nappropriate, the agency shall modify its proposed rule.\n  Finally, the findings and comments of the review panel shall be \nincluded as part of the rulemaking record.\n  This process shall be repeated prior to the final publication of a \nreg flex analysis.\n  Remember, Mr. President, the agencies themselves have recognized that \nsmall businesses are underrepresented during rulemakings. I believe \nthat these review panels, convened before the initial and the final reg \nflex analyses, will ensure that small businesses finally have an \nadequate voice in the regulatory process. In addition, these panels, \nworking together so all viewpoints are represented, will be the crux of \nreasonable, consistent, and understandable rulemaking. Finally, Mr. \nPresident, and perhaps most important, these panels will help reduce \ncounterproductive, unreasonable Federal regulations at the same time \nthey are helping to foster the nonadversarial, cooperative \nrelationships that most agree are long overdue between small businesses \nand Federal agencies.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the pending bill, S. 942, the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, deserves the \nsupport of all Senators--and the able chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee, our good friend from Missouri, Mr. Bond, is to be commended \nfor his persistence.\n  This legislation is badly needed. In North Carolina literally \nhundreds of small businesses are struggling under the heavy regulatory \nburdens imposed by the Washington bureaucracy. These businesses are \nseeing their profit margins gobbled up by oppressive Federal \nregulations.\n  Mr. President, S. 942, will go a long way toward leveling the playing \nfield and giving small businesses some long overdue relief from a \nportion of existing burdensome regulations. Small businesses now will \nbe better able to challenge burdensome regulations in the courts.\n  Federal agencies hereafter will be required to obtain the views and \nopinions of small businesses before regulations are drafted, making \nsmall businesses players before regulations are drafted and imposed.\n  Mr. President, Mary McCarthy in the October 18, 1958, New Yorker \nMagazine observed, ``Bureaucracy, the rule of no one, has become the \nmodern form of despotism.''\n  How true, and I'm hopeful that both the Senate and the House will \npass this legislation, and that the President will sign it, because no \nbureaucracy or bureaucrat should be permitted to be a despot over the \npeople they are supposed to be serving.\n\n\n                 duties and functions of the ombudsman\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. One of the proposals put forward in S. 942 would establish \nan ombudsman position in the Small Business Administration. The \nproposal of the Senator from Missouri would provide a way to gather and \npublicize information about how agencies across the board treat small \nbusinesses in the regulatory enforcement process. I have concerns about \nthe language the bill uses to describe the duties and functions of the \nombudsman.\n  Specifically, I would like to ask the Senator from Missouri about \ntitle II, section 30(b)(2) (A) and (C). In an earlier version of the \nbill, these sections, which outline the duties of the ombudsman, stated \nthat the ombudsman shall\n\n     work with each agency with regulatory authority over small \n     businesses to ensure that small business concerns that \n     receive or are subject to an audit, on-site inspection, \n     compliance assistance effort, or other enforcement related \n     communication or contact by agency personnel are [provided \n     with a means to comment on and rate the performance of such \n     personnel],\n\nand,\n\n     based on substantiated comments received from small business \n     concerns and the Boards, annually report to Congress and \n     affected agencies [concerning the enforcement activities of \n     agency personnel including a rating of the responsiveness to \n     small business of the various regional and program offices \n     and personnel of each agency].\n\n  This language appeared to direct small businesses and the ombudsman \nto publish employment ratings of specific agency employees who carry \nout regulatory enforcement actions. While the boards and the ombudsman \nare specifically directed to report on substantiated actions of agency \npersonnel, I am concerned that this provision would have focused \nattention inappropriately on public ratings of individuals rather than \non rating the performance of the agencies and agency offices. Such an \nindividual rating system could interfere with the employment \nrelationship between agencies and their employees.\n\n  The language of the bill before us today is somewhat different from \nthe earlier version. The current version of the bill states that the \nombudsman shall\n\n     work with each agency with regulatory authority over small \n     businesses to ensure that small business concerns that \n     receive or are subject to an audit, on-site inspection, \n     compliance assistance effort, or other enforcement related \n     communication or contact by\n\n[[Page S2316]]\n\n     agency personnel are [provided with a means to comment on the \n     enforcement activity conducted by such personnel],\n\nand\n\n     based on substantiated comments received from small business \n     concerns and the Boards, annually report to Congress and \n     affected agencies [evaluating the enforcement activities of \n     agency personnel including a rating of the responsiveness to \n     small business of the various regional and program offices of \n     each agency].\n\n  While the current language still allows for comment on the \nenforcement activities of agency personnel in order to identify \npotential abuses of the regulatory process, it appears to remove the \nmandate for the boards and the ombudsman to create a public performance \nrating of individual agency employees. Senator Bond, is this \ninterpretation correct and, if so, was the change in language made in \norder to focus the reports of the boards and the ombudsman on rating \noverall agency performance rather than on rating individual regulators?\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator's interpretation of the change in language is \ncorrect. My goal is to reduce the instances of excessive and abusive \nenforcement actions. Those actions obviously originate in the acts of \nindividual enforcement personnel. Sometimes the problem is with the \npolicies of an agency, and we are very definitely trying to change the \nculture and policies of Federal regulatory agencies. At other times, \nthe problem is really that there are some bad apples at these agencies. \nIt is for that reason that we specifically included a provision to \nallow the ombudsman, where appropriate, to refer serious problems with \nindividuals to the agency's inspector general for proper action. The \nombudsman's report to Congress should not single out individual agency \nemployees by name or assign an individual evaluation or rating that \nmight interfere with agency management and personnel policies. The \nintent of the bill is to give small businesses a voice in evaluating \nthe overall performances of agencies and agency offices in their \ndealings with the small business community.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the chairman of the Small Business Committee. This \nis an important change and clarifies that the purpose of the \nombudsman's report is not to rate individual agency personnel, but to \nassess each program's or agency's performance as a whole.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, passage of the Small Business Regulatory \nFairness Act will mark an important milestone in our efforts to provide \nAmerican business with reasonable, common sense regulatory relief. It \nis a bill that should be passed by Congress and sent to the President \nwith dispatch.\n  This legislation, which was approved unanimously by the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee, and which I expect will pass the Senate with \noverwhelming bipartisan support, will provide much needed change in the \nway Federal agencies deal with American small business. It acknowledges \nthat the Federal bureaucracy often chokes small business in red tape, \nand institutes a number of reforms that will unleash their productive \nenergy without diminishing the Federal responsibility to protect the \npublic health and safety. Passage of this bill will send an important \nmessage to small business owners across the country that their voice is \nbeing heard in Washington, DC.\n  Small businesses already face a daunting array of challenges, from \nthe uncertain economic climate to the myriad daily paperwork burdens of \naccounting, bookkeeping, and bill paying. The further burden of keeping \nup with, and complying with, Federal regulations can discourage even \nthe most stalwart business men and women from striving to achieve their \ndream of entrepreneurship.\n  The Federal Government has a responsibility to protect worker health \nand safety, public health, and the environment. In that effort, \nagencies issue regulations, but experience shows that many of those \nregulations look good on paper, but don't work in the real world. This \nbill acknowledges that fact and demonstrates our determination to both \nconfront and correct mistakes.\n  Federal agencies should be as sensitive as possible to the challenges \nfaced by small businesses in America, and I expect this bill will help \nachieve that goal. Many of this bill's provisions were developed by \nsmall business owners from South Dakota and across the country during \nthe White House Conference on Small Business last summer. No one knows \nmore about the risks and pitfalls associated with owning a small \nbusiness than businesspeople themselves. The White House conference \ngave them a forum in which to discuss how the regulatory process could \nbe improved, and I am glad that Congress has taken to heart what they \nhad to say on this subject.\n  One of the most frequent criticisms I hear from small business owners \nis that Federal agencies bring harsh enforcement actions against \nbusinesses for relatively insignificant and unintentional violations of \nFederal rules. This legislation responds to that concern by requiring \nagencies to develop policies to waive fines for first-time, nonserious \nviolations.\n  The legislation also requires Federal agencies to publish easy-to-\nread guidance for small business to comply with Federal rules and \ncreates a small business and agricultural ombudsman at the Small \nBusiness Administration to provide a means to comment on agency \nenforcement personnel and to develop a customer satisfaction rating of \nFederal agencies. It assists small businesses in recovering attorneys' \nfees if they have been subject to excessive and unsustainable \nenforcement actions, and subjects final agency actions under the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act to judicial review. Small businesses will \nnow be able to hold the feet of Federal agencies to the fire and ensure \nthat they comply with the letter and spirit of the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act\n  Finally, I am very pleased that the congressional veto legislation \ndeveloped by Senators Reid and Nickles and passed by the Senate last \nyear has been added to the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Act. The \nReid/Nickles provision establishes a process through which Congress can \nreview major regulations before they are issued, thereby ensuring that \nthe agencies developing these rules adhere to the intent of Congress \nand develop reasonable requirements for American business.\n  Mr. President, the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Act was written \nwith advice from the small business community and will pass the Senate \nwith strong bipartisan support. It reaffirms Congress' belief in the \nessential role that small business plays in the American economy and \nsends a clear signal that the public and private sectors are ready to \nwork together in promoting the economic growth and expansion we will \nneed to compete in the 21st century. I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport this important bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Regulatory \n     Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) a vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n     to creating jobs in a dynamic economy;\n       (2) small businesses bear a disproportionate share of \n     regulatory costs and burdens;\n       (3) fundamental changes that are needed in the regulatory \n     and enforcement culture of Federal agencies to make agencies \n     more responsive to small business can be made without \n     compromising the statutory missions of the agencies;\n       (4) three of the top recommendations of the White House \n     Conference on Small Business involve reforms to the way \n     Government regulations are developed and enforced, and \n     reductions in Government paperwork requirements;\n       (5) the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act have \n     too often been ignored by Government agencies, resulting in \n     greater regulatory burdens on small entities than \n     necessitated by statute; and\n       (6) small entities should be given the opportunity to seek \n     judicial review of agency actions required by the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to implement certain recommendations of the 1995 White \n     House Conference on Small Business regarding the development \n     and enforcement of Federal regulations;\n       (2) to provide for judicial review of the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act;\n       (3) to encourage the effective participation of small \n     businesses in the Federal regulatory process;\n       (4) to simplify the language of Federal regulations \n     affecting small businesses;\n       (5) to develop more accessible sources of information on \n     regulatory and reporting requirements for small businesses;\n       (6) to create a more cooperative regulatory environment \n     among agencies and small businesses that is less punitive and \n     more solution-oriented; and\n       (7) to make Federal regulators more accountable for their \n     enforcement actions by providing small entities with a \n     meaningful opportunity for redress of excessive enforcement \n     activities.\n\n     SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall become effective on the date 90 days after \n     enactment, except that the amendments made by title IV of \n     this Act shall not apply to interpretive rules for which a \n     notice of proposed rulemaking was published prior to the date \n     of enactment.\n             TITLE I--REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SIMPLIFICATION\n\n     SEC. 101.

COMPLIANCE GUIDES.\n\n       (a) Compliance Guide.--For each rule or group of related \n     rules for which an agency is required to prepare a final \n     regulatory flexibility analysis under section 604 of title 5, \n     United States Code, the agency shall publish one or more \n     guides to assist small entities in complying with the rule, \n     and shall designate such publications as ``small entity \n     compliance guides''. The guides shall explain the actions a \n     small entity is required to take to comply with a rule or \n     group of rules. The agency shall, in its sole discretion, \n     taking into account the subject matter of the rule and the \n     language of relevant statutes, ensure that the guide is \n     written using sufficiently plain language likely to be \n     understood by affected small entities. Agencies may prepare \n     separate guides covering groups or classes of similarly \n     affected small entities, and may cooperate with associations \n     of small entities to develop and distribute such guides.\n       (b) Comprehensive Source of Information.--Agencies shall \n     cooperate to make available to small entities through \n     comprehensive sources if information, the small entity \n     compliance guides and all other available information on \n     statutory and regulatory requirements affecting small \n     entities.\n       (c) Limitation on Judicial review.--An agency's small \n     entity compliance guide shall not be subject to judicial \n     review, except that in any civil or administrative action \n     against a small entity for a violation occurring after the \n     effective date of this section, the content of the small \n     entity compliance guide may be considered as evidence of the \n     reasonableness or appropriateness of any proposed fines, \n     penalties or damages.\n\n     SEC. 103.

In any \n     civil or administrative action against a small entity, \n     guidance given by an agency applying the law to facts \n     provided by the small entity may be considered as evidence of \n     the reasonableness or appropriateness of any proposed fines, \n     penalties or damages sought against such small entity.\n       (b) Program.--Each agency regulating the activities of \n     small entities shall establish a program for responding to \n     such inquiries no later than 1 year after enactment of this \n     section, utilizing existing functions and personnel of the \n     agency to the extent practicable.\n\n     SEC. 104.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nbill was passed.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation to \nmy colleagues for the overwhelming endorsement of this small business \nregulatory relief measure. Particularly, I want to thank my ranking \nmember, Senator Bumpers. He and all the members of the committee worked \nvery hard on this bill.\n  The purpose of the bill is to provide targeted relief to small \nbusinesses, small entities such as townships, counties, and cities, and \nnot-for-profit organizations who feel overwhelmed by Government \nregulation.\n  This is a measure providing judicial enforcement and therefore, \nputting teeth into the requirements of the measure that Congress \nadopted in 1980 saying that regulations affecting small business and \nsmall entities must have an analysis to make sure that flexibility for \nthese small entities was included and was a No. 3 priority for small \nbusiness. At the White House Conference on Small Business held in \nWashington last year, 2,000 delegates from all across the country said \nthis was the third most important item on their agenda.\n  We took that message from the small businesses, from small entities, \nfrom people who attended our hearings across the country and in \nWashington, and people who contacted us in our States, and we crafted a \nmeasure that had the strongest bipartisan support. Our staffs worked \nwith a wide variety of groups. We had the full support of the President \nand the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. But lots of \npeople had lots of concerns and lots of little issues that needed to be \naddressed in this bill. As a result, we made significant numbers of \nminor changes to make sure that the bill did what it accomplishes.\n  I believe that while the project is not perfect, it is an excellent \nmeasure. I hope we will see quick action on it in the House so that we \nmay come to conference and agree, and send to the President something \nat least very close to this measure.\n\n  I wish to extend a very special thanks to the counsel for the \nminority, John Ball, to the director of the Small Business Committee, \nLouis Taylor, and to Keith Cole. Among them, they listened to many, \nmany hours of telephone calls and concerns from people who had a little \nfix here and a little fix there. The end product, I think, reflected \nmuch good advice and some advice that could not be taken. But I express \nappreciation, first, to the members of the Small Business Committee \nthemselves who worked hard on this, to all of their staffs, and to the \nrepresentatives of small business who showed the strength and the \nresolve to keep us focused on this, a measure designed to provide \nregulatory relief to an area which has experienced tremendous burdens \nfrom Government regulations.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S2322]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business for 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week, a new book hit the stands \ntitled ``Blood Sport.'' It is written by Mr. James B. Stewart.\n  The book is an account of the Whitewater issue. Many of us have had \ntrouble understanding the issue. Reading this book helps. It makes a \ncomplicated financial scandal read more like a story.\n  Mr. Stewart was given access to sources by the White House. In part, \nit was because he is ideologically compatible with the Clintons. Those \nare Mr. Stewart's bona fides for the book he writes about the President \nand the First Lady.\n  In his own words, Mr. Stewart paints the character of the first \ncouple this way:\n\n       [T]he Clintons themselves proved no different from their \n     recent predecessors in the White House, deeply enmeshed in a \n     Washington culture so accustomed to partisan distortion and \n     ``spin'' that truth is the most frightening prospect of all.\n\n  Let me repeat that last phrase, Mr. President: `` * * * that truth is \nthe most frightening prospect of all.''\n  Mr. Stewart's observation seems to substantiate those of columnist \nCharles Krauthammer. On January 12, Mr. Krauthammer's column appeared \nin the Washington Post under the title, ``Why Whitewater Now?'' In it, \nhe calls Whitewater ``a scandal that appears to be all coverup and no \ncrime.'' He then asks the logical question: Why would there be a \ncoverup if there's no crime? He asks the question of both Whitewater \nand Travelgate.\n  Here is his conclusion: ``Because the vanity of the Clintons is not \nthat they are merely law abiding * * * but that they are morally \nsuperior.''\n  In Whitewater, the Clintons certainly are vulnerable. In October \n1991, bill Clinton said: ``Let's not forget that the most irresponsible \npeople of all in the 1980s were * * * those who sold out our savings \nand loans with bogus deals.''\n  Meanwhile, we now find that Mrs. Clinton drafted the option papers \nfor Castle Grande on behalf of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. Federal \nregulators have called Castle Grande a sham operation. Isn't it fair, \nthen, to lump the Clintons into the same category of, using Clinton's \nwords, ``the most irresponsible people of all in the 1980s?''\n  In Travelgate, the Clintons are once again vulnerable. Using Mr. \nKrauthammer's words, the ``morally superior'' Clintons, had an interest \nin covering up their nonillegal actions. After all, just how morally \nsuperior can one be when sacking seven innocent employees for a \nrelative and a rich Hollywood crony, who, both, by the way, advised the \naction and stood to profit from it?\n  And finally, there's Cattlegate. During the 1992 campaign, the \nClintons railed against Wall Street's high rollers. We later learn that \nthe First Lady's luck had turned $1,000 into $100,000. Once again, the \ntarget of the Clintons' railing might well have included the Clintons \nthemselves.\n  Mr. Krauthammer sums this all up in a phrase: ``Political \nduplicity.'' He says: ``[T]he offense is hypocrisy of a high order. \nHaving posed as our moral betters, they had to cover up. At stake is \ntheir image * * * ''\n  Mr. President, it is my view that there's a serious lack of moral \nleadership in the White House. By moral, I mean basic values such as \nhonesty, trust, forthrightness. It is the quality most needed in the \nPresidency--in a President. The governed expect that their elected \nofficials, their leaders, will be role models.\n  Franklin Roosevelt is a more credible source than I on this point. He \nonce said: ``The Presidency is not merely an administrative office * * \n* It is more than an engineering job * * * It is pre-eminently a place \nof moral leadership.''\n  Clearly, FDR understood the importance of the First Family setting an \nexemplary standard for the governed.\n  I feel obliged to share these observations, Mr. President. Having \nlong been a student of politics and history, I adopted a view held by \nanother Roosevelt--Teddy Roosevelt. He commented on how important it is \nto criticize the President when warranted:\n\n       [I]t is absolutely necessary that there should be full \n     liberty to tell the truth about his acts * * * Any other \n     attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To \n     announce that there must be no criticism of the President * * \n     * is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally \n     treasonable to the American public * * * It is even more \n     important to tell the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, about \n     him than about any one else.\n\n  Mr. President, I feel the same obligation felt by Teddy Roosevelt--to \ntell the truth about the President. Pleasant or unpleasant. And the \ncrucial issue is the same one proclaimed by Franklin Roosevelt--moral \nleadership.\n  In my view, there is a void in this White House of moral leadership. \nAs we approach a new era, a new millenium, and a new world, this is not \ndesirable. How can we be leaders of the free world without strong \nleadership at home?\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2322-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2322-S2323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        A BOOK THAT BRINGS NEW UNDERSTANDING TO A TRAGIC ILLNESS\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to talk \nabout a book I recently read, and to recommend it to anyone who seeks \nto learn more about Alhzeimer's Disease. The book is called ``He Used \nTo Be Somebody'' and it is a poignant, soul-searching account of one \ncouple's struggle with the disease as told through the eyes of the wife \nand caregiver. The author is an extraordinary woman, Beverly Bigtree \nMurphy.\n  What made this story particularly moving for me is that I knew the \nman about whom the book is written. Tom Murphy was a good friend of \nmine. Even if you did not know Tom personally, however, you come to \nknow him over the course of the book. And it is by watching the loss of \nhis great spirit and personality little by little to this disease that \nthe reader comes closer to understanding the reality of Alzheimer's.\n  The book is made up of episodes that illustrate the process by which \nAlzheimer's disease takes away a loved one. Through her personal \nanecdotes and history, Beverly Bigtree Murphy conveys a larger picture \nof what life with an Alzheimer's sufferer is like in a way that no \nclinical account can. She manages to incorporate in the book her whole \nordeal, describing problems caused by lack of understanding from family \nand loved ones, discouragement from doctors, legal battles and the \nfinancial strain.\n  What other people would describe as a nightmare scenario--what is in \nfact a nightmare, the author accepts as real and shows how she has \nworked through it. In order to fight the fear, anger and sadness, she \nuses her strong resolve and her love for her husband.\n  There is a lot to be learned in this book about the effects of grief \nand the emotional toll of the disease. In addition to being a love \nstory and a very personal account, ``He Used To Be Somebody'' also \naddresses the larger social issue of Alzheimer's disease. It seeks to \ndisabuse the public of the misconceptions and distortions in the media \nand in society that stem from a fundamental lack of understanding. In \nthis way, Beverly Bigtree Murphy acts as an advocate for Alzheimer \npatients and their families.\n  She asserts the power of positive thinking, and describes her \nrealization that even in the face of a hopeless, unchangeable \nsituation, people still have choices. They can choose how to respond. \nIn ``He Used To Be Somebody,'' we see Beverly Murphy choose love over \nanger. Through her description of isolation, loneliness and feelings of \nbeing trapped, she achieves what she describes as: ``a mission to \nincrease awareness of caregiver needs, and to work as an activist to \nimprove the care of and attitudes towards the frail elderly in this \ncountry.''\n\n[[Page S2323]]\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to read this book. Whether or not \nyou have a friend or loved one who suffers from Alzheimer's, this book \nis an excellent tool for understanding the nature of the disease. It is \nan informative guide and it is an inspirational story.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2322-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SHAWN AUSTIN\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am proud to bring to the attention of \nthe Senate, the courage and patriotism of a brave young Montanan. Shawn \nAustin, a Billings-born 21-year-old, was shot in the left shoulder \nwhile patrolling his base in Northern Bosnia. Shawn spotted an intruder \ntrying to break in through his camp's perimeter. When Shawn challenged \nhim, the intruder opened fire. Shawn was hit, but he was able to return \nfire and the intruder fled.\n  Fortunately, the bullet did not hit any bones and caused little \ndamage. God willing, Shawn will be back on his feet very soon. He is \nthe second soldier in the American peace-keeping force in Bosnia to be \ninjured. And I think this occasion gives us a chance to pause and think \ndeeply on our Nation's mission in this troubled part of the world.\n  I spoke with Shawn's parents, Terry and Doreen, last week. They are \nproud of and concerned about their son. I share their concerns. And I \nsalute Shawn Austin for his bravery in the line of duty. He has paid a \nhigh price for our country.

Mr. President, I was greatly saddened to hear of the \ndeath of Roswell Gilpatric this past Friday. As Deputy Secretary of \nDefense during President Kennedy's administration, he provided wise \ncounsel throughout those thousand days--and especially during times of \ngreat crisis.\n  At the height of the Cuban missile crisis, when the crucial decision \nhad to be made on what course of action to take--an air strike or a \nblockade--Roswell Gilpatric spoke up. His experience and wisdom led him \nto say to President Kennedy that, ``Essentially, this is a choice \nbetween limited action and unlimited action, and most of us think that \nit is better to start with limited action.'' At a very difficult \nmoment, President Kennedy's respect for Ros Gilpatric's good judgment \nhelped to reinforce his own instincts that it would be best to start \nwith a course of limited action. We now know what officials did not \nknow then--that the consequences of an air strike could have triggered \na nuclear exchange, the results being too terrible to imagine.\n  Ted Sorensen said that Roswell Gilpatric was an ``indispensable'' man \nin the administration of President Kennedy, as his impact in the Cuban \nmissile crisis illustrates. He was also valuable in his effort to help \nSecretary of Defense McNamara reorganize the Defense Department's \nmanagement and command staffs. His intelligence, resourcefulness, and \neasygoing manner made him a man who could be depended on to handle \ngreat responsibility with grace, dignity, and diplomacy. His entire \nlife was an example of that.\n  Roswell Gilpatric, a native of New York, attended Yale University. He \ngraduated with honors as a member of Phi Beta Kappa and went on to Yale \nLaw School where he became an editor of the Law Journal. After his \ngraduation in 1931, he joined the law firm of Cravath, Swain & Moore \nwhere he rose to become a partner, and later presiding partner, from \n1966 until his retirement in 1977. During these years he also made time \nfor public service, first, as Undersecretary of the Air Force from 1951 \nto 1953, and then as a member of the New Frontier, assisting President \nKennedy. After his public service in Washington, he returned to New \nYork and became a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and \neventually its chairman.\n  From the beginning of his service as Deputy Secretary of Defense, Ros \nGilpatric was a valued advisor to my brother. As the years passed, he \nprovided warm friendship and loyal support to all of us in the Kennedy \nfamily, and especially to Jackie after the loss of President Kennedy. \nThey shared an interest in the arts and worked together on many causes \nin his capacity as a trustee of NYU's Institute of Fine Arts, the New \nYork Public Library, and the Metropolitan Museum.\n  Vicki joins me in expressing our deepest sympathy to his wife Mimi \nand his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. I know that \nthey take comfort and pride in his outstanding contributions to the \nNation and New York. Roswell Gilpatric served his community and his \ncountry with great caring, commitment, and distinction. President \nKennedy paid him his highest compliment when said of him what we all \nsay now--Roswell Gilpatric made a difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2323-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PASSING OF TRIBAL ELDER\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, the Northern Cheyenne and native \nAmericans across the country are mourning the loss of an elder, \nstatesman, and ambassador for our people, and I would like to take a \nfew moments to pay tribute to this extraordinary man whose death is a \ngreat loss not only for all Indian nations but for the entire country.\n  William ``Bill'' Tallbull's life exemplifies service and dedication \nto one's country and people. A World War II veteran, Bill spent much of \nhis life on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation serving his tribe, \nincluding a position as a councilman for the Northern Cheyenne. He \nretired in 1972, and while most people dream of retirement, Bill was \nnot the type of man to be idle. He came out of retirement a few short \nyears later, and went on to serve his tribe and his country for another \ntwo decades.\n  Bill's list of accomplishments is a long and impressive list. He has \ndone more in his lifetime than most people ever dream of doing. He \nbecame an assistant history professor at Dull Knife Memorial College, \nlocated on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, teaching oral traditions \nand ethno-botany classes. From 1983 through 1995, he served as chairman \nof the Northern Cheyenne Tribal Cultural Resource Program, and in 1990, \nhe received the Montana State Historic Preservation Award becoming the \nfirst native American so honored by the State of Montana.\n  Bill was also instrumental in the formation of the Native American \nGrave Protection and Repatriation Act, having worked with former \nSenator Melcher of Montana on the initial draft of that legislation. He \nwas later appointed by former Secretary of the Interior Manual Lujan, \nJr., to sit on the committee which wrote the regulations for this act. \nBill was the only native American to serve on that committee.\n  In his ongoing efforts to safeguard the native American culture and \nheritage, Bill was a founder of the Medicine Wheel Alliance, an \norganization committed to preserving the Medicine Wheel National \nHistoric Landmark in the Bighorn Mountains. This commitment to landmark \npreservation led President Clinton, in 1994, to appoint Bill to become \nthe first native American ever to serve on the Advisory Council on \nHistoric Preservation, a national panel committed to protecting \nhistorical landmarks across the country.\n  A professor, author, historian, and ethno-botanist, Bill was also a \ndevoted husband, father, and tribal elder. He was admired and respected \nby all who knew him, and his commitment to the promotion of cultural \nawareness and to the protection of the native American heritage \nbenefited all Americans, regardless of race or ethnicity.\n  I was honored to have known this distinguished tribal leader, and his \ndeath is a great loss for all of us. However, I'm certain Bill would \nnot have wanted his death to create a void where his work is concerned. \nWe can all learn from this great man and continue his work for cultural \nawareness and spiritual integrity of the land. There could be no better \ntribute to such a man as Bill Tallbull.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2323-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2323-S2324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE VALUE OF LIFE: HARVEY C. KRAUTSCHUN DAY IN SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, men are measured by both word and deed, \nyet the greater measure of man is by their deeds. A man's deeds shape \nthe character of mankind. Our active protection of human life is a \nmonumental measure of mankind's character. Harvey Krautschun's deeds \ndefine the essence of ``being committed to life'' and\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\nhis own personal character--one that should be a model for mankind.\n  All South Dakotans know Harvey for his great service in our State \nlegislature. He has served in the legislature for 11 years. He has been \nthe Speaker of the State House of Representatives for a year. Recently, \nHarvey announced he will not seek reelection. This is unfortunate. His \nshoes will be hard to fill. But I rise today to pay tribute to Harvey's \ncontributions not as an elected official, which are many, but in his \nsingular contribution as a loving, caring husband.\n  Recently, Gov. Bill Janklow declared Saturday, February 24, Harvey C. \nKrautschun Day in South Dakota. This honor was given for the life he \nsaved--the life of his wife, Joy. He stood by Joy's hospital bed as she \nlay comatose for a month, fighting for her life. Because of his \nconstancy and commitment to his wife's life, even as doctors began \ndiscussing terminating life-support, Harvey's devotion remained \nunmoved. He would see his wife awake again.\n  Harvey demonstrated bravery, courage, and faith in protecting his \nwife's life. Joy found herself in this condition also because of \nbravery and courage. In July of 1995, when a newborn colt jumped into \nan 8-foot-deep pond, Joy jumped in to save the colt. While trying to \nsave the colt, Joy's heart suddenly failed. Harvey rushed to her side, \nand began administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Their son, Bart, \nrushed to find additional help, calling an ambulance. Bart returned to \nhis mother's side and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on her. \nFather and son together fought to save Joy's life. The massive heart \nfailure pushed her into a coma. Miraculously, Joy awoke from her coma. \nHer recovery from the massive heart arrhythmia would entail months of \nhospitalizations and therapy. Joy did recover, she did awaken from the \ncoma, and today she is living with her family. Doctors had believed she \nwould not live. But Harvey and his family made a commitment to Joy's \nlife, and, thereby, saved her.\n  To speak of saving a life, to speak of heroism measures a man's \nvalues and ideals. To take courageous, loving actions measures a man's \nvalor and commitments. Considering the turbulence surrounding all of us \non a daily basis, at times finding simple answers to our problems is \ndifficult, if not humanly impossible. Some mornings while reading the \nSouth Dakota newspapers, I wonder, ``What keeps people so strong?'' In \nthe quake of unforseen events--I have found strength in faith and \nprayer. So when I heard of the sudden accident of Joy Krautschun and \nthe courageous and enduring actions of her husband, Harvey, I knew \nfaith in the human spirit and prayer are the strongest, most powerful \nagent we have to combat the turbulence in our lives.\n  I have personally known Harvey for many years. As fellow runners, we \njogged together through Spearfish Canyon. As a South Dakota statesman, \nHarvey has dutifully represented and protected his community, State, \nand all human life. Harvey has always been there for his constituents. \nIn cases where the problem stretched to the Federal level, Harvey took \nthe initiative to seek out help. It has been my pleasure to have worked \nwith Harvey on such cases in the past. Harvey truly believes in \nfighting the good fight.\n  I have a great deal of respect and admiration for Harvey's leadership \nin the South Dakota Legislature. I trust and appreciate his views and \nadvice on State and national issues. Harvey and his entire family are \ngood, exemplary people and patriots of their Spearfish community.\n  Harriet and I wish Harvey and his family many more years of health \nand happiness. Harvey, Joy and their family continue to be in our \nthoughts and prayers. Knowing a man who is so committed in faith and \ndeed to community, State, country, family, and the very essence of life \nis an honor. Harvey is true to his rocksolid beliefs in both word and \ndeed.\n  February 24 may have been Harvey Krautschun Day for South Dakota, but \nit's safe to say that for Joy Krautschun, every day is Harvey \nKrautschun day.\n\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2323-4", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today the administration officially sent \nits budget requests to the Congress. Although much of the detailed \nbudget information is still not available for review, I want to provide \nmy initial views of the material we have received in the Armed Services \nCommittee. On the positive side of the ledger, I was very pleased that \nthe military pay raise was fully funded in this budget request. The \nyoung men and women who serve our Nation in uniform continue to be the \nmost important asset of our Nation's defense. This year, I intend that \nthe Armed Services Committee will continue to provide increased funding \nfor the quality-of-life initiatives and programs we began in last \nyear's authorization bill.\n  Mr. President, I am troubled over several decisions made in the \nproposed budget. First is the Defense Department's decision to again \nreduce funding for critical ballistic missile defenses. We should be \nseeking ways to accelerate the development and deployment of both \ntheater and national missile defense systems, not delay them. Under the \nDepartment's new proposal, we would not deploy a theater high altitude \narea defense system, commonly known as THAAD, or Navy upper tier, for \nanother decade. This delay is unacceptable. I find it hard to believe \nthat the administration would continue to place the lives of our \nservice men and women at risk, by delaying this critical capability.\n  Additionally, the levels of spending for modernization are perilously \ndangerous. Gains made in last year's bill, as a result of funds added \nby Congress, to revitalize modernization, may be lost due to inadequate \nlevels of funding in this budget. The procurement accounts have been \nreduced by 44 percent since fiscal year 1992. This year's budget \nrequest decreases procurement spending even further.\n  General Shalikashvili recently stated we should provide $60 billion a \nyear for defense modernization by fiscal year 1998. This is 2 years \nearlier than the administration previously indicated in last year's \nbudget, and now will not be achieved until fiscal year 2001. Recent \ntestimony, before the Armed Services Committee by Vice Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Owens, reinforces my concerns. I agree \nwith Admiral Owens that we have a ``crisis in procurement.'' I agree \nwith him also, that procurement continues to be underfunded.\n  While the Department's planning documents reflect increased spending \nfor procurement in the outyears, I am not confident that we will ever \nget there. The administration's budget for this year reflects another \ndecline in procurement spending. It appears that each year, \nmodernization is used as a bill payer to fix other near term problems. \nThis concerns me. I fail to see how this budget provides for adequate \nmodernization. I believe that the Congress will be required to add \nfunds to the defense budget again this year, to provide for minimal \nlevels of modernization.\n  The Armed Services Committee will continue to look for opportunities \nto work with the military services, as we did last year, to add funds \nwhere they will have the most beneficial effects. We intend to invest \nmoney now where these investments will save money in the future.\n\n[[Page S2325]]\n\n  As an example, last year we provided authority for multiyear \nprocurement and an additional $82 million for the Longbow Apache \nHelicopter Program in the fiscal year 1996 Defense bill. As a result, \nwe may save up to $1 billion over the life of this program. We want to \ncontinue to look at other innovative ways to achieve savings, which can \nthen be applied toward other vital defense needs.\n  Finally, I remain concerned about the increasing frequency of \ndeployments and the amount of time our men and women in uniform spend \naway from their homes and families. Ongoing and contingency operations, \nsuch as Haiti and Bosnia, not only drain resources away from current \nand future readiness, but place undue strain on our service members and \ntheir families.\n  Over the course of the next couple of months, the Armed Services \nCommittee will continue to conduct an extensive evaluation of the \nbudget request. Readiness, both current and long term, must be \nmaintained and in some cases, revitalized. Modernization must be \nrestored. Missile defense must become a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2324-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n               enrolled bill and joint resolution signed\n\n  At 4:04 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill and joint resolution:\n\n       S. 1494.

It reforms \nwelfare to make work pay and provides tax relief to middle-income \nAmericans and small business.\n  Three years ago, we inherited an economy that was suffering from \nshort- and long-term problems--problems that were created or \nexacerbated by the economic and budgetary policies of the previous 12 \nyears.\n  In the short term, economic growth was slow and job creation was \nweak. The budget deficit, which had first exploded in size in the early \n1980s, was rising to unsustainable levels.\n  Over the longer term, the growth in productivity had slowed since the \nearly 1970s and, as a result, living standards had stagnated or fallen \nfor most Americans. At the same time, the gap between rich and poor had \nwidened.\n  Over the last three years, we have put in place budgetary and other \neconomic policies that have fundamentally changed the direction of the \neconomy--for the better. We have produced stronger growth, lower \ninterest rates, stable prices, millions of new jobs, record exports, \nlower personal and corporate debt burdens, and higher living standards.\n  Working with the last Congress in 1993, we enacted an economic \nprogram that has worked better than even we projected in spurring \ngrowth and reducing the deficit. We have cut the deficit nearly in \nhalf, from $290 billion in 1992 to $164 billion in 1995. As a share of \nthe Gross Domestic Product, we have cut the deficit by more than half \nin three years, bringing the deficit to its lowest level since 1979.\n  While cutting overall discretionary spending, we also shifted \nresources to investments in our future. With wages increasingly linked \nto skills, we invested wisely in education and training to help \nAmericans acquire the tools they need for the high-wage jobs of \ntomorrow. We also invested heavily in science and technology, which has \nbeen a strong engine of economic growth throughout the Nation's \nhistory.\n  For Americans struggling to raise their children and make ends meet, \nwe have sought to make work pay. We expanded the Earned Income Tax \nCredit, providing tax relief for 15 million working families. And we \nhave given 37 States the freedom to test ways to move people from \nwelfare to work while protecting children.\n  As the economy has become increasingly global, prosperity at home \ndepends heavily on opening foreign markets to American goods and \nservices. With this in mind, we secured legislation to implement the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free \nTrade Agreement, and we have completed over 80 other trade agreements. \nUnder our leadership, U.S. exports have grown to an all-time high.\n  With these policies, we have helped pave the way for a future of \nsustained economic growth, low interest rates, stable prices, and more \nopportunity for Americans of all incomes. But our work is not done.\n  Looking ahead, as I said recently in my State of the Union address, \nwe must answer three fundamental questions: First, how do we make the \nAmerican dream of opportunity for all a reality for all Americans who \nare willing to work for it? Second, how do we preserve our old and \nenduring values as we move into the future? And, third, how do we meet \nthese challenges together, as one America?\n  This budget addresses those questions.\n\n\n                     creating an age of possibility\n\n  I am committed to finishing the job that we began in 1993 and finally \nbringing the budget into balance. In our negotiations with \ncongressional leaders, we have made great progress toward reaching an \nagreement. We have simply come too far to let this opportunity slip \naway.\n  A balanced budget would reduce interest rates for all Americans, \nincluding the young families across the land who are struggling to buy \ntheir first homes. It also would free up funds in the private markets \nwith which businesses could invest in factories and equipment, or in \ntraining their workers.\n  But we have to balance the budget the right way--by cutting \nunnecessary and lower priority spending; investing in the future; \nprotecting senior citizens, working families, children, and other \nvulnerable Americans; and providing tax relief for middle-income \nAmericans and small businesses.\n  My budget does that. It strengthens Medicare and Medicaid, on which \nmillions of senior citizens, people with disabilities, and low-income \nAmericans rely. It reforms welfare. It cuts other entitlements. And it \ncuts deeply into discretionary spending.\n  But while cutting overall discretionary spending, my budget invests \nin education and training, the environment, science and technology, law \nenforcement, and other priorities to help build a brighter future for \nall Americans. We should spend more on what we need, less on what we \ndon't.\n\n\n                     projecting american leadership\n\n  Across the globe, we live in a time of great opportunity and great \nchallenge. With the end of the Cold War, the world looks to the United \nStates for leadership. Providing it is clearly in our best interest. We \nmust not turn away.\n  My budget provides the necessary resources to advance America's \nstrategic interests, carry out our foreign policy, open markets abroad, \nand support U.S. exports. It also provides the resources to confront \nthe emerging global threats that have replaced the Cold War as major \nconcerns--regional, ethnic, and national conflicts; the proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction; international terrorism and crime; \nnarcotics trading; and environmental degradation.\n\n[[Page S2326]]\n\n  On the diplomatic front, our successes have been numerous and \nheartening, and they have made the world a safer and more stable place. \nThrough our leadership, we are helping to bring peace to Bosnia and the \nMiddle East, and we have spurred progress in Northern Ireland. We also \nencouraged the movement toward democracy and free markets in Russia and \nCentral Europe, and we led a successful international effort to defuse \nthe nuclear threat from North Korea.\n  On the military front, we have deployed our forces where we could be \neffective and where it was in our interest to promote stability by \nending bloodshed (such as in Bosnia) and suffering (such as in Rwanda). \nWe also have used the threat of force to ease tensions, such as to \nunseat an unwelcome dictatorship in Haiti and to stare down Iraq when \nit threatened again to move against Kuwait.\n  This budget provides the funds to sustain and modernize the world's \nstrongest, best-trained, best-equipped, and most ready military force. \nThrough it, we continue to support service members and their families \nwith quality-of-life improvements in the short term, while planning to \nacquire the new technologies that will become available at the turn of \nthis decade.\n\n\n          creating opportunity and encouraging responsibility\n\n  The Federal Government cannot--by itself--solve most of the problems \nand address most of the challenges that we face as a people. In some \ncases, it must play a lead role--whether to ensure the guarantee of \nhealth care for vulnerable Americans, expand access to education and \ntraining, invest in science and technology, protect the environment, or \nmake the Tax Code fairer. In other cases, it must play more of a \npartnership role--working with States, localities, non-profit groups, \nchurches and synagogues, families, and individuals to strengthen \ncommunities, make work pay, protect public safety, and improve the \nquality of education.\n  To restore the American community, the budget invests in national \nservice, through which 25,000 Americans this year are helping to solve \nproblems in communities while earning money for postsecondary education \nor to repay student loans. We want to create more Empowerment Zones and \nEnterprise Communities to spur economic development and expand \nopportunities for the residents of distressed urban and rural areas. We \nwant to expand the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund to \nprovide credit and other services to such communities. With the same \ngoal in mind, we want to transform the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment into an agency that better addresses local needs. And we \nwant to maintain our relationship with, and the important services we \nprovide to, Native Americans.\n  In health care, our challenge is to improve the existing and largely \nsuccessful system, not to end the guarantees of coverage on which \nmillions of vulnerable Americans rely. My budget strengthens Medicare \nand Medicaid, ensuring their continued vitality. For Medicare, it \nstrengthens the Part A trust fund, provides more choice for seniors and \npeople with disabilities, and makes the program more efficient and \nresponsive to beneficiary needs. For Medicaid, it gives States more \nflexibility to manage their programs while preserving the guarantee of \nhealth coverage for the most vulnerable Americans, retains current \nnursing home quality standards, and continues to protect the spouses of \nnursing home residents from impoverishment. My budget proposes reforms \nto make private health care more accessible and affordable, and premium \nsubsidies to help those who lose their jobs pay for private coverage \nfor up to six months. It also invests more in various public health \nservices, such as the Ryan White program to serve people living with \nAIDS, and research and regulatory activities that promote public \nhealth.\n  Because America's welfare system is broken, we have worked hard to \nfix those parts of it that we could without congressional action. For \ninstance, we have given 37 States the freedom to test ways to move \npeople from welfare to work while protecting children, and we are \ncollecting record amounts of child support. But now, I need the help of \nCongress. Together, in 1993 we expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit \nfor 15 million working families, rewarding work over welfare. Now, my \nbudget overhauls welfare by setting a time limit on cash benefits and \nimposing tough work requirements, and I want us to enact bipartisan \nlegislation that requires work, demands responsibility, protects \nchildren, and provides adequate resources to get the job done right--\nwith child care and training, giving recipients the tools they need.\n  More and more, education and training have become the keys to higher \nliving standards. While Americans clearly want States and localities to \nplay the lead role in education, the Federal Government has an \nimportant supporting role to play--from funding pre-school services \nthat prepare children to learn, to expanding access to college and \nworker retraining. My budget continues the strong investments that we \nhave made to give Americans the skills they need to get good jobs. \nAlong with my ongoing investments, my budget proposes a Technology \nLiteracy Challenge Fund to bring the benefits of technology into the \nclassroom, a $1,000 merit scholarship for the top five percent of \ngraduates in every high school, and more Charter Schools to let \nparents, teachers, and communities create public schools to meet their \nown children's needs.\n  As Americans, we can take pride in cleaning up the environment over \nthe last 25 years, with leadership from Presidents of both parties. But \nour job is not done--not with so many Americans breathing dirty air or \ndrinking unsafe water. My budget continues our efforts to find \nsolutions to our environmental problems without burdening business or \nimposing unnecessary regulations. We are providing the necessary funds \nfor the Environmental Protection Agency's operating program, for our \nnational parks and forests, for my plan to restore the Florida \nEverglades, and for my ``brownfields'' initiative to clean up \nabandoned, contaminated industrial sites in distressed urban and rural \ncommunities. And we are continuing to reinvent the regulatory process \nby working collaboratively with business, rather than treating it as an \nadversary.\n  With science and technology (S) so vital to our economic future, \nour national security, and the well-being of our people, my budget \ncontinues our investments in this crucial area. To maintain our \ninvestments, I am asking Congress to fulfill my request for basic \nresearch in health sciences at the National Institutes of Health, for \nbasic research and education at the National Science Foundation, for \nresearch at other agencies that depend on S for their missions, and \nfor cooperative projects with universities and industry, such as the \nindustry partnerships created under the Advanced Technology Program.\n  To attack crime, the Federal Government must work with States and \ncommunities on some problems and lead on others. To help communities, \nwe continue to invest in the Community Oriented Policing Services \n(COPS) program, which is putting 100,000 more police on the street. We \nare helping States build more prisons and jail space, better enforce \nthe Brady bill that helps prevent criminals from buying handguns, and \nbetter address the problem of youth gangs. At the Federal level, we are \nleading the fight to stop drugs from entering the country and expand \ndrug treatment efforts, and we are stepping up our efforts to secure \nthe border against illegal immigration while we help to defray State \ncosts for such immigration.\n  For many families, of course, the first challenge often is just to \npay the bills. My budget proposes tax relief for middle-income \nAmericans and small businesses. It provides an income tax credit for \neach dependent child under 13; a deduction for college tuition and \nfees; and expanded individual retirement accounts to help families save \nfor future needs and more easily pay for college, buy a first home, pay \nthe bills during times of unemployment, or pay medical or nursing home \ncosts. For small business, it offers more tax benefits to invest, \nprovides estate tax relief, and makes it easier to set up pensions for \nemployees. It also would expand the tax deduction to make health \ninsurance for the self-employed more affordable.\n\n[[Page S2327]]\n\n                         making government work\n\n  As we pursue these priorities, we will do so with a Government that \nis leaner, but not meaner, one that works efficiently, manages \nresources wisely, focuses on results rather than merely spending money, \nand provides better service to the American people. Through the \nNational Performance Review, led by Vice President Gore, we are making \nreal progress in creating a Government that ``works better and costs \nless.''\n  We have cut the size of the Federal workforce by over 200,000 people, \ncreating the smallest Federal workforce in 30 years, and the smallest \nas a share of the total workforce since before the New Deal. We are \nahead of schedule to cut the workforce by 272,900 positions, as \nrequired by the 1994 Federal Workforce Restructuring Act that I signed \ninto law.\n  Just as important, the Government is working better. Agencies such as \nthe Social Security Administration, the Customs Service, and the \nVeterans Affairs Department are providing much better service to their \ncustomers. Across the Government, agencies are using information \ntechnology to deliver services more efficiently to more people.\n  We are continuing to reduce the burden of Federal regulation, \nensuring that our rules serve a purpose and do not unduly burden \nbusinesses or taxpayers. We are eliminating 16,000 pages of regulations \nacross Government, and agencies are improving their rulemaking \nprocesses.\n  In addition, we continue to overhaul Federal procurement so that the \nGovernment can buy better products at cheaper prices from the private \nsector. No longer does the Government pay outrageous prices for \nhammers, ashtrays, and other small items that it can buy cheaper at \nlocal stores.\n  As we look ahead, we plan to work more closely with States and \nlocalities, with businesses and individuals, and with Federal workers \nto focus our efforts on improving services for the American people. \nUnder the Vice President's leadership, agencies are setting higher and \nhigher standards for delivering faster and better service.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Our agenda is working. We have significantly reduced the deficit, \nstrengthened the economy, invested in our future, and cut the size of \nGovernment while making it work better for the American people.\n  Now, we have an opportunity to build on our success by balancing the \nbudget the right way. It is an opportunity we should not miss.\n  March 1996.\nWilliam J.

A bill to reauthorize the Hate Crime Statistics Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n       THE HATE CRIMES STATISTICS ACT REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I am pleased to join today with \nSenator Hatch, Senator Simon, and others as an original cosponsor of \nlegislation to permanently authorize the Hate Crimes Statistics Act. \nThe Hate Crimes Statistics Act, passed overwhelmingly by Congress in \n1990 and signed into law by President Bush, directs the Department of \nJustice to compile and publish data on crimes that manifest prejudice \nbased on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. The 1994 \nCrime Law added the requirement that data also be collected about \ncrimes based on disability. The categories of crime for which data is \ncollected under the act includes homicide, rape, assault, arson, \nvandalism, and intimidation. The law expired on December 31, 1995, and \nnot only should be reauthorized, but should be given a permanent \nmandate.\n  Before enactment of this law, there existed no such national \ncollection of data on hate crimes. At the time it was originally \npassed, this law was needed to fill the gap in information concerning \nthe deplorable, and increasing, incidence of violent crimes based on \nbigotry and prejudice. Today, 6 years later, this statute remains \nvitally necessary.\n  Madam President, far too often, we hear reports of violent hate-\nrelated incidents which shock all decent people in this country. It \nseems inconceivable that in 1996 such crimes can still be so pervasive, \nbut statistics collected under the law indicate that thousands of hate \ncrimes take place each year. Therefore, it is critically important that \nwe continue to monitor the occurrence of these crimes, in order that we \nmay more effectively respond to them. This law has enabled a systematic \ncollection of information about these crimes on a national basis \nallowing us to develop a clear picture of the problem and fashion \nappropriate governmental responses.\n  Some States, including my home State of Maryland, officially monitor \nthe incidence of hate violence and law enforcement officials in those \nStates have testified to the usefulness of this information. In \naddition, a number of private groups have done an outstanding job \ncollecting information and pointing out the serious problem of bigotry-\nrelated crimes. In particular, I would like to recognize the work of \nthe National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence at the University \nof Maryland, formed in 1984 through the efforts of former Governor of \nMaryland Harry Hughes and others. This fine organization has been a \nclearinghouse for information on hate crimes and has conducted original \nresearch and provided assistance to communities wishing to deal with \nthe problems of hate crime violence.\n  However, these efforts are simply not enough. A national collection \nof information is vital. The 1990 act accomplished the establishment \nand implementation of a Federal data collection system which has proven \nuseful and should continue.\n  Although the Federal Bureau of Investigation is required under the \nlaw to collect information on hate crimes, participation by State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies under the law is strictly voluntary. \nHowever, participation has increased over the time that the law has \nbeen in effect. There has been a significant effort on the local level \nto encourage participation in the effort and as participation \nincreases, the information will become increasingly more helpful for \npurposes of identifying and examining national trends in bias-related \ncrime and effectively responding to such crime.\n  Madam President, experience over the past few years has shown the act \nalso is helpful to State and local law enforcement, both in the effort \nto provide training with respect to hate crimes and in the effort to \nidentify how law enforcement agencies should direct their resources in \ndealing with hate crimes. An essential aspect of the effort to address \nthe problem of hate crimes in this country is ensuring that the police \nhave a greater awareness of hate crimes and treat such incidents with \nmore sensitivity and understanding. The presence of more supportive and \nhelpful law enforcement makes it more likely that hate crime victims \nwill report these crimes, which in turn allows Federal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement to better respond.\n  I want to congratulate Senators Simon and Hatch for their leadership \non this important legislation and I urge my colleagues to support \nprompt enactment of this bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nintroducing this bill that will extend the authority of the Attorney \nGeneral to collect data on crimes motivated by race, religion, or \nethnic hatred. The Act was the first action taken by Congress as a \ndirect response to hate-motivated crimes and has certainly merited its \ncontinued existence.\n  When the original act was passed in 1990, the Attorney General was \ndirected to collect data on any crime that evidenced some type of \nprejudice. It was the first action taken by Congress to address the \nviolence emanating from hate crimes. The reports that have since been \nprepared by the Attorney General, based on the collected data, describe \ntrends and patterns associated with hate crimes. Having this \ninformation is a great asset for Federal officials as well as State and \nlocal governments in formulating responses to the vicious behavior of \nperpetrators of bias crimes.\n  For New York, with its unique mix of people, the collection of hate \ncrime statistics is too important to fall by the wayside. Communities \nin my State have begun to organize in order to respond to the incidents \nof hate crimes in their neighborhood. For example, residents in the \ntown of Oyster Bay on Long Island recently met with their councilman to \ndiscuss the escalating occurrences of hate crimes. The response by \ncitizens of my State is laudable and, I believe, must be supported by \ninformation compiled in these reports. A permanent database will assist \nin composing effective initiatives that will fight hate crimes.\n  State and local law enforcement in New York have struggled against \nthe rising tide of hate crimes. A uniform compilation of statistics can \nbe an asset in determining strategy, even if the participation in the \ncollection of data is voluntary. With a better understanding of the \nimplications and trends of hate crimes, our criminal justice system can \ntarget scarce resources to those mechanisms that work the best to \ncombat bias crimes.\n  Several years ago, the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn saw a \nsenseless violent murder of a young Rabbinical student, a crime that \nwas seemingly motivated by religious hatred. The tension within the \ncommunity mounted, culminating in days of riots and years of healing. \nDetecting patterns in the incidents of hate crimes may have forewarned \nNew York City of the horrendous turmoil that was to follow the brutal \nmurder of that young student, Yankel Rosenbaum.\n  If used in the right manner, statistics are a valuable tool. I hope \nthat my colleagues recognize the need to maintain this database and \nurge the passage of this important legislation.\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, I rise today to join Senator Hatch in the \nintroduction of a bill to reauthorize and provide a permanent mandate \nfor the Hate Crimes Statistics Act. I would also like to thank Chairman \nHatch for his leadership on this important issue, and for scheduling \ntoday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on this bill. This bill's 28 \noriginal cosponsors show the strong bipartisan support for this \nmeasure. It also has the strong support of Attorney General Reno, as \nwell as the endorsement of major law enforcement and advocacy groups.\n  The Hate Crimes Statistics Act, which passed the Senate in 1990 by a \nvote of 92-4 and was signed into law by then President Bush, requires \nthe Justice Department to collect data on crimes that show evidence of \nprejudice based on race, religion, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. \nUntil this act was passed, no Federal records of such crimes were \nmaintained. This lack of information made it difficult to determine \nwhether a particular crime was an isolated incident, or part of a \ncontinuing series against a particular group.\n  The act has proven successful in its initial purpose--the creation of \ndata\n\n[[Page S2329]]\n\ncollection--and has also served as a catalyst for an FBI effort to \ntrain State and local law enforcement officials about hate crimes. \nHearings held before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on \nthe Constitution in 1992 and 1994 showed that one of the prime benefits \nof the act is that it has helped dramatically increase the awareness \nand sensitivity of the police about hate crimes. Not only do victims of \nhate crimes benefit from a more informed police force, but greater \npolice awareness encourages others to report hate crimes.\n  Since all data submission under the act is voluntary, we did not \nanticipate 100 percent participation by State and local law enforcement \nagencies from the start. Nonetheless, over the course of 4 years, there \nhas been great progress in participation levels. In 1991, 2,771 law \nenforcement agencies participated in the voluntary reporting program. \nIn 1994, more than 7,200 agencies participated. Local police, advocacy \ngroups, mayors, and others have joined the effort to encourage every \nlaw enforcement agency to comply, and as more and more local agencies \nparticipate, the statistics will be more and more useful to identify \ntrends and formulate responses. In addition, the FBI is in the process \nof working with States to upgrade their computer systems. When this \ntransition is complete, the data should be even more useful. \nUnfortunately, there are still law enforcement agencies in some States \nand many large cities which are not yet participating in the data \ncollection. We need active oversight of this act to ensure that these \nagencies join in this important effort, making the statistics more \naccurate and useful.\n  FBI Director Louis Freeh has stated that he is committed to the \ncontinued tracking of hate crimes statistics. However, we believe that \nthis effort has proven its usefulness and deserves a permanent mandate. \nCollecting such data will not erase bigotry. It will, however, be a \nvaluable tool in the fight against prejudice. The information is \nessential in identifying how law enforcement should best focus its \nresources in dealing with hate crimes. The data will also be useful to \npolicymakers and local communities in their efforts to fight these \ncrimes.\n  Obviously, the FBI statistics do not yet accurately reflect the level \nof violence motivated by prejudice in our society. More and more \nagencies participate each year, however, we need only read the \nheadlines and reports by advocacy groups to see how widespread the \nproblem of hate crimes remains in our Nation.\n  The Justice Department recently launched a civil rights probe into a \nrash of arson which has destroyed at least 23 black churches in the \nSouth since 1993. The Justice Department is trying to determine whether \nthe crimes are racially motivated, and whether they are connected. \nSeveral of the incidents have been solved, however, and clearly racism \nmotivated the offenders. The teenagers found guilty of burning a church \nin Mississippi in 1993 shouted racial epithets during commission of \ntheir crime. Racist graffiti was spray-painted on the walls of a \nKnoxville, TN, Baptist church set afire on January 8, 1996. Sumter \nCounty Circuit Court Judge Eddie Hardaway, a black judge who sent two \nwhite men to jail for vandalizing black churches, was recently the \nvictim of a shotgun attack which shattered bedroom windows in his home. \nDuring the 1960's civil rights movement, many black churches were set \nablaze, however in the late 1980's and early 1990's only one or two \nsuch crimes were reported each year. This recent string of arson \nreminds us that prejudice and hate crimes remain a problem in our \nNation.\n  Recent reports by private groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League, \nthe National Coalition on Anti-Violence Projects, and the National \nAsian Pacific American Legal Consortium, confirm that unfortunately the \nproblem of crimes based on prejudice continues. The ADL's 1995 Annual \nAudit of Anti-Semitic Incidents actually had some good news: the 1,843 \nanti-Semitic incidents reported to the Anti-Defamation League in 1995 \nrepresented a decrease of 223 incidents, or 11 percent, from the 1994 \ntotal of 2,066. This is the largest decline in 10 years. However, this \ngood news is tempered by the seriousness of many of the incidents \nreported. For the fifth straight year in a row, acts of anti-Semitic \nharassment against individuals outnumber incidents of vandalism against \ninstitutions and other property.\n  The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Projects and New York City \nGay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project report similar findings for 1995. \nThere were fewer incidents of violence against homosexuals in 1995, but \nthe incidents were more violent. There was an 8 percent drop in the \nnumber of incidents, but a 10 percent increase in the number of \nassaults and rapes.\n  We need to realize that the name-calling, the graffiti, the \ndiscrimination, and the threats and violence are all signs of a \npervasive problem. The more informed we are about the scope and nature \nof our communities' problems with hate crimes, the better able we will \nbe to develop effective prevention and prosecution strategies, as well \nas support structures for victims of these crimes.\n  I am pleased to join with Senator Hatch today, with support from 28 \nof our colleagues, the Attorney General and law enforcement and \nadvocacy groups across the Nation, to introduce the reauthorization of \nthe Hate Crimes Statistics Act. I encourage all of my colleagues to \njoin us in working to pass this important legislation.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to \naddress this important issue. If one needs a reminder as to why we must \nmake the Hate Crime Statistics Act mandate permanent, one need look no \nfurther than today's headlines. Throughout the South, Federal and State \nauthorities are investigating a rash of arson against African-American \nchurches reminiscent of the violence perpetrated three decades earlier. \nIn California, a native American was brutally stabbed by skinheads.\n  My home State of Colorado has not been immune from the scourge of \nhate violence. In Morrison, CO, a swastika was burned on a woman's \nlawn. While in Aurora, a man shot his neighbor with a BB gun because of \nhatred for his Asian neighbor.\n  In 1995, the Southern Poverty Law Center's Klanwatch Project counted \n267 active hate groups in the United States including 6 in Colorado. \nAnd, in 1994, because of the passage of the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, \nlaw enforcement agencies in the United States were able to identify \n5,852 hate crimes.\n  Hate crimes are a growing problem--one that cannot merely be measured \nby numbers alone. If we are going to be successful in our battle \nagainst the scourge of violent hate crime, one thing is certain--we \nmust have hard, reliable, information about the nature and the scope of \nthe problem.\n  Mr. President, this bill calls for a permanent mandate for the \ncollection of hate crime data by the Justice Department. This important \npiece of legislation received broad bipartisan support and was signed \ninto law by President Bush in 1990.\n  Data collection is crucial to this effort for other reasons as well. \nAccording to an article in Stanford Law & Policy Review entitled ``Bias \nCrime; A Theoretical and Practical Overview,'' data collection has \nproven to be a gateway for other important initiatives in the battle \nagainst crime. These other responses include enhanced investigative \ntechniques, improved services for victims and the establishment of \ninter-agency coordination.\n  There is another important purpose to this legislation as well. It \nsends a strong, symbolic message that we, as a nation, will not \ntolerate this kind of behavior. Mr. President, I proudly cosponsor this \nlegislation which will make the Hate Crimes Statistics Act a \nsignificant and permanent addition to our framework of anti-crime laws.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 1625. A bill to provide for the fair consideration of professional \nsports franchise relocations, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n        the professional sports franchise relocation act of 1996\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the purpose of my seeking recognition \nis to introduce legislation that would \nprovide for an antitrust exemption \nfor the National Football League on the subject of franchise moves, \nbecause that has become such a major \nproblem in the United States. Note \nthe recent move of the Cleveland \n\n[[Page S2330]]\n\nBrowns to Baltimore, and previous moves of the Cardinals from St. Louis \nto Phoenix, of the Rams from Los Angeles to St. Louis, of the Colts \nfrom Baltimore to Indianapolis, and the tremendous dislocations that \nthese moves have caused not only to sports fans who have a very close \nrelationship with their team --really, America is in love with sports \nand it carries from the high school to the college and professional \nlevel--but to all Americans. We have recently seen the Pirates saved in \nthe city of Pittsburgh because of the ability of professional baseball \nto control franchise moves, which is not possible for professional \nfootball, because baseball has a generalized exemption to the antitrust \nlaws, whereas football does not.\n  This is a matter which has enormous financial implications for the \ncities involved. There are thousands of jobs involved in hotels, \nrestaurants, commercial opportunities, and more than even the financial \nmatters and the status as a big-league city. As a Senator from \nPennsylvania, with major sports teams in my State, it is a matter of \nvery, very significant importance. It first came to my attention \npersonally in my early years in the Senate, back in 1982, when Dan \nRooney, the owner of the Steelers, approached me with then-Commissioner \nPete Rozelle seeking hearings in the Judiciary Committee on the then-\npending move of the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles. Senator \nThurmond, then chairman of the Judiciary Committee, scheduled those \nhearings. They were very important hearings, which, regrettably, did \nnot stop the move of the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles. Then we \nhave seen the Raiders move back from Los Angeles to Oakland, and it led \nme to introduce a series of bills, as others have, on this very \nimportant subject. These are delineated in a fuller statement, which I \nwill have made a part of the Record at the conclusion of this brief \npresentation.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that legislation is necessary in this area \nto provide stability for professional football. It is my hope, as we \nmove through this legislative process, that we will receive from \nfootball, as well as from baseball, for the preservation of their \nantitrust exemption, some consideration that will result in the \navoidance of some cities putting up vast sums of money, like Baltimore \nis putting up some $200 million to bring the Browns to Baltimore from \nCleveland, according to press reports. This antitrust exemption \napplies, as well, to basketball and hockey. Again, it is very important \nto have stability in those leagues so they can avoid dislocations and \nhaving franchises moved because of the threat of judicial holdings that \nthe antitrust laws are violated when the league attempts to block a \nteam from relocating.\n  My legislation does contain a provision that where a team moves and \nit leaves the city at a loss because of infrastructure changes the city \nhas made, or contractual obligations, the moving team has to reimburse \nthe city for its share of that public debt. This is an idea brought to \nme by the distinguished mayor of Pittsburgh, Mayor Tom Murphy. It is \nbased on a resolution adopted by the Conference of Mayors. My bill also \nhas a provision that requires that when a team moves from a city, if \nthe league expands, that city will have the first opportunity--in \neffect, the right of first refusal--to be considered for an expansion \nteam. The bill does not impose an obligation on the league, because \nthere are many complicating factors that the league has to consider in \ndeciding where a team should be located.\n  But we have seen tremendous instability in professional sports with \nthese franchise moves. My own concern arose a long time ago when the \nDodgers moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. I thought Los Angeles ought \nto have a team, but not the Dodgers. They ought to have had an \nexpansion team. At the same time there was the move of the Giants to \nSan Francisco from New York.\n  This legislation builds upon previous bills of mine, which I have \nspecified in my longer statement. It is a part of the process, and I \nbelieve we need to have a dialog with the commissioners on the whole \nvariety of issues confronting sports, as I have with Commissioner \nTagliabue, talking about, for example, the need for multipurpose \nstadiums--with objections now to using the Vet in Philadelphia or Three \nRivers in Pittsburgh for multiple sports--using, for example a kidney-\nshaped design to accommodate both football and baseball. We must try to \nsee to it that we have stability and we do not impose enormous burdens \non the taxpayers for new stadiums, but that we retain the big-league-\ncity status of current markets that support their teams and expand the \nleagues, where appropriate, and find some way to stabilize professional \nsports with revenue sharing and salary caps to protect small-market \nteams. These issues raise complex matters which are yet to be worked \nout, but this bill is a start to addressing some of the issues facing \nprofessional football, basketball, and hockey.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1625\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Professional Sports \n     Franchise Relocation Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) professional sports teams foster a strong local \n     identity with the people of the cities and regions in which \n     they are located, providing a source of civic pride for their \n     supporters;\n       (2) professional sports teams provide employment \n     opportunities, revenues, and a valuable form of entertainment \n     for the cities and regions in which they are located;\n       (3) in many communities, there are significant public \n     investments associated with professional sports facilities;\n       (4) it is in the public interest to encourage professional \n     sports leagues to operate under policies that promote \n     stability among their member teams and to promote the \n     equitable resolution of disputes arising from the proposed \n     relocation of professional sports teams; and\n       (5) professional sports teams travel in interstate commerce \n     to compete, and utilize materials shipped in interstate \n     commerce, and professional sports games are broadcast \n     nationally.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, last Thursday I offered an amendment \nto the omnibus appropriations bill to restore funding for three Federal \nliteracy programs. The Senate will vote on this amendment tomorrow.\n  Adult education and literacy programs are essential to reducing \nwelfare dependency, crime, and unemployment. Yet all Federal, State, \nand local public and private nonprofit literacy programs combined serve \nonly 10 percent of those in need.\n  Last year, I had the pleasure of meeting with a group of new readers \nwho had recently completed basic literacy programs. These individuals \nshared with me the difficulties they had faced and how learning how to \nread and write had changed their lives for the better. I was so struck \nby their stories that I contacted their Senators encouraging them to \nmeet with their States' new readers. I do not know how many of my \ncolleagues took me up on this offer, but I trust that those who did \nfound this experience as informative and as inspiring as I did.\n  I also asked one of the women who visited me, Elaine Randall, to \nwrite out her story, as I thought it was particularly moving. She was \nkind enough to send it along to me. I ask that her account be printed \nin the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Simon:\n       Thank you for meeting with me and the other adult learners \n     who were in Washington for the National Institute of Literacy \n     (NIFL) work group meeting on July 23-24. These 20 adult \n     learners from around the country met with NIFL staff to open \n     a dialogue on the students' views of literacy policy and \n     practices, and to explore ways to take a more active role in \n     shaping them.\n       We were chosen as participants in this NIFL student work \n     group for our local, state, and national literacy \n     involvement. Besides receiving adult basic education or \n     English as a Second Language instruction, we are student \n     leaders ``giving back''--working towards solutions. We are \n     not the only ones out there doing this. We are only a handful \n     of adult learners who start and lead student support groups; \n     speak to encourage others to join a literacy program; \n     encourage businesses to fund literacy organizations; and \n     advise our programs on ways to improve recruitment, \n     retention, and learning gains. These are only a few examples \n     of the kinds of contributions students all over the country \n     are making to ``give back'' as much as they ``get'' from the \n     literacy field.\n       Each of us has worked long and hard to become contributors \n     in the literacy field. We have been improving our basic \n     reading and writing skills and developing our leadership \n     abilities. This is where we are now, but it's not where we \n     started. As non- or low-level readers, each of us has had \n     different experiences throughout our lives. However, those \n     experiences and the feelings and the emotions they caused \n     were very similar.\n       Being able to read is expected daily in American life. \n     Before an adult literacy program started in my area, it \n     seemed like there was no chance for me to learn how to read. \n     My choices in life were severely limited--I constantly \n     guarded against being put into situations where I would have \n     to read and write. I discovered how society mistreats those \n     who cannot read.\n       While other children were learning to read and write in \n     school, I learned early on what it meant to be illiterate in \n     our society, and why it was important to cover it up and how \n     to do it. By second grade all my classmates knew I was \n     behind, which made me a target of their taunting. Kids who \n     were friends in my neighborhood did not care to talk with me \n     in class for fear of being called stupid--``If you talk with \n     a dummy, you must be a dummy too.'' My best friend was older \n     than me and didn't know I was having trouble with reading. \n     When my third grade teacher began keeping me after school \n     every day, to give me more time to do classwork, my best \n     friend didn't understand why I had to stay instead of walking \n     home with her. I couldn't tell her, because I had learned the \n     year before what happens when people find out you can't read.\n       I always wanted to learn and know what other people knew, \n     but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't catch up. School \n     seemed like a prison where I was being punished for not being \n     smart enough. I wanted to drop out when I became old enough.\n       By the time I was in high school, I had become a master in \n     ``school survival.'' School survival was going to school \n     everyday, knowing no matter how hard I tried, I was still \n     going to fail. So, I learned to balance between trying hard \n     enough to please my teachers without excessively tormenting \n     myself in the process. Another part of my school survival was \n     to figure out what I would need to graduate: how many \n     credits, which courses were the easiest, and the minimum \n     number of academic classes I would have to take.\n       I realized I'd need a high school diploma in order to help \n     cover up my illiteracy in the future--especially when it came \n     to finding a job. I knew an employer would be less likely to \n     suspect I couldn't read very well if I had a high school \n     diploma. The day I graduated, I tried to read my diploma, but \n     I could only read a few words. Nonetheless, I felt I had \n     earned it through hard work and a lot of tears.\n       It was not easy to find a job that didn't require reading. \n     My employment options were limited since I did not have a \n     trade. I had tried taking some trade classes in high\n\n[[Page S2335]]\n\n     school. I could understand the theory of what the teachers \n     were saying, but didn't learn what I needed to know--that was \n     in a book. I've always been a hard worker and knew if I could \n     get my foot in the door somewhere, I would do a good job. \n     After identifying a job in manufacturing, I still had to fill \n     out the job application as well as read and sign forms. To \n     this day, I don't know what I signed. I could only hope I \n     would not do something that violated what was in those forms.\n       I went as far as I could in jobs with the minimum amount of \n     reading or writing involved. My supervisors considered me a \n     valuable employee and never suspected I had trouble reading. \n     I felt I had the potential to do more. When a literacy \n     program for adults started at my local library, I finally had \n     an opportunity to get the help I needed so I could do more.\n       It wasn't until a few years ago that I discovered the \n     reason why I had so much trouble learning to read and write. \n     I have a language-based learning difference--clinically \n     diagnosed dyslexia and attention deficit disorder. At least \n     now I know what I'm dealing with. It was not my fault--I was \n     smart enough. What I needed was a teaching and learning \n     method that worked for me.\n       There is a difference between learning to read and reading \n     to learn. I first needed to learn how to read and that has \n     taken time. I've been working on my education for almost nine \n     years and I am still taking classes two nights a week. During \n     the same time, I have had to work to support myself. Like \n     most adults, I do not have the luxury of going back to school \n     full-time because I must fulfill other obligations and \n     responsibilities.\n       There is no ``quick fix'' solution--two years and you're \n     finished. It is a long process. It is one we all must agree \n     to commit to. There are many more adults like me who, with \n     the right help, can get better jobs and lead more productive \n     lives. They, too, can begin to ``give back'' to the system.\n       Thank you for your commitment to help improve the adult \n     literacy system. Around the country, there are many adult \n     learners equally committed to improving the system in \n     addition to their own education. It's great to know we have \n     people like you working with us to make it possible for \n     adults who cannot read, write, or speak English to get the \n     help they need.\n       Sincerely,\n     Elaine W.

Mr. President, Congressman Frank Wolf is a \nRepublican and I am a Democrat, but we have joined with Senator Lugar \nand others in proposing a commission to look at where this Nation is \ngoing and the question of legalized gambling.\n  The most casual observer must recognize that we are headed for some \nproblems.\n  I was pleased to see the editorial in the Washington Post, ``The \nGambling Lobby v. Frank Wolf,'' which I ask to be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The reality is that one of the reasons the gambling lobby is so \neffective is the huge amounts of campaign contributions that are \nprovided.\n  And, as we know from indictments and convictions across the land, the \ngambling gentry do not hesitate, from time to time, to get into illegal \nactivity to promote their enterprises.\n  I am proud of my colleague, Frank Wolf, for what he is doing, as I am \nproud of Senator Richard Lugar and the other cosponsors in the Senate.\n  The Post editorial follows:\n\n                    The Gambling Lobby v. Frank Wolf\n\n       A funny thing is happening with the gambling issue in the \n     House. Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) has been pressing for a useful \n     bill to create a national commission to study the economic \n     and social impact of the spread of gambling, and the bill was \n     making good progress. Mr. Wolf's bill has already cleared the \n     Judiciary Committee and is supposed to go to the floor of the \n     House in early March.\n       But in the interim, the bill has gone to the House \n     Resources Committee, which claims jurisdiction because the \n     measure affects gambling on Indian reservations. House \n     Resources now plans another set of hearings on the bill, and \n     Mr. Wolf is understandably worried that the hearings might be \n     used to further delay consideration. Given the wide support \n     the bill has--it's hard to argue against a national study of \n     gambling's spread or to pretend there are no national \n     implications to this trend--the danger is that the bill will \n     be killed not directly but by endless delay and amendment.\n       The American Gaming Association (the gambling industry \n     likes the 17th century drawing room sound of ``gaming'') \n     insists that it is not opposed to a national study of \n     gambling. But it sees the Wolf bill, as written, as just the \n     first step in an effort by Congress to impose some federal \n     rules on an industry that has so far been largely regulated \n     by the states. It also complains that the commission as set \n     up in the Wolf bill now has no representation from state \n     officials (governors or legislators), even though one of the \n     main purposes of the committee is to provide more objective \n     information to local officials than they usually get from the \n     gambling industry.\n       These objections strike us mostly as clever ways for the \n     industry to gum up the progress of useful legislation. In \n     particular, it would be foolish to limit the commission's \n     mandate. With the spread of gambling--especially to Indian \n     reservations, whose casinos have ways around state \n     regulation--there may well be a case for some national rules. \n     If any event, it's certainly an issue the commission should \n     debate.\n       The gambling industry has a great deal of money, has been \n     making large campaign contributions and recently hired some \n     of Washington's most influential lobbyists. We have no doubt \n     that the industry can bring a lot of pressure against Mr. \n     Wolf's bill and construct some ingenious stratagems to weaken \n     it. The issue is whether the House leadership will play \n     along, mouthing kind words about Mr. Wolf's efforts while \n     trying to undermine them. The leaders should not play that \n     game. They should keep the promise and let an undiluted \n     version of the Wolf bill go to the floor on schedule.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2335-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2335-S2336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MAIL BALLOT VOTING\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I suppose there is no columnist \nwhose writings I read, and with whom I agree more consistently, than \nCarl Rowan.\n  And his recent column about the mail voting experiment in Oregon is \nno exception.\n  Every move forward to enlarging the voter franchise has been \nresisted. That includes giving voting rights to African-Americans, \nnative Americans and to American women.\n  And the secret ballot which we prize so much today was not part of \nour early history.\n  We have gradually made improvements, despite the objections of many \npeople who were wedded to the status-quo.\n  I do not suggest that on the basis of the Oregon experiment, we \nshould nationally move to mail voting yet, but I would like to see \nseveral States try it, because my instinct is that it is likely to be \nan improvement over the present system.\n  I ask that the Carl Rowan column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n            A Knock at Mail Ballots Is a Knock at Democracy\n\n                            (By Carl Rowan)\n\n       The political mentalities of the 1770s and 1950s are \n     bursting out all over now that Oregon has had a successful \n     mail ballot to fill the seat of disgraced Sen. Bob Packwood.\n       I hear cries that the mail ballot cheapened the election, \n     robbing the vote of the sacred majesty that the framers of \n     our government intended.\n       I hear complaints that the mail ballot permitted uneducated \n     people ``who don't even know the names of their congressmen'' \n     to vote.\n       We're told that it allowed all people to vote without \n     expending the small amount of energy and sacrifice of going \n     to a neighborhood polling place, undermining the notion that \n     ``the vote is a precious thing.''\n       This is swallowed by some as the sentimentality of \n     patriotism, but it is, in fact, undemocratic gibberish that \n     ought not override the fact that the Oregon election lifted \n     the percentage of voters to about 65 percent of those \n     eligible, a figure that made democratic participation almost \n     as high as in European countries. It saved Oregon about $1 \n     million. And it produced results that any Republican could \n     applaud.\n       So we are to deplore this election as a violation of what \n     ``the framers'' intended? I remember that the framers counted \n     black citizens as three-fifths of a vote. And women as zero \n     percent of a vote. Naturally, neither I nor my wife is much \n     impressed by a reminder of what the framers believed about \n     the semi-slave status of African-American males, or women.\n       The framers created a situation under which many states \n     could decree that only the propertied could vote. When that \n     idea and ``poll tax'' requirements were beaten down, polling \n     places were located where millions of poor, ill minority \n     citizens could not get to because they lacked transportation \n     or couldn't leave their jobs.\n       Nothing in a neighborhood polling place could be more \n     sacred to deprived citizens than casting their first ballot--\n     primarily because the mail ballot allowed them to do so.\n       So spare me this balderdash about how this country must \n     return to a respect for what ``the framers'' intended!\n       I find especially offensive the complaints that mail \n     ballots were cast by ``uninformed, uneducated'' citizens. In \n     the 1950s some states had laws requiring ``literacy tests'' \n     for those seeking to vote. That was implemented in ways where \n     white registrars could deny the ballot to blacks who couldn't \n     answer ``correctly'' such questions as ``How many bubbles in \n     a bar of soap?''\n       Everyone I've heard deploring the mail ballot would be \n     incensed if anyone accused\n\n[[Page S2336]]\n\n     them of harboring the racist and sexist views of the framers. \n     Yet they peddle those views almost mindlessly.\n       We either treasure democracy or we don't. If we do, the \n     more of it the better. So I say of the Motor Voter law and \n     mail ballot: ``Welcome and hooray!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2335-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SENATOR COHEN: WHY I AM LEAVING\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I received a note in the mail from \nMarion Plancon of Staten Island, NY, and she enclosed an op-ed piece \nwritten by our colleague, Senator William Cohen, for the Los Angeles \nTimes.\n  Somehow I missed seeing the original publication of it.\n  But I have found through the years on the Senate floor and with my \nservice with him in the House, that our colleague, Bill Cohen usually \nmakes sense.\n  And his call for greater civility, less hostility, more reason, and \nless shouting is a call that should be heeded in this body, and also by \nthe American public.\n  I wish that the extremes of partisanship and hostility were only in \nthe House and Senate or only between the administration and Congress.\n  Unfortunately, we do reflect the American public sometimes more than \nwe should.\n  We should be a reconciling force, and I fear that we are not.\n  I ask that the William Cohen op-ed piece be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                      [From the Los Angeles Times]\n\n                            Why I Am Leaving\n\n                         (By William S. Cohen)\n\n       Last week, I announced that I would not seek reelection to \n     the Senate for a fourth term. I have been moved by the \n     reaction of my constituents and colleagues. Many expressed \n     sadness over my decision, and nearly all were perplexed. Why \n     are so many leaving the Senate? How can the center hold? \n     Won't the system fall apart?\n       It is not a case, to continue with Yeats's words, ``that \n     the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of \n     passionate intensity.''\n       Such a poetic construct presumes too much and maligns the \n     character and capabilities of those who have most recently \n     arrived in Congress and those who have chosen to remain.\n       Those of us leaving the Senate do so for unique and deeply \n     personal reasons. I suspect, however, that we share a common \n     level of frustration over the absence of political accord and \n     the increase in personal hostilities that now permeate our \n     system and our society.\n       Increasingly, public officials face: Too little time to \n     reason and reflect; the hair-trigger presumption of guilt \n     pulled at the slightest whisper of impropriety; the \n     schizophrenia of a public that wants less government \n     spending, more government services and lower taxes, and the \n     unyielding demands of proliferating single-issue \n     constituencies.\n       Too many hours are devoted to endless motion without \n     movement, interminable debate without decision and rhetorical \n     finger-pointing without practical problem-solving.\n       Our republic, we know, was designed to be slow-moving and \n     deliberative. Our Founding Fathers were convinced that power \n     had to be entrusted to someone, but that no one could be \n     entirely trusted with power. They devised a brilliant system \n     of checks and balances to prevent the tyranny of the many by \n     the few. They constructed a perfect triangle of allocated and \n     checked power, Euclidean in symmetry and balance. There could \n     be no rash action, no rush to judgment, no legislative mob \n     rule, no unrestrained chief executive.\n       The difficulty with this diffusion of power in today's \n     cyberspace age is that everyone is in check, but no one is in \n     charge.\n       But more than the constitutional separation of powers is \n     leading to the unprecedented stalemate that exists today. \n     There has been a breakdown in civil debate and discourse. \n     Enmity at times has become so intense that members of \n     Congress have resorted to shoving matches outside the \n     legislative chambers. The Russian Duma, it seems, is \n     slouching its way toward the Potomac as debate gives way to \n     diatribe.\n       We are witnessing a gravitational pull away from center-\n     based politics to the extremes on both the right and left. \n     Those who seek compromise and consensus are depicted with \n     scorn as a ``mushy middle'' that is weak and unprincipled. By \n     contrast, those who plant their feet in the concrete of \n     ideological absolutism are heralded as heroic defenders of \n     truth, justice and the American way.\n       The departure of centrists from party ranks may be cheered \n     by ideologues in the short term. But unless the American \n     people are willing to embrace one party dominance and \n     governance for extended periods (or turn to the British \n     parliamentary model, which I don't recommend), then elements \n     within the liberal and conservative factions will necessarily \n     move back to the center, toward compromise and, yes, \n     consensus.\n       The American people are experiencing a great deal of anger \n     and anxiety at this time. The stern virtues of self-\n     discipline and fiscal prudence have given way to the soft \n     vices of mindless consumption and selfish gratification. We \n     are now paying for the wages of our sins, and ironically, our \n     citizens are angry with political leaders who have indulged \n     their appetites, purchased their votes and passed the bills \n     to the next generation. The road to fiscal solvency and \n     sanity will not be easy, and it surely will not be paved with \n     the bloated promises of blandishments of political \n     extremists.\n       I have devoted nearly a quarter of a century to public \n     service and a search for common ground in a society that is \n     growing in complexity and diversity. Although I have decided \n     to enter the private world to pursue new challenges and \n     opportunities, I remain convinced that the American political \n     system will pass through this transitional phase in our \n     history and return to the center, the place where most people \n     live and a democracy functions best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2336-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2336-S2337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JAMES THOMAS VALVANO\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, March 10, 1996, marked what would \nhave been James Thomas Valvano's 50th birthday. It has been almost 3 \nyears since the Queens, NY, native lost a rather public battle with \ncancer. The intent here, however, is not to eulogize. And any attempt \nto do so would pale in comparison to the impassioned eloquence of that \noffered on this floor by my distinguished friend and colleague from \nNorth Carolina, Mr. Helms on April 28, 1993. I did not know Jim \nValvano--barely knew of him. But I am aware of the good work done by \nthe foundation he founded in the final weeks of his life.\n  On March 4, 1993, Jim Valvano was awarded the inaugural ESPN Arthur \nAshe Award for Courage at the American Sports Awards. In an acceptance \nspeech that was widely noted and shall long be remembered, he announced \nthe creation of the V Foundation for Cancer Research. With a \nChurchillian stoutness of spirit, Valvano set forth the mission:\n\n       It may not save my life. It may save my children's lives. \n     It may save someone you love. . . . [I]t's motto is, ``Don't \n     give up, don't ever give up.'' That's what I'm going to do \n     every minute that I have left . . . so that someone else \n     might survive, might prosper and might actually be cured of \n     this dreaded disease. . . . I'm going to work as hard as I \n     can for cancer research and hopefully, maybe, we'll have some \n     cures and some breakthroughs.\n\n  Since that night the V Foundation has raised more than $2.3 million \nfor that mission. Here are just some of the organizations and programs \nto which the V Foundation has contributed: $250,000 to fund a national \npublic awareness campaign through the NCCR [National Coalition of \nCancer Researchers]; $100,000 to fund Dr. Gerold Bepler at Duke \nComprehensive Cancer Center; $100,000 to fund a 2-year grant for Dr. \nPhil Hochhauser at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York; \n$100,000 to the UNC Lineberger Cancer Center for construction of the \nJim Valvano Cancer Research Lab; $100,000 to fund Dr. Leland Powell at \nthe University of California at San Diego; $100,000 to fund the \nresearch of Dr. Thomas Gajewski at the University of Chicago \nComprehensive Cancer Center; $29,000 to the Kosair Children's Hospital \nin Louisville, KY, for the construction of the Angela Valvano \nClassroom.\n  Any basketball coach who carried a collection of Emily Dickinson \npoems in his gym bag and quoted Edna St. Vincent Millay and Ralph Waldo \nEmerson to sports reporters most certainly knew the impermanence of \nathletic achievements. Records are broken, victory banners fade, \nchampionship rings tarnish. But when all of these are long forgot, \nJames Thomas Valvano will be remembered to the beneficiaries of the \nfoundation that bears his name. And through them, to us all.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that the entire text of Jim Valvano's remarks at \nthe 1993 ESPN Awards be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n       Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. That's the \n     lowest I've ever seen Dick Vitale since the owner of the \n     Detroit Pistons called him in and told him he should go into \n     broadcasting.\n       I can't tell you what an honor it is, to even be mentioned \n     in the same breath with Arthur Ashe. This is something I \n     certainly will treasure forever. But, as it said on the tape, \n     and I also don't have one of those things going with the cue \n     cards, so I'm going to speak longer than anybody else has \n     spoken tonight. That's the way it goes. Time is very precious \n     to me. I don't know how much I\n\n[[Page S2337]]\n\n     have left and I have some things that I would like to say. \n     Hopefully, at the end, I will have something that will be \n     important to other people, too.\n       But, I can't help it. Now I'm fighting cancer, everybody \n     knows that. People ask me all the time about how you go \n     through your life and how's your day, and nothing is changed \n     for me. As Dick said, I'm a very emotional and passionate \n     man. I can't help it. That's being the son of Rocco and \n     Angelina Valvano. It comes with the territory. We hug, we \n     kiss, we love.\n       When people say to me how do you get through life or each \n     day, it's the same thing. To me, there are three things we \n     all should do every day. We should do this every day of our \n     lives. Number one is laugh. You should laugh every day. \n     Number two is think. You should spend some time in thought. \n     Number three is, you should have your emotions moved to \n     tears, could be happiness or joy. But think about it. If you \n     laugh, you think and you cry, that's a full day. That's a \n     heck of a day. You do that seven days a week, you're going to \n     have something special.\n       I rode on the plane up today with Mike Krzyzewski, my good \n     friend and a wonderful coach. People don't realize he's 10 \n     times a better person than he is a coach, and we know he's a \n     great coach. He's meant a lot to me in these last 5 or 6 \n     months with my battle. But when I look at Mike, I think, we \n     compete against each other as players. I coached against him \n     for 15 years, and I always have to think about what's \n     important in life to me are these three things. Where you \n     started, where you are and where you're going to be. Those \n     are the three things that I try to do every day. When I think \n     about getting up and giving a speech, I can't help it. I have \n     to remember the first speech I ever gave.\n       I was coaching at Rutgers University, that was my first \n     job, oh, that's wonderful [reaction to applause], and I was \n     the freshmen coach. That's when freshmen played on freshmen \n     teams, and I was so fired up about my first job. I see Lou \n     Holtz here. Coach Holtz, who doesn't like the very first job \n     you had? The very first time you stood in the lockerroom to \n     give a pep talk. That's a special place, the lockerroom, for \n     a coach to give a talk.\n       So my idol as a coach was Vince Lombardi, and I read this \n     book called ``Commitment to Excellence'' by Vince Lombardi. \n     And in the book, Lombardi talked about the first time he \n     spoke before his Green Bay Packers team in the lockerroom, \n     and they were perennial losers. I'm reading this and Lombardi \n     said he was thinking should it be a long talk, a short talk? \n     But he wanted to be emotional, so it would be brief. So \n     here's what I did. Normally you get in the lockerroom, I \n     don't know, 25 minutes, a half hour before the team takes the \n     field, you do your little X and O's, and then you give the \n     great Knute Rockne talk.\n       We all do. Speech No. 84. You pull them right out, you get \n     ready. You get your squad ready. Well, this is the first one \n     I ever gave and I read this thing, Lombardi, what he said \n     was he didn't go in, he waited. His team was wondering \n     where is he? Where is this great coach? He's not there. \n     Ten minutes he's still not there. Three minutes before \n     they could take the field Lombardi comes in, bangs the \n     door open, and I think you all remember what great \n     presence he had, great presence. He walked in and he \n     walked back and forth, like this, just walked, staring at \n     the players. He said, ``All eyes on me.''\n       I'm reading this in this book. I'm getting this picture of \n     Lombardi before his first game and he said, ``Gentlemen, we \n     will be successful this year, if you can focus on three \n     things, and three things only. Your family, your religion and \n     the Green Bay Packers.'' They knocked the walls down and the \n     rest was history. I said, that's beautiful. I'm going to do \n     that. Your family, your religion and Rutgers basketball. \n     That's it. I had it. Listen, I'm 21 years old. The kids I'm \n     coaching are 19, and I'm going to be the greatest coach in \n     the world, the next Lombardi.\n       I'm practicing outside of the lockerroom and the managers \n     tell me you got to go in. Not yet, not yet, family, religion, \n     Rutgers basketball. All eyes on me. I got it, I got it. Then \n     finally he said, 3 minutes, I said fine. True story. I go to \n     knock the doors open just like Lombardi. Boom! They don't \n     open. I almost broke my arm. Now I was down, the players were \n     looking. Help the coach out, help me out. Now I did like \n     Lombardi, I walked back and forth, and I was going like that \n     with my arm getting the feeling back in. Finally I said, \n     ``Gentlemen, all eyes on me.'' These kids wanted to play, \n     they're 19. ``Let's go,'' I said. ``Gentlemen, we'll be \n     successful this year if you can focus on three things, and \n     three things only. Your family, your religion and the Green \n     Bay Packers. I told them. I did that. I remember that. I \n     remember where I came from.\n       It's so important to know where you are. I know where I am \n     right now. How do you go from where you are to where you want \n     to be? I think you have to have an enthusiasm for life. You \n     have to have a dream, a goal. You have to be willing to work \n     for it.\n       I talked about my family, my family's so important. People \n     think I have courage. The courage in my family are my wife \n     Pam, my three daughters, here, Nicole, Jamie, LeeAnn, my mom, \n     who's right here, too. That screen is flashing up there ``30 \n     seconds'' like I care about that screen right now, huh? I got \n     tumors all over my body. I'm worried about some guy in the \n     back going 30 seconds? You got a lot, hey va fa napoli, \n     buddy. You got a lot.\n       I just got one last thing, I urge all of you, all of you, \n     to enjoy your life, the precious moments you have. To spend \n     each day with some laughter and some thought, to get your \n     emotions going. To be enthusiastic every day and Ralph Waldo \n     Emerson said, ``Nothing great could be accomplished without \n     enthusiasm,'' to keep your dreams alive in spite of problems \n     whatever you have. The ability to be able to work hard for \n     your dreams to come true, to become a reality.\n       Now I look at where I am now and I know what I want to do. \n     What I would like to be able to do is spend whatever time I \n     have left and to give, and maybe, some, some hope to others. \n     Arthur Ashe Foundation is a wonderful thing, and AIDS, the \n     amount of money pouring in for AIDS is not enough, but is \n     significant. But if I told you it's 10 times the amount that \n     goes in for cancer research. I also told you that 500,000 \n     people will die this year of cancer. I also tell you that one \n     in every four will be afflicted with this disease, and yet \n     somehow, we seem to have put it in a little bit of the \n     background. I want to bring it back on the front table.\n       We need your help. I need your help. We need money for \n     research. It may not save my life. I may save my children's \n     lives. It may save someone you love, and ESPN has been so \n     kind to support me in this endeavor and allow me to announce \n     tonight, that with ESPN's support, which means what? Their \n     money and their dollars and their helping me, we are starting \n     the Jimmy V Foundation for cancer research. And its motto is, \n     ``Don't give up, don't ever give up.'' That's what I'm going \n     to do every minute that I have left.\n       I will thank God for the day and the moment I have. If you \n     see me, smile and give me a hug. That's important to me, too. \n     But try if you can to support, whether it's AIDS or the \n     cancer foundation, so that someone else might survive, might \n     prosper and might actually be cured of this dreaded disease.\n       I can't thank ESPN enough for allowing this to happen. I'm \n     going to work as hard as I can for cancer research and \n     hopefully, maybe, we'll have some cures and some \n     breakthroughs. I'd like to think, I'm going to fight my \n     brains out to be back here again next year for the Arthur \n     Ashe recipient. I want to give it next year!\n       I know I gotta go, I gotta go, and I got one last thing and \n     I've said it before and I want to say it again. Cancer can \n     take away all my physical abilities. It cannot touch my mind, \n     it cannot touch my heart and it cannot touch my soul. And \n     those three things are going to carry on forever.\n       I thank you and God bless you all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2336-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2337-S2338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EVERY MAN A PETER LYNCH\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the more informative journals \nthat I read is one called Grant's Interest Rate Observer. It contains \ninformation that I find in no other journal.\n  James Grant, the publisher and editor, also makes observations about \na variety of things, and recently he had comments on the suggestion \nthat part of the Social Security fund be invested in the stock market.\n  Before people start chasing this rainbow, it would be good to read \nhis thoughtful observations which I ask to be printed in full in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows.\n\n          [From Grant's Interest Rate Observer, Mar. 1, 1996]\n\n                        Every Man a Peter Lynch\n\n       In the Nixon years, it was said triumphantly that only a \n     Republican could have opened China. Perhaps the Clinton \n     administration believes that only a Democrat can open Wall \n     Street. On February 17, The New York Times disclosed that a \n     federal advsisory panel will recommend an epochal change in \n     Social Security policy; investing billions of dollars of \n     payroll taxes in the stock market.\n       For now, of course, the Social Security Trust Fund holds \n     only Treasury securities, $483 billion's worth at last \n     report. In fiscal 1994, $381 billion, in round numbers, was \n     paid into Social Security (via payroll taxes, from employers \n     and employees combined), and $323 billion was paid out. The \n     Treasury issued special, non-negotiable, interest-bearing \n     claims to the Social Security Trust Fund to acknowledge \n     receipt of the difference. The difference, $58 billion, was \n     ``invested'' only in the sense that it wasn't actually \n     stolen. It was spent. (A Mexican official once told the \n     British journalist James Morgan, apropos of government \n     ``investment'': ``Senor, the money that was stolen was \n     invested better than the money that was invested.'')\n       In 1974, the Social Security System was consolidated for \n     accounting purposes into the unified federal budget. In \n     effect, a Social Security surplus (such as the nation \n     currently, and temporarily, enjoys) works to reduce the \n     reported federal deficit; a shortfall tends to expand it. It \n     follows that any redeployment of Social Security assets into \n     the stock market would force an identical increase in federal \n     borrowing. So also, a diversion of an individual's payroll \n     taxes into an earmarked equity investment account would force \n     a corresponding rise in federal borrowing--other things being \n     the same.\n       However, it is always possible that other things would not \n     be the same. Things could\n\n[[Page S2338]]\n\n     improve. A revitalized private sector might generate more tax \n     revenue than even the government could spend, or investment \n     returns might beggar even those of the past five years, \n     causing the much feared $11 trillion unfunded Social Security \n     liability (the difference between the present value of \n     promised benefits and the present value of projected taxes) \n     to melt away like the much feared banking calamity of 1990-\n     91. How often have free markets made short work of allegedly \n     intractable political or economic problems? Often enough, in \n     our experience.\n       Yet, to us, the heart of the Social Security trial balloon \n     was contained in the Times story's perceptive third \n     paragraph: ``Such discussions would have been unthinkable \n     just a few years ago,'' and in a quotation from the chairman \n     of the Clinton study group, Edward M. Gramlich, professor of \n     economics and dean of the School of Public Policy at the \n     University of Michigan, a few paragraphs below that: ``Stocks \n     have outperformed bonds by a singificant margin over long \n     periods of time.''\n       Did anyone in public life remember to put in a good word \n     for stocks at the bottom of the 1969-74 bear market, or on \n     the Tuesday following Black Monday in October 1987? According \n     to the Times, the draft of the report by the Advisory Council \n     on Social Security puts on a brave, bull-market face: ``While \n     stock investments would entail `a slight increase' in risk \n     for Social Security,'' the paper relates, ``the risk would be \n     manageable.'' And another panel member boldly affirmed: \n     ``Beyond the floor of protection provided by Social Security, \n     we should let people participate fully in this economic \n     miracle that we call America.'' Will the panelist's economic \n     patriotism be just as intense during the next cyclical \n     downswing, we wonder, or will it be subject to revision?\n       It is almost certainly no accident that the Social Security \n     investment plan came into the world at the same time as Dow \n     5,500. According to James A. Bianco, Arbor Trading Group, \n     Barrington, Ill., the capitalization of the U.S. stock market \n     at year-end 1995 stood at 87.5% of GDP, the highest such \n     percentage in history. ``Likewise,'' Bianco went on, ``the \n     size of available cash, or M-2, to the size of the stock \n     market is the lowest in history at 57.1%. What this suggests \n     is that the stock market is grossly overvalued.'' Enthusiasts \n     for what would boil down to the greatest bond-for-stock swap \n     in the history of the republic have thought of everything \n     except what the stocks would be worth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2337-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2338-S2339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADULT EDUCATION FOR FAMILY LITERACY\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, a former valued staff member of mine \nwho is now working with the National Institute for Literacy, Alice \nJohnson, sent me an article that appeared in the magazine, Adult \nLearning. It is titled, Adult Education for Family Literacy by Thomas \nG. Sticht, President of the Applied Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences \nCompany in El Cajon, CA. In the midst of budget cutting I hope we will \nnot be short-sighted on this matter of literacy.\n  There has been a great deal of talk about the growing disparity \nbetween the top one-fifth of our population and the lower one-fifth of \nour population in terms of income.\n  One of the most effective ways of lifting the lot of the bottom one \nfifth is to make sure that they have the basic skills that are needed \nin our society, and that certainly includes reading. There is no single \nmagic bullet for solving this problem. It is a mosaic with many pieces. \nBut literacy is one of the pieces.\n  The article points out that when we educate adults better, they then \nfeel comfortable in schools and demand and get better education for \ntheir children.\n  Two years ago, I visited 18 schools in the impoverished areas of \nChicago and one of the things I heard from teachers over and over was \nthat they wished they had more parental involvement, but frequently the \nparents do not feel comfortable coming into a school situation because \nthey cannot read and write.\n  If we diminish our future by cutting back on literacy funding \neveryone loses.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the article by Thomas Sticht which I ask \nto be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From Adult Learning, November/December 1995]\n\n                  Adult Education for Family Literacy\n\n                         (By Thomas G. Sticht)\n\n       For nearly a half century, the United Nations Educational, \n     Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has led a \n     worldwide movement to promote the development of literacy \n     programs for adults and primary education for children. Many \n     successes have been documented in both of these programs. \n     Over the last quarter century, the rate of literacy among the \n     earth's adults has declined, but because of population \n     growth, the absolute numbers of illiterate adults continued \n     to grow. However, at the outset of International Literacy \n     Year in 1990, both the rate and the absolute numbers of adult \n     illiterates had declined. Still, there were an estimated 921 \n     million adult illiterates in the underdeveloped nations of \n     the world, and some 42 million low literates in developed \n     nations.\n       Paralleling the growth of adult literacy education in the \n     world, there has been an increase in the numbers of children \n     enrolled in primary education. Over the last four decades \n     enrollments in underdeveloped nations' primary schools rose \n     from about one-third to over seventy percent of primary aged \n     children. Yet, at the beginning of International Literacy \n     Year in 1990, UNESCO estimated that in developing countries \n     as a whole, some 386 million children and young adults aged \n     from six to seventeen years would not be attending school. \n     They are in a trajectory toward beginning the next generation \n     of illiterate adults.\n\n\n                            Family Literacy\n\n       In 1994, the International Year of the Family signaled a \n     new direction for adult and childhood literacy programs \n     worldwide, one that unites adults' literacy and children's \n     primary education. Taking stock of research and experience \n     over the last half century, the United Nations noted that:\n       The family constitutes a context of informal education, a \n     base from which members seek formal education, and should \n     provide a supportive environment for learning. Literacy has a \n     dramatic effect on the dissemination of ideas and the ability \n     of families to adopt new approaches, technologies and forms \n     of organization conducive to positive social change. Often \n     affected by early school leaving or dropping out, literacy is \n     a prime conditioner of the ability of families to adapt, \n     survive and even thrive in rapidly changing circumstances. \n     Attention should also be given to promoting equal \n     opportunities for girls and young women.\n       Whereas in the past, there has been tacit recognition of \n     the importance of the literacy education of adults as a key \n     factor in promoting the attendance of children in primary \n     education, the United Nations' statement makes clear that, \n     rather than being regarded as a secondary institution to the \n     schools as educational agents, the family is each society's \n     first and most basic educational institution.\n       There is evidence to suggest that as developing nations \n     move toward the educational and economic status of \n     industrialized nations, the family will play a greater role \n     in the educational achievement of children. Studies of \n     twenty-nine developing and industrialized nations examined \n     the relative contributions of school quality (e.g., number \n     and quality of textbooks, teacher's educational preparation) \n     versus family background factors (e.g., parents' education \n     levels) on children's achievement in science education. The \n     research revealed that, as nations moved from being less to \n     more developed, the quality of schools diminished as the \n     primary determinant of science achievement, and the influence \n     of family background factors increased. For instance, in \n     India, school quality accounted for ninety percent and home \n     factors only ten percent of the children's variation in \n     science achievement. In Australia, on the other hand, school \n     quality accounted for only twenty percent and home factors \n     eighty percent of the variation in science achievement.\n\n\n                        family literacy programs\n\n       The family literacy concept makes explicit what has \n     generally been implicitly understood, and recognizes the \n     family as an institution for education and learning, and the \n     role of parents as their children's first teachers. The \n     starting point for the development of human resources within \n     a culture is the family. Families provide an \n     intergenerational transfer of language, thought, and values \n     to the minds of their newborn infants and throughout the \n     formative years of their children's lives. Families provide \n     initial guidance in learning to use the cultural tools that \n     will be valued and rewarded within the culture. Families \n     interpret the culture for their children and they mediate the \n     understanding, use, and value placed on the cultural tools \n     for learning and education, of which the capstone tools are \n     language and literacy.\n       This recognition of the intergenerational role that parents \n     play as family educators places a much higher premium on the \n     importance of adult education than has traditionally been \n     accorded. Up to now adult literacy education programs have \n     generally aimed at making adults literate while the business \n     of making the adults' children literate has been left to the \n     formal school system. Under the family literacy concept, \n     however, it is now recognized that, due to the \n     intergenerational transfer of cognitive skills, including \n     language and literacy, an investment in the literacy \n     education of adults provides ``double duty dollars.'' It \n     improves the educational level of adults and simultaneously \n     improves the educability and school success of the adults' \n     children.\n       Family literacy programs differ from traditional adult \n     literacy programs in that they are designed to maximize the \n     probability that adults who receive literacy education will \n     actually succeed in transferring aspects of their new \n     beliefs, attitudes, knowledge, and skills intergenerationally \n     to their children.\n\n\n    the centrality of adult education to national development goals\n\n       In most nations, adult education occupies a tertiary \n     position to the formal schooling of\n\n[[Page S2339]]\n\n     children. However, as noted above, evidence now exists to \n     suggest that adult education, and particularly literacy \n     education for present and potential parents, should occupy a \n     central position in all governments' educational planning. \n     Four interrelated reasons for nations to support greater \n     investments in adult education are summarized below.\n       1. Better Educated Adults Are More Productive for Society. \n     Supervisors in six manufacturing companies near Chicago \n     reported that adult literacy programs made improvements in \n     job training, job performance, promotability of participants, \n     and productivity, such as scrap reduction, reduced paperwork, \n     and less wastage. Other research found that more literate \n     workers who actually use their literacy skills at work may \n     increase their productivity as much as ten to fifteen \n     percent. Adult literacy education improves work today, \n     reforming schools for children takes decades.\n       2. Better Educated Adults Provide Better Communities for \n     Learning. At AC Rochester, a supplier of components for \n     General Motors automobile manufacturing in New York State, \n     management, labor union members, and educators got together, \n     and provided adult literacy programs for employees. This \n     helped increase the local tax base for community services by \n     bringing in several new contracts, including a billion dollar \n     contract with Russia.\n       3. Better Educated Adults Demand and Get Better Schooling \n     for Children. Wider Opportunities for Women in Washington, \n     DC, found that mothers in women's literacy programs spent \n     more time with their children talking about school, helping \n     them with their homework, taking them to the library, and \n     reading to them. They also said they spent more time going to \n     and helping with school activities, they talked more with \n     teachers about their children's education, their \n     children attended school more, showed improvements in \n     their school grades, test scores, and reading.\n       4. Better Educated Adults Produce Better Educated Children. \n     Better educated parents send children to school better \n     prepared to learn, with higher levels of language skills, and \n     knowledge about books, pencils, and other literacy tools \n     needed for school and life. Better educated mothers have \n     healthier babies, smaller families, children better prepared \n     to start school, and children who stay in school and learn \n     more.\n     Make Every Adult Basic Education Class a Family Literacy \n     Class\n       The San Diego Consortium for Workforce Education and \n     Lifelong Learning (CWELL) operates an Action Research Center \n     (ARC) in the San Diego Community College District, Continuing \n     Education Division. In 1994, the ARC initiated research \n     orchestrated around the theme, ``make every adult basic \n     education class a family literacy class.'' The research \n     included the publication of a simple rating scale in one \n     issue of the Community Exchange, the newspaper that the ARC \n     publishes to disseminate R information into the ARC \n     community.\n       The rating scale asks adults to rate how frequently they \n     perform various parenting activities such as reading to their \n     children, taking them to the library, helping with homework \n     and so forth. A tabulation of responses from 131 adults in \n     five different adult basic education and English as a Second \n     Language (ESL) programs indicated that adults vary greatly in \n     how often they engage in these kinds of activities that can \n     help transfer literacy to their children. These data provide \n     a baseline for comparing parenting activities before the ARC \n     introduces activities to ``make every adult education class a \n     family literacy class.''\n       With sound evaluation of these programs, it should be \n     possible to demonstrate that ``double duty dollars'' can be \n     obtained through the intergenerational transfer of literacy \n     that takes place in adult basic skills education programs. \n     Governments and other sponsors of education programs should \n     know that they can obtain multiplier effects for their \n     investments in adult basic education. They should know that \n     by investing in the education of adults, they can improve the \n     education of children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2338-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ARAFAT MUST STIFLE EXTREMISTS\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, all of us have been stunned by the \nsuicidal missions of extremist in Israel.\n  And it is the hope of most people around the world, as well as in the \nMiddle East, that the extremists should not prevail and scuttle the \npeace process.\n  I was particularly pleased to read in the Chicago Tribune as well as \nthe New York Times, the letter of Ray Hanania, President of the \nPalestinian American Congress, which I ask to be printed in the Record. \nMr Hanania is calling on Yasser Arafat to crack down on the extremists.\n  People of good will of every persuasion should join in this endeavor.\n  The article follows:\n\n                       [From the Chicago Tribune]\n\n                     Arafat Must Stifle Extremists\n\n                            (By Ray Hanania)\n\n       CHICAGO.--The Israelis are right about one thing: It is the \n     responsibility of Yasser Arafat, president of the Palestinian \n     Authority, to crack down on extremists who are based in the \n     territories that he controls.\n       It is not an easy decision to make, but it is one that \n     Arafat must make if the Middle East peace process is to \n     succeed and Palestinians are to have their own state.\n       Arafat must come to grips with the responsibilities of \n     Democratic leadership. This is no longer a revolution in \n     which internal criticism is hushed for the sake of survival.\n       While he must learn to tolerate criticism and not jail \n     Palestinian journalists who attack his policies, so too must \n     he learn to be more forceful with those who challenge the \n     foundation of Palestinian democracy.\n       Palestine is democratic. And Arafat's election is founded \n     on democracy. Democracy requires that leaders no longer need \n     to seek unanimity to justify their actions. Quite the \n     contrary, democracy allows leaders to do what they could not \n     do before--make decisions with the slimmest of majorities.\n       Realizing that he can never make everyone, especially the \n     extremists, happy with any decision he makes is a necessity \n     if he and the Palestinian people are to survive as a nation.\n       It is a realization he has yet to come to grips with. And \n     when he does, he will discover that the vast majority of \n     Palestinians support a crackdown but fear public expression \n     of this view. The extremists have and will use violence \n     against their own people to justify their means and achieve \n     their goals.\n       Our leaders need courage to change this.\n       In the United States, the Palestinian-American community \n     has spoken loudly, favoring the peace process. While we, as a \n     community, may not totally agree with every detail, the \n     principle of pursuing a peaceful resolution of the Israel-\n     Palestine question is now a mandate for our people.\n       Arafat cannot make the mistake of believing that he can \n     walk between the moderates and those who advocate violence. \n     The extremists that he must silence are the very same people \n     who, if given the chance, would silence Palestinian democracy \n     and destroy any hopes of establishing a democratic \n     Palestinian state.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2339-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           VALLEY HAVEN SCHOOL 20TH ANNIVERSARY HIKE/BIKE/RUN\n\n Mr. SHELBY.

The primary \nsource of these funds is the annual Hike/Bike/Run, which consists of a \n5 or 10 mile walk, an 11 or 22 mile bike ride, a skate-a-thon, a 1, \n3.1, or 6.2 mile run, a 5 mile bike ride for children, and the Trike \nTrek for preschoolers.\n  Each participant in the Hike/Bike/Run obtains pledges for their \nparticipation, and all proceeds go directly to Valley Haven to support \nthe education and training for handicapped students. In 1995, this 1 \nday fundraiser involved over 1,000 participants and 8,000 pledging \nsponsors. The event generated over $100,000 in pledges to support the \nwork of the school.\n  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and commend Valley Haven \nand the entire Valley community for displaying such strong support and \nconcern for these special students. This year's Hike/Bike/Run will be \nheld on Saturday, May 4, and I know that the community will once again \nunite to support this wonderful program and help Valley Haven School \nhelp its students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2339-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2339-S2340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the 78th anniversary \nof Lithuania's independence in 1918. This should be a time for \nremembrance and renewal. It evokes memories of great sadness and also \ngreat joy. The long night of Soviet domination and occupation has given \nway to a new beginning for the Lithuanian people. It is heartening to \nthe world to see that Lithuania's strong and vibrant culture has \nsurvived the many years of Soviet control.\n  Lithuania showed its commitment to joining the free world when it was \nthe first country from the former Soviet Union to formally join the \nPartnership for Peace in 1994. The faith and courage of the Lithuanian \npeople and the undying efforts and support for Lithuanian independence \nof Lithuanian-Americans has the respect and admiration of\n\n[[Page S2340]]\n\npeace-loving people throughout the world. I know that my Senate \ncolleagues join me in honoring Lithuania's independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/19/senate-section/article/S2339-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
