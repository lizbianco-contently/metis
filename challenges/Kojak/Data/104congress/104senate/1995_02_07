Mr. President, last week was Schools Without Violence week \nin the Milwaukee public schools. However, last Monday, at the same time \nthat students in my alma mater, Washington High School, were preparing \nessays on a theme of ``Peace Begins with Me,'' gunshots shattered that \npeace. In the first shooting ever in a Milwaukee classroom, a 19-year-\nold former student shot a high school senior in the arm and leg. He was \nfortunate that he was not killed.\n  In the aftermath, one concerned mother stated:\n\n       Washington High School is a place of learning for kids. \n     They should feel safe enough to learn. For this to happen \n     here is unfair.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not just unfair. It is unacceptable. Young \npeople should be able to concentrate on their biology and math classes \nand not on avoiding bullets.\n  Of course, there is no easy cure for the violence that is riddling \nour streets and ravaging our schools. We need more police, more \nprisons, and better family structure. However, I do believe that in the \nlast Congress we passed three measures which can begin to make a \ndifference: The Brady Act, the Youth Handgun Safety Act, and the \nassault weapons ban. I do not believe that any of these bills infringe \non anyone's second amendment rights, and I am a strong supporter of \nthese rights.\n  First, the evidence strongly supports the fact that during the 11 \nmonths that it has been in effect, the Brady law has helped save lives. \nAccording to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Brady law \nhas resulted in approximately 2 percent of all applicants being turned \ndown from purchasing firearms because they were ineligible. Fugitives, \nrapists, murderers, and convicted felons have been arrested while \ntrying to purchase guns.\n  In my own State of Wisconsin, which has a 2-day waiting period and a \nbackground check on handguns, more than 800 convicted felons have been \nprevented from buying handguns in the past 3 years.\n  Second, as we all know, homicides involving firearms, especially \namong our Nation's young, are on the increase. The risk of being \nmurdered by a firearm in the United States has more than doubled since \n1966. But for young people aged 15 to 19, it is much worse. The rate \nhas increased nearly seven times. In our America of 1995, far too many \nof our young people are being killed and far too many of our young \npeople are killing each other.\n   [[Page S2218]] The problem of young people and guns has concerned me \never since I came to Washington. Last year, we finally made some \nprogress. We enacted the Youth Handgun Safety Act as part of the crime \nbill which makes it a Federal crime to sell a handgun to a minor and \nfor a minor to possess a handgun under most circumstances. Our measure \nhad bipartisan support, from Senators Craig and Thurmond to former \nSenator Metzenbaum, from the NRA to law enforcement. It is not a total \nsolution, but it does take a step toward stemming the violence.\n  Finally, we have all read reports that some House Members want to \nrepeal the ban on assault weapons as part of a new crime bill. I \nbelieve that this would be a terrible mistake. Have we forgotten about \nthe 1989 massacre of innocent schoolchildren in Stockton, CA, and have \nwe forgotten about the Long Island Railroad commuters who were \nruthlessly gunned down just last year?\n  The ban on assault weapons is supported by almost 80 percent of the \nAmerican people and numerous police organizations. Law enforcement \nclaims that these are the weapons of choice for gang members and drug \nkingpins and that repealing the ban would ensure that gangs outgun \npolice officers who walk the beat. In any event, to repeal the ban \nwould be to reopen a partisan political wound just at a time when we \nare trying to work together on behalf of the American people. For that \nreason alone, Senators Dole and Hatch deserve credit for not including \na repeal in their crime legislation.\n  Yes, things have certainly changed from when I was a student at \nWashington High School. Back then, we did not have to worry about gangs \nand drugs and assault weapons and broken homes. Young people were not \nraised in front of TV sets that bombarded them with senseless violent \nimages. And now for many young people guns, crime, and violence are the \nonly way that they think they can get ahead.\n  Mr. President, this is not the kind of a world that our children \ndeserve, but it is one in which too many do in fact live. And so I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the 104th Congress to reduce \nthe number of guns in school and the number of young people with guns.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2217-6", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2218-S2230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nnow resume consideration of House Joint Resolution 1, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J.

Mr. President, I would like to just continue where I was \nyesterday. I appreciate the comments of my dear friend from Wisconsin \nand the leadership he is providing on the balanced budget amendment as \nwell.\n  Yesterday I brought up a Balanced Budget Act debt tracker, and you \ncan see by this tracker that since we have been debating--we are now in \nour ninth day--since we have been debating the balanced budget \namendment, each day the national debt has gone up $829,440,000. That \nwas day one. As you can see, each day that we are debating this \namendment, the deficit that the American taxpayers are owing is going \nup by that amount. It is a steady climb. As of yesterday, we were up to \n$6,635,520,000. As of today, the ninth day of our debate, we are now up \nto $7,464,960,000.\n  The trend line is straight up and we have only debated this 9 days. \nThe President's budget does not do anything about that. As a matter of \nfact, his budget is going to go on at about $200 billion a year in \ndeficits.\n  Today I added this other bar to this balanced budget amendment debt \ntracker. The debt, as I said, is now increased by $7,464,960,000 in \njust the 9 days we have been on this balanced budget amendment. A staff \nmember told me this morning, regarding the balanced budget, in an \nattempt to balance his own budget at home he spends $50 a week for \ngroceries. This $7.4 billion that we have just spent in 9 days, putting \nus into more bankruptcy--that $7.4 billion would buy that staff member \ngroceries for 2,871,138 years at $50 a week. So you can see how big \nthis really is. If you look in the Wall Street Journal yesterday there \nis a very clever article related to the debt.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 6, 1995]\n\n          If You Bought 2 Trillion Copies of This Paper * * *\n\n                           (By Stephen Moore)\n\n       Today, President Clinton releases his fiscal 1996 budget. \n     Already the Associated Press is reporting that officials \n     claim the budget ``proposes to abolish or consolidate \n     hundreds of government programs, reducing federal spending by \n     $144 billion over the next five years.'' No doubt the \n     president will firmly insist that this is the most tight-\n     fisted, penny-pinching budget in 20 years.\n       Why is this so predictable? Because this is what every \n     president since Richard Nixon has said. But 20 years ago the \n     federal budget was $370 billion. Today, Mr. Clinton will \n     request almost $1.6 trillion. Even adjusting for inflation, \n     the federal budget is twice as large as it was during the \n     last years of the Nixon presidency. Besides, without the \n     sleight of hand of baseline budgeting, President Clinton's \n     new budget calls for a $50 billion increase in spending from \n     the current budget. And that was $70 billion more than was \n     spent the year before that. Yet the budget-busting news is \n     bound to be greeted with a national yawn of unconcern.\n       Why is there more public outrage when we learn that \n     Washington wastes $100 on Al Gore's famous ashtray than that \n     it wastes nearly $1.6 trillion on everything else? Much of \n     the problem seems to be that 1\\1/2\\ trillion is an \n     incomprehensibly large number. So here are some simple ways \n     to picture how enormous the U.S. government is today:\n       One trillion dollars--$1,000,000,000,000.00. That's 12 \n     zeroes to the left of the decimal point. A trillion is a \n     million times a million. It would take more than 1\\1/2\\ \n     million millionaires to have as much money as is spent each \n     year by Congress.\n       One of the highest-paid workers in America today is \n     basketball superstar Shaquille O'Neal, who reportedly earns \n     about $30 million a season in salary and endorsements. He is \n     rich beyond our wildest imaginations. But he'd have to play \n     33,000 seasons before he earned $1 trillion. It would take a \n     Superdome full of Shaquille O'Neals to have enough to pay all \n     of Congress's bills each year.\n       Here's an experiment. What if we were to try to pay off the \n     $4 trillion national debt by having Congress put one dollar \n     every second into a special debt-buy-down account? How many \n     years would it take to pay off the debt? One million seconds \n     is about 12 days. One billion seconds is roughly 32 years. \n     But one trillion seconds is almost 32,000 years. So to pay \n     off the debt, Congress would have to put dollar bills into \n     this account for about the next 130,000 years--roughly the \n     amount of time that has passed since the Ice Age.\n       Even if we were to require Congress to put $100 a second \n     into this debt-buy-down account, it would still take well \n     over 1,000 years to pay the debt down.\n       Try this one on for size. Imagine a train of 50-foot \n     boxcars crammed with $1 bills. How long would the train have \n     to be to carry the $1.6 trillion Congress spends each year? \n     About $65 million can be stuffed in a boxcar. Thus, the train \n     would have to be about 240 miles long to carry enough dollar \n     bills to balance the federal budget. In other words, you \n     would need a train that stretches the entire Northeast \n     corridor, from Washington, through Baltimore, Delaware, \n     Philadelphia, New Jersey, and into New York City.\n       Former Office of Management and Budget Director Jim Miller \n     calculates that if a military jet were flying overhead at the \n     speed of sound and spewing out a roll of dollar bills behind \n     it, the plane would have to fly for more than 15 years before \n     it reeled out 1.6 trillion dollar bills.\n       Here's a challenging one: If you laid $1 bills from end to \n     end, could you make a chain that stretches to the moon with \n     1.6 trillion? Answer: without a sweat, with billions and \n     billions of dollars left over. In fact, they would stretch \n     nearly from the Earth to the sun.\n       The newspaper tabloids report that O.J. Simpson is paying \n     some $55,000 a day in legal fees. The trial would have to \n     last 26 million days, or almost 100,000 years, before the \n     lawyers earned $1.6 trillion.\n       This year the White House want to spend three times as much \n     as America did to win World War I, which cost roughly $500 \n     billion in today's dollars. Adjusted for inflation, the \n     combined cost of defeating the Nazis and the \n      [[Page S2219]] Japanese in World War II and winning World \n     War I was $4.5 trillion. This is what Washington will spend \n     in peacetime in just the next three years to continue losing \n     the war on poverty, drugs, illiteracy, homelessness and so \n     on.\n       So far, we've just been counting the amount Washington \n     spends each year. When state and local expenditures are \n     included, total annual government spending now surpasses $2.5 \n     trillion. That's more than $23,000 of government for every \n     household in America. In constant dollars government spends \n     twice as much per household as it did in 1960--though most \n     Americans believe that government services have deteriorated \n     since then.\n       With the $2.5 trillion government spends each year, you \n     could purchase all of the farmland in the U.S. (market value: \n     $725 billion), plus all of the stock of the 100 most \n     profitable U.S. corporations today ($1.6 trillion). You would \n     then still have just enough money left to pay the advance on \n     Newt Gingrich's book deal.\n       All of this points to one conclusion: The budget that Bill \n     Clinton is presenting today is not lean; it is not efficient; \n     it is not frugal. It is a monstrosity. It should be greeted \n     with heaps of ridicule and scorn. No matter how you stack it, \n     $1.6 trillion is a whole lot of money--even in Washington.\n  Mr. HATCH. That article lists how much $1 trillion really is.\n  As I look at the President's recent budget, the way deficit cuts are \ncalculated by the administration is like a 200 pound man claiming he \nlost weight when he weighs in at only 300 pounds because he thought he \nwould be 400 pounds. Only in Washington can an increase be called a \ncut, and that is precisely what is happening.\n  The Daschle motion to recommit has rightly been called the right-to-\nstall proposal. It purports to put off the requirement of a balanced \nbudget until Congress actually achieves a balanced budget, by adopting \nsuch a budget plan.\n  Mr. President, this proposal purports to give Congress a \nconstitutional right to stall the requirement of a balanced budget by \nmere failure to balance the budget. Mr. President, the very reason we \nneed a balanced budget amendment is because Congress has failed to \nbalance the budget for decades. The Daschle right-to-stall amendment \nwould make that abject failure of responsibility the explicit condition \nof avoiding the acceptance of that responsibility. If there is a better \nmanner to lock in business as usual, a better way to constitutionalize \nor borrow and spend status quo--our ever-steeper slide into the debt \nabyss--I admit I cannot think of it.\n  Think of it, Mr. President, the proponents of the right-to-stall \namendment want to use Congress' historical inability to balance the \nbudget as a reason--a constitutional reason--to deny the American \npeople, to deny future generations, the requirement they want to force \nCongress to act responsibly, get its fiscal house in order, and live \nwithin its means. Talk about a recipe for inaction. The right-to-stall \nproponents say ``if Congress cannot balance the budget, they should not \nhave to.'' They say, ``if Congress has been and is unable to\n balance the budget in the absence of a balanced budget requirement, we \nshould not impose a balanced budget requirement on it.'' Is this what \nthe American people want? Do they want Congress' failure to fulfill its \nresponsibility to be a reason to drop the requirement? Does this even \nmake any sense?\n\n  Mr. President, I do not think so. If someone borrowed money from you, \nwould you forgive the debt simply because they had not repaid it or had \nno plan to do so? I do not think so. If someone were dangerously \noverweight, would you suggest they not resolve to go on a diet because \nthey did not yet have a full and particularized diet plan? I do not \nthink so. When the Framers established the Congress in article I of the \nConstitution, did they first require that all subsequent legislation be \ndisclosed before ratification? I do not think so.\n  Mr. President, the ``right-to-stall'' amendment confuses the \ndifference between choosing rules and making choices within the rules. \nThis distinction was elaborated by Prof. James M. Buchanan, a Nobel \nPrize-winning economist in a letter to the editor in yesterday's Wall \nStreet Journal. I would like to quote it because I believe it points up \na basic fallacy in the reasoning of the objection of the right-to-stall \nproponents. Professor Buchanan says:\n\n       The essential argument [of the Daschle amendment \n     proponents] against the balanced budget amendment reflects a \n     basic misunderstanding of the difference between a choice of \n     rules and choices made with rules. The Clinton-Democratic \n     argument suggests that proponents of the amendment should \n     specify what combination of spending cuts and revenue \n     increases are to be implemented over the seven-year \n     transition period. This argument reflects a failure to \n     understand what a choice of constitutional constraint is all \n     about and conflates within-rule choices and choices of rules \n     themselves.\n       Consider an analogy with an ordinary game, say poker. We \n     choose the basic rules before we commence to play within \n     whatever rules are chosen. Clearly, if we could foresee all \n     of the contingencies beforehand (for example, how the cards \n     are to fall), those of us who know in advance that we shall \n     get bad hands would not agree to the rules in the first \n     place. Choices of rules must be made in a setting in which we \n     do not yet know the particulars of the within-rule choices.\n       Applied to the politics of taxing and spending, the \n     constitutional amendment imposes a new rule of the game, \n     under which the ordinary interplay of interest groups-\n     majoritarian politics will generate certain patterns of \n     taxing-spending results. By the very nature of what rules-\n     choices are, outcome patterns cannot be specified in advance.\n       The opponents of the proposed balanced budget amendment \n     should not be allowed to generate intellectual confusion \n     about the difference between choices among vs. within rules. \n     There are, of course, legitimate arguments that may be made \n     against the amendment, but these involve concerns about the \n     efficacy of alternative rules, including those that now \n     exist, rather than a specific prediction of choices to be \n     made under any rule or choices made during the transition \n     between rules.\n  That was James M. Buchanan's letter to the Wall Street Journal on \nFebruary 6 of this year.\n  Mr. President, Professor Buchanan is right. Proponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment recommended a rule change. Opponents argue \nagainst the amendment on the basis of either possible choices under the \nnew rule which could hurt well-organized special interest groups or the \nfailure to specify which well-organized special interest groups will be \nhurt under the new rule. Either objection is, as Professor Buchanan \npoints out, intellectually confused as an objection to the new rule. \nThe proponents do not advocate any particular outcomes, just a new way \nof making those choices. That is what we proponents feel. The right-to-\nstall motion offered by the Democrat leader does not move the debate \nforward.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the Daschle right-to-stall amendment is \nnothing more than a way to stop Congress from adopting the resolve to \nforce itself to act responsibly and balance the budget and live within \nits means in the future.\n  Now, the opponents point to President Clinton's tax plan of 1993 as \nthe great epitome of budgetary courage we should follow. But, Mr. \nPresident, that was no plan to balance the budget. I would ask my \ncolleagues, did the 1993 tax bill balance the budget? Does the \nPresident propose a path to a balanced budget? Just look at the \nPresident's budget released this week. It projects $200 billion yearly \nbudgets as far as the eye can see--and that is the best case scenario \nwith the most optimistic assumptions. There is no budget balancing \nleadership here.\n  As a matter of fact, there are pundits now saying in the press that \nthe reason the President has done that is because he wants the \nRepublican Congress to have to make the cuts so that he can then \ncriticize them for making them. I certainly hope Congress will pass a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment. We will have to.\n  Those who offer the right-to-stall proposal seek to distract us and \nthe Nation from the clear principle of a balanced budget requirement by \nstarting the budget battle before the rules are established. They \neither seek to divide the strong coalition who supports the principle \nby the implementing details which can and should change with the \nnational priorities over time; or they hope to be able to say, once \nsuch a budget plan is adopted, that we no longer need the amendment. \nEither way this is simply a distraction tactic to stall the amendment \nand protect the status quo.\n  Mr. President, those who say we can balance the budget without the \nbalanced budget amendment are the ones who should show us how they \npropose to do it. They are the ones who say, regardless of history, we \ncan balance the budget now, without a rules change.\n  The President has not done it, and he is against the balanced budget \namendment. And neither will those who are \n      [[Page S2220]]  against it here on the floor. But I continue \n     to ask in vain, how do they propose to do it, Mr. President? \n     Why should we trust they will do better under the status quo \n     than they have for the last 26 years?\n  Mr. President, I ask again: What is their budget plan to reach a \nbalanced budget? If you read this one, the administration recent \nbudget, it just throws in the towel and says there will be $190 \nbillion-plus deficits every year for the next 12 years. Is this the \nplan that they want?\n  Mr. President, their plan is no plan at all. Their plan is more of \nthe same. it is preservation of the status quo. It is the old order. We \nare saying it is time for a new view, a new order, where we start \nliving within our means. The only way we are going to get there is if \nwe change the rules of the game so that there are incentives to get \nthere.\n  The beauty of this balanced budget amendment is it does not force us \nto get there, but it gives us the incentives to get there. That is \nsomething we need to do.\n  Mr. President, the administration's type of budgeting will not do. Is \nthis their plan? Mr. President, their plan is no plan. Their plan is \nmore of the same.\n  We should adopt the binding resolve to accept our responsibility, and \nthen fulfill it. We should not avoid responsibility on the ground that \nwe have so far failed to act responsibly. We should not be able to deny \nthe American people and future generations the responsible rule of \nfiscal discipline on the grounds of our historical lack of discipline. \nAnd, Mr. President, the correct way to proceed is the way of the Dole \nneed-to-need proposal, which suggests that if President Clinton and his \nallies succeed in defeating the balanced budget amendment once again, \nthey should have to show us how to balance the budget without the \namendment.\n And if they are going to make this argument that we ought to show them \nbefore we set the rule in place, then where are their ideas on how to \ndo it without the rule in place?\n\n  Let us take the first step first. Let us get our house in order by \nadopting the balanced budget amendment.\n  Finally, let me go back to this chart one more time. This red line \nhappens to be our current national debt, $4.8 trillion. These green \nblocks represent how much that debt has now gone up above the $4.8 \ntrillion each day that this debate has been going on. We are now in our \n9th day of this matter and we have gone from an $829,440,000 increase \nin this $4.8 trillion deficit on the 1st day to the 9th day, where we \nare at $7,464,960,000. So every day that this debate goes on, and every \nday that we do not have a balanced budget amendment, we are going to \ncontinue to increase the debt.\n  Last but not least, with the President's budget, over the next 5 \nyears we will have the deficit go up $1.3 trillion more.\n  So you have the idea. It is time for this fiasco to end, for us to \npass a rule called the balanced budget amendment that will put some \nmechanism in place to get us to move in the right direction so that we \ncan save this country. We cannot allow this country to go into a fiscal \nbankruptcy through monetizing the debt and paying off our debts with \nworthless dollars. We have to pass this balanced budget amendment now. \nI hope our colleagues will do it.\n  I notice the distinguished Senator from Vermont has been waiting. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah, of course, was a \ntrial attorney, as was I and the distinguished occupant of the chair. I \nlistened to his debate. I recall some of the trials that I was in. I \nrecall some where we were ending up having long trials on contracts. \nUsually, what brought us there was the fact that somebody had said at \none point, ``Sign this contract. You do not have to read all of the \nprint in it. Let us hurry up and get this going because time is \nwasting.''\n  Then, later on, of course, we were in a long trial trying to figure \nout just what somebody had signed away.\n  Basically, my good friend from Utah is saying that time is wasting. \nSign this. He, of course, says it is a rules change. It is a lot more \nthan that. We are amending the Constitution.\n  We are the most powerful nation on Earth. We are also the most \npowerful democracy history has ever known.\n  No other country has achieved, in economic or military power, the \ndiversity the United States has. No other country has even come close \nto such a clear and concise Constitution as we have. We have only \namended it 17 times since the Bill of Rights.\n  Yet, in the past few weeks, since the elections last fall, we have \nhad 75 proposals to change the Constitution. Can you imagine, Mr. \nPresident? We were able to keep on somehow as a country for 200 years, \namending the Constitution only 17 times since the Bill of Rights; but \nsomehow America has so changed in the last 4 months since the elections \nin November that we have to have 75 new constitutional amendments? I \nreally cannot accept that.\n  I say to my good friend from Utah that when he speaks of the amount \nthe debt has gone up, and that if we pass this, somehow the suggestion \nis that it would stop--well, the balanced budget amendment, which is \nfar more than a rules change, which does not say how we are going to \nget there, says that in the year 2002, whoever might still be standing \nwill somehow come up and miraculously balance the budget. It does \nnothing to stop this increase in debt.\n  In fact, I point out that during the 1980's, incidentally, during the \n6 years that the party of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \ncontrolled the U.S. Senate, they, along with the President, nearly \nquadrupled the national debt, more than the debt that had been piled up \nover in the previous 200 years, including two world wars. During that 6 \nyears, they were in control and quadrupled the American debt.\n  In fact, when you look at how much the debt is piling up today, \nvirtually all of it is interest on the debt they piled up during those \n6 years. We spend nearly $500 million every working day just on \ninterest on the debt that was piled up during those halcyon days of the \n1980's.\n  President Clinton was the first President since I have been in the \nSenate who actually had a budget which, 3 years in a row, has cut the \ndeficit. President Clinton is the first President to cut the deficit \nfor 3 years in a row since President Truman. He would actually have a \nbalanced budget if he was not having to find money to pay for the \ninterest on the debt run up by his two Republican predecessors. I do \nnot say that to be partisan but simply to set the record straight.\n  In fact, one of the local dailies in Vermont, the Burlington Free \nPress, has a cartoon in today's paper. It shows a rather rotund person \nflying through the congressional Chambers, little wings flapping away. \nHe is smoking a big cigar, and he has a thing on his shirt that says \n``Balanced Budget Amendment.'' And here are all these eager, young \nMembers of Congress clapping and clapping, saying, ``If you believe in \nfairies, keep clapping, keep clapping.''\n  That is what the balanced budget amendment is about.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I would like to know more of what we are \ngoing to do if this passes. We can look at how much debt is piling up. \nThis debt will keep piling up to the year 2002, I am afraid, even if we \npass this, unless we have the will to vote to actually cut the deficit. \nThe only Presidential budgets that have cut the deficit have been those \nPresident Clinton has submitted in the last couple of years--with no \nvotes on the Republican side of the aisle to actually bring down the \ndeficit. The Republican side of the aisle voted to quadruple the debt \nwhen they were in control of the Senate and when they had the \nPresidency. Not one of them voted to bring it down.\n  We overwhelmingly passed a bill against unfunded mandates. But the \nbalanced budget amendment may be the biggest unfunded mandate of all \ntime. It ignores the two fundamental principles underlying the reasons \nwe are against unfunded mandates: The Federal Government should not \nshift burdens onto the States without paying for them; and to protect \nagainst such shifts, we have to examine the unintended consequences of \nFederal actions on State and local governments.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that \nCongress has to achieve $1.2 trillion in deficit reductions if we are \ngoing to balance the budget by 2002. If we are going to do that, all of \nus know it is going to affect local and State governments.\n  Unless we carefully balance the budget, the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment could be a disaster for the States. I do not \nsupport the balanced budget amendment, but I assume it is going to \npass. I worry about what it will do in my own State. If we look at some \nof the ways we could have cuts, we can do across-the-board spending \ncuts, for example, and that avoids having to make the choices needed to \nbalance the budget. [[Page S2221]] \n  But the Treasury Department looked at this, in answer to a question \nfrom Governor Dean of Vermont. They said that assuming Social Security \nand defense cuts were off the table--and the Republican majority said \nthey are--then the Treasury analysis predicts cuts in Medicaid, highway \ngrants, welfare, and other Federal grants in Vermont that would total \n$200 million. If we wanted to offset these losses, Vermont would have \nto increase State taxes by 17 percent.\n  They also looked at other States. New York would lose over $8 billion \nin Federal grants, resulting in a State tax increase of 17 percent to \nmake up the difference. California would lose $7.7 billion in Federal \ngrants, resulting in a State tax increase of 9 percent to make up the \ndifference. Texas would lose over $4 billion in Federal grants, \nresulting in a State tax increase of 14 percent to make up the \ndifference. Louisiana would lose $2 billion, resulting in a State tax \nincrease of 27 percent to make up the difference.\n  In another study, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \nestimates that by 2002, Vermont would have cumulative cuts in Federal \naid to the State and local government of $1 billion due to the balanced \nbudget amendment. We are a very small State; others would lose a great \ndeal more.\n  The Children's Defense Fund has estimated what the balanced budget \namendment would do to children. Children do not vote, children do not \nhave PAC funds, and children do not have political influence; but \nchildren are going to really feel it. In Vermont, 4,850 babies, \npreschoolers, and pregnant women would lose infant formula under the \nWIC program; 13,900 children would lose subsidized school lunches; \n13,750 children would lose Medicaid health coverage. The other 49 \nStates would, of course, have similar losses.\n  So House Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment, may \nbecome the super silent unfunded mandate. I know what is going to \nhappen in my State. We will do everything possible in our churches, our \nsynagogues, our private organizations, to pick up the difference, but \nthe State will ultimately have to pick up a great deal of it. It may \nnot pick up all of it. To do so would require 17 percent in higher \ntaxes. I do not believe that would happen. We would find a lot of the \nchildren, pregnant women, and others left off the rolls. At the same \ntime, Vermont taxes would go up.\n  Basically, it is the ultimate budget gimmick. It is the easy, feel-\ngood budget gimmick. We do not have to make any hard choices. We can \njust pass this and say we did our bit, and guess what? In the year \n2002, a Senate and House full of angels will stand up here and somehow \ndo everything that we are unwilling to do and, of course, what they \nwill do is simply pass it on to the States and the local communities.\n  We have passed the buck to the States before. Federal aid to State \nand local governments fell sharply in the 1980's, at the same time we \nwere quadrupling the national debt. In fact, during that time, in my \nState of Vermont--I suspect as in most other States--State and local \ntaxes went up to make up the difference.\n  So let us talk to the States and tell them exactly what is in here. I \nsupport Senator Daschle's amendment. We should let the States know what \nthe details are; and if they know what the details are, then those who \ndo support this balanced budget amendment can work in conjunction with \nthem to ratify this constitutional amendment.\n  What I am afraid of is we are going to pass this, and everybody is \ngoing to go home and say, ``Look what we did,'' and instead of the \nchecks in the mail to the States, the bill will be in the mail.\n  I would note that almost every weekend when I go home, I have a lot \nof people come up to me when I am pumping gas in my car, shoveling \nsnow, in the grocery store or just walking down the street to pick up a \npaper, people come up to me and say they favor this amendment, but only \nif they know what is going to be in it. They want to know the effect of \nthis constitutional amendment before it is passed.\n  And in Vermont, we are no different than the rest of the country. CNN \ndid a poll that said 74 percent of those surveyed support the right to \nknow. The Los Angeles Times found it was 80 percent. They surveyed the \nwhole Nation. Eighty percent of Americans want what Senator Daschle is \nsuggesting in his amendment. Let us know what is in the balanced budget \namendment.\n  I said before that when I practiced law and a client would come in \nwith a contract that had some big type and a whole lot of little type, \nI would say: You go ahead and read the big type. You do not need a \nlawyer for that. You need a lawyer to read the small type. That is the \n``gotcha'' kind of type. The effect of this amendment are the small \ntype, the ``gotcha. The big type is the balanced budget amendment. We \ncould put that on a bumper sticker. ``We balanced the budget,'' whoop-\nde-do. It means that someone in the next century, the next millennium, \nwill then stand up and make the hard choices.\n  But what we should do is say we are going to at least tell you what \nis involved in this amendment, where the cuts are, what the states are \ngoing to have to do. Then, if the Congress and the States want to amend \nthe Constitution for the 18th time in nearly 200 years after the Bill \nof Rights, then go ahead and do it. If it is that important, then do \nit.\n  But do not sell the American people on the idea that suddenly, if we \njust tamper with this Constitution, the real contract with America, we \nare going to solve all our budget problems. Do not tell the American \npeople that after 200 years of the most powerful, diverse democracy in \nhistory, a democracy that has existed with only 17 amendments to the \nConstitution since the Bill of Rights, that suddenly we need these 75 \namendments, including this one, to make us a real democracy.\n  We are the envy of the rest of the world. Every emerging democracy \nlooks at our Constitution to see how to do it. And we should not allow \nthat to change.\n  So does the debt rise each day, even as we debate? Of course, it \ndoes.\n  But I would point out there are a lot of people who stood on this \nfloor during the 1980's, when the other party controlled the Senate, as \nthey do now, and voted for one huge--one huge--deficit after another. \nPresident Reagan proposed them and then President Bush did. They \nquadrupled the national debt.\n  There are only seven of us left in this body who voted against that, \nand I am one of them. Ironically, had we been listened to, we would \nhave a balanced budget today. Instead, our deficit today is about what \nwe are paying for the interest, legally obligated interest, on that \ndebt of the 1980's.\n  So next time we talk about doing this by slogans, let the reality at \nleast come up even with the rhetoric, and the reality is a lot \ndifferent than the rhetoric.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont for his statement. I also thank the \nmanager of the bill for yielding the floor at this time.\n  Mr. President, I intend to take the next hour or so, maybe a bit \nlonger, to try to lay out the case for at least letting the people know \nwhat might be entailed in a balanced budget amendment.\n  But let me try to put this balanced budget amendment in a broader \ncontext. We will shortly get into a lot of numbers, because if you are \ngoing to deal with the balanced budget amendment, you have to get into \nnumbers. However, before we get into those numbers, let me try to \nestablish what I think is the proper context for the balanced budget \ndebate.\n  During the 1992 campaign, the Clinton campaign had a theme song by \nFleetwood Mac, called ``Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow.'' This \nsong \n [[Page S2222]] represented a kind of theme for the campaign--change, \nhope, ``don't stop thinking about tomorrow''; tomorrow is coming, think \nabout it, it is important.\n  Yet, if you actually thought about that song and you thought about \nwhat has been happening in the country, it is clear that we have not \nbeen thinking about tomorrow and we have not been thinking about \ntomorrow for a long time.\n  Every speaker needs a text, or theme, for his or her statements. I \nwould like to take as the text for my remarks today one of Aesop's \nfables. It is an old fable. All of us knew it when we were children. \nThis is about the grasshopper and the ant. The fable goes like this:\n  It was wintertime. The ants' stored grain had gotten wet and they \nwere laying it out to dry. Along came a hungry grasshopper and asked \nthem to give him something to eat. One of the ants said, ``Why didn't \nyou gather food in the summer like us?'' The grasshopper replied, ``I \ndidn't have any time. I was busy making sweet music.'' The ants laughed \nand said, ``Very well, then, since you piped in the summer, now dance \nin the winter.''\n  The moral of the story: In everything, beware of negligence if you \nwant to escape distress and danger.\n  Now, that is the Aesop fable. It is a pretty clear message: If you do \nnot work in the summer and put the food away, you are not going to have \nthe food in the winter.\n  And I think that it basically is saying that not thinking about \ntomorrow means being negligent, acting like the grasshopper instead of \nthe ant. Too many of us, I think, have been grasshoppers for too long, \nnot thinking about tomorrow.\n  Let me just give you a couple of examples. Let us just think about \nurban America. Each year it gets poorer, more violent, more populated \nwith families in distress. If we stopped to think about this reality, \nthe reality that is there, we would be compelled to act because of the \nmorality. If you are your brother's keeper, you have to walk your talk. \nBecause of self-interest, I mean, we are never going to compete and our \nliving standards will be lower with a larger and larger unskilled \npopulation on our collective backs.\n  And as for world leadership, how are we going to lead the world by \nthe power of our example after the events that occurred in Los Angeles \na couple years ago which popped across television screens from Tokyo to \nLondon? Or where 40 percent of the people in America who wanted to vote \nwere denied this basic right because they were not registered.\n  Clearly, on this issue, Mr. President, we have not been thinking \nabout tomorrow. If we were thinking about tomorrow, we would see the \nhuman and national tragedy that is building in our cities and we would \nact to change those conditions. But we have not.\n  Like the grasshopper, we have been playing our sweet music in the \nsuburbs, while things have just gotten worse in the cities.\n  Then, Mr. President, there is the plight of our children. Not just \npoor children, but all children. How can we say that we are thinking \nabout tomorrow but continue to neglect our children?\n  In 1975, one-third of married couples with children had both spouses \nworking. By 1993, that percentage had doubled, as nearly two-thirds of \nall married couples with children had both spouses working. It is no \nmystery as to why that is the case. Without the second paycheck, many \nfamilies just would not make it. Yet with it, their children are often \nalone and without supervision from an early age.\n  Parents in this Chamber and in this institution know the pressures. \nCertainly I know the pressures. Certainly the distinguished Member from \nVermont in the Chair knows the pressure. Certainly the staff knows the \npressure. Certainly those who are listening know the pressures. If \nparents are lucky, they have a loving relative living in the \nneighborhood who can help take care of the children. If you are upper \nincome, you can hire somebody to provide full-time care. If you do not \nhave a relative in the neighborhood or you do not have enough money, \nthen it becomes a little more difficult.\n  There are only a few possible answers to this. For a spouse of either \ngender to have the option of staying at home, the salary of the spouse \nthat continues to work outside of the home has to be a lot higher than \nit is now, or companies are going to have to give family leave that is \nmeasured not just in weeks but in years, or everyone will have to pay \nmore taxes so Government can subsidize day care at the company, union, \nneighborhood center, the church, the synagogue or the mosque.\n  Those seem to me to be the options. The only given, the only \nimperative, is that someone has got to provide loving care for our \nNation's children. Too often, this does not happen. We have not given \nchild care a priority. Like the grasshopper, we have been dancing \ntoward winter. Not facing the reality that is staring everyone in the \nface. We have not been thinking about tomorrow.\n  So, Mr. President, there is urban America, the plight of our \nchildren, but by far, probably the best obvious example of our failure \nto think about tomorrow is the enormous debt that we have amassed over \nthe last 12-14 years. It is not only public debt. Between 1980 and 1987 \nconsumer credit increased 90 percent. People under economic stress did \nnot consume less, they borrowed and consumed more. And they borrowed \nand in some cases to speculate. However, in 1989, 1990, 1991, the \nbubble burst and it was over. People cut back, businesses started to \npay debt down and, gradually, the private sector began to come back.\n  Here in Washington the bubble has never burst. It just keeps getting \nbigger and bigger. The national debt went from about $800 billion in \n1980 to about $4.5 trillion by the end of 1994. Over the next 5 years, \nunless we change our ways, the debt will exceed $5.5 trillion. Over 58 \npercent of all personal and corporate savings go to finance the \ninterest on this debt.\n  It is as though in 1980 you owed about $10,000 on the credit card and \nnow you owe $43,000 and the interest you have to pay is money that you \ndo not have to spend on your kids' college education, to buy a house, \nto buy a car, to put an addition into your factory and hire more \nworkers. People do not have the money and they cannot borrow it because \nit is being sucked up by the Government to pay interest on the debt.\n  In other words, Mr. President, we have placed the burden of our \nirresponsibility on the backs of our children. Someone once said \ndemocracies are pretty good dealing with today's problems, but \nsometimes they are not very good thinking about tomorrow. By amassing \nthis debt and passing this burden onto our children, I believe we have \nshown that we are not very good thinking about tomorrow.\n  So, Mr. President, this brings us to the question, ``What do we \nactually do about this debt?'' I will not talk about remedies for urban \nAmerica or child care. This is a balanced budget amendment debate, a \ndebate about Federal spending. Therefore, today I would like to focus \nthe rest of my remarks on the Federal budget and what do we can do \nabout this debt. I would also like to point out how facing reality \nmeans actually facing the numbers in this budget.\n  First, Mr. President, we will take the analogy that we often hear--\nthat is, the family household. Every family manages its income and the \nFederal Government has things way out of whack. A giant deficit--that \ndoes not happen in a family, at least not for very long. However, \nbefore we begin with this analogy, we need to think about what a budget \nis. A budget is not a snapshot of what happened yesterday. It is a \nguess about what is going to happen in the future. It is not a picture \nof what happened last year with respect to spending or taxes, it is a \nguess about what will happen in the future on spending and taxes.\n  We will take it to the household level. You sit around the kitchen \ntable, trying to figure out what will your budget be for the coming \nyear. What is the first thing you do? You figure out what is your \nincome likely to be. Some basic questions come up. Are you going to \nwork? Am I going to work? Is he going to work? How many people in the \nhousehold are going to work? How many incomes are we going to count? Do \nwe count the husband and the wife? How about the teenage son? Is that \nthe family income? Do we count the husband, the wife, and the wife's \nolder sister who is living with the family? Is \n [[Page S2223]] that counted as income? What is the income? That is \nfairly central to devising a budget. What is the income that we can \ncount on?\n  Second, there is the issue of growth. Well, do you anticipate, will \nthere be bonuses in the year? Will you work overtime? Will you get a \nraise? Will the company, because it is doing well, give you a 15 \npercent increase? All of these would provide more income. Each family \nhas to figure these out in an effort to decide what is likely to \nhappen. Each family also has to figure out where are prices going. What \ncan we afford? What should we spend our income on? Last year you might \nhave spent x on food; what will it be this year? What will the price of \nfood be? If there is inflation, if there is a crisis in the coffee \nmarket and you have to buy coffee and it goes up three times from the \ncost of last year, suddenly you have to deal with inflation. It \nincreases prices. It also has the effect of increasing taxes, often. It \npushes you into a higher bracket. Less so at the Federal level, but \nmore so at the State level.\n  Then there is interest. How do you calculate your interest \nexpenditure? You could say well, I have a variable rate mortgage. I got \nthat variable rate mortgage at 9 percent and during the last couple of \nyears interest rates had been going down. Interest rates were down \naround 7 percent. However, in laying out a budget, each family has to \nthink about how much it will pay next year. Maybe interest rates will \ngo back up. If the Federal Reserve continues on its current path, \nclearly the interest rates will go back up and that means more pressure \non the family budget. With a variable rate mortgage, the family will \nhave to pay more in interest charges to pay back the bank.\n  So every family, Mr. President, when it makes a set of budget \ndecisions, has to figure out what is the income coming in, and what it \nis going to spend money on. The income depends on how many people are \nworking and depends on whether you think times are good or times are \nbad. Will you get a raise? Are interest rates going up? What is the \ninflation rate going to be? How much can I actually spend? How much can \nI actually buy? These are factors in any kind of household decision.\n  Mr. President, these types of factors apply equally to the Federal \nbudget. Let us assume that you miscalculated on your variable rate \nmortgage and you have to pay 1 percent more in interest because the \nrates have gone back up. Well, if you are the Federal Government and \nyou miscalculate your interest on your projected budget, you add $20 \nbillion to the deficit that year alone.\n  If a family is counting on the income of one of its members, that \nfamily will have a big problem if that family member loses his or her \njob. Similarly, in the country as a whole, if a number of people \nunexpectedly lose their jobs, we will have a big problem: a much bigger \ndeficit. Just a 1-percent increase in unemployment, adds $60 billion to \nthe Federal deficit.\n  What about growth? Let us assume that our economy grows 1 percent \nless than we predicted. This small change in the assumptions adds $32 \nbillion to the deficit. These are aspects of budget policy that change \nin the course of a year. If unemployment is higher, that costs the \nGovernment more. If inflation is higher, that costs the Government \nmore. If interest rates are higher, that costs the Government more. If \ngrowth is lower, fewer people have a chance to work, less money is \nearned, and the Government receives less revenue and pays more in \nbenefits. All of this adds to the deficit.\n  So let us begin this by simply laying these points out that when you \ndo a budget, you are basically making a projection and the projection \nis affected by things that are out of your control in your household. \nFor example, there are plenty of people in this Congress who know the \nFederal Reserve's efforts to raise interest rates are out of our \ncontrol. These things, over time, will have an impact on your family's \nbudget, just as they have a dramatic effect on the Federal budget.\n  Let us discuss for a few moments what is the Federal budget. What I \nwant to do today is to lay out clearly what is the Federal budget. What \ndo we spend taxpayer's money on, and where do we get these funds. Every \nyear we debate a budget resolution, 50 hours equally divided. Our \ncolleagues get up, read their opening statements, and a couple hours \nare already gone already. As a result, despite the debates, I am not \nsure that the American public gets an opportunity to fully understand \nwhat is in the Federal budget. If we are going to consider balancing \nthe budget, I think the American public should know what is in the \nbudget. They are entitled to know what things are likely to be cut or \nwhat taxes will be increased. You cannot decide what things will be cut \nor what taxes will be increased until you know what is in the budget \nand how the Government raises the money to pay for its spending.\n  So let us go with the basic point, a very basic point. The \nexpenditures of the Federal Government in 1994 were roughly $1.5 \ntrillion. The revenue, the total of all taxes that have been collected, \nare $1.3 trillion. Because the $1.3 trillion in revenue was less than \nwhat was spent, we ended up with a deficit, an annual deficit, of $200 \nbillion.\n  It would be important to know what are the taxes? Where does the \nFederal Government get its $1.3 trillion? Who pays the $1.3 trillion? \nTaxes are broken down into the following categories:\n  The individual income tax is, in total, 43 percent of all revenues, \nand it raised $545 billion in 1994. Now remember, we spent $1.5 \ntrillion. The individual income tax raises $545 billion.\n  The next largest set of taxes is what are called social insurance \ntaxes. Those are the Social Security taxes, the FICA tax, and \nunemployment insurance collections. Of the $460 billion that was raised \nwith social insurance taxes, $430 billion of that was the Social \nSecurity FICA tax. Everybody has it deducted from their wage statement \neach pay period. The total of that is $430 billion. Unemployment \ninsurance taxes made up the remaining $30 billion.\n  So you have individual taxes, social insurance taxes, and corporate \ntaxes. Corporate taxes raise $140 billion a year. All of the \ncorporations in America pay in total $140 billion a year.\n  And then you have a category called other, which totaled $60 billion. \nThat consists of essentially estate taxes. You die, you pass on your \nestate, you pay a tax on that; customs duties, you import something \ninto the United States, you pay a tariff or a duty. Those taxes equal \n$60 billion.\n  And then finally, the smallest amount of total taxes are the excise \ntaxes, like the gasoline tax and the cigarette tax, which raise \napproximately $55 billion.\n  So in total, the U.S. Government raised $1.3 trillion in 1994 --$545 \nbillion come from the individual income tax; $460 billion come from the \nSocial Security and unemployment insurance taxes; $140 billion from all \nof the corporations in America; $60 billion come from estate and gift \ntaxes; and $55 billion come from the gasoline tax, cigarette tax, and \nother excise taxes.\n  So that is it, that is where the money comes from. That is the money \nthat the Federal Government has to spend from taxpayers. Total: $1.3 \nbillion.\n  Now the question is, What do we spend this money on? Well, first, I \nwould like to give you a quick overview, and then I will provide a more \ndetailed explanation.\n  Broadly speaking, there are three big categories of Federal \nexpenditures.\n  In total, the expenditures are $1.5 trillion. One of the three main \ntypes of Government spending is on what are called mandatory \nexpenditures. Mandatory expenditures are really expenditures for which \nCongress does not appropriate a specific amount of money every year. \nInstead, we write into the law certain eligibility rules and benefit \nlevels. For example, if you are over 65 and have made certain minimum \npayments into the system, you are entitled to Social Security benefits. \nIf you are poor, you may qualify for certain benefits to help you meet \na minimum income level. Or, if you are a veteran, you may be entitled \nto other benefits. These are mandatory expenditures that automatically \nflow to eligible recipients. The total amount of mandatory expenditures \nis $790 billion. In other words, nearly half of the Federal budget is \nfor mandatory expenditures.\n  Next are the discretionary expenditures. These total about $545 \nbillion. This amount includes spending on things such as national \ndefense, education, housing, transportation--$545 billion. These are \ndiscretionary expenditures, meaning that Congress, if \n [[Page S2224]] it wants to, every year can change that amount. It does \nnot have to appropriate that amount of money, unlike a mandatory \nspending which occurs almost automatically. A discretionary expenditure \nis the Federal Government deciding whether it wants to spend a \nspecified amount each year on national defense or education.\n  The third category after mandatory and discretionary spending is \ninterest--interest on the national debt. Last year, we paid roughly \n$205 billion in interest on the national debt. As the debt has grown--\nespecially since 1980--the more we have paid in interest, because the \nmore you have to borrow, the more people you have to pay interest to \nthose who have loaned you, the Government, money.\n  Now, an interesting caveat about interest is that when the Government \ncollects all of those taxes, the first call on these funds, the first \nplace that money has to be spent is not defending the Nation or feeding \nchildren or providing for education or building highways or sending \nmoney to Social Security recipients. The first place that money has to \nbe spent is to pay those bondholders who have loaned us money. So right \noff the top, $205 billion goes to people in this country--and others--\nwho buy Government debt, people who have enough money to buy Government \nsecurities, Treasury bills, Treasury bonds, people who are not spending \nall of their money every year just to get by, but rather people who \nhave enough money to buy Government bonds. The more we have to pay in \ninterest, the more that interest flows to those bondholders.\n  So in terms of total expenditures, you have $790 billion in mandatory \nspending, $540 billion in discretionary spending, and $205 billion in \ninterest payments.\n  Mr. President, this is a rough overview of the Federal budget: where \nthe revenues come from and where they go. What I would like to do on \nthe spending side--because we are discussing a balanced budget \namendment, and the American public should know how this budget is going \nto be balanced--is to take a closer look at Federal spending so that we \ncan determine what Federal spending must be cut in order to balance the \nbudget.\n  First, let us look again at the mandatory spending programs, again \nabout half of all Federal spending. These funds go to eligible \nrecipients at preset benefit levels--at a total of $790 billion worth \nof benefits.\n  Well, what is this $790 billion spent on? First, we need to make one \ndistinction on the mandatory programs. Some mandatory spending programs \nflow to everybody who is eligible. Others flow only to those who have \nlower income; in other words, means tested and non-means tested. Take \nthe biggest mandatory program, Social Security. Social Security is not \nmeans tested. Everybody in America who meets certain age and \ncontribution requirements, gets Social Security. If you are a \nmillionaire and you worked 30 years and paid into Social Security, you \nreceive these benefits, just as the guy that worked in the GM plant in \nDetroit or in the neighborhood drugstore who paid Social Security for \n30 years. In fact, these folks all probably get the same amount. It is \nnot a means tested program.\n  The next largest mandatory program, Medicare, is the same thing. If \nyou are over 65, you are eligible for Medicare. The Federal Government \nwill pay your health costs under the provisions and rules of the \nsystem. If you are a multimillionaire and you check into a hospital and \nyou stay several days and you have a hospital bill of $10,000, send it \nto Medicare. It is a non-means-tested program. This means that a \nmillionaire gets the same amount of money as somebody, a husband or \nwife, who worked for 30 years, gets sick, goes to the hospital, and \nneeds that same $10,000 treatment.\n  Then there are other mandatory programs. You take $25 billion in \nunemployment benefits. If you are unemployed in the United States, you \nare eligible for unemployment compensation. We have had that in place \nfor 50 years or more. It is one of the things we learned from the Great \nDepression. Because we have an automatic stabilizer, we are less likely \nto have as deep of a recession. We are all better off if we have an \nautomatic stabilizer, this one being unemployment compensation, because \nthe economy then will not go down so far. People will at least have \nenough money to buy some food or begin to keep themselves until they \nget another job.\n  We also spend $70 billion automatically each year for the civilian \nand military pension and disability systems. Every member of the \nmilitary, every member of the Federal Government who has a retirement \nplan pays into that plan, and that plan then pays benefits. Last year, \nthose benefits were $70 billion.\n  Then there is Medicaid. Medicaid is a means-tested program. This \nmeans that if you are dirt poor in America and you get sick and you go \nto the hospital, somebody is going to take care of you. And because \nsomebody takes care of you, somebody has to pay, and the Federal \nGovernment will chip in its share if the State agrees to pick up some \npart of the cost as well. But it is a mandatory spending program based \non income, and it accounts for roughly $80 billion in annual spending.\n  Now, in this category of other mandatory spending are such things as \nfood stamps--again, means tested. If you are poor, you are eligible for \nthis type of assistance. This is $25 billion.\n  Supplemental security income, again, goes to the poorest, \noverwhelmingly elderly, overwhelmingly female population, who just \ncannot get by without some assistance. In addition, there is child \nnutrition which totals about $7 billion.\n  So the mandatory portion of the Federal budget is the amount of money \nthat flows simply because of certain eligibility criteria--you are over \n65 and eligible for Social Security, you are over 65 and eligible for \nMedicare.\n  Thus, $460 billion of mandatory expenditures, nearly one-third of the \nwhole budget, goes to people over 65 who have paid into the Social \nSecurity and Medicare systems throughout their lifetimes. You are \neligible, regardless of income, if you have paid into the system. The \nother areas of mandatory spending are Medicaid, food stamps, \nsupplemental security income, retirement, and unemployment benefits.\n  So when we talk about cutting the Federal budget and we decide that \nwe are not going to touch any entitlements--meaning the mandatory \nspending--we have to realize that this leaves a much smaller portion of \nthe budget and this remaining portion will have to cut a lot more to \nbalance the budget. But to cut those mandatory expenditures, we would \nhave to change the eligibility rules and we would have to change the \nbenefit levels. We could say that you have to be poorer to get food \nstamps or Medicaid, or we could say that you have to pay more, if you \nare above a certain income level, for Medicare. But we would be \nchanging the rules. That is the way that entitlements would be cut.\n  Mr. President, let us look for a moment at the next biggest chunk of \nFederal expenditures. First, we have mandatory expenditures. Now we \nhave approximately $545 billion of discretionary expenditures. This is \nthe money that the appropriations committees appropriate every year. \nThe tax dollars come in. The appropriations committees meet, and they \ndecide that this program or that program merits funding. What do the \nappropriations committees spend $545 billion on? Overwhelmingly, the \nmoney in discretionary programs is spent on the national defense. It is \n$280 billion a year out of the total of $545 billion which is spent on \ndiscretionary programs.\n  What are the other big discretionary expenditures in addition to \nnational defense? You have $40 billion for education, training and \nsocial services. This includes education for the handicapped--it used \nto be that if you had a child that was autistic, the child had no \nchance of getting into any school anywhere, and had no chance of going \nto the public school. Now because of a Federal program for handicapped \neducation, we are able to challenge that child and develop that child's \npotential.\n  In addition, there is transportation spending, primarily for mass \ntransit, highways, and airports. There is spending for income security \nwhich is essentially housing assistance.\n  There is also spending to support Government activities which cost \n$30 billion. This amount is basically what it costs to run the Federal \nGovernment. Of this $30 billion, the Congress \n [[Page S2225]] accounts for $2.5 billion. The other Government \nactivities include running the Department of the Interior, the Park \nSystem, the FBI, keeping guards in our prisons, and making sure that \nthe IRS collects taxes. Some people do not like that. But spending for \nthese, and other, Government activities represents what it costs to run \nthe Federal Government, $30 billion out of $1.5 trillion.\n  In addition to all of this is foreign aid. Foreign aid--for both \nhumanitarian and security assistance--represents $20 billion out of \n$1.5 trillion.\n  So discretionary spending is divided among defense, education, \ntraining, social services, transportation, income security, Government \nactivities, foreign aid, and other domestic non-defense programs.\n  Mr. President, there is a point that should be made on discretionary \nspending. I have implied that discretionary spending is whatever the \nappropriations want to spend money on. That is true. Yet, since 1991 \nthis spending has been capped. We have said by law that the Congress \nand the Government cannot spend above a certain amount. It has been \ncapped. As we discussed earlier, inflation is not capped. Inflation \ncontinues to eat away at the purchasing power of American families, and \nit continues to eat away at the purchasing power of Government.\n  So when you cap spending programs, all $545 billion in discretionary \nspending, that means it will buy less. Essentially the caps on \ndiscretionary spending shrink in real terms what this will buy, by \nabout 9 percent between now and 1998.\n  There are no caps on mandatory spending; no caps at all. How could \nthere be? You do not know how many people are going to be unemployed. \nYou do not know how many people are going to be poor. You do not know \nhow many people are going to qualify for the mandatory spending \nprograms. However, for those things that the Congress and the \nGovernment have direct control over, there has been a cap since 1991. \nYou can argue the caps should be lower. But there has been a cap.\n  With the next chart I would like to demonstrate how Federal spending \nhas changed over the years. Back in 1963, a long time ago, \ndiscretionary spending represented 70 percent of what the Federal \nGovernment spent.\n Entitlements--the so-called mandatory expenditures, such as Social \nSecurity--represented 22 percent. Net interest represented 6 percent. \nIn 1965 we added in Medicare and Medicaid, and in 1972, we indexed \nSocial Security. In 1973, discretionary gets a little smaller, \nentitlements get a little bigger. In 1983, entitlements have grown to \n45 percent of the budget and discretionary has dropped. But 1983 was, \nof course, 2 years after the Reagan defense buildup and tax cut and the \nstart of gigantic deficits. So interest rates and the amount we spent \non interest are higher.\n\n  In 1993, suddenly entitlements are up to 47 percent. Discretionary \nexpenditures are down to 39 percent. It is projected that if current \nlaw continues, by 2003 mandatory spending--those things we talked about \nearlier, such as Social Security, Medicare, income security--will eat \nup almost 60 percent of the budget, and interest will be almost 14 \npercent. And all of the rest of the money that the Government spends, \nsuch as for transportation, education, and defense, will be 28 percent \nof the budget.\n  So, Mr. President, what clearly we see is that over the years those \nmandatory portions of spending have increased dramatically. So \ndramatically that, by 2003, interest payments on the debt will equal \nalmost half of all discretionary spending.\n  Mr. President, I think that it is important here to talk about \nanother kind of spending, and that is essentially what I call off-\nbudget spending through the Tax Code. You have $1.5 billion of Federal \nexpenditures. We talked about that already. And we raise $1.3 billion \nthrough all taxes. If you recall, we raise $545 billion from the \nindividual income tax. But, of course, the income tax does not apply to \neverybody in the same way. You would think that under an income tax \nsystem the same rules and rates would and apply to everybody. No, no, \nno, not the case.\n  Over the last several years, much to my own distress, we have \nreturned to aggressive spending through the Tax Code, meaning we tell \npeople that if they simply do this activity, they will pay less in \ntaxes. Some of these activities that we tell people will lower their \ntaxes have been long established in the Tax Code. If you buy a house \nand pay mortgage interest, that interest is deductible, so you pay less \ntaxes because you have mortgage interest. If your employer pays health \ninsurance premiums for you, those premiums are not included in your \ntaxable income. If you have a pension plan that builds up, or \ninvestment income building up, you do not pay taxes on those. If you \npay State and local taxes, like property taxes and State income taxes, \nyou deduct those and you do not pay Federal taxes on them. The more \ntaxes you pay, or the bigger your pension plan is, or the more generous \nyour employer-paid health benefits are, or the bigger your mortgage \ninterest is, the less you pay in taxes.\n  Those are some of the well-known, biggest tax expenditures. And then \nthere are, of course, the little special ones that are not used by the \nvast majority of Americans. These are not in the Tax Code because of a \nparticular public policy reason--whether flawed or not--but because a \nlobbyist had a way to insert into a tax bill a special exclusion for a \nparticular category of people. For example, I do not know how many \npeople in America know that if you rent your home for 2 weeks a year, \nyou do not pay any income tax on that income. That is a special \nexclusion. It costs $50 million a year in foregone income. How did that \nhappen? Well, the story goes that a guy who had a big house close to \nthe Masters Golf Tournament also had a friend on the Finance Committee. \nDuring one of those late night sessions, the friend slipped in an \namendment to a bill which said if you rent your house for 2 weeks a \nyear, you do not pay any income tax on that income. This is not going \nto help me and probably will not help a lot of other people, if they \nare living in your house. But if you have a big house next to a big \ninternational event, you might make a little money.\n  How about the $12 million a year that we use to essentially subsidize \nthe production of some of the most toxic chemicals and minerals in the \nworld? On the one hand, you have the Federal Government telling people \nto take asbestos out of the schools and workplaces. We have ads on \ntelevision about lead contamination telling how it makes our children's \nintelligence lower than it otherwise should be. Meanwhile, you have the \nTax Code telling people that if you mine asbestos or if you mine lead, \nyou pay less tax.\n  Mr. President, the point is that $545 billion is raised from personal \nincome taxes. But that Tax Code that sets rates is riddled by \nexceptions to those rates. And because of all those exceptions, the \npeople who use those exceptions end up paying less tax and the rest of \nus end up paying a higher rate of tax than we otherwise would have to \npay. And the question is raised, since this is a balanced budget \namendment debate, how much would revenues be if we did not have any of \nthose loopholes? We have had a little debate about a flat tax led by \nCongressman Armey on the other side. If we did not have any of those \nloopholes, how much more money would the Federal Government raise? The \nanswer is $455 billion a year. In 1986, we trimmed this amount back \ndramatically. Since then, it has exploded. It is one of the fastest \ngrowing Government programs and accounts for $455 billion a year in tax \nexpenditures.\n  So, Mr. President, you can see if you had a deficit of $176 billion--\nas is projected for 1995--if you simply trimmed a third off of the tax \nexpenditures, you could eliminate the entire budget deficit. Earlier we \ntalked about mandatory spending, discretionary spending, and interest \non the debt. Now, we have seen that we also spend off budget through \nthe Tax Code.\n  Mr. President, if I could, I think that it helps to get a picture of \nhow these deficits have changed over time. I have interns who come into \nmy office thinking that the deficit is a little like oxygen. They would \nnot know how to exist if the deficit did not exist. It has been there \ntheir whole lives.\n  People say that the Federal Government has always run a deficit. Are \npoliticians not always spending more money than they have? Are we not \nalways living beyond our means as a \n [[Page S2226]] Government? Well, the answer to that question is \nabsolutely not. In the 1940's and 50's, Harry Truman had a few \nsurpluses. Dwight Eisenhower had surpluses in a couple of years. In \nfact, Lyndon Johnson had a surplus in 1969. As hard as that is to \nbelieve, they collected more than they spent. No depressions occurred \nin the late 1940's and early 1950's. No depressions occurred in the \nmid-1950's. In the early 1960's when we had a tremendous economic boom, \nthe deficit was minuscule, and the debt was minuscule, and policymakers \nwere thinking about tomorrow.\n  But the story changes in 1980. And we all know that story--defunded \nGovernment, dramatic tax cuts. A lot of the hotels in this town were \nbuilt after 1980 because the Federal Government said in that tax bill, \n``If you build this hotel for $20 million, you can write $1.5 million \noff a year of income taxes.'' We gave depreciation in 15 years on \nstructures that were going to last 30 and 40 years. So a lot of \nlobbyists decided they would become hotel investors and pay no tax.\n  We also were going to trade tax benefits from one corporation to \nanother corporation. We also gave dramatic individual income tax cuts, \n30 percent across the board, and defunded Government.\n  At the same time, we began a massive defense buildup--not to say we \nshould not spend more on defense--but unlike Lyndon Johnson in the \n1960's, Ronald Reagan in the 1980's did not finance his defense \nbuildup. And as a result of these facts--a dramatic decrease in tax \nrevenues, a dramatic increase in defense expenditures, and a continued \ngrowth of mandatory spending--the deficit took a dramatic turn for the \nworse.\n  In the 1940's, 1950's, and 1960's, not much of a deficit; there was \neven a surplus in some years. But then what happened in the 1980's? \nWell, you can see what happened. Here is the passage of the tax bill, \naround August 1981. See what happens to the deficit? It starts going up \nand up, and soon becomes over $200 billion. It only took a couple of \nyears for the national deficit to grow larger than the whole debt of \nthe country in the previous 15 to 20 years.\n  The deficit then dropped a little in 1984, came back up in 1985 and \n1986, and then dropped significantly for 1987 and 1988 due to cosmetic \nand process changes such as the Gramm-Rudman Act, which arguably kept \nthings under control for a short while. But the deficit then exploded \nagain after 1989, and kept rising until 1992. As a result, from 1980 to \n1992, the national debt of this country grew from $800 billion to $4.3 \ntrillion. Is that thinking about tomorrow? Hardly.\n  Since 1992, what has happened? Because of the 1993 deficit reduction \npackage, the national deficit has dropped dramatically.\n  My point here is simply that these deficits have not always been a \npart of our history. They are a part of bad public policy, and they \nhave placed a gigantic burden on the backs of our children. And if we \ndo not face up to this burden all of our tomorrows will be darker than \nthey otherwise would have to be.\n  And it is also important to note that these deficit figures actually \nmask the seriousness of the problem. This is because we have been using \nthe surpluses that are accumulating in our trust funds to hide the true \nsize of the deficit in the rest of the budget. Because of changes we \nmade to Social Security in the mid-1980's, this program now raises more \nfunds than it pays out. Prior to 1983, Social Security was a pay-as-\nyou-go program. Money would come in, stay a few months, and immediately \nbe paid out to eligible recipients. But in 1983, we changed the program \nso that it would start accumulating surpluses, so we could supposedly \nguarantee that there would be enough money there for my generation when \nwe retired. But right now we are actually spending these surpluses, by \nborrowing them to pay for deficits in other parts of the Federal \nbudget. And, Mr. President, if action is not taken to stop this \npractice, the Federal Government will borrow an additional $636 billion \nfrom the Social Security trust fund between 1996 and 2002. So let us be \ncandid about that.\n  So, once again, Mr. President, here is the history of our national \ndebt. The situation was pretty good during the late 1940's and 1950's, \nwith surpluses under both Truman and Eisenhower. Under Kennedy and \nJohnson we had solid fiscal policy. Under Nixon, Social Security was \nindexed and high inflation began. This inflation accelerated throughout \nthe decade, and was accompanied by oil shock repercussions, but the \ndeficit still remained relatively under control, with the national debt \nless than $1 trillion. But the 1980's heralded the sudden arrival of \ntax cuts, increased defense expenditures, and out-of-control mandatory \nspending, which have led to today's debt of nearly $5 trillion.\n  Mr. President, that is a cautionary tale. What would the ant say to \nthe grasshopper if at this point the grasshopper said, ``Let me come in \nfrom the cold into the house that you prepared, because you were not \nspending beyond your means''? The ant would say, ``Play your sweet \nmusic in the summer, dance in the winter. You're on your own.'' \nUnfortunately, this is the position we all find ourselves in as a \nresult of this profligate activity.\n  Mr. President, how do we make this situation real to people? How do \nwe get them to understand? It is such a complicated issue. People do \nnot want to think it through. They want to sound bite it. They want to \nhave a quick answer. They want to believe if they vote for the balanced \nbudget amendment they do not have to make any of these tough choices \nabout cutting spending.\n  Mr. President, that is the furthest thing from the truth.\n  Think of it this way: If the average taxpayer's share of Federal \nspending and revenues were arranged in the form of a credit card \nstatement, it would look something like this table entitled ``Uncle Sam \nSays Charge It.''\n  Mr. President, the first line shows the balance due. Take the \nnational debt, divide it by all the taxpayers in the United States, and \nthe result is that every taxpayer in this country had a debt of $37,838 \nat the start of this year. Each one of us. That is just to get to where \nwe are right now. Each one of us has to pay that debt. And it is \ngetting larger all the time. So the first line shows the outstanding \nbalance. As you can see, at the start of 1994, it was $37,838.\n  But what about Government spending during 1994? Well, we ran a big \ndeficit again, about $200 billion, in that year. How did that break \ndown for each citizen of the United States? Well, each citizen is \nspending about $4,000 per person on Social Security; about $2,400 for \nnational defense; about $1,900 for income security and welfare; about \n$926 for health; about $389 for education, training, and employment \nprograms; $313 for agriculture and natural resources; $320 for \ntransportation; and $133 for the administration of justice.\n  Now, that comes to a total of about $2,273.\n  What about the money that we have taken in, per person? Well, \naverage, this totaled about $4,700 in income taxes, $3,700 in Social \nSecurity taxes, and about $2,484 in other forms of payments to the \nGovernment, such as customs, estate taxes, and excise taxes. This comes \nto a total of $10,932 for each taxpayer. Compare this to total spending \nper taxpayer of $12,700. The result is $1,765 added to the credit card \nbill of every taxpayer--and remember that this is added on top of the \n$37,838 that every taxpayer owes from previous years.\n  Now, Mr. President, what happens in this kind of situation? We cannot \ncontinue down this path. Something has to give. About 3 years ago, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from New \nMexico, and I asked the General Accounting Office to tell us what would \nhappen if we do nothing about this deficit situation. They came back \nwith a report that said if we do nothing, every one of our income will \nbe 40 percent less than it otherwise would be by the year 2020--40 \npercent less.\n  That is understandable, given all the money which must be sucked in \nfrom the economy just to pay interest to bondholders, in order to keep \nfinancing our $5 trillion in national debt. None of that money is \navailable to create jobs, pay raises, buy cars, or purchase homes.\n  Things have changed since that GAO report. If we recall the last \ngraph, the deficit came down in 1993. We took action in 1993, passing \nthe biggest deficit \n [[Page S2227]] reduction package in history. But there is still an \nawful lot to do.\n  So, Mr. President, having discussed what is in the federal budget, we \nnow come to the more difficult part. We clearly need to reduce the \ndeficit, but the question is, What are we going to do to cut spending? \nLet us start by asking how much spending cuts will be needed in order \nto balance the budget. If we do not implement the tax cuts that are \nincluded in the Contract With America, we would need to cut on average \n$922 for every resident of my State. If the contract tax cuts are \nenacted, then this number rises to about $1,265.\n  What does this mean? These are vague numbers. All the budget debates \neventually turn into numbers, and people turn them off. What is the \nreal impact of cutting $922 or $1,265 per person in New Jersey, and of \nmaking similar cuts in other States? What does this mean in terms of \nthe Federal spending that we have talked about?\n  Given our current fiscal policies, balancing the budget would require \na 13-percent cut in every spending program--13 percent. The question \nis, Are we willing to tolerate cuts in every one of those programs? Are \nwe willing to take a 13-percent cut in Social Security? Are we willing \nto take a 13-percent cut in the national defense? Of course, we cannot \ntake a 13-percent cut on interest. The bondholders get paid, \nregardless.\n  However, if Social Security is off the table, and everybody in this \nChamber has given speeches that have resonated across America promising \nthat there will be no cuts at all in Social Security, then the size of \ncuts needed in all other programs goes up to 18 percent. Take Social \nSecurity off the table, and everything else is cut 18 percent. \nMedicare, defense, grants to State and localities, and all other \nspending--18 percent.\n  Let us carry this a little further. I know no one in here wants to \nmake the United States vulnerable, even in the post-cold-war world. So \nin addition to taking Social Security off the table let us take defense \noff also. And remember that interest is automatically off the table \nbecause we have to pay the bondholders. If we say that there are to be \nno cuts in any of these three areas, then the remaining programs are \nsubject to across-the-board cuts of 22 percent. And if the tax cuts \noutlined in the Contract With America are implemented, then the level \nof cuts needed to balance the budget rises to 30 percent. That would be \na 30 percent cut in all non-Social Security entitlements, including \nMedicare, and in every other existing program except Social Security \nand defense. That would mean a 30-percent cut in grants to state and \nlocal governments. It would require that we cut areas such as \ninvestment in infrastructure and unemployment compensation by 30 \npercent.\n  Now, Mr. President, it is not really likely we will cut 30 percent of \nthe FBI or 30 percent of the Immigration Service or 30 percent of the \nInternal Revenue Service or 30 percent of Federal prisons or 30 percent \nof military pensions or 30 percent of veterans programs. To be honest, \nwe will take certain things off the table in the same way that Social \nSecurity and defense will be off the table. We will have to take these \nother programs off the table as well.\n  As a result, the cuts in the other programs are going to be even \ndeeper. This means cuts of over 30 percent in Medicare, State and local \ngrants, environmental programs, automatic stabilizers like unemployment \ncompensation, and many other programs. What would cuts of at least 30 \npercent mean to these remaining programs? Well, in 1993, Medicare \npayments to doctors were approximately 40 percent less than private-\nsector payments. Imagine cutting them by at least another 30 percent. \nAnd cutting back on many of the other programs would be penny-wise and \npound-foolish. We could cut back on programs for early childhood but \nend up paying more later for prisons.\n  Mr. President, going to this next table, what if we decided to cut \ngrants to State and local governments? We give them $200 billion a \nyear. The Federal Government gives it right to the States, many of whom \nare advocating the balanced budget amendment. Well, going after those \ngrants for States, what are they for? Highways, airports, and other \nforms of transportation spending total 11 percent, or over $20 billion \nin Federal spending. Then take education, training, employment and \nsocial services, such as the handicapped education program, special \neducation, foster care. These total about $25 billion in Federal \nspending, or 16 percent of grants to State and local governments. Cut \nit. What about income security, welfare, section 8, school breakfast, \nWIC, nutrition, and related programs--these total 24 percent. Cut it. \nMedicaid is 40 percent. Cut it.\n  So say that we cut all these programs that go to States, and in doing \nthis we balance the budget. Then the State has to make the decision: \nDoes it increase taxes, or does it forget about the education programs, \nthe health programs, the housing programs?\n  So, Mr. President, what would significant cuts to States and \nlocalities look like? As I said, grants to States and local governments \ntotaled $200 billion in 1994. In New Jersey, we received about $6 \nbillion in Federal grants. This money funded a significant number of \nprograms. Roughly 40 percent of the Federal funds went to health, 16 \npercent to education, 24 percent to welfare, and 11 percent to fund \ntransportation.\n  On average--this is an important point--on average, Federal grants to \nsupport programs administered by States comprise 25 percent of all \nState revenues--25 percent. Remove those.\n  This is money that Governors have to spend--States get more money \nfrom the Federal Government than they raise with the personal income \ntax, more money than they raise with the general sales tax, more money \nthan they raise with any other kind of taxes. If the Federal Government \neliminated this 25-percent contribution, it would either lead to a \ndramatic increase in State or local taxes or else essentially eliminate \nmany of these programs.\n  I think people have not really focused on what the impact of this \nwill be. I know that people in this body have not focused on impact, \nbut I guarantee you the State legislatures will. In my State of New \nJersey, only about 20 percent of our State budget comes from the \nFederal Government. We have a diverse State, with a broadly based \neconomy and rapid growth. New Jersey is quick to rebound from \nrecessions, heavily export oriented, dramatically changed from \nmanufacturing to services, and it has a very flexible work force with \nvery talented people. The Federal Government gives us 20 percent of our \nState revenues.\n  This percentage is a little different in other places: in Arizona, it \nis 30 percent; in Michigan, 30 percent; in California, 34 percent; and \nin Idaho, 32 percent. This raises a very interesting question. Your \npeople send tax dollars to Washington. They get dollars back from \nWashington, in terms of Federal expenditures.\n  My State has the second-highest income in the country. We pay a lot \nof taxes, because a lot of people with high income pay taxes. We do not \nhave a lot of big defense expenditures in the State. We do not get back \nmuch relative to what we give the Federal Government, but a lot of \nother States do pretty well. For every dollar that New Mexico sends to \nWashington it gets back $1.96; Mississippi gets back $1.63; West \nVirginia gets back $1.45; North Dakota, $1.41; Virginia, $1.38. What do \nthese figures mean? They mean that more Federal dollars are being spent \nin these States than are being sent to Washington from those States.\n  So here we have the West, the site of some of the strongest \nsupporters of the balanced budget amendment. In the West, the Federal \nGovernment still plays as big a role as the Governor plays; for \nexample, in Arizona, 30 percent of State revenues come from the Federal \nbudget; the percentage is 32 percent in Idaho; 34 percent in \nCalifornia. Some of these States are owned by the Federal Government. \nNinety percent of the land in Nevada is owned by the Federal \nGovernment; 1 percent of the land in New York is owned by the Federal \nGovernment. I think 9 percent of the land in Michigan is owned by the \nFederal Government; 90 percent of the land in Nevada is owned by the \nFederal Government.\n  So the point, Mr. President, is that if we are going to cut spending \nand we are going to do it across the board 30 \n [[Page S2228]] percent, then those States that are getting more money \nback from the Federal Government than they are contributing are going \nto be disproportionately cut. It is not only going to be poor people \nwho are going to be affected. So you might want to look at some of the \nother ways to raise revenue.\n  For example, right now we have public lands all over the West. Let us \nsay I want to mine gold. Well, I pay about $500 to $1,000 max. I go in \nand mine the gold, and I do not pay the Government anything, I do not \nowe the Government anything. If we are asking individuals to pay more \nin taxes or we are cutting money to help them send their kids to \ncollege, do you think we might want to ask some of the mining companies \nto pay more if they mine minerals on public lands?\n  So the advocates of the balanced budget amendment have to understand \nthe disproportionate impact that these cuts or additional revenue \nincreases will have on their respective States.\n  So, Mr. President, I think that the analysis makes two points very \nclear, and they are that we have to balance the budget for the sake of \nour children's long-term economic prospects and that doing so is \ninevitably going to be very painful. What looks like a cheap move or an \neasy move here--cutting back that State and local Government transfer--\nwill translate into, in some cases, higher taxes in many States.\n  Finally, as much as it is necessary to reduce the deficit--and it \nwill be a bitter pill for the country--I think that it is absolutely \nessential that we do so. Trying to rush a balanced budget amendment \nthrough the Congress without a thorough discussion of how the budget \nwill be balanced is, in my view, unfair and undemocratic.\n  So a lot of those Western States are probably going to have second \nthoughts when they look at the numbers. Alabama, with about $2.38 on \nevery dollar, is going to look at it and have a second thought. The \namendment will have dramatic effects on the lives of American citizens \nand every one of these citizens has a right to know what these effects \nwill be before their elected representatives are asked to vote on this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I have heard an awful lot of people saying, \nparticularly States: Oh, you ought to balance your Federal budget; we \nwant the balanced budget Federal amendment.\n  And yet, Mr. President, Governors do not have to balance their \nbudgets in the way we have to balance our budget here in Washington. \nGovernors have the right to, and in many cases do, have capital \nbudgets, which means that instead of raising taxes and spending money, \nthey simply borrow from these bondholders that we are borrowing from to \ncreate a Federal deficit, except when they borrow, it does not count in \ntheir State because they have a capital budget. I do not know about all \nStates, but if you look in total, public indebtedness has dramatically \nincreased at the State level.\n  So, increasingly, what the State governments are doing is the same \nthing the Federal Government did in the 1980's except they do not need \na balanced budget amendment because they have simply defined the \nproblem away. What if we had the same capital budget at the Federal \nlevel that exists in most States, mine included? Do you know what \nportion of the Federal budget would be included as a capital budget? \nAnd that includes all physical infrastructure, defense and non-defense, \nand all education programs. Do you know what that would be? $225 \nbillion. If we simply defined our Federal budget as most States do, in \none stroke of the pen we would have no Federal deficit this year. We \nwould have a $25 billion surplus.\n  So when Governors tell me that they want to have a balanced budget \namendment, I say to them: Give me the same capital budget. Give me the \nsame capital budget you have, and we will have a surplus.\n  So, Mr. President, I think before we get a vote on the balanced \nbudget amendment, we ought to have the specifics. I have spent almost 2 \nhours here today laying out what this budget is. The proponents of the \namendment have not stepped forward and told us what they are going to \ncut. Which of the mandatory programs are they going to cut? Which of \nthe discretionary programs are they going to cut?\n  I have a suspicion that there might be another game going on here. I \ndo not mean to cast aspersions on anyone, and I do not. But my guess is \nthat the other side will not take my suggestion of defining the problem \naway with a capital budget. A capital budget would make a lot of sense. \nIt would be like State governments. I mean it would be like most \nbusinesses that have a capital budget. It would be like most families. \nYou have mortgage interest. You have a mortgage on your house. You are \nin debt. But you can make your debt payments. You do not have to pay \nthe whole thing immediately. Everybody in America has debt. The \nquestion is how you manage the debt and, most importantly, how you \nstructure the debt.\n  Let us make a reform: a capital budget. Then we have a surplus. Then \nwe have a surplus. That is a change that I could certainly support.\n  I am concerned there is going to be another approach, though. I \nalready see it rumbling out there. And that is going to be to redefine \nCPI, saying that the deficit is not as big as you think it is because \nwe have exaggerated inflation. Inflation is really lower, and if you \ncalculate it in this different way, we will save $150 billion over 5 \nyears just like that, so the deficit is much less.\n  Well, to those who are contemplating this, I would simply say beware, \nbecause--I am almost inviting the people to do this--the result is you \npay about $21 billion in higher taxes every year if you do that. Why? \nYou pay $21 billion in higher taxes because we have indexed the rates. \nBut if you understate what inflation is, then people are going to be \npushed into higher rates and pay more taxes. And about $28 billion \nless, in terms of less benefits, will go out because the CPI is \ncalculated at a lower level. That is my fear.\n  If you really wanted to come out of this with significant reform that \nwould be right to every legislator, it would be to implement a capital \nbudget, take Social Security out and focus on the operating \nexpenditures.\n  My hope is that, before this is over, at least we will have a chance \nto think about that. If we are serious about cutting the budget, at the \nminimum why not do it on a basis of some principle as opposed to \nlobbyists mud wrestling? Why not say, look, here is the deficit. We \nlooked at this gigantic budget deficit we have. We have to do something \nabout it. We are tired of being grasshoppers. We want to start to be \nthe ant. We want to start to think of our future. We want to start \nthinking of tomorrow.\n  What we are going to do, maybe what we will say is, ``What principle \ncould we use?'' Well, we have a principle for liberals and a principle \nfor conservatives. If we join the two principles, we might actually \nhave a way to proceed here. The principle for liberals would be, I \nwould say, well, why not make income a principle? You get a Federal \nbenefit up to a certain income level. Above that level you get less or \nyou get none. Why should the millionaire who goes to the hospital get \nthe same payment from Medicare as my struggling uncle who went to work \nevery day in the lead factory for 40 years? Why should that happen? Why \nshould a wealthy farmer who makes $3 million a year get the same farm \nsubsidy or the same water subsidy that a struggling family farmer with \n600 or less acres such as in the great State of Iowa or even the cotton \nfarmers in Arizona gets? Why should it be the same for the millionaire \nas for the average person? Well, that is one principle. Maybe make \nincome a criterion.\n  The other principle, for my conservative friends, would be to ask: \nHow about the market? Everybody talks about the market. Yes, we want \nthe market to allocate resources. Well, great, get the Government away \nfrom the market. Let the market allocate the resources. Cut the budget \nby eliminating all these subsidies that impede the function of the \nmarket.\n  If we join those two, having a principle of income and a principle of \nno subsidies, then you would have a way to proceed and explain to \npeople why we are cutting this and not that. Otherwise, it is going to \nbe that the agriculture people are stronger than the mass transit \npeople, who each have their lobbyists trying to figure what \n [[Page S2229]] levels of subsidies are there going to be.\n  So, Mr. President, as I tried to demonstrate today in this talk, it \nis not going to be easy to cut the Federal budget. It is not going to \nbe easy at all to balance this budget. It is going to require bigger \ncuts in expenditures than anyone has heretofore contemplated. And as we \nproceed, if we proceed, I hope we will have not only a suggestion from \nthe proponents of the amendment as to how they would balance the \nbudget, but I think also those who oppose it might raise specific \nquestions of how they would reduce the budget deficit. I believe that \nreducing the budget deficit is an imperative, second only to getting \ngrowth started in our economy. That is a big debate. What comes first, \ngrowth or deficit, savings or investment? I think you have to first get \ngrowth; second, reduce the deficit, and reducing the deficit has the \npotential of improving the prospects for growth.\n It requires some tough choices.\n\n  Mr. President, to go back to the cautionary tale, we are living in a \ntime when the grasshopper and the ant continue to look at each other \nacross the great divide. The grasshopper says to the ant, the ant that \nhas worked all through summer and put food away for the winter, \n``Please, please, Mr. Ant, let me come into your warm home in the \nwinter.''\n  And the ant says to the grasshopper, ``What did you do all summer?''\n  ``I made sweet music.''\n  ``If you make sweet music in the summer, you die in the winter, and \nyou are on your own.''\n  More and more are we saying that. And more and more have we acted as \nthe grasshopper and not the ant. Less and less have we thought of \ntomorrow. As I hope the last hour and a half has made abundantly clear, \nless and less have we thought of tomorrow with regard to our urban \ncenters, with regard to our children. It is about time we start \nthinking of tomorrow and tell the truth to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n                  reply to senators leahy and bradley\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take this time to briefly \nrespond to certain contentions made by Senators Leahy and Bradley \nregarding the balanced budget amendment. These contentions fall into \nseveral categories: First, that the balanced budget amendment does \nabsolutely nothing to balance the budget; it is an unenforceable \ngimmick; second, that the deficit is the result of the Reagan \nadministration; third, that President Clinton's deficit program \neffectively deals with the deficit program; and fourth, that the \nbalanced budget amendment is the largest Federal unfunded mandate \nprogram to date and will be ruinous to the States because it forces the \nStates to assume the cost of Federal social spending programs. Each of \nthese contentions are either false or widely exaggerated.\n\n\n                balanced budget amendment is enforceable\n\n  Senator Leahy's assertion that the amendment is an unenforceable \ngimmick that does nothing to balance the budget, is both wrong and \nmisleading. Of course, the amendment does not balance the budget by \nitself. But neither does the first amendment protect free speech nor \nthe free exercise of religion by itself. The balanced budget amendment, \nsimilar to most of the Constitution, establishes a process, a mechanism \nto effectuate governmental power and obligations. The amendment \nestablishes a limitation on Congress' taxing, spending, and borrowing \npower that furthers the goal of a balanced budget.\n  Moreover, the notion advanced by opponents of the balanced budget \namendment that it is a paper tiger--that Congress will flout its \nconstitutional authority to balance the budget--is simply wrong. First, \nthe amendment has sharp teeth. It is self-enforcing. Because, \nhistorically, it has been easier for Congress to raise the debt \nceiling, rather than reduce spending or raise taxes, the primary \nenforcement mechanism of House Joint Resolution 1 is section 2, which \nrequires a three-fifths vote to increase the debt ceiling. This \nprovision is a steel curtain that will shield the American public from \nan all ill-disciplined and profligate Congress.\n  Furthermore, Members of Congress overwhelmingly conform their actions \nto constitutional precepts out of fidelity to the Constitution itself. \nWe are bound by article VI of the Constitution to ``support this \nConstitution.'' I fully expect fidelity by Members of Congress to the \noath to uphold the Constitution. Honoring this pledge requires \nrespecting the provisions of the proposed amendment. Flagrant disregard \nof the proposed amendment's clear and simple provisions would \nconstitute nothing less than a betrayal of the public trust. In their \ncampaigns for reelection, elected officials who flout their \nresponsibilities under this amendment will find that the political \nprocess will provide the ultimate enforcement mechanism.\n\n\n                       whose fault is the deficit\n\n  Both Senators Leahy and Bradley claim that the current deficit is the \nwork of the Republicans--particularly former President Ronald Reagan. \nThey claim it was the massive defense buildup of the 1980's along with \nthe Reagan tax cuts that led to the present day deficits. In President \nReagan's words, ``Well, there they go again.''\n  In reality, one thing and one thing only has led to our massive \ndeficits, Congress' voracious appetite to spend and spend. During the \n1980's, the Reagan tax cuts stimulated the\n economy and led to the largest peace time boom in American history. \nAbout 20 million new jobs were created and revenue increased by about \n$1 trillion. The problem was that Congress, whose constitutional \nauthority it is to oversee and legislate the budget, spent $1.4 \ntrillion.\n\n  In fact, it really doesn't matter whose fault it is. This is a \nbipartisan problem with fault enough for both sides of the aisle. Let's \nstop pointing fingers and work together.\n  Senator Bradley, who presented a very detailed and erudite exegesis \nof the budget process--I wish more of my colleagues were present on the \nfloor to see it--hit the nail on the head when he stated that the real \nproblems of the budget shortfalls is the mammoth growth in entitlement \nspending and payments on interest on the debt. He even seemed at times \nto make a case for passage and ratification of the amendment since he \nmust concede that Congress, without a balanced budget amendment, has \nbeen wholly ineffective in resolving the budgetary crisis.\n  Furthermore, both Senators proudly point to President Clinton's \ndeficit reduction plan as some kind of solution to the deficit problem. \nBut they neglected to mention one simple thing--that after a small drop \nin the deficit for the first few years of the plan--the deficit \ncontinues to rise, surpassing $200 billion in 1996, reaching the record \nlevel of $297 billion in 2001, and topping $421 billion in 2005. Even \nthe President's new budget plan fails to resolve the deficit problem as \nit averages about $200 billion deficits for each year of the budget \nplan.\n\n\n            balanced budget amendment as an unfunded mandate\n\n  Finally, both Senators Leahy and Bradley contend that passage and \nratification of the balanced budget amendment will act as an enormous \nfiscally crushing Federal unfunded mandate, forcing the States to \nassume responsibilities for social spending that the Federal Government \nhas shouldered for years. This statement is the mother of \nexaggerations. First of all, it does not take into account that many of \nthese Federal programs come with inflexible bureaucratic strings \nattached and ofttimes hamper localities resolve economic and social \nproblems. Indeed, many Governors, including Governors Wilson of \nCalifornia, Allen of Virginia, Whitman of New Jersey, and my own \nGovernor, Governor Leavitt of Utah, have publicly stated that they will \ngladly take the decrease in Federal proceeds due to a Federal balanced \nbudget for control over how moneys are spent in States and localities. \nI truly believe that the States and localities will be far more \nefficacious in how money is spent without Big Brother Federal \nGovernment looking over their shoulder.\n  Of course, passage and ratification of the balanced budget amendment \nwill require sacrifices, sacrifices from all of us. But the returns on \na balanced budget are enormous--increased economic growth and more and \nbetter jobs. Indeed, as Senator Simon often cites, GAO estimates that a \nbalanced budget in the late 1990's will result in a 33-percent increase \nin the standard of living in about 10 years. I bet Senators Leahy \n [[Page S2230]] and Bradley did not take this into account.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2218-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE PRESIDENT'S FISCAL YEAR 1996 BUDGET\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the issue of constitutional amendment \nfor a balanced budget that has been before us for a week and probably \nwill be before this body for several more days before we make a final \ndecision has had the debate on that issue intertwined pretty much with \nthe present budget situation and even lately with the budget that the \nPresident has presented to this specific Congress.\n  The President's budget of yesterday reflects an abdication of \nleadership. It fails not only to put the budget on a glidepath toward \nbalance, it also fails to seek even the President's own goal and \npromise to the American people. That promise, if you remember, Mr. \nPresident, was as stated in the 1992 campaign that the deficit would be \ncut in half by the 1996 election. That will not be the case under the \nbudget that the President has presented to Congress.\n  So I am overcome by the farcical vision of how this budget must have \nbeen sent up here to Capitol Hill. Members of the President's team \nlined up on Pennsylvania Avenue and punted. They punted copies of that \nbudget up here one by one.\n  On January 24, after the President's State of the Union Address, I \nhad occasion to remark when I was asked about his address that it \nseemed that the President was very willing to accept the leadership of \nCongress and to follow our agenda because he recognized the outcome of \nthe election. That election gave Republicans the responsibility to \nlead. Today, through his actions, the President confirmed my suspicion \nand submitted a budget that says, ``Let Congress make the tough \nchoices. Let Congress lead.''\n  According to reports, several of the President's high-level advisers \ncounseled that, since the administration has failed to get credit from \nprevious deficit reductions, there is little wisdom in trying to cut \nmore. I hope that this is not the case. For, if it were true, there \nwould be no clearer signal of the absence of leadership from this \nadministration.\n  Just last month administration officials were boasting about their \nachievements on the deficit front. They were bemoaning the fact that \nthe message of what they supposedly have cut and accomplished on the \ndeficit scene was not getting out.\n  So why are they now abandoning what they consider a virtuous policy \ninstead of working to get that message out, if they want to be viewed \nwith any sort of credibility? Because in my estimation, in abandoning \ntheir goal of more deficits, the administration has also abandoned its \npromise to the American people and, as a consequence, the President has \nlost all moral authority to lead.\n  Clearly, this President has chosen to play defense; that is, after \nthe punting of the budget to us, they are now saying ``You''--meaning \nRepublicans--``call the plays, now. It is your turn with the ball and \nlet us see if you can do any better.'' We have heard that for a long \nperiod of time and just this morning on the floor of this body.\n  I believe that Congress can do better. For the sake of our children \nand grandchildren, we can and must do better. The President has \nfollowed the lead of the American people who spoke in November. Thus he \nhas passed the mantle of leadership on to us.\n  With that leadership, the Republican Congress has already delivered \non making Congress more accountable to the public and State \ngovernments, and now we will work toward making Congress more \naccountable to our children and grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2230-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2230-S2231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n         the daschle amendment to the balanced budget amendment\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, what the 104th Congress is all about is \nending business as usual in Washington. We started out by passing the \nbill that Senator Lieberman and I introduced to make Congress live by \nthe same laws it passes for everyone else. Then we passed a bill to \nrestrict unfunded mandates.\n  These proposals represent a change from business as usual. The voters \nlast November demanded a change in business as usual in Washington. And \nthis Congress has delivered. And I am confident that we will continue \nto deliver.\n  One of the changes the American people wanted is a balanced budget \namendment. They are tired of Congress coming up with clever rhetoric \nthat has defeated this amendment over the years. Now, those same \ncritics want us to spell out on an account by account basis the \nreceipts and outlays for fiscal years 1996 to 2002. The proposal is yet \nanother rhetorical trick designed to let big spenders defeat the \nbalanced budget amendment by people who want no fiscal discipline.\n  The proposal represents a last gasp by the old guard to continue \nbusiness as usual. For them, business as usual means a continually \nexpanding Federal Government. The voters have spoken, and the business-\nas-usual crowd refuses to listen. That is not what representative \ngovernment and democracy is all about.\n  We all know that a balanced budget is achievable. I know that our \nrespected colleague Senator Domenici, chairman of the Budget Committee \non which I serve, is working on a variety of fiscal strategies to show \nthat it can be done--without touching Social Security. The numbers are \nclear.\n  We can limit spending growth to over 2 percent and reach a balanced \nbudget, again without touching Social Security. Under current fiscal \npolicy, Federal spending in fiscal 2002 will be 44 percent higher than \nthis year if we do nothing. By holding growth to 22 percent, \nRepublicans can balance the budget without cutting Social Security or \nraising taxes. Federal spending will increase under either approach.\n  But by how much? That is the question. Many of the supporters of this \nright-to-know amendment think Government spending must double by 2002. \nSupporters of the balanced budget amendment think Government can get by \non approximately $260 billion more than we are currently spending, but \nhalf of what other people think we should spend.\n  I say that is enough money, taking inflation into account, to balance \nthe budget while still allowing programs to grow. The argument has been \nmade by my colleagues that, in 1993, Congress and the President acted \nhonestly and forthrightly in enacting the fiscal 1994 budget. They say \nspecific cuts and tax increases were spelled out to bring us toward a \nreduced budget deficit. Now opponents say supporters of this \nconstitutional amendment have a similar obligation to spell out our \nplan. But the premise of the argument is invalid and the conclusions do \nnot follow.\n  The 1993 tax bill raised taxes, and it had very few spending cuts. I \ndoubt that anybody outside of the beltway can name a single real cut. \nThe whole premise of the tax bill that the deficit would be cut was \nfallacious. The President's own budget predicts $200 billion in budget \ndeficits for the next 5 years if we do nothing. Notwithstanding the \n1993 tax bill, the President still projects deficits as high as an \nelephant's eye.\n  And so the debt still continues to grow clear up to the sky. The so-\ncalled honesty in budgeting of 1993 is a very slender reed on which to \nbase a so-called right-to-know amendment.\n  In addition to serving on the Budget Committee, I also serve on the \nJudiciary Committee and I am concerned that the Democratic leader's \namendment--another amendment before our body--will be beyond the intent \nof the Constitution. It says that the amendment shall not take effect \nuntil Congress passes a budget reconciliation act.\n  But article V of the Constitution--that is, the amending article--\nprovides that when both Houses of Congress pass a proposed \nconstitutional amendment, it ``shall be valid to all intents and \npurposes, as a part of this Constitution, when ratified by the \nlegislatures of three-fourths of the several States, or by conventions \nin three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification \nmay be proposed by the Congress.'' But the proposal before us would not \nallow the amendment to be \n [[Page S2231]] effective once Congress has passed it and, in this \ncase, three-fourths of the State legislatures having ratified it. \nInstead, we put a whole new condition on the amendment that we have \nbefore us, the amendment to be ratified: The passage of a 7-year budget \nreconciliation act.\n  That is not a constitutional convention for the ratification of an \namendment. And I think this amendment by the leader of the minority \nshould be beaten.\n  We have heard it said that if Congress may constitutionally insist as \na condition for ratification that the States ratify a proposed \nconstitutional amendment within 7 years, then it is constitutional for \nCongress to impose a condition such as the Daschle amendment before \nCongress submits the proposal to the States. This analysis is incorrect \nfor two reasons.\n  First, the courts have upheld limitations on the ratification \nprocess, but no case has ever upheld the imposition of a condition for \ninitiating ratification proceedings once Congress has adopted an \namendment.\n  Second, the Supreme Court has ruled that although it is a political \nquestion, article V implicitly requires a contemporaneous majority to \nratify an amendment. Thus, a 7-year or equivalent period is a \nconstitutional necessity under the case law. But no such status \npertains to the proposal by the Senator from South Dakota.\n  So, Mr. President, we should pass the balanced budget amendment. We \nshould not adopt the Daschle amendment to that amendment because it is \nimpractical and because it is unconstitutional. The American people \nwant us to end business as usual. They see the so-called right-to-know \namendment to be business as usual--a business-as-usual approach, \nrejected by the people in the November 8 election, a business-as-usual \napproach rejected by Congress for the first time in 40 years, as we try \nto bring to a vote all of the things that have been buried in Congress \nby a Congress controlled for 40 years by the now minority party.\n  We accept our responsibilities to reject business as usual, with our \nsurveys showing 80 percent support for the constitutional amendment for \na balanced budget. It has been before this body four or five times over \nthe past 15 years. Now is the time to pass it.\n  I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair and my colleague from Iowa. Mr. \nPresident, I want to call the attention of my colleagues a situation, \nwhich I discovered during our recent December recess, dealing with \npublic housing.\n  Since 1980, the law has been clear that those who are illegal \nimmigrants are not entitled to occupy public housing. So I was somewhat \nastonished in visiting with a housing authority director in my own \nState and to have him tell me that in the city of Reno, he would \nestimate that approximately 10 percent, maybe a little more, maybe a \nlittle less of those who occupy public housing are, in fact, illegal \nimmigrants. At the same time, in the city of Reno--and I think this is \nreplicated throughout the country--there are some 500 families waiting \nto occupy public housing.\n  So I asked the question, well, if it is illegal for them to occupy \npublic housing, why have you not done something about it? That, Mr. \nPresident, is an astonishing story. In 1982, 1984, and 1986, \napparently, efforts were made to implement by regulation what the \nstatute establishes by way of policy. Through a series of \nadministrative or bureaucratic delays and obfuscation, in fact, none of \nthese regulations have been implemented.\n  So currently the housing authority directors in America are told that \nalthough the 1980 law remains in effect, you may not inquire and you \nmay not verify the resident status of those persons who seek to make \napplication to occupy public housing. May I say, Mr. President, this is \nabsolutely absurd and ridiculous.\n  The law says that they ought not to be eligible--those who are \nillegal immigrants--to occupy public housing. Nevertheless, they are \npermitted to do so. There is a glimmer of hope. That is, that there is \na rule making its way through the Office of Management and Budget, and \nI urge OMB to implement that regulation immediately so that the policy \nsince 1988 may be carried out.\n  I thank you, Mr. President for your courtesy and that of the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2231-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2231-S2233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL 2:15 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 12:30 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will stand in recess until the hour of \n2:15 p.m.\n  Thereupon, the Senate, at 12:38 p.m., recessed until 2:15 p.m.; \nwhereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by the Presiding \nOfficer (Mr. Cohen).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Indiana.\n  (Mr. THOMPSON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, for decades Congress has enjoyed the \nunlimited luxury of unlimited debt. Our practices, which are pleasing \nfor the moment to constituencies that profit from the practice of \nunlimited debt, have seriously undermined the credibility of this \ninstitution with the American people.\n  Skepticism and cynicism abound. That skepticism and cynicism--\ndirected toward those who have made hollow promises, unfulfilled year \nafter year, perceived to have been made for political purposes--brought \nabout, in my opinion, the results that we saw in the November election. \nThe American people want Congress to be honest and to be \nstraightforward with them, even if it brings some unpleasant truths.\n  Now, with the passage in the House of Representatives of the balanced \nbudget amendment by a historic 301 to 132 vote, the spotlight has \nturned on the Senate. As such, we, in a sense, are on trial. Our \ncredibility is at stake. We are debating something of which the \nAmerican people have become very well aware--the impact, year after \nyear, for 25 straight years, of expenditures that exceed our revenues.\n  It has become apparent to the American people that we are forfeiting \nnot only our own future but, more importantly, that of future \ngenerations and their opportunity to participate in the American dream.\n  I do not think there should be any argument about the urgency of our \ncircumstances. Every child born in America inherits about $18,000 in \npublic debt. This unfair burden placed on the future is the result of a \nfailure of political will and it is a betrayal of moral commitments.\n  It was Thomas Jefferson who noted long ago:\n\n       The question of whether one generation has the right to \n     bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of Government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and be morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.\n\n  ``The fundamental principles of Government,'' Jefferson noted. What \nis perhaps the most fundamental of those fundamental principles?\n  It is the same principle that applies to each person in our \nindividual lives, to our family life, to corporate America, to business \nAmerica, to virtually every institution. That fundamental principle \ninvolves being responsible and accountable to the people we serve, to \nour employees, to our family members, to ourselves. It means not \nspending more than we receive and running up a debt to the extent where \nwe have become unable to pay that debt. Or, in paying that debt, we \nmust squander resources that should go for essential purposes and \nessential services.\n  That is exactly what has happened here in the United States. We now \nface a national debt of $4.8 trillion. Applied across the board per \ncapita that is \n [[Page S2232]] $18,000 for each individual child born in America.\n  The debt robs people of the opportunity for economic progress. It \nsteals their opportunity to set essential priorities of how they will \nspend their money. This failure of fundamental principle has led some \nof the most distinguished Members of this body to leave out of \nfrustration, perhaps, or disgust. These respected Senators lost faith \nin our ability to act.\n  As I said earlier, the public generally shares that skepticism. With \nthe House of Representatives now having passed the balanced budget \namendment--and I hope the Senate will soon follow--we can begin to \nrecover the trust of the American people. Despite the pleas of \nconstituencies that walk in each of our offices and say, ``Yes, it is a \nproblem, but not my program,'' I believe the American people \ninstinctively know that we have got to get our hands on this monster \nthat has just grown beyond anybody's ability to control.\n  Now, I understand that amending the Constitution is serious business. \nPerhaps it is the most serious act of which this Congress is capable. \nIt alters the most basic social contract between government and its \ncitizens. The continued accumulation of debt threatens the endurance, \nthe very endurance of that very contract, because it is an agreement \nnot only with ourselves but an agreement with our children.\n  The constitutional amendment is, admittedly, a strong measure, a \nstrong remedy. Sometimes it is needed, as we have demonstrated in the \npast. It is needed when the crisis is truly here. And it is truly here.\n  A General Accounting Office report says that interest payments will \nexceed $1 trillion by the year 2020 if we simply remain on our present \ncourse. That fact has to be unacceptable to every Member of this body. \nThat continued load of interest on the debt means that we hinder our \neconomy from growth it can provide in jobs and opportunities for \nAmericans. It means that we divert money from essential expenditures \nthat this Congress needs to make while continually taking more money \nfrom hard-working taxpayers who need those funds to meet basic \nindividual and family needs.\n  We borrow at the rate of $1 billion a day--$1 billion a day. What \ncould we do in this country with $1 billion a day to meet essential \nneeds, to return funds, or allow taxpayers to retain more hard-earned \ndollars, to make decisions for themselves and their family. What can we \ndo with those funds.\n  So it does come down to a test of will. It does come down to \npolitical courage. But this Congress and previous Congresses have \ndemonstrated, to date, that we do not have the political courage or the \nwill because it is simply too easy to take the expedient route, to say \n``yes'' to the constituent groups that might help ensure our \nreelection, rather than say, ``I am sorry. We simply do not have the \nfunds.'' We can say what legislators of 48 States have to say to their \nconstituents. That is, ``Yes, I recognize your concerns. I understand \nthe need. But you must understand we have to decide how we will spend \nour scarce revenue dollars on the basis of priorities. That's what we \nare elected to do.''\n  This body has not had to do that. It has become an all too convenient \nmethod of ensuring political longevity and reelection to be able to say \n``yes'' while we ask future generations to pay for that ``yes.''\n  Spending habits of Congress are simply too entrenched. There is an \nideology of many Members that has nothing to do with left or right, \nliberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat. It has to do with \npower. Power to use the Federal Treasury to please special interests, \nto make powerful constituencies happy, to ensure our longevity and our \nreelection.\n  Deficit spending has always made political sense because it allows \nCongress to please people in the present by placing burdens on the \nfuture. The future, significantly, has no vote in the next election. We \nhave built that power on the ability to buy constituent support for \ncash funded from debt. That power, it is obvious here, will not be \neasily surrendered even when we face a crisis of our own creation. Even \nwhen the views of most Americans are clear, that power will not be \neasily surrendered.\n  Make no mistake, what we are talking about with the balanced budget \namendment is surrendering power, power which I contend we have handled \nirresponsibly. The record is clear. I came to this body, the body of \nCongress, in 1981. I remember the recoiling of new Members over the \nprospect of having to vote early on in 1981 to raise the debt limit to \nover $1 trillion. I stand here today, a few short years later, and we \nare looking at the prospect of a $5 trillion debt.\n  It is a failure of political will. We all bear responsibility. The \nquestion now is, how do we address the problem, given the fact that the \ncrisis is here and we must not continue the past practice of increasing \ndebt and placing the responsibility on the shoulders of future \ngenerations--how do we address that? That is the fundamental question.\n  We have had proposal after proposal, scheme after scheme, promise \nafter promise that holds out the hope that we finally will have \nsummoned the political will and the courage to address the crisis in a \nlegislative manner. Yet the record is clear. Year after year, proposal \nafter proposal, we have failed in that responsibility.\n  So now comes the moment of truth. Now comes the opportunity for \nMembers to enshrine in the Constitution of the United States--perhaps \nthe one promise none of us dares violate--a mandate to which we will \npledge fealty upon our swearing in, a mandate that says, ``Thou shalt \nnot spend more than you bring in.'' Such an oath will make honest \npoliticians out of all, honest legislators out of all. Having placed \nour left hand on the Bible and raised our right hand, swearing to \nuphold the Constitution of the United States, including the injunction \nthat ``We will not spend more than we take in,'' we will have to face \nthe music at every legislative session. We will have to look our \nconstituents in the eye and say, ``We are sworn to uphold this \nConstitution, and this Constitution forbids us from going into debt. So \nyour program, your proposal, the additional spending that you seek may \nbe worthy, but it has to be placed among the categories and lists of \npriorities that we will have to decide each time we meet.''\n  We will be forced to establish those priorities. We will be able to \nsummon the wherewithal to finally live up to the responsibility that \neach of us has failed in, and that is to be careful guardians of the \ndollars that the public entrusts to Members. It will force us to avoid \na system which allows Members to transfer that responsibility from the \npresent to the future, and ensure that we do not place on future \ngenerations the debts which we are obligated to pay.\n  The constitutional amendment to balance the budget would transform \nthe nature of our commitment to a responsible budget. It is one thing \nto vote for a deficit, it is something entirely else to violate the \nConstitution.\n  That, Mr. President, I contend is what is at issue here. The \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget is an opportunity, a \nchance to leave some legacy other than monumental debt.\n  I ask my colleagues, many of whom have provided many, many years of \nmeritorious service, what legacy do you want to leave when your time is \nfinished? What legacy, what heritage do you want to pass on, given the \nservice that you have been privileged to provide as a Member of the \nU.S. Congress? Do we want to leave a legacy of debt which places a \nburden on the opportunities for this Nation. Do we want to leave a \nlegacy for our children and grandchildren and future generations that \ndenies them the very opportunities of which we have taken advantage? Is \nthat the legacy we want to leave?\n  I suggest that it is not the legacy we want to leave. I suggest that \nevery other attempt that we have made, every other proposal that we \nhave addressed has not solved the problem or even come close to solving \nthe problem. There has been too much temptation to please the present \nby shifting the responsibility to the future. We have demonstrated that \nwe are not capable of dealing with it.\n  So we are almost asking to approve the balanced budget amendment as a \nway of saving ourselves, saving ourselves from the continued moral \nfailure of being responsible to the very people that we are privileged \nto represent. Let \n[[Page S2233]] us leave a legacy of which we can be proud, a legacy \nthat will ensure for future generations the rights and privileges that \nwe have been so fortunate to enjoy.\n  The balanced budget amendment is also a chance to restore some needed \ntrust, to prove that the Congress can stand for something other than \ndefense of its own power and its own privilege.\n  Mr. President, I will have, obviously, many opportunities to speak \nfurther on this issue. It is a critical one. We will spend a \nconsiderable amount of time dealing with it. There are obviously \ndivisions of opinion as to how we should get from here to there. I look \nforward to speaking and participating on this issue in the days ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have listened to the closing words of my \ndistinguished friend from Indiana, Mr. Coats. Speaking for myself, I do \nnot want to leave my children and my grandchildren the legacy of a \ncrippled Constitution. I believe that the balanced budget amendment, if \nadopted, would be an irresponsible act that would cripple this Nation's \ncapacity to cope with the economic problems of the 21st century and \nbeyond.\n  Does the Senator wish me to yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee will yield to me for the purpose \nof making a statement on another issue for approximately 7 or 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as for myself, I have no problem with \nyielding to the Senator. I do know that Senator Bumpers has been \nwaiting patiently to speak, and there are others who wish to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may be permitted to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana for not to exceed 8 minutes without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, today I begin a series of statements about \na place that is very special to me, the city of Butte, MT. These \nstatements will focus on Butte's economy, its people, its quality of \nlife, and other special attributes of Butte.\n  I will begin today by discussing the recent history of Butte's \neconomy.\n  Butte, MT, is 1 of 13 communities across the Nation under \nconsideration for a new microchip manufacturing plant to be constructed \nby Micron Technologies.\n  Now, Butte and Micron may seem to have little in common; after all, \nwhy would one of the Nation's leading high-technology companies want to \nset up a shop in an old western mining town like Butte?\n  Yet, if you scratch just below the surface, Butte and Micron have a \nlot in common. Thanks to the basic American values of hard work, \npatriotism, ingenuity, competitiveness, both Butte and Micron have \ngrown and prospered over the past 10 years. And Micron has done this \nwithout shipping jobs overseas.\n  Many of their managers have told me, with great and justifiable \npride, that their corporate philosophy is to grow jobs not overseas but \nin America. It is exactly that kind of loyalty that has helped the \npeople of Butte rebuild their economy after the loss of the largest \nemployer more than a decade ago.\n  For over a century, the business of Butte was mining. Butte's first \nsettlers called it ``the glittering hill.'' Later, Butte would be known \nas the ``mining city.'' At first, it was silver and gold but primarily \ncopper.\n  While the mining industry flourished, Butte grew and prospered, and \nsome in Butte got very wealthy. Many others made a hard but a decent \nliving in the mines. During the early part of this century, Butte's \npopulation rose to nearly 100,000 people, about the same size as \ntoday's Billings, MT, our largest city.\n  With copper prices falling in the 1970's, Butte's once mighty mining \nindustry began to slowly taper off.\n  Then it happened. The mines closed. This January 7, 1983, headline, a \nreplica, a mockup of the Montana Standard, reads like a death sentence \nfor Butte: ``Butte Mining to Stop.'' There is a big stop sign; a death \nsentence for Butte, MT.\n  Hundreds of jobs were lost, direct jobs; over $32 million in annual \npayroll disappeared; over $1 million in yearly tax payments to the \nlocal government were lost, and Butte lost a big chunk of its \nidentity--mining. The ``mining city'' became the ``former mining \ncity.''\n  Butte's chief executive at the time was a good friend of mine named \nDon Peoples. Don told the local paper:\n\n       It's like being told that a patient has a terminal illness. \n     You first feel frustration, anger and then sit back and \n     determine how you fight on.\n\n  Don's reaction of the news was typical of the spirit, optimism, and \nloyalty that helped make Butte such a special place.\n  Yet, there were a lot of other people, most of whom, by the way, do \nnot live in Butte, who counted Butte out. They thought Butte was \ndestined to become nothing more than a very large ghost town on the \nwestern landscape.\n  But were they ever wrong. Perhaps they underestimated the teamwork \nand the ingenuity of Butte's leaders, people like Don Peoples, Harp \nCote, Joe Quilici, Bob Pavlovich, J.D. Lynch, Judy Jacobson, Fritz \nDaily, Evan Barrett, Bob Gannon, and Jack Lynch. And I know they \nunderestimated the thousands of other hardworking Montanans who were \nstill proud--fiercely proud--to call Butte their home.\n  These people were not about to pack up and leave. They were \ndetermined to stay in Butte and build a better life for themselves and \ntheir families, and they did it. By working together and creating a \nprobusiness environment, they made Butte of 1995 a great economic \nsuccess story.\n  There is much, much more to the Butte of 1995 than mining.\n  The Montana technology companies have earned Butte international \nrecognition as a center for the development, testing, and marketing of \nnew environmental technologies. They have done it themselves in Butte.\n  Montana Power Co., based in Butte, operates one of the most dynamic \nutility and energy businesses in the Nation.\n  Butte's Montana Tech turns up on any list of the best engineering and \nscience schools in the country. For instance, in a survey of college \npresidents recently published in U.S. News and World Report, Tech, \nMontana Tech was voted the top ranked small college science program in \nthe Nation--top, No. 1.\n  Hundreds of new small businesses have grown up and prospered in \nButte.\n  Well, 12 years have now passed since the mines closed. Mining has \ncome back to Butte. With the development of Montana Resources several \nyears ago, Butte can again rightfully call itself the mining city.\n  In short, if Micron is looking for a good place to do business, Butte \nis the best place. Its industrious people are the perfect match for \nMicron's record of growth and productivity.\n  Over 30,000 Montanans from Butte and southwest Montana have signed \npetitions urging Micron to locate in Butte. I can only add my voice to \ntheirs by expressing my fervent hope that Micron will become Butte's \nnext economic miracle.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2233-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2233-S2242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today we continue one of the most important \ndebates in the history of the Senate. The debate involves whether to \nchange the basic, fundamental, organic law of this Nation forever, and \nfor the first time \n[[Page S2234]] to write fiscal policy into the Constitution of the \nUnited States--for the first time, amended only 27 times in its \nhistory. The Constitution of the United States is one of the most \nbrilliant, uplifting, and inspired documents ever written by the hand \nof mere mortals. It has served as a model for other nations, nations \nthat are struggling to emulate the American genius and ensure a \ngovernment that allows maximum freedom for its people, and yet also \nfairly imposes the strictures of the rule of law.\n  Such a document, with its carefully weighted checks and balances, its \nbeautiful guarantees of freedom and liberty, its eloquent preamble of \n52 words, and its visionary flexibility has inspired and guided this \ngreat Nation of ours for generations.\n  Now the decision to preserve it for our future generations rests with \nthis body--100 men and women sworn to support and defend this marvelous \nConstitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And the \ndecision rests with us. The buck stops here. I have taken that oath 13 \ntimes in the last 48 years--to support and defend the Constitution \nagainst all enemies, foreign and domestic. I have administered the oath \nof office on a good many occasions to several of my colleagues, and I \nhave considered it an honor and a privilege to do so.\n  This body has a solemn responsibility to debate the proposed \namendment carefully, fully, thoroughly and with diligence. Nothing on \nthe Senate's agenda is as important as this proposal. It is the most \nimportant decision that will be made in this Senate this year. And if, \nwhich God avert, this amendment is adopted, it will prove to have been \nthe most important amendment, the most important change to the \nConstitution since the Constitution became effective 206 years ago, and \nit will be the first time out of 27 times that an amendment has been \nadopted to damage this inimitable document.\n  Nothing on the Senate's agenda, as I say, is as important as is this \nproposal. So I say that no politically crafted, so-called Contract With \nAmerica--you have heard about that, the Contract With America, the so-\ncalled Contract With America. Let me show you my contract with America. \nHere it is, the Constitution of the United States. It cost me 15 cents. \nThere it is--15 cents. Any Senators who wish to get similar copies may \ndo so from the Government Printing Office. It only costs a dollar even \nat today's prices.\n  So this so-called Contract With America, which I did not sign on to, \nand which just sprouted up like the prophet's gourd overnight, during \nthe last election, should not drive this debate or crowd out the \nthorough consideration of this proposed constitutional amendment.\n  We have a duty to air all sides before the public, lest there be any \nmisunderstanding about what is being proposed. If we are to adopt this \nmost serious of alterations to our Constitution, let us not do so \nwithout telling the American people exactly what the change will mean \nto them. Let us not do so without telling the American people exactly, \nto the very best of our ability, what the change will be to them, the \nAmerican people.\n  The debate may be at times tedious. It deals with concepts and truths \nwhich are not usually on the public radar screen. But it is our \nresponsibility to focus the public, if we can, on this issue which is \nso fundamental, so fundamental to the future of our Nation.\n  And so it is my hope that the Senate and its Members will concentrate \ntheir fractured attention spans, clear the decks, and listen to and \nparticipate in this extraordinary debate. Now, this is no ordinary \nbill. It is no mere amendment to a statute. This is the supreme law of \nthe land about which we are talking. We are talking about amending the \nsupreme law of the land, the Constitution of the United States, the \nsupreme law of the land, the guarantor of our freedoms and the freedoms \nof generations of Americans which we are considering here on this \nSenate floor. We are considering an amendment to write into the \nConstitution for the very first time language dealing with fiscal \npolicy. That is a subject which the framers of the Constitution, in \ntheir wisdom, left for the decisions of the elected representatives of \nthe people in this body and in the other body.\n  I hope that we will be guided by at least a limited wisdom of the \nFramers. There is a kind of pretense that one can read between the \nlines in this amendment, namely that the statesmen of today are wiser \nthan those Framers of the Constitution who acted 208 years ago to \nsubmit to the States for their ratification the great document. I hope \nthat we will reread the solemn oath that we all took when we were sworn \nin. I hope that Members will listen to their consciences and resist the \npolitical winds that have already blown through the other body.\n  Now is the Senate's time to shine. It can fulfill the task before us, \nwith faithfulness to its purpose, by an exhaustive review of the impact \nof this proposal. Nothing we do during our collective service in the \nSenate will ever be more important than this task which is before us \ntoday, the task of examining, scrutinizing, dissecting, and hopefully \nrejecting this constitutional amendment.\n  The people hopefully will remember one truth as they watch and as we \nengage in this historic debate; that is, that there is no disagreement \nover the goal of getting to a balanced budget by reducing the Federal \ndeficit. This debate, however, is about tampering with the United \nStates Constitution in such a way as to mandate a zero deficit each and \nevery year for the life of this Republic--for the life of this \nRepublic--not just for a few years, but for centuries. Who knows? This \nis an extreme and serious remedy, indeed.\n  We can change a statute a month after it is enacted, 2 weeks after it \nis enacted, or a year after it is enacted. A statute can be repealed by \nthe same Congress that originally enacted it. But not so with an \namendment to the Constitution. Once this surgery has been performed, \nonce the frontal lobotomy has been done, it will be very difficult to \nundo if we do not like the consequences.\n  That is why as much should be known about this proposal as possible, \nincluding a blueprint for exactly how the proponents would get the \nbudget into balance by 2002. If that blueprint cannot be produced, then \nthe American people should be aware from the outset that the amendment \nmay be a sham and a cruel hoax by politicians looking to curry favor by \nmaking promises that they cannot keep, and by using the Constitution--\nthis Constitution of the United States--as cover for their singular \nlack of courage.\n  Public service should mean more than that. The welfare of the people \nshould mean more than that. And the Constitution of the United States \nmust surely mean more than that.\n  Mr. President, I have heard the great name of Thomas Jefferson \ninvoked time and time again during this debate by some of those who \nsupport this constitutional amendment on the balanced budget. Thomas \nJefferson was not one of those at the Constitutional Convention. Thomas \nJefferson was not one of the 39 signers of the Constitution. He was a \nMinister to France at the time that the Constitutional Convention was \nunderway.\n  We all know that a failure of the Congress under the Articles of \nConfederation to provide the Nation with a responsible financial system \nwas the principal stimulus to the drafting of the Constitution. That \nwas one of the things that was wrong with the Congress under the \nConfederation, one of the things that weakened the Continental \nCongress.\n  The First Continental Congress met on September 5, 1774. The Second \nContinental Congress met in 1775, and it continued until 1781, in which \nyear the Articles of Confederation were created, and the Congress under \nthe Confederation continued to exist until 1789, when this Republic, \ncreated under the new Constitution, came into being.\n  One of the principal reasons why it became clear that the Congress \nwas ineffective under the Confederation was the fact that its financial \nsystem was really a paralyzed system, one in which the Congress had to \ndepend upon the States for their good will and their support in coming \nup with the funds that were levied against them. The Congress had \nlittle power. It had to requisition moneys from the States, and the \nmoneys were not always forthcoming.\n  So, it was decided that there would have to be a new form of \nGovernment, \n[[Page S2235]] and a new Constitution was thus written. There were also \nproblems with regard to commerce between and among the States. All \nthose things came into focus and made clear the need for a new \nConstitution and a new form of Government. That Constitution, \ntherefore, was written during those 116 days that occurred between and \nincluding May 25 and September 17, 1787.\n  Jefferson did not help to write that Constitution. Jefferson was not \nat the Constitutional Convention. So why invoke his name? This notion \nthat today's populace should not be able, by borrowing, to burden \nfuture generations with debt was never seriously considered by the \nconvention. Such an amendment to the Constitution was never submitted \nto the people.\n  Jefferson was President of the United States from 1801 to 1809. Why \ndid he not suggest or recommend that such an amendment be submitted to \nthe people by the Congress? He had the opportunity to do it. Why did he \nnot do it?\n  I think we have to recognize a limitation as to what we are willing \nto include in the Constitution by recognizing that there is a vast gulf \nbetween what might be considered a Utopian Constitution and what it \nmight contain, and what a Constitution in the real world can achieve.\n  One should never underestimate the price of making promises that even \na Constitution might not be able to deliver.\n  Thomas Jefferson took no part in the debates, as I have said, of the \n1787 Convention that produced the Constitution. He was in France. He \ndid not return home until October 1789. The Constitution had already \ngone into effect on March 4, 1789.\n  A month previous to his return home from Paris, Jefferson wrote the \ncelebrated ``The Earth Belongs to the Living'' letter, and he wrote it \nto James Madison. In that letter, Jefferson argued that ``no generation \ncan contract debts greater than may be paid during the course of its \nown existence,'' and Jefferson calculated such a period to be about 19 \nyears. We would calculate it to be a longer period these days.\n  James Madison, though, is generally recognized to be the Father of \nthe Constitution. Here it is in my hand, the Constitution of the United \nStates. This is not the so-called Contract With America; this is the \nConstitution of the United States. That is my contract with America.\n  James Madison is generally agreed to have been the Father of the \nConstitution of the United States. He continued to explain that ``the \nimprovements made by the dead form a charge against the living who take \nthe benefit of them.'' In other words, the improvements made by those \nof this generation, who years hence, would be dead. The improvements \nmade by the dead form a charge against the living generations hence, \nwho will take the benefit of those improvements. Continuing, Madison \nsaid, ``Debts may be incurred for purposes which interest the unborn, \nas well as the living''--This is not Robert C. Byrd talking; this is \nJames Madison. I was not there when this Constitution was written. I \ndid not have a thing to do with writing it. But it is my contract with \nAmerica. Madison said: ``The improvements made by the dead form a \ncharge against the living who take the benefit of them. Debts may be \nincurred for purposes which interest the unborn, as well as the living; \nsuch are debts for repelling a conquest, the evils of which may descend \nthrough many generations.''\n  Madison's view, therefore, was that ``debts may be incurred \nprincipally for the benefit of posterity.'' Jefferson said, in essence, \nwe should not pass debts on to our children and grandchildren. But \nMadison took the other view--the better view, in my judgment--that \n``debts may be incurred principally for the benefit of posterity.''\n  I think greater weight should be given to Madison's view than to \nJefferson's more abstract idea, written from the distant European \nshores. Particularly compelling is Madison's salient observation of the \nyear 1790, namely, that ``the present debt of the United States''--in \n1790--``far exceeds any burdens which the present generation could well \napprehend for itself.'' Even in 1790, the next year following the \nflowering of this new republic, under the new Constitution.\n  Madison believed in the ``descent of obligations'' from one \ngeneration to another. ``All that is indispensable in adjusting the \naccount between the dead and the living,'' he wrote, ``is to see that \nthe debits against the latter do not exceed the advances made by the \nformer.'' As I stated earlier, Jefferson later became President. Why \ndid he not propose a constitutional amendment? Why did he not lead an \neffort to propose a constitutional amendment to carry out the ``Earth \nBelongs to the Living'' theory? Say what you want; he did not do it.\n  To the contrary, in 1803, Jefferson encountered an unexpected offer \nfrom France to purchase the Louisiana Territory. Although he felt that \nhe lacked clear constitutional authority to act, Jefferson accepted the \noffer--and I am glad that he did--and incurred a public debt to pay the \nrequired $15 million. Where did he get the money? He borrowed it from \nEnglish and Dutch banks. Grappling with this contradiction now, \nJefferson said in 1810 that the question was ``easy of solution in \nprinciple, but somewhat embarrassing in practice,'' and then Jefferson \nwent on to suggest that the ``laws of necessity'' were sometimes higher \nthan the written laws of government and concluded that it would be \nabsurd to sacrifice the end to the means. I think he did the right \nthing.\n  I have no doubt that, once the American people are better informed on \nthis question before the Senate, the judgment of the American people \nwill be sound.\n  Talleyrand, who dominated the politics of Europe for 40 years--he was \nPrime Minister of France, who served under Napoleon--said there is more \nwisdom in public opinion than is to be found in Napoleon, Voltaire, or \nall the ministers of State, present and to come.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. But, Madam President, it has to be an informed public \nopinion. It has to be an informed public opinion.\n  And that is, more than anything else, why the Senate is the premier \ndeliberative body of the world today. It is the forum of the States and \nthe forum of minorities, and a forum in which there is unlimited \ndebate, the right of unlimited debate, only to be shut off by a cloture \nmotion adopted or by a unanimous consent agreement.\n  I happen to believe that the American people are not fully\n   informed as to the ramifications of this snake oil constitutional \namendment which would mandate--mandate--a balanced budget every year \nfrom now until kingdom come; every year.\n\n  Madison, in Federalist Paper No. 63, said:\n\n       * * * so there are particular moments in public affairs \n     when the people, stimulated by some irregular passion, * * * \n     or misled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men, \n     may call for measures which they themselves will afterwards \n     be the most ready to lament and condemn.\n\n  Now he was talking about the Senate. That is what Madison was talking \nabout. Go look at the Federalist Paper No. 63. He was talking about the \nSenate.\n  ``In these critical moments,'' he said, ``how salutary will the \ninterference of some temperate and respectable body of citizens in \norder * * * to suspend the blow meditated by the people against \nthemselves until reason, justice and truth can regain their authority, \nover the public mind.''\n  Madison was talking about the Senate.\n  ``What bitter anguish'' he said, ``would not the people of Athens \nhave often escaped if their government had contained so provident a \nsafeguard against the tyranny of their own passions? Popular liberty \nmight then have escaped the indelible reproach of decreeing to the same \ncitizens the hemlock on one day and statutes on the next.''\n  That was Madison, the father of the Constitution, talking about the \nSenate. William Ewart Gladstone--who was prime minister four times \nunder Queen Victoria--referred to the U.S. Senate as ``that remarkable \nbody, the most remarkable of all the inventions of modern politics.''\n  Madison was talking about the Senate, referring to it as a body of \n``temperate and respectable'' citizens who might interfere and \n``suspend the blow meditated by the people against themselves'' in a \ntime of partisan political \n[[Page S2236]] passion, ``until reason, justice, and truth can regain \ntheir authority over the public mind.''\n  That is why we have the Senate. That is why we are here to debate \nthese issues.\n  Madam President, for more than a week now I have listened with great \nfascination as some of the proponents of the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment have laid out every conceivable reason as to \nwhy we should adopt this measure. If I did not know better, if I did \nnot certainly think I knew better, I might be convinced by all of the \nrhetoric that the amendment is the silver bullet cure-all for \neverything that ails the country. But I do know better, and, more \nimportantly, the American people will know better, too, if only they \ncan be fully informed on the matter.\n  Unfortunately, left unsaid in all the pro-amendment talk has been one \nof the most important parts of this, what it will really amount to, \nwhat it really amounts to in my judgment will be an immense fraud: the \npeople's right to know how implementation of the amendment will affect \nthem. How will the adoption of this amendment affect you, Mr. and Mrs. \nAmerica, you and your children and your grandchildren?\n  And, contrary to what some may think, the public does have a right to \nknow how they will be affected. The people have a right to know how \nspending cuts on the magnitude of $1.5 trillion over the course of a 7-\nyear span will impact their lives and the lives of their children.\n  The fact that the public is beginning to understand that they are \ngoing to be hit and hit hard can be seen in the results of a recent \nnationwide survey. Last week, the American Association of Retired \nPersons released a poll, conducted by the Wirthlin Group during the \nlast week of January, which showed that 75 percent of the American \npeople want to know the details of what will have to be cut to balance \nthe budget before the amendment is voted on. Notice, I said ``before \nthe amendment is voted on.''\n  So, as will be seen by this chart here, the American people are \nsaying, ``Spell out the cuts.'' Spell out the cuts.\n  Three out of four Americans, according to this poll that was released \nby the American Association of Retired Persons last week, three out of \nfour Americans want to know, Madam President, where, oh where, we \nintend to come up with $1.5 trillion and they want to know it before \nthe vote on this fiscal pie-in-the-sky proposal takes place.\n  Even more amazing than those overwhelming numbers, though, is that \nthe support for the radical idea of knowing the details ahead of time \nruns across party lines.\n  The chart to my left plainly states that 68 percent of the \nRepublicans polled by the Wirthlin Group want to know what will be cut \nfirst before Congress passes the balanced budget amendment. Seventy-\nseven percent of the Democrats want to know. Eighty-three percent of \nthe independents want to know. Want to know what? What will be cut \nfirst?\n  They want to know first, before we adopt any such amendment, they \nwant to know the figures that will be cut.\n  These results of the poll show that the argument over the people's \nright to know is not a partisan argument. It is not, as some have \nsuggested, simply a way of delaying a vote on the balanced budget \namendment. Sixty-eight percent of the Republicans polled do not believe \nthat it is simply a way of delaying the vote. Seventy-seven percent of \nthe Democrats polled do not believe it is just a way to delay the vote. \nThey want to know what is in the amendment. Eighty-three percent of the \nindependents do not believe it is just a way to delay the vote. They \nwant to know what is going to be cut.\n  It is not, as some have suggested, simply a way of delaying a vote on \nthe balanced budget amendment. On the contrary, the people's right to \nknow is a very real issue that must be confronted. In reality, Madam \nPresident, none of the Members should be surprised by the poll results \nbecause the American people are not reckless.\n  People know, for example, that before they buy a house, they need to \nask whether or not the roof leaks. They know that before they buy an \ninsurance policy, they should read the fine print to see exactly what \nit covers. And they know if they want to cut the amount of fat and \ncholesterol in their diets, they should read the label on the foods \nthat they buy at the supermarket.\n  The people take the time to think about what they are being asked to \nbuy. They consider all of the pluses and all of the minuses of what \nthey are judging. They do not run out willy-nilly and lay down their \nmoney without asking for the details of what they are about to \npurchase. They do not take it on faith that what they are being told is \nthe full story. They ask questions. They ask questions. They expect to \nbe given clear and honest answers to their questions.\n  Now that the American people are asking questions, now that they are \nasking the details of the $1.5 trillion magic pill that will shrink the \ndeficit without pain or suffering, are they going to be ignored? Is the \nAmerican people's right to know going to be ignored? By refusing to \nhonor the public's right to know, the proponents will, in effect, be \ntelling the American people that we here in Washington know what is \nbest.\n  ``Take it on faith,'' is what the American people are being told. \n``Trust us. Trust us. Do not press us. Do not press us for all of these \nmessy details.'' Is that what Senators think the public was telling \nMembers last November? Do Senators honestly believe the message out of \nthe last election was that the American people want Members to pass \nlegislation in such a hurry that we do not tell the American people the \nramifications?\n  Does anyone think that the public is happy with being kept in the \ndark on this $1.5 trillion scam? In my view that is what it is, unless \nwe tell them, let them look under the hood, unless we tell them what is \non the label, unless we at least put a label on this bottle. If anyone \nthinks that, then they should think again. The American people have a \nright to know the details behind this amendment. They have a right to \nknow whether or not their children are going to be able to get a \nstudent loan, whether or not the national parks in their State will be \nclosed, whether or not the National Institutes of Health will be able \nto continue with breast cancer research, whether or not they will see \nfewer cops on the beat in their cities, whether or not the Federal \nGovernment will continue to offer financial help with highways and \nwater treatment plants in their communities. People have a right to \nknow.\n  Nearly everyone is making promises, as I listen, promises that Social \nSecurity will not be cut under the balanced budget amendment. There \nwill be amendments offered to exempt Social Security, we hear, and \npromises made to protect Social Security from cuts. I do not want our \nsenior citizens to be misled. Taking the Social Security trust fund off \nthe table does not totally ensure our elderly citizens from the \ndevastation of this amendment. Taking the Social Security trust fund \noff the table simply means that even more pressure for cuts falls on \nMedicare and on other programs that help the elderly, such as Meals on \nWheels.\n  Moreover, there are backdoor ways, backdoor ways of getting at Social \nSecurity even if it were to be taken off the table. One such idea which \nis being explored, I believe by our Republican friends, is to \nrecalculate the way we measure cost-of-living increases in order to \nhelp to reduce the deficit. That proposal, that recalculation, would \nactually mean a reduction in inflation adjustments for taxpayers' \nstandard deductions and personal exemptions on their income tax form. \nThose changes, then, would result in both a cut in Social Security \nbenefits and a tax hike to the recipients of Social Security benefits. \nSo Social Security recipients should not rest easy, even if the trust \nfund were to be exempted.\n  Social Security recipients will not be protected. The mammoth cuts \nthat will have to be made under this balanced budget amendment, even if \nSocial Security were to be taken off the table, will mean that state \ntaxes and local taxes will likely go through the ceiling so that States \ncan pay for some of the essential services which the Federal Government \nno longer will be able to provide.\n  The elderly, along with everybody else in the Nation, will see their \nincomes eroded by higher taxes in the \n[[Page S2237]] States. The elderly will be hurt by this balanced budget \namendment, whether or not the trust fund is exempted. And I say make no \nmistake about that.\n  Additionally, I do not want to see a kind of generational and \ninterest group warfare set up by the enactment of this amendment. There \nwill be interest group and generational hand-to-hand combat the like of \nwhich we have never seen if this amendment is adopted, and the warfare \nand sniping will worsen if Social Security were to be exempted.\n  A recent study shows that 26 percent of the children under 6 years \nold live in poverty in the United States. Do we want to set up a \nsituation that forces Members to choose between helping the elderly and \nhelping the children; helping the elderly and helping the grandchildren \nof the elderly?\n  What about pitting the elderly against their grandchildren? What \nabout pitting the elderly against the veteran? Certainly, we should not \nwant to see that. Many senior citizens also receive veterans benefits. \nThis amendment sets one American against another, one interest group \nagainst another, and would tend to force severe across-the-board cuts \nunder the guise of fairness. Instead of using our judgment, instead of \nlooking at what could and should be cut, Senators would likely buckle \nunder competing interest group pressure, put the blindfolds on, and \nenact sweeping, meat-ax cuts on all programs.\n  That would be bad public policy. But if that is to be the policy, \nthen the elderly, the veterans, the mayors and Governors, the parents \nand grandparents of the children and everybody else in America, \nincluding the Members of this body, need to know now, in order to be \nable to make an informed choice about the wisdom, or the unwisdom, of \nthis constitutional amendment.\n  Did the Senator ask me a question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thought you completed your comments. I will wait.\n  Mr. BYRD. I say to my able friend, I will not go longer than another \n5 minutes at most. The Senator has been sitting here waiting. I did not \nsee him sitting back there because this chart is between the two of us. \nIf the Senator will indulge me just another 3 or 4 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I have been enjoying it.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the American people have a right to know these things, \nand while many of them come to the floor to speechify on the need for a \nbalanced budget amendment, over the past 5 years we here in the \nCongress have already cut more than $900 billion from the deficit. In \nthe Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, Congress cut $482 billion from the \ndeficit. We followed that effort with $432 billion worth of deficit \nreduction in 1993--without, I would note, the help of many of those who \nfavor a balanced budget amendment. And each and every one of those \ndollars of deficit reduction, Mr. President, was cut without--without--\na constitutional amendment. What was required to do the job then, and \nwhat will be required to do the job in the future, was putting a budget \nplan out here on the Senate floor, getting down to business and \ndiscussing the pros and cons of the proposed cuts in full view of the \nAmerican public, and then voting up or down.\n  Yesterday, we were treated to several hours of bashing of the \nPresident's budget by the proponents of this constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget. But I hope that no one will be confused by those \ntransparent attempts to obscure the central point of this debate. That \npoint is that the American people need to know how the proponents \nintend to get to a perfect budget balance by the year 2002, and they \nneed to know it before their Senators vote on the amendment. The \nPresident has submitted his budget. He does not support a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget by 2002; therefore, it \nis not incumbent upon him to produce a budget that does so. He will not \neven have a chance to sign such an amendment or veto such, \nconstitutional amendment, because that amendment goes straight to the \nStates if we in the Congress approve it, God forbid. The President is \nlargely a mere observer in this process. The decision to amend the \nConstitution is a decision that is reserved for the Congress and for \nthe people of the several States.\n  But the President's budget is a useful illustration of one thing. \nBudget balance, or even a continuing glidepath to deficit reduction, is \ndifficult to achieve if tax cuts are part of the equation. Be that as \nit may, I believe that the President has given us an honest budget, \neven if I personally do not agree with it. I do not believe he has \ncooked the numbers. We have seen plenty of that in the past. He has \nheld the deficit steady, even though health care costs will grow by \nmore than 9 percent a year for the next 5 years. And I believe that we \ncould have had a continuing glidepath of deficit reduction if the tax \ncuts had been dropped from the President's budget.\n  But, the President has put his cards on the table. What about the \namendment's supporters? They say that they are in favor of this so-\ncalled constitutional amendment, but they refuse to show their cards. \nAnd, worse, they propose to start on the road to this constitutional \namendment with a gigantic tax cut--one that dwarfs the administration's \nmodest proposal, by something like three to one. Just last week, the \nstaff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the revenue \nloss to the Treasury, if the Republican tax cuts are enacted, would be \nalmost $205 billion over 5 years. Even that figure is somewhat \nmisleading because the tax cuts which the proponents are suggesting are \nback-loaded. Taking the back-loading into account, in the fifth year \nalone, revenue losses would be some $69 billion.\n  But, the proponents claim that, not only can they pay for these tax \ncuts with spending cuts; they can cut even further and get the budget \nto balance by 2002. So far, the proponents will only make vague \npromises about what they will not cut. They have listed Social \nSecurity, defense, and interest on the debt as items that will not be \ntouched. Those three items together make up a little over one-half of \nthe Federal budget. To get to budget balance by 2002, the proponents \nwould have to cut the remaining Federal budget by about one-third. The \nlargest category of spending in the half of the budget that is to be on \nthe chopping block are the health care programs. Medicare and Medicaid \namount to about one-sixth of all Federal spending. These same health \ncare programs, Medicare for the elderly and the disabled, and Medicaid \nfor the poor, are also the fastest growing programs in the half of the \nbudget which the proponents propose to cut.\n  So why do the proponents not stop talking about what they will not \ncut and tell the American people what they will cut? It is popular to \nsay Social Security is off the table. But how about telling the \nAmerican people what is left on the table? Medicare is on the table. \nState and local grants are on the table. Why not tell the Governors and \nthe mayors and the elderly about the cuts that will be necessary for \nbudget balance by 2002? Veterans pensions, civilian and military \nretirement pensions, highway grants, environmental cleanup, WIC, \neducation--all those items are left on the table. Why do the proponents \nnot show down? This so-called balanced budget amendment is their idea, \nnot mine, not President Clinton's. So, let us hear how the proponents \nintend to deliver. Let us know how the proponents plan to enact giant \ntax cuts, protect Social Security from any cuts, protect defense from \nany cuts, pay the interest on the debt and still get the budget into \nbalance by 2002. The silence from the proponents about the specifics of \nhow we get to budget balance is positively deafening. Why is that? Will \nsomeone please tell the American people why we are not laying out a \nplan for their scrutiny? I can only say what I believe. I believe that \nwe are hearing nothing from the proponents because it cannot be done, \nor because they will not do it.\n  We are already required to project the deficits for at least 5 years \nout. Why can the proponents not project the plan for this amendment, as \nit will affect the American people, 7 years out? I believe that we are \nhearing nothing from the proponents because they don't really want the \nAmerican people to know.\n  Tax cuts, coupled with removing Social Security, defense, and \ninterest payments from any consideration for spending reductions, make \nbalancing \n[[Page S2238]] the budget by 2002 without totally devastating the \neconomy of this Nation and the 50 States, is mission impossible.\n  Let us not tell the patient that he is going under the knife for \ncosmetic liposuction--lipo comes from the Greek, l-i-p-o, meaning \n``fat''--when, in fact, we all know that he will wake up with most of \nhis intestines and part of his stomach missing. Let us not sign on to \nthis contract with evasion. We hear so much about the so-called \nContract With America. This is a contract with evasion and deceit. \nUnless we tell the American people how we intend to get the budget to \nbalance by the year 2002 before we vote, this amendment amounts to \nlittle more than a contract with deceit. The Senate would have to be \ninfected with the virus of collective madness to adopt this contract \nwith deceit and evasion.\n  But as the poll shows, the American people have caught on to this \nunbecoming ruse, and they are not going to let us get away with it. \nPassing the buck is a political cop out. In the case of the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, the buck stops right \nhere.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to insert in the Record at \nthis point an article from the Wall Street Journal of today, titled \n``GOP Tax Cuts Are Seen Costly Over 10 years,'' which states that the \nGOP tax cuts would cost $704.4 billion over the next decade.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 7, 1995]\n\n               GOP Tax Cuts Are Seen Costly Over 10 Years\n\n\n   new congressional analysis finds loss of revenue reaching $704.4 \n                                billion\n\n               (By Jackie Calmes and Christopher Georges)\n\n       Washington.--Even as Republican lawmakers lambasted \n     President Clinton's budget for its failure to slash federal \n     deficits, a new congressional analysis put the cost of their \n     promised tax cuts at $704.4 billion over the next decade.\n       That analysis yesterday from Congress' nonpartisan Joint \n     Committee on Taxation, whose estimates are the basis for \n     Republican legislation on taxes, closely parallels the \n     Clinton administration's own earlier finding, which many GOP \n     leaders criticized at the time. Now both have found that the \n     revenue loss from the proposed tax cuts would balloon in \n     later years far beyond the five-year estimates of $200 \n     billion that Republicans previously have cited. The Treasury \n     Department last month put the cost of the Republican tax cuts \n     at $725.5 billion through fiscal 2005.\n       Although Republicans in Congress have vowed to offset the \n     five-year cost through $200 billion in matching spending \n     cuts, the effort has proved such a struggle that the House \n     isn't expected to act on the package until at least mid-\n     March. Only afterward will it turn to drafting a budget aimed \n     at slashing deficits. While Congress bases its budgets on \n     five-year outlooks, the new 10-year forecast for the tax cuts \n     is pertinent given the Republicans' current push for a \n     constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget by 2002.\n       Meanwhile, at a news conference on the president's budget, \n     Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole said ``the administration \n     has given up'' on the deficit, a realization that ``will \n     certainly help our cause to get enough votes for a balanced-\n     budget amendment.'' The Senate is in the second week of \n     debate on the amendment.\n       President Clinton and his advisers yesterday defended their \n     budget after it was released as one that would reduce the \n     deficit gradually if measured as a percentage of the gross \n     domestic product, the total value of goods and services \n     produced in the country. ``There is no magic amount of \n     deficit reduction that you need,'' Budget Director Alice \n     Rivlin told reporters. ``We now have a deficit that's under \n     control and coming down in relation to the size of the \n     economy.''\n       ``The best way or the most obvious way to do additional \n     deficit reduction,'' Ms. Rivlin said, ``is the one that we \n     talked so much about last year, namely, controlling the out-\n     year costs of health care.'' She described the \n     administration's decision to essentially ignore health-care \n     reform in this year's budget as a tactical one. The president \n     still wants to work with Congress to slow the growth in the \n     cost of health care and to improve access to health care, she \n     said.\n       The budget projects a deficit of $196.7 billion, or 2.7% of \n     GDP, in fiscal 1996, which begins Oct. 1. If Mr. Clinton's \n     proposals were adopted by Congress and if the economy \n     performs precisely as the White House projects--two unlikely \n     outcomes--then the deficit is projected to be 2.7% of GDP the \n     following year and to fall to 2.4% of GDP in fiscal 1998. But \n     it would remain around $200 billion a year for the \n     foreseeable future.\n       The new White House economic forecast published in the \n     budget shows that the administration thinks the Federal \n     Reserve is finished raising interest rates. The president's \n     economic advisers anticipated the increase of one-half \n     percentage point in short-term interest rates that the Fed \n     engineered last week, but they don't foresee any further \n     boosts, chief White House economist Laura Tyson said.\n\n\n                            ballooning costs\n\n       The congressional committee previously estimated that the \n     Republican tax-cut proposals would cost $203.9 billion in the \n     first five years. But over 10 years, the reductions would \n     cost the Treasury more than three times as much because the \n     cost of some proposals balloon in the future. GOP proposals \n     to reduce capital-gains taxes would lose $170.3 billion over \n     10 years--up from $53.9 billion in the first five years. The \n     Treasury projects similar revenue drains, of $60.9 billion in \n     the first five years, and $183.1 billion over 10.\n       The similarity of the Treasury and Joint Committee \n     findings--and particularly those on the much-debated capital-\n     gains proposals--provides striking evidence that the new GOP-\n     controlled Congress hasn't significantly departed from \n     longstanding procedures for measuring the impact of tax \n     changes. For years, some Republicans had vowed to overhaul \n     those procedures to reflect their belief that tax cuts boost \n     revenues through economic growth, rather than lose revenues.\n       Two GOP proposals that are shown to raise revenues over the \n     first five years would become revenue-losers after that \n     period, as Treasury had found. One, to liberalize the \n     existing deductions for individual retirement accounts, would \n     raise an estimated $2.2 billion through 2000 but then \n     increasingly lose revenue--for a total of $23.9 billion over \n     10 years. Early on, the new proposal would encourage \n     taxpayers to transfer existing IRAs into new ``American Dream \n     Savings Accounts,'' but they would have to pay taxes on the \n     amount transferred. After five years, however, savers could \n     withdraw money from the new accounts tax-free.\n\n\n                          write-off provision\n\n       The second provision, liberalizing write-offs for capital-\n     intensive businesses' plant and equipment, would raise $16.7 \n     billion over the first five years but lose $88.8 billion over \n     10 years. The early gain comes because the proposal would \n     create less generous write-offs for the first years of an \n     investment, in exchange for more generous write-offs later. \n     The Treasury found an even larger loss from this ``neutral \n     cost recovery'' provision--$120.4 billion over a decade.\n       The Treasury says President Clinton's tax cuts for the \n     middle class would cost $62.7 billion over five years and \n     $171.2 billion over 10 years.\n       Although many private forecasts anticipate further \n     increases in short-term interest rates, last week's \n     employment report has led some to conclude that the Fed won't \n     raise rates much more than it has already.\n       ``They'll be wrong on interest rates, but not by much. \n     We'll get one more rate hike from the Fed this year,'' \n     Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, \n     said of the White House forecast. The Fed has increased \n     short-term rates three percentage points in the past year.\n       The economic forecast in the budget says the unemployment \n     rate, now at 5.7% of the work force, will climb to 6% by the \n     fourth quarter of this year. But the president's Council of \n     Economic Advisers has already changed its mind and now \n     predicts that unemployment will range between 5.5% and 5.8% \n     over the rest of the decade.\n\n\n                           new or higher fees\n\n       Nearly all the significant features of the president's \n     budget were leaked over the weekend. Among the details in \n     documents released yesterday are a number of new or higher \n     fees, including some on small-business loans and pesticide \n     registration. The president also proposes:\n       To levy a border-crossing fee of $3 a vehicle and $1.50 a \n     pedestrian, with discounts for those who cross the border \n     frequently.\n       To fund the Commodity Futures Trading Commission with a 10-\n     cent fee for each round-turn transaction on commodity futures \n     and options contracts.\n       To charge federal employees for parking, but only where the \n     agency heads decide to do so.\n       To raise about $1 billion over five years by requiring the \n     Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve to \n     assess fees from state-chartered banks they regularly \n     examine. The fees would be calculated according to the size \n     of the banks; those with assets of less than $100 million \n     would be exempt.\n       To submit a plan to raise $4.8 billion over five years by \n     expanding Federal Communication Commission authority to \n     auction off more of the radio spectrum or to levy new user \n     fees.\n       To collect fees from medical-device makers that are seeking \n     Food and Drug Administration product approvals, using the \n     money to hire more staff to speed reviews.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Madam President, there is an old axiom in the court of equity that is \nhe who seeks equity must do equity; he who comes into the court of \nequity must come with clean hands. We have \n[[Page S2239]] had many chants and claims in recent days calling on \nMembers to submit a balanced budget.\n  Two weeks ago, with that equitable axiom in mind, I did exactly that. \nI felt that I lacked standing in this so-called court of the U.S. \nSenate to demand that my colleagues submit a budget blueprint that I \nhad not submitted myself.\n  Two weeks ago, I included it in the Record and attempted to highlight \ncertain realities of our present fiscal situation. The reality is that \nbalancing the budget in a 7-year period requires $1.2 trillion in \nspending cuts.\n  The other reality was that the savings from entitlement reform would \nnot be enough to balance the budget. Clearly, we must try our best to \nslow health costs and reform our welfare system. Likewise, we can save \nsome Federal dollars by reviewing supplementary security income as Mort \nZuckerman suggested in last week's U.S. News and World Report.\n  But putting these reforms in place costs money. Anyone who argues \nthat they can set up a work program for welfare recipients, care for \ntheir children, and reap large savings is whistling Dixie. Likewise, in \nreforming in health care, our focus has been on slowing the growth of \noverall spending rather than cutting back on existing funds. President \nClinton's commitment to health care reform has already led to \nmarketplace reforms in my own State of South Carolina. In fact, not too \nlong ago the chairman of the board of one of the largest employers in \nmy State said, ``Fritz, you keep on debating that health reform package \nup there, because whatever happens is healthy. Rather than seeing \nincreases, I am now getting a 10 percent decrease in premiums for \ncoverage of my employees.''\n  So while the President has done a magnificent job in encouraging the \nmarketplace to make reforms, we are still a long way from getting on a \nrealistic path to a balanced budget. In short, to stop the hemorrhaging \nin interest costs, spending cuts as well as taxes are necessary.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, to include once again in \nthe Record this particular document which lists the budget realities \nand a potential list of discretionary spending cuts.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Senator Hollings on Truth in Budgeting\n\n       Reality No. 1: $1.2 trillion in spending cuts necessary.\n       Reality No. 2: Not enough savings in entitlements. Yes, \n     welfare reform but job program will cost; savings \n     questionable. Yes, health reform can and should save some, \n     but slowing 10 percent growth to 5 percent--not enough \n     savings. No, none on social security; off-budget again.\n       Reality No. 3: Hold the line budget on Defense--no savings.\n       Reality No. 4: Savings must come from freezes, cuts in \n     domestic discretionary--not enough to stop hemorrhaging \n     interest costs.\n       Reality No. 5: Taxes necessary to stop hemorrhage in \n     interest costs.\n\n                                                                                                                \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   1996       1997       1998        1999        2000        2001        2002   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeficit CBO Jan. 1995 (using                                                                                    \n trust funds).................        207        224        225         253         284         297         322 \nFreeze discretionary outlays                                                                                    \n after 1998...................          0          0          0         -19         -38         -58         -78 \nSpending cuts.................        -37        -74       -111        -128        -146        -163        -180 \nInterest savings..............         -1         -5        -11         -20         -32         -46         -64 \nTotal savings ($1.2 trillion).        -38        -79       -122        -167        -216        -267        -322 \nRemaining deficit using trust                                                                                   \n funds........................        169        145        103          86          68          30           0 \nRemaining deficit excluding                                                                                     \n trust funds..................        287        264        222         202         185         149         121 \n5 percent VAT.................         96        155        172         184         190         196         200 \nNet deficit excluding trust                                                                                     \n funds........................        187         97         27         (17)        (54)       (111)       (159)\nGross debt....................      5,142      5,257      5,300       5,305       5,272       5,200       5,091 \nAverage interest rate on the                                                                                    \n debt (percent)...............        7.0        7.1        6.9         6.8         6.7         6.7         6.7 \nInterest cost on the debt.....        367        370        368         368         366         360         354 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Does not include billions necessary for middle class tax cut.                                            \n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

billions of dollars.                              \n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, we have heard a lot in recent days \nabout a simple way to balance the budget--the so-called 3 percent \ngrowth approach--which the Senator from Texas spoke of last week. But \nlet's look at the facts. According to CBO, \n[[Page S2240]] the budget is growing annually at about 6.2 percent or \nby $94 billion. Thus, if you plan to cut that in half to 3 percent \ngrowth, that is $46 billion. But wait, we all agree Social Security is \noff the table and will grow by $18 billion next year. Similarly, we \nwill have to pay the interest costs on the debt which will increase by \n$25 billion next year. Kick in the last $3 billion to try and hold the \nline on defense spending and you quickly see that there's not much left \nof that 3 percent. While seductively simple, this approach fails to \nspell out the impact on the American people. If the 3 percent is used \nup, what is the effect on Medicare and Medicaid programs, education, \nand law enforcement?\n  The glidepath that I have put before the Senate requires $37 billion \nin spending cuts for the first year. It meets that target by listing \nsome 80 spending cuts that I do not think for a minute would ever pass \non the floor of the Senate. In addition to cuts in discretionary \nprograms, I also included a list of possible entitlement programs to \npick and choose from that was circulated earlier this year by Senator \nGregg of New Hampshire.\n  We tried such budget cutting exercises before. Give credit to Senator \nDomenici, who was chairman of the Budget Committee in 1986, when he \noffered an amendment to adopt President Reagan's budget cuts. Do you \nknow how many votes they got? Fourteen, fourteen votes.\n  Last year, on the House side, Congressman Solomon corralled together \na list of cuts that had been recommended by various groups. He put them \nall together and came up with $700 billion in cuts over 5 years. Do you \nknow who voted against it? Congressman Kasich. Do you know who voted \nagainst it? Speaker Gingrich. Do you know how many votes they got? \nSeventy-three out of four hundred and thirty-five.\n  Madam President, you have to face the realities and I think one stark \nreality is the one stated by the House majority leader who feared that \ncoming forward with specific spending cuts would cause members knees to \nbuckle. That is the truth.\n  I have come to the floor this afternoon to say a word about those who \nare blaming President Clinton for not doing anything about the deficit. \nIf there is one fellow who had nothing to do with this deficit, it \nwould be President William Jefferson Clinton. He came from Arkansas up \nto Washington, and he inherited fiscal chaos.\n  I do not mean to sound rude. I mean to sound factual and to give you \nthe reality of the situation. Yesterday, we honored our distinguished \npast President, President Reagan, on his birthday. We gave him a \nbirthday present but he has given us a birthday present. That birthday \npresent is an increase in taxes of a billion a day. It is the biggest \ntax increase in the history of this land.\n  I constantly hear about the largest tax increase. We were there, this \nparticular Senator, and Senator Mathias on the other side of the aisle \nat the birth of Reaganomics. Eleven of us voted against the massive tax \ncuts that some called a riverboat gamble. President Bush called it \nvoodoo economics.\n  But the fact of the matter is this Senator voted against the tax cuts \nof Reaganomics and for the spending cuts. Only three Senators who voted \nagainst the tax cuts but for spending cuts: Senators Bradley, Mathias, \nand myself.\n  So we have positioned ourselves with some kind of credibility on \ntrying to balance the budget. When they talk about the biggest tax \nincrease in history, we only have to refer very quickly, Madam \nPresident to--and I was going to at length, but I only just refer to \nit--the article by Judy Mann in the Washington Post entitled ``Fiddling \nWith the Numbers.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Fiddling With the Numbers\n\n                             (By Judy Mann)\n\n       Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican meteor from New \n     Jersey, had the unusual honor for a first-term governor of \n     being asked to deliver her party's response to President \n     Clinton's State of the Union message last week.\n       And she delivered a whopper of what can most kindly be \n     called a glaring inaccuracy.\n       Sandwiched into her Republican sales pitch was the kind of \n     line that does serious political damage: Clinton, she \n     intoned, ``imposed the biggest tax increase in American \n     history.''\n       And millions of Americans sat in front of their television \n     sets, perhaps believing that Clinton and the Democrat-\n     controlled Congress had done a real number on them.\n       The trouble is that this poster lady for tax cuts was not \n     letting any facts get in her way. But don't hold your breath \n     waiting for the talk show hosts to set the record straight.\n       The biggest tax increase in history did not occur in the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The biggest tax \n     increase in post-World War II history occurred in 1982 under \n     President Ronald Reagan.\n       Here is how the two compare, according to Bill Gale, a \n     specialist on tax policy and senior fellow at the Brookings \n     Institution. The 1993 act raised taxes for the next five \n     years by a gross total of $268 billion, but with the \n     expansion of the earned income tax credit to more working \n     poor families, the net increase comes to $240.4 billion in \n     1993 dollars. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of \n     1982, by comparison, increased taxes by a net of $217.5 \n     billion over five years. Nominally, then, it is true that the \n     1993 tax bill was the biggest in history.\n       But things don't work nominally. ``A dollar now is worth \n     less than a dollar was back then, so that a tax increase of, \n     say, $10 billion in 1982 would be a tax increase of $15 \n     billion now,'' says Gale. In fact, if you adjust for the 48 \n     percent change in price level, the 1982 tax increase becomes \n     a $325.6 billion increase in 1993 dollars. And that takes it \n     the biggest tax increase in history by $85 billion.\n       Moreover, says Gale, the population of the country \n     increased, so that, on a per person basis, the 1993 tax \n     increase is lower than the one in 1982, and the gross \n     domestic product increased over the decade, which means that \n     personal income rose. ``Once you adjust for price \n     translation, it's not the biggest, and when you account for \n     population and GDP, it gets even smaller.\n       He raises another point that makes this whole business of \n     tax policy just a bit more complex than the heroic tax \n     slashers would have us believe. ``The question is whether \n     [the 1993 tax increase] was a good idea or a bad idea, not \n     whether it was the biggest tax increase. Suppose it was the \n     biggest? I find it frustrating that the level of the debate \n     about stuff like this as carried on by politicians is \n     generally so low.''\n       So was it a good idea? ``We needed to reduce the deficit,'' \n     he says, ``we still need to reduce the deficit. The bond \n     market responded positively. Interest rates fell. There may \n     be a longer term benefit in that it shows Congress and the \n     president are capable of cutting the deficit even without a \n     balanced budget amendment.''\n       Other long-term benefits, he says, are that ``more capital \n     is freed up for private investment, and ultimately that can \n     result in more productive and highly paid workers.''\n       How bad was the hit for those few who did have to pay more \n     taxes? One tax attorney says that his increased taxes were \n     more than offset by savings he was able to generate by \n     refinancing the mortgage on his house at the lower interest \n     rates we've had as a result. The 1993 tax increase did \n     include a 4.3-cent-a-gallon rise in gasoline tax, which hits \n     the middle class. But most of us did not have to endure an \n     income tax increase. In 1992, the top tax rate was 31 percent \n     of the taxable income over $51,900 for single taxpayers and \n     $86,500 for married couples filing jointly. Two new tax \n     brackets were added in 1993: 36 percent for singles with \n     taxable incomes over $115,000 and married couples with \n     incomes over $140,000; and 39.6 percent for singles and \n     married couples with taxable incomes over $250,000.\n       Not exactly your working poor or even your average family.\n       The rising GOP stars are finding out that when they say or \n     do something stupid or mendacious, folks notice. The jury \n     ought to be out on Whitman's performance as governor until we \n     wee the effects of supply side economics on New Jersey. But \n     in her first nationally televised performances as a \n     spokeswoman for her party, she should have known better than \n     to give the country only half the story. In the process, she \n     left a lot to be desired in one quality Americans are looking \n     for in politicians: honesty.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I quote:\n\n       The biggest tax increase in post-World War II history \n     occurred in 1982 under President Ronald Reagan.\n\n  Because when you cut all the revenues on the one hand and then you \nincrease all the spending on the other hand, rather than growth, \ngrowth--``growth.'' That is what they are trying to come up again with. \nIt is the same act, same scene, same players, same disaster, in this \nSenator's opinion. When they come up with that growth, instead of \ngrowing out of the deficit, we have grown into the worst deficit and \ndebt, saddling us with interest costs.\n  Madam President, in 1981 the gross interest cost on the national debt \nwith President Reagan--of course, he had nothing to do with that one \nbecause \n[[Page S2241]] that one was already made up by President Carter. But, \nincidentally, President Carter cut the deficit that he received from \nPresident Ford, and President Lyndon Johnson gave us a balanced budget. \nSo I have been around when we have been cutting deficits and when we \nbalanced the budget in this Government.\n  But President Reagan came to town and he was elected on the promise \nthat, ``I am going to put this Government on a pay-as-you-go plan.'' He \nsaid, ``I am going to do it in a year.'' When he got to town, he said, \n``Oops. This is worse than I ever thought. It is going to take 2 to 3 \nyears to do it.'' He cut back, and never increased that interest cost \nof $95.5 billion.\n  I am listening to the other side of the aisle and the blame game on \nPresident Clinton about what he said and what he is doing. President \nReagan said that he was going to balance the budget in a year and not \nadd to the interest costs. Rather, he has the interest up to $339 \nbillion, according to CBO, and that does not take into account the \nincrease by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve, here this past week.\n  So it is going to be about $350 billion, $352 billion--$1 billion a \nday. That is what it is. The interest cost cannot be avoided. It has to \nbe paid. There are two things in life: Death and taxes. It has to be \npaid. But interest cost is interest taxes. You get absolutely nothing \nfor it. The deficit this year is only conceived to be $176 billion by \nCBO. We would have a $67 billion surplus if President Ronald Reagan had \nnot given us that birthday present of the biggest tax increase.\n  So here they come to town and talk about ``taking a walk,'' ``white \nflag of surrender,'' and on ``life supports.'' I know Speaker Gingrich \ngives out to the troops the right expressions around here to make on \nthe 7 o'clock news. But that does not take over the facts. The facts \nremain that we are in one heck of a fix financially, and you cannot do \nit without taxes.\n  On that score, do not blame President Clinton. President Clinton came \nand struggled in his first year as a freshman President for a $500 \nbillion cut in the deficit, and there was not a soul talking about \ntaking walks. They squatted, sat in the chair fixed, on both sides of \nthe aisle, and would not move, would not give a vote. Then after he did \nthat, he went about health care reform. And in health reform, yes, he \nrecommended Medicare cuts. But he said, ``I have to get health reform \nwith it.'' Now they blame him.\n  Do you know why they blame him, Madam President? It is very \ninteresting. Because they put out the alternative budget, the ``GOP \nAlternative: Deficit Reduction and Tax Relief.'' This was last year.\n  You cannot get anything out of them this year except the blame game \nand the catchy phrases they are putting out here, and now the ``white \nflag of surrender'' and ``taking a walk.''\n  ``GOP Alternative: Deficit Reduction and Tax Relief; Slashing the \nDeficit, Cutting Middle Class Taxes.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The Republican Alternative Budget will reduce the deficit \n     $318 billion over the next five years--$287 billion in policy \n     savings and $31 billion from interest savings. This is $322 \n     billion more in deficit reduction than the President proposes \n     and $303 billion more in deficit reduction than the House-\n     passed resolution contains.\n       Moreover, the GOP alternative budget helps President \n     Clinton achieve two of his most important campaign promises--\n     to cut the deficit in half in four years and provide a \n     middle-class tax cut. The GOP plan:\n       Reduces the deficit to $99 billion in 1999. This is $106 \n     billion less than the 1999 deficit projected under the \n     Clinton budget.\n       Even under this budget federal spending will continue to \n     grow.\n       Total spending would increase from $1.48 trillion in FY \n     1995 to more than $1.7 trillion in FY 1999.\n       Medicare would grow by 7.8-percent a year rather than the \n     projected 10.6-percent. Medicaid's growth would slow to 8.1-\n     percent annually rather than the projected 12-percent a year \n     growth.\n       It increases funding for President Clinton's defense \n     request by the $20 billion shortfall acknowledged by the \n     Pentagon.\n       Provides promised tax relief to American families and small \n     business:\n       Provides tax relief to middle-class families by providing a \n     $500 tax credit for each child in the household. The \n     provision grants needed tax relief to the families of 52 \n     million American children. The tax credit provides a typical \n     family of four $80 every month for family expenses and \n     savings.\n       Restores deductibility for interest on student loans.\n       Indexes capital gains for inflation and allows for capital \n     loss on principal residence.\n       Creates new incentives for family savings and investments \n     through new IRA proposals that would allow penalty free \n     withdrawals for first time homebuyers, educational and \n     medical expenses.\n       Establishes new Individual Retirement Account for \n     homemakers.\n       Extends R tax credit for one-year and provides for a one-\n     year exclusion of employer provided educational assistance.\n       Adjusts depreciation schedules of inflation (neutral cost \n     recovery).\n       Tax provisions result in total tax cut of $88 billion over \n     five years.\n       Fully funds the Senate Crime Bill Trust Fund, providing $22 \n     billion for anti-crime measures over the next five years. The \n     Clinton budget does not. The house-passed budget does not. \n     The Chairman's mark does not.\n       Accepts the President's proposed $113 billion level in \n     nondefense discretionary spending reductions and then secures \n     additional savings by freezing aggregate nondefense spending \n     for five years.\n       Accepts the President's proposed reductions in the medicare \n     program and indexes the current $100 annual Part ``B'' \n     deductible for inflation. Total medicare savings would reach \n     $80 billion over the next five years.\n       Achieves $64 billion in medicaid savings over the next five \n     years, by capping medicaid payments, reducing and freezing \n     Disproportionate Share Hospital payments at their 1994 level.\n       Achieves additional savings through reform of our welfare \n     system totaling $33 billion over the next five years.\n       Repeals Davis-Bacon, reduces the number of political \n     appointees, reduces overhead expenditures for university \n     research, and achieves savings from a cap on civilian FTE's.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will not read it all. I want to be accurate:\n\n       The GOP plan:\n       Accepts the President's proposed reductions in the medicare \n     program and indexes the current $100 annual Part ``B'' \n     deductible for inflation. Total medicare savings would reach \n     $80 billion over the next five years.\n\n  And then:\n\n       Achieves $64 billion in medicaid savings . . .\n\n  So you see, that was $144 billion in savings that the President did \nnot stand over them for to ride on.\n  I saw my distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee on the House \nside throw a duck fit. Cover it. Oh, no. He got caught off base. He was \nthe one in December, I say to the Senator from Utah, who said: ``We are \non a roll. I have to meet the press, right here.'' He said: ``We have \nthree budgets now. When that is done, Alan''--he is talking to Alan \nMurray. He says, ``at the same time, we are going to move onto the \nglidepath of zero now.'' Who is taking a walk? That was December, one \nfor January, one of three budgets; we are moving, we are going, and \nwhere is his?\n  That is what the Senator from West Virginia wants. That is what this \nSenator wants. I put up mine. We ask that they put up theirs. This \nrings in my ears when they say take a walk, when they talk about the \nlargest tax increase in the history of the Government. We are suffering \nfrom the largest tax increase. That is why, with all the spending cuts, \neven in entitlements, on the SSI, some of the programs, and domestic \ndiscretionary, try it on for size. You are going to need tax increases \nin order to get on top of this monster. You are going to need tax \nincreases.\n  I recommended a 5-percent value added tax. I disagree with President \nClinton. I think the need of the hour is just that, to get physically \nsound, put us on a pay-as-you-go basis and a Marshall plan for the \nUnited States. We have 40 million in poverty. We have 10 million \nhomeless, sleeping on the streets of America. We have 12 million hungry \nchildren. We have the cities, dens of violence and crime; the land is \ndrug infested. And we have the biggest deficit in the balance of trade. \nThat age group between 17 and 24, 73 percent of that age group cannot \nfind a job out of poverty. They are the hope of the land.\n  We need now, with the fall of the Wall and the sacrifices to occur in \norder to keep the alliance together, to sacrifice for ourselves. We \nneed a 5 percent value added tax; $180 billion could start paying down \nthe deficit, the debt, take care of health costs, and get the country \nmoving with respect to women and infants feeding, Head Start, and title \nI for the disadvantaged. Biotechnical research at NIH, they are \n[[Page S2242]] cutting. They are all going around being proud to cut. I \ndo not believe in dismantling the Government.\n  I got the first triple A credit rating of any State from Maryland \naround to Texas. So I have been down the road. We know how to pay our \nbills. I have said time and again we need more South Carolina-led \nGovernment than Washington Government in South Carolina.\n  So I go along with my Republican colleagues on that particular score. \nBut when they come around here now and they say, about welfare and \npulling the wagon--that is another one. Pulling the wagon. The idea is, \nof course, that we here are pulling the wagon and the welfare people \nare all squatting in the wagon. We are all in the wagon and nobody is \npulling it, except maybe the Japanese who are buying the bonds. Yes. \nGet trade policy, and try to go against Japan. If the Chinese want to \nget out of this soup that they are in on CD's, tell them to buy a few \nTreasury bills and the Secretary of Treasury will come over and say, \n``I am sorry. We didn't mean to talk. We have a special relationship.''\n  We are in the hands of the Philistines because we have to sell those \nbonds to finance this debt. That is what is going on. They all know it. \nWe are all in the wagon to the point of $1 billion a day, and nobody is \npulling it. So let us get away from that particular expression. But \nthey do not want Government and everything else.\n  Another thing, then I will close. But I have to refer to this because \nI have the greatest respect for, and I have worked very closely with \nthe distinguished Senate majority whip, Trent Lott of Mississippi.\n  Senator Lott said, ``Nobody, Republican, Democrat, conservative, \nliberal, moderate, is even thinking about using Social Security to \nbalance the budget.''\n  Absolutely false. They are not thinking about it; they are working on \nit. When I was buddied up with the distinguished Senators from Texas \nand New Hampshire in Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, I talked to Senator Gramm, \nand the first page he gave me was an across the board cut entitlements \nincluding Social Security. I said, ``Phil, I can tell you now that is a \nnonstarter. You will not get a single Democrat, including me, that is \ngoing to vote for that one.'' So, we exempted Social Security and split \nit in half with entitlements and discretionary spending on one side and \ndefense on the other. I knew he was particularly anxious to cut Social \nSecurity. I am particularly unanxious to cut any kind of Social \nSecurity because it pays for itself. If you want a contract for \nAmerica, let us pull out the 1935 contract for the senior citizens of \nAmerica. As a result of that agreement, taxes are paid, put in a trust \nfund, and they want to violate it.\n  On July 10, I offered the Social Security Preservation Act before the \nBudget Committee. There were 20 yeas with the Senator from Texas [Mr. \nGramm] voting nay. Then, the distinguished Senator from Texas came \nalong last year and introduced his Balanced Budget Implementation Act \non February 16, 1993, at page S1635, and I read: ``Exclusion from \nbudget. Section 13301(a) of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 is \namended by adding at the end thereof the following: This subsection \nshall apply to fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 2001.''\n  I put section 13301 into the Budget Enforcement Act because I did not \nwant to use the Social Security funds. We put it into statutory law by \nalmost a unanimous vote on this floor. There were only two dissenters, \nbut we had 98 others who supported it. But the Senator from Texas, in \nhis own budget there, is proposing it.\n  Madam President, it is against the law to cite the deficit using the \nSocial Security trust funds, but Members of Congress and the White \nHouse violate it at every level. I cannot get them to enforce the law. \nI do not want to go along with any constitutional amendment that \nviolates that law, because I am talking about truth in budgeting. That \nis how we passed Gramm-Rudman-Hollings.\n  I could go on, Mr. President, but I want to yield. I will tell you, \nthis off-Broadway show generalities and percentages fails to tell the \nAmerican people the true facts about the fiscal crisis we face. I \nchallenge them, or anyone on this side of the aisle, or on any aisle in \nany House, to give me a 1-year budget that only grows by 3 percent.\n  Republicans can continue to give us the gamesmanship and the \npercentage arguments, but let us cut out this blame game. There is one \nthing we cannot charge William Jefferson Clinton with and that is the \nresponsibility for the deficit. He came up with a plan to cut it $500 \nbillion during his first year. The second year he has proposed \nterminating 131 programs and consolidating 271 programs into 27. He has \nnot left much for ``President'' Dole, if he ever takes over this budget \nin Government.\n  I do not believe in dismantling the Government. I think we live in \nthe real world and we have to come out here and quit dancing around the \nfire. Let's end the argument and provide the American people with a 1-\nyear budget that has only a 3-percent increase and puts Government in \nthe black. They cannot do it without taxes.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for yielding time, and I thank the \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Utah may \nwant to speak.\n  Mr. HATCH. I notice the Senator from Minnesota is trying to get to an \nappointment. So why do we not proceed. If I could ask some comity, I \nknow the Senator from Arkansas is waiting, too. Senator Specter would \nlike to speak. I will defer my remarks until later if we can go to \nSenator Specter for a few minutes after the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota, and then to the distinguished Senator from Arkansas; is that \nOK?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous that be the case--first the Senator from \nMinnesota and then the Senator from Pennsylvania and then the Senator \nfrom Arkansas and perhaps myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

HENRY FOSTER, JR., TO BE SURGEON GENERAL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \nwithhold judgment on Dr. Henry Foster, Jr., the nominee for Surgeon \nGeneral, until we know all the facts. I do not believe that performing \na legal medical procedure should be a litmus test for confirmation for \nSurgeon General of the United States.\n  According to news reports, Dr. Foster flatly denies what purports to \nbe a transcript of his statement that he performed ``a lot of \namniocentesis and therapeutic abortions, probably near 700.''\n  I am very much concerned about allegations that Dr. Foster \nmisrepresented his record. If the issue is veracity and character, that \nmay be a basis for disqualification. If the facts support Dr. Foster's \nstatement that he has ``performed fewer than a dozen pregnancy \nterminations, all in hospitals, and were primarily to save the lives of \nwomen or because the women had been the victims of rape or incest,'' \nthen his status looks much stronger, although the White House still has \nto answer for its representation that he had performed only one \nabortion.\n  If some wish to deny Dr. Foster confirmation because he has performed \nany abortions, then I believe the Senate should debate and carefully \nconsider whether a nominee should be disqualified where he has \nperformed a \n[[Page S2243]] medical procedure which is legal under the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  I do not believe that there ought to be a litmus test which would \ndisqualify a person from being Surgeon General if he/she has performed \na medical procedure which is legal under the U.S. Constitution. It is \nalready difficult to persuade qualified people to accept governmental \nappointments because so often the character of an individual is \nirreparably damaged by charges before the facts are known. What is \nprinted in the newspaper, uttered on television, or heard on the radio \nsimply cannot be erased. The facts cannot catch up with that.\n  I hope that the President and the Senate will give Dr. Foster an \nopportunity to state his case before we rush to judgment.\n  I thank the Chair, and again I thank my colleague from Minnesota for \npermitting the interruption.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2242-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2243-S2255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just associate myself with the \nvery, very thoughtful and important remarks of the Senator from \nPennsylvania. I thank my colleague for the timely and I think judicious \nand very important statement that he made on the floor.\n  Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Utah for his \ngraciousness. I know he wanted to respond to some of the remarks of my \ncolleague from West Virginia and the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, let me, first of all, present a little bit of context, \nwhich I think is important to this debate. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has calculated that to reach a balanced budget by 2002, \nsubtracting interest that we would save from projected spending cuts, \nstill we would have to cut a trillion dollars. The question is, where \nare we going to make the cuts? The question is, what kind of standard \nof fairness will be employed, and will this be some standard of fair \nsacrifice, shared sacrifice, if you will?\n  I have a lot of passion about this issue because I think this is the \ncentral issue of this Congress in this decade. But I think objectivity \nserves my subjectivity. I believe I can marshal evidence that will \nsupport my point of view, evidence that I want the people in Minnesota, \nour State, and people around the country, to carefully consider.\n  If you add to the equation the proposed $82 billion of defense \nincreases over the next 5 years in the Contract With America, and in \naddition the $364 billion that would be required to pay for additional \nRepublican tax cuts, Mr. President--by the way, tax cuts which I have \nnot supported since I think it is difficult, to use the old Yiddish \nproverb, to dance at two weddings at the same time, and to be talking \nabout deficit reduction while you are also in a bidding war to cut \ntaxes yet further.\n  I believe the Senator from South Carolina was trying to speak \ndirectly to that contradiction.\n  Then we have $1.481 trillion of cuts before us. The question that the \npeople in Minnesota and people around the country deserve an answer to \nis: Where are we going to be making the cuts? Who is going to be asked \nto sacrifice? Is it going to be by some standard of fairness? What is \nits impact going to be on people in Minnesota and around the Nation?\n  So far, Mr. President--and I would say this to my colleague from \nArkansas who has been really trying to push hard for defense and other \ncuts to be made according to some standard of fairness--so far, what \nthe Senator from North Dakota has called the Republican credibility gap \nreally sort of just stares you in the face, because all we have heard \nso far from Republican proposals is that there will be $277 billion of \ncuts. Not as in tax cuts, but budget cuts.\n  So on the one hand we have $1.481 trillion of budget cuts that have \nto be made to have a balanced budget in the year 2002 and so far the \nonly thing we have had listed is $277 billion.\n  Mr. President, that is one huge credibility gap. That is $1.200 \ntrillion to go.\n  Mr. President, given this credibility gap, it is in this context and \nknowing that we would be involved in this historic debate that, from \nthe very beginning of this 104th Congress, I have tried to push forward \non the idea of accountability.\n  Mr. President, what I worry about is simple. Given a bidding war to \ncut taxes, given a bidding war not to decrease the Pentagon's budget \nbut to increase the budget, understanding full well that Social \nSecurity is not going to be a part of this plan and is taken off the \ntable, understanding that interest that we have to pay on debts can't \ngo unpaid, then it is crystal clear to me that there are only a \nrelatively few other areas where cuts can take place.\n  Mr. President, my concern is that the deficit reduction that will \ntake place and the way in which we will meet a balanced budget \ndeadline, if in fact we pass this balanced budget amendment, will be to \nmake the cuts according to the path of least resistance; that is to \nsay, ask some of the citizens in this country to tighten their belt who \nare least able to tighten their belt.\n  Mr. President, I came to the floor early on in the session and I had \nan amendment on the unfunded mandates bill. It was a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment that we in the U.S. Senate would go on record that we \nwould not pass any legislation, make any cuts that would increase \nhomelessness or hunger among children. I could not get a majority vote. \nIt was defeated on essentially a party-line vote. I want people in the \ncountry to know that. I could not get a majority vote.\n  Then I had another amendment that said if we are going to talk about \naccountability, we ought to have a child impact analysis. When we pass \nlegislation out of committee, if there is a report that accompanies \nthat legislation, there ought to be a child impact statement. Mr. \nPresident, I could not get a majority vote for that.\n  Then I came to the floor several weeks ago and offered a motion very \nsimilar to the amendment that our leader, Senator Daschle, has \npresented, which is now before us.\n  This amendment came straight from our State of Minnesota, where the \nMinnesota State Senate unanimously, and the House of Representatives, I \nthink, three votes short of a unanimous vote, signed by the Governor \nJanuary 20, sent a resolution here. I took the wording of that \nresolution and brought it to the floor of the Senate as an amendment \nwhich essentially said that if we pass a balanced budget amendment, \nbefore we send that amendment to the States, we should present to the \nStates a detailed analysis of the impact of this amendment on our \nStates.\n  Where will the cuts take place? What is the budget over the next 7 \nyears? How will it shape the lives of the people we represent? Will \nthis become some shell game where a State like Minnesota sees cuts, and \nthen is required to raise taxes to make up the difference?\n  Under the balanced budget amendment, there will be cuts in higher \neducation, in K-12 education, child nutrition programs, early childhood \ndevelopment programs, veterans programs, agriculture programs, health \ncare programs, and others on which regular middle-class Minnesotans \ndepend. No question about it. In fact, they would have to cut them 30 \npercent across the board to reach this target, given the parameters \nthat have been set.\n  By the way, Mr. President, nowhere in the Contract With America, and \nnot once in the debate that has taken place in the Senate from those \nwho have been pushing so far for a balanced budget amendment, have I \nheard any analysis of all of the benefits of the tax loopholes and \ndeductions that go to large corporations and large financial \ninstitutions in America. We will cut child nutrition programs; school \nlunch and school breakfast; women, infants, and children's programs, \nbut we will not cut subsidies for oil companies.\n  Mr. President, this is the reason there is such resistance to this \nright-to-know amendment. I raise the question again on the floor of the \nSenate: What is it that we do not want the people in our States to \nknow? Were the Minnesota Legislature, Democrats and Republicans alike, \nand the Governor correct in saying before they send the balanced budget \namendment, please present an analysis of the cuts that will be ahead, \nand how it will affect our States so we know what we will have to pick \nup through an income tax or sales tax or property tax? And we are not \nwilling to do that. That goes against the very essence of \naccountability.\n   [[Page S2244]] Now, Mr. President, about a week ago, I filed a \nmotion that I will make on the floor of the Senate at the appropriate \ntime that would refer this House joint resolution to the Budget \nCommittee with instructions to report it to the Senate with a report \ncontaining a detailed description of the 7-year budget plan.\n  I say to my colleagues, here is the one irony to the debate. There \nare many ironies, but here is one central irony. If we believe, and \nmany do, that State legislators and Governors ought to understand the \nimpact of this balanced-budget amendment, if we agree that they have a \nright to know exactly what it is that they will be voting on for \nratification, if we agree that decisionmakers ought to know what they \nare voting on, if we agree that the people back in our States ought to \nhave an understanding of what exactly is going to happen, where will \nthe cuts take place, and how will it affect them, then it seems to me \nthat we as Senators ought to also know what the impact of this plan \nwill be on the people we represent before we vote on it.\n  That is why sometime during this very historic debate, I will move to \nrefer this to committee so that the Budget Committee can present to \nSenators a detailed 7-year plan on how to get to balance by the year \n2002, and then we will know what we are voting on.\n  Mr. President, I am not in favor of constitutional amendment, for all \nthe reasons that Senator Byrd and others have spelled out, I think in a \nmore profound way than I can. But as far as deficit reduction and \nmoving toward balancing the budget, of course we should do that. But \nhow can anyone vote on it until we know what the choices are? If we \nwere going to have cuts in the Pentagon budget, if we were going to \nlook at tax expenditures, if we were going to look honestly at how we \nknew to raise revenue, or if we were going to do this by some standard \nof fairness, I might be all for it; that is to say, an effort to move \ntoward balancing the budget. But there is no accountability here.\n  Now, Mr. President, in the last part of my remarks today, I want to \nspeak to one issue that I think tells the large story of what is going \non. I also want to ask unanimous consent that the amendment that I will \nbe filing today be printed in the Record. It would, at the appropriate \nplace in section 1 of this balanced budget amendment, amend the section \nwhich reads ``total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \nreceipts for the fiscal year unless,'' to add ``unless a majority of \nthe whole number of each House of Congress shall determine that \ncompliance with this requirement would increase the number of hungry or \nhomeless children.'' I believe we should all be held accountable on \nthis issue.\n  It seems to me a reasonable proposition that we do not want to do \nanything that would increase hunger or homelessness among America's \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I will file another amendment, and I am not sure I was \nclear in my unanimous consent. I would like to have both amendments \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will file another amendment that will \nsay again, in the same place as the first, ``a balanced budget unless a \nmajority of the whole number of each House of Congress shall determine \nthat compliance with this requirement would not provide for the common \ndefense and promote the general welfare.''\n  Mr. President, that comes from the Preamble to the Constitution and \nfrom section 8. When we are talking about the general welfare, it \nstrikes me that if it becomes clear that we are going to cut Medicare, \ncut Medicaid, slash and burn, make higher education not affordable for \nyoung people, cut into child nutrition programs for our children, we \nare moving away from investing in our people, in our communities. That \nhas had a lot to do with the general welfare.\n  Mr. President, there is one issue that I do not think has been \ndiscussed thoroughly on the floor that I want to talk about for a few \nmoments, and then I want to yield because I know Senator Bumpers is \nanxious to speak. That issue is Medicare.\n  Mr. President, let me be crystal clear with my colleagues: You cannot \ndance at two weddings at the same time. You cannot say you are for this \nbalanced budget amendment but you are unwilling to lay out where you \nwill make the cuts. But you already made it clear you want to increase \nthe Pentagon budget, you already made it clear you want tax cuts, you \nalready made it clear that Social Security is off the table, and then \nwe look at the big expenditure items that are left, and Medicare is \nclearly one of them. Of course, Medicare will be cut deeply.\n  Now, let me take Members back to last year's debate. We had some \nhealth care proposals, the single-payer plan being one of them, about \nwhich the Congressional Budget Office and General Accounting Office, \ndepending on which estimate we want to look at, talked about projected \nsavings of up to $100 billion a year.\n  And Mr. President, we had other health care proposals--for example \nthe President's plan--that talked about putting a limit on insurance \ncompany premiums. Some of us during that debate were talking about how \nwe could contain costs. The single-payer plan contained health care \nsystem costs while also providing universal coverage with choice of \ndoctor and a huge administrative savings. But, granted, the insurance \ncompanies would have to give something up.\n  And that's why Mr. President, very early on in the health care \ndebate, the whole issue of how we contain health care costs by putting \nsome limit on insurance company premiums was taken off the table. Huge \namounts of money were pouring into the Congress in the form of campaign \ncontributions. We saw a huge amount of lobbying from powerful \ninterests. No way were they going to see any of their profit hurt. So \nwhat happened was, the special interests made the argument that premium \nlimits--the only way you can do cost containment--would lead to \nrationing. What they neglected to say was that rationing only happens \nwhen you limit spending on one population without limiting the spending \non the whole system.\n  Mr. President, I want to be clear on the floor of the Senate today \nthat the very Senators who were most vociferous in their opposition to \nuniversal health care coverage--and we could not do universal coverage \nunless we could contain costs--the very Senators who blocked that \nlegislation, the very Senators who yelled about rationing, right now \nwhen it comes to deep cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, which will lead to \nrationing among the elderly and the disabled and the poor, have nothing \nto say.\n  Their silence is deafening. And Mr. President, here is why. Looking \nat some Treasury Department estimates, total Medicare cuts would total \n$404 billion between 1996 and 2002. Medicare cuts in 2002 alone would \nequal $106 billion. That translates into roughly $10,000 per senior \ncitizen over a 7-year period.\n  I hope that I was clear with these numbers. Let us not be fooling \npeople in any State. I do not want to fool people in Minnesota. There \nare going to be deep cuts in Medicare. There have to be. There is no \nway you can get there any other way: $404 billion between 1996 and \n2002; $106 billion in 2002.\n  Now, there are a number of ways that you could make these cuts. And \nnone of them makes any sense in a country where we are trying to \nimprove coverage and contain total system costs. One of the ways you \ncould do it would be to reduce provider payments. Most hospitals--and I \nknow, Mr. President, that you know this, especially in rural \nMinnesota--are already reimbursed by Medicare at less than cost. Let me \njust say this as best I can. We should be trying to improve health care \nin this country, not ruin it. When you cut the Medicare reimbursement, \neither your hospitals close--especially your rural hospitals--or your \nproviders have to make it up some way, and this leads to charge \nshifting. Those people who have private health insurance are charged \nmore and then their premiums go up and then less people can afford it. \nThat is where we are heading.\n  Not only are we going to have this kind of vicious cost shifting, but \nin addition, those people who are going to be most severely hurt by \nthese severe cuts in Medicare are going to be precisely the rural and \npublic hospitals \n[[Page S2245]] that have been providing care to those citizens who have \nhad the least care in this country and who have the most trouble \naccessing services.\n  A few days ago, I met with John Stindt, the CEO of Swift County-\nBenson Hospital in Benson, MN. Swift County-Benson is a small rural \nhospital 30 miles from Willmar, MN. Seventy-five percent of Swift \nCounty's revenues come from Medicare and 11 percent from Medicaid.\n  Last year they had a loss of $148,000 from operations. They have two \nfamily practice physicians and are desperately trying to hire more to \nhandle their patient load. Mr. President, they do not have any room for \nany further cuts. Do not ask people who cannot tighten their belts to \ntighten their belts. Do not sacrifice the health care of citizens in \nthis country who most need it. Cut the oil company subsidies, cut the \ninsurance company subsidies, cut some of the large global corporation \nsubsidies. I do not hear a word about cuts there. Deep cuts in \nMedicare, that is what is going to be. That is exactly the direction we \nare going in and that is why our colleagues do not want to spell out \nwhere they are going to make these cuts.\n  Mr. President, I lived 20 years in Northfield, MN and I can just tell \nyou that severe cuts in Medicare are going to have just a cruel impact \non rural communities. Hospitals in communities like Rush City, Aitkin, \nGrand Marais, Comfrey, Karlstad, Virginia, and Bigfork are all \nstruggling to make ends meet.\n  Closing down local hospitals does not make a lot of sense, either \nfrom a health care or an economic development perspective. There was an \narticle in the Minneapolis Star Tribune entitled ``When a Hospital \nCloses Its Doors.'' It talked about a hospital in Karlstad that closed \nlast week because of financial difficulties--low Medicare \nreimbursements--and the inability to recruit doctors. It left a \nnorthwestern community in shock and limbo.\n  Mr. President, in Minnesota, 10 percent of the population already \nlives 30 miles from their doctor. We are seeing an increased reliance \non helicopters to move people from rural areas to our cities to get \ncare. It is not cheaper to transport people by helicopter. And in \nMinnesota, helicopters cannot fly in the fog and in the snowstorms.\n  We should be supporting community-based health care, not dismantling \nit. The reason that many of my colleagues do not want to vote for a \nright-to-know amendment and lay out where the cuts will take place and \nthe impact these cuts will have on people that we represent is because \nthey know we are going to have to make these cuts, they know it is \nwrong, they know what its impact will be and they are unwilling to step \nforward and be accountable.\n  In Minnesota, there is a shortage of 300 physicians and 180 midlevel \nproviders in the rural communities. Places like University of Minnesota \nDuluth do a phenomenal job of training and retaining family \npractitioners who practice in rural communities. But, they need more \nthan a pat on their back and a cut in their training budget to continue \nthis work.\n  There are a number of other ways that these cuts will take place, but \nI just want to focus on one other. One option is to shift more of the \ncost back on the beneficiaries. Seniors already spend close to 25 \npercent of their household incomes on health costs, about $2,803 per \nperson, and I am not including the health care costs of people that are \nin nursing homes.\n  I have received more than 1,000 letters from elderly citizens in \nMinnesota who are concerned about Medicare costs. Let me just read a \nfew of them. A couple from Detroit Lakes, MN, writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: My husband and I are concerned \n     about Medicare cuts. When we reached 65, we were advised to \n     sign up for Medicare, so we did, also taking out medigap \n     insurance. We pay over $3,000 for medigap insurance plus the \n     Medicare that is withheld from our Social Security. Medicare \n     is a great help to decent taxpaying people. The GOP have a \n     contract for the American people. We feel that Social \n     Security and Medicare is also a contract with the American \n     people.\n\n  A woman from Coon Rapids writes:\n\n       We paid into both Social Security and Medicare all the \n     working years of our life. Reducing the deficit must be done \n     in a fair and balanced way. They did not ask our wealthiest \n     citizens and corporations to share the burden by giving up \n     their tax loopholes.\n\n  And she is absolutely right, absolutely right. Not one word, not one \nword in the Contract With America asking large corporations to share.\n  And finally a woman from Watertown, MN:\n\n       I am writing to you about the proposal to cut Social \n     Security and Medicare. I hope you will say no to these unfair \n     and irresponsible cuts. I am 86 years old. My husband and I \n     worked hard all our lives. He died 8 years ago after being in \n     a nursing home for 5 years. That took all of our savings. I \n     receive $489 a month from Social Security and I think I have \n     saved enough for my funeral. We never wanted to be a burden \n     to our children or anyone else. I recently had to go on \n     medical assistance. I have enjoyed good health, and I am a \n     foster grandparent to a child center three mornings a week. \n     We never missed voting and really worked hard for \n     conservation and betterment of our country. I hope this has \n     not inconvenienced your time. Perhaps you did not find time \n     to read it, but I surely hope you will vote ``no'' on that \n     proposal.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, for me that letter pretty much says it all. And, \nof course, we hear discussions about also restructuring Medicare. I'm \nwilling to hear some more details on this--none of which have been \noutlined for us--but it sounds to me like a poorly disguised way of \nforcing seniors into managed care and cutting their benefits. Managed \ncare should be an option for seniors--not a mandate.\n  I conclude this way with first, a policy discussion and second, a \nringing denunciation and enunciation.\n  Policy statement: We will have premium death spiral in health care if \nwe go forward with this balanced budget amendment which will \nnecessitate deep cuts in Medicare. What will happen is we will have to \nreduce the payments for our public programs--and many citizens are \ndependent on those programs--and providers will cost shift to those of \nus who have private insurance. The insurance premiums will go up, fewer \npeople will be able to afford coverage and\n the base of payers becomes smaller and smaller. Then you get more cost \nshifting and premiums keep going up.\n\n  Mr. President, last session we were talking about universal health \ncare coverage. We were talking about decent health care for our \ncitizens. And last session, when we tried to do that, my colleagues, \ntoo many of them, talked about rationing. They said cost containment \nwould be rationing--a catastrophic end to quality health care. Now we \nreally are about to ration because we are talking about cuts for only \ncertain programs. Now we are about to ration care for the elderly, \nration care for the poor, and ration care for the disabled. But do you \nhear any of those same voices yelling now? No. As I said before, their \nsilence is deafening.\n  I come from a State that had probably one of the greatest Senators \never to serve in the Senate, Hubert Humphrey. Hubert Humphrey said the \ntest of a government and the test of a society is how we treat people \nin the dawn of their life, our children; in the twilight of their life, \nthe elderly; and in the shadow of their life, people who are struggling \nwith an illness or struggling with a disability or those who are needy \nand those who are poor.\n  I did not come to the Senate to vote for a balanced budget \namendment--which is essentially a pig in the poke--when I do not even \nknow what it means, and when I have no idea as a decisionmaker where \nthe cuts are going to take place. I know full well, given the \nparameters of what has been laid out, that some of the deepest cuts and \nsome of the cruelest cuts will have to affect the very people that \nSenator Humphrey talked about. I am not going to be a Senator who is \ngoing to vote for cuts directly or indirectly in nutrition programs for \nchildren, and I am not going to be a Senator who is going to vote for \ncuts in a way that takes one of the most successful parts of health \ncare in this country and begins to dismantle it. I am talking about \nMedicare.\n  My mother and father both had Parkinson's disease, and every time I \nhear people criticize Medicare, I remember that for them Medicare was \nthe difference between being able to make it and utter financial chaos \nand disaster.\n  So, Mr. President, I just want to remind my colleagues that this \namendment in the Chamber right now, the minority leader's amendment, \nwhich has been superseded by the majority \n[[Page S2246]] leader's amendment, is right on the mark.\n  It is irresponsible, it is not being accountable, it is not being \nstraightforward to vote for a balanced budget amendment unless we have \nthe courage to lay out specifically where those cuts are going to take \nplace, what kinds of choices we are going to make, and how it affects \nthe people we represent. For my own part, I think people have made a \nbig mistake. I think this 2002 date makes very little sense, given the \nparameters that have been spelled out. For myself, we need to have \ndeficit reduction, and we need to invest in our people. That is the \nchallenge for us, and we should do it. But we ought to be \nstraightforward and lay out for the people in this country what that \nmeans to them. That I think is the only responsible approach to take, \nand as a Senator from Minnesota that is the position I take in this \ndebate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, there is a great story about Winston \nChurchill. It is probably apocryphal. Somebody was introducing him one \nnight at a dinner, and they alluded to his drinking habits. And whoever \nit was that introduced him drew an imaginary line on the wall and said, \nI bet if all the whiskey Winston Churchill had drunk were put in this \nroom, it would fill this room up to this mark. Churchill looked at that \nline, looked at the ceiling and said, ``Oh, so much to do and such a \nshort time in which to do it.''\n  Now, here we have a constitutional amendment, and everybody has said \neverything that needs to be said--well, I guess everything that needs \nto be said has been said but everybody has not said it. So I come late \nto the debate, 10 days after it began, to put in my 2 cents' worth and \nexpress my undying opposition to this proposal.\n  When it comes to the Constitution of the United States, I belong to \nthe wait-just-a-minute club. I confess that I voted for a \nconstitutional amendment early on in my career in the Senate. I would \nnot do it again.\n  I have taken plenty of political heat in my lifetime. I remember that \ngreat school prayer amendment in 1984 which would have allowed the \nschool board or the State legislature to compose prayers or adopt \nprayers composed by others and demand their recitation by the students \nin school. And now it has become so commonplace to offer an amendment \nto cure every seemingly intractable problem.\n  As to the Contract With America, I join my colleague from West \nVirginia. I am not a party to that contract. My contract is with the \npeople of America: the Constitution of the United States. But right in \nthis session, there is a proposal to require a balanced budget, which \nis the debate now, a proposal to again address the prayer in school \nissue, and a proposal to limit the terms of Members of Congress, which \nI also consider to be a very bad idea. Every time we demonstrate to the \npeople of America that we do not have the spine or the political \ncourage to deal with a pressing problem, somebody says, ``Well, let's \namend the Constitution.''\n  In 205 years, Mr. President, the Bill of Rights, the first 10 \namendments to the Constitution, have not been tinkered with. So far as \nour Constitution is concerned, 205, coming on 206 years old, we have \namended it 27 times including the 10 amendments which constitute the \nBill of Rights. So actually, the people of this country in their \ninfinite wisdom have seen fit to tinker with the Constitution only 17 \ntimes.\n  When you take out the constitutional amendment that said, ``We will \nnot drink,'' and the ensuing constitutional amendment of 1933 that \nsaid, ``We will drink,'' only 15 times in 205 years have we chosen to \ntinker with this very precious document. There is a fellow named Robert \nGoldwin at the American Enterprise Institute. I do not know him, but I \nwas reading an article by Robert Samuelson the other day where he \nquotes Robert Goldwin as saying, the first principle of a conservative \nshould be ``Don't muck with the Constitution.''\n  Now, I do not agree with the American Enterprise Institute very \noften. I do not always agree with Robert Samuelson. But I can tell you \nthere is infinite wisdom in that statement for everybody who considers \nhimself or herself a conservative. ``Do not muck with the \nConstitution.''\n  When the House of Representatives came back into session, and Speaker \nGingrich told Members of Congress that they ought to read some of these \nearly documents. Two that he mentioned were the Federalist Papers and \nAlexis de Tocqueville's ``Democracy in America.''\n  I read those in political science 103A. I read them again in law \nschool, and have read them a couple of times since then. The Federalist \nPapers, written by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay, \nwere published in New York newspapers explaining to the people what the \nConstitution would do, and why they ought to vote to ratify it. New \nYork and Virginia were key States and were absolutely essential for the \nratification of the Constitution.\n  Incidentally, do you know how old James Madison was when he wrote \nthat magnificent series of papers? Hamilton wrote most of them. \nHamilton was 31, and Madison was 37. I think John Jay was the old man \nin the crowd, and he was 44. But the point is that the most important \npoint that Madison made in the Federalist Papers was that we have three \nseparate branches of government, and we have created all these checks \nand balances so that one branch does not run amuck or usurp the powers \nof another. He said we should let the President nominate Supreme Court \nJustices, but Congress is the one that is going to have to sign off on \nthem. Time after time Madison returned to the theme of checks and \nbalances. Lets not muck with it now.\n  I will come back to this in a moment. There is absolutely no question \nthat this amendment is utterly foolish, totally unenforceable, unless \nthe courts, the judiciary branch of Government, enforce it. Who wants \nthat? You go back home to the coffee shop, Senators. Go home this \nweekend and walk into small town America in the coffee shop, and say, \n``We are passing that balanced budget amendment up there. We are going \nto get our house in order.''\n  Maybe some old farmer or small business owner says, ``Well, now, \nSenator, how you going to enforce that amendment?''\n  You say, ``Well, we are going to let the courts do that.''\n  And he is going to say, ``Wait just a minute. Are you telling me that \nyou people are so spineless that you cannot deal with this deficit, and \nso you are going to put a few words in the Constitution and buck it \nover to the courts?''\n  I promise you that you just lost his vote.\n  If there is anything America does not need or want it is for the \nCourt to say, ``Congress, you must raise taxes. Congress you must cut \nspending.'' Where? When? How much? In what programs? It is the height \nof folly.\n  You know sometimes we all ought to go listen to the folks at the \ncoffee shop more often. I never will forget in 1979 speaking to the \nNevada County Cattleman's Association. Jimmy Carter had just imposed a \ngrain embargo on the Soviet Union. I voted for it. I thought, ``We will \nshow those Soviets.'' And the embargo had an effect precisely opposite \nwhat we expected. It did not bother the Soviets at all. They just \nbought wheat in other places, and the American wheat farmers saw the \nprice of their product go down dramatically.\n  So this old cowboy said, ``Senator, you voted for that grain embargo \nagainst the Soviet Union?''\n  I said, ``Yes. I did.'' By that time, I knew I had done the wrong \nthing, and, I said, ``I am sorry about that. I will never do it \nagain.''\n  Then he said, ``I hope you won't Senator, because I think a fat, \nhappy Russian is a lot less dangerous to us than a starving Russian.''\n  I said, ``You are wiser than most of the people I serve with in the \nU.S. Senate.''\n  I remember in 1981 when President Reagan came to town, he said, ``We \nare going to grow our way out of this deficit. We are going to have an \neconomy so hot people will be paying more taxes, and we are going to \nbalance this budget in nothing flat.'' That was in 1984. Those were his \nwords. They were not mine.\n  Ronald Reagan is the one who said we will balance the budget by 1984, \nand that we might even do it in 1983. I remember it so distinctly. When \nwe \n[[Page S2247]] asked him how, he said, ``We are going to cut taxes, \ndouble defense spending, and balance the budget.'' And with the utmost \nrespect to everybody who was here at the time, I say it was a lunatic \nidea; sheer lunacy. When I die I want my epitaph to say, ``Dale Bumpers \nwas 1 of the 11 Senators in the U.S. Senate that voted no.'' Very \nshortly after that vote we saw the deficit start zooming. That was $3.5 \ntrillion ago, Senator; 14 years and $3.5 trillion ago that we were told \nthat was the way to balance the budget.\n  Did you know that if we had not done that, if we did not have those \nmammoth deficit increases during the 12 years before Bill Clinton \nbecame President--the deficit today would be $800,000, less than $1 \nmillion. Virtually every dime of the interest we are paying on the \nnational debt today is due to the deficit from 1981 to 1992.\n  So everybody says, well, we mucked that up. We forgot something. What \ndid we forget? We forgot to put a few words in the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, you could put all the words in the Constitution you \nwant to put in, and it will not matter. I do not mean to be denigrating \nto anyone, but I can tell you what this is all about. It is about two \nor three things.\n  No. 1, it is about putting the balanced budget amendment into the \nConstitution, your simply declaring that we will achieve balance by the \nyear 2002. Then everybody hoped and assumes that by the year 2002 the \nAmerican people have forgotten what was said in 1995.\n  No. 2, what we are in effect saying is that we do not have the spine \nor the courage to do what we have to do to get the deficit under \ncontrol. Therefore, let us put a few words in the Constitution that we \ncan hide behind for at least another 7 years. Members will say, ``I \nprobably will want to be out of here then anyway, so what difference \ndoes it make?''\n  Finally, Mr. President, the Contract With America says we will amend \nthe Constitution, and we will balance the budget by 2002 or 2 years \nafter the States ratify the Constitution, whichever is later.\n  I want you to think about that. What does that mean? It means that \nthe people who are championing this amendment and saying ``Trust me,'' \nare also saying that we will cut spending by $1.6 trillion to $2 \ntrillion over the next 7 years, and we will do it while increasing \ndefense spending and we will not touch Social Security, and obviously, \nwe cannot touch interest on the debt.\n  So what does that mean? That means that at least 30 percent of all \nthe rest of Government spending has to be cut. There is not one person \nin this body, Republican or Democrat, who believes that is even \nremotely possible--not even remotely possible. Yet, we plow ahead \nasking the American people to not probe too deeply into what we are \ndoing here, hoping they will not expose us for our hypocrisy and our \ncynicism.\n  When the year 2002 rolls around and the deficit is still soaring, we \nwill have done exactly what Alexander Hamilton said we should guard \ncarefully against, and that is: Do not raise people's expectations \nbeyond the point of fulfillment. Every time you promise the American \npeople something you fail to deliver, they become that much more \ncynical.\n  Mr. President, let me show you a chart here regarding the space \nstation. Everybody knows that I think the space station is an utter \nwaste of money. I saw the picture this morning of the Russian cosmonaut \nwaving at the American astronauts. That is heady stuff--sending a \nshuttle up there and to come within 35 feet of the Russian space \nstation Mir. I do not want to berate the space station, but that is the \nseventh space station Russia has had orbiting the Earth. One guy aboard \nhas been on it 2 years. We say we want to put one up there, too. That \nis going to cost about $70 billion.\n  So last year, 63 Senators voted for a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget, yet within 3 months, 43 of them voted to plow ahead \nwith this $70 billion boondoggle, the space station. Some of the other \namendments I offered last year to cut spending were just as \nembarrassing, or more so. So now we have people saying, ``Well, it did \nnot work in 1981 when we proposed to cut taxes, raise defense spending, \nand balance the budget. But this time we really mean it, and we are \ngoing to put some words in the Constitution, and now it will work.'' \nSome very wise reporter here in Washington has properly called it deja \nvoodoo.\n  You remember the comedian Flip Wilson, who use to say ``The Devil \nmade me do it!'' I suppose people in this body think that in the future \nwhen they have to make the tough choices and cut spending, they will \nhave the Constitution to rely on. They can go home, and when everybody \nis irritated because their program got cut, they can say, ``The \nConstitution made me do it!'' If we just put a few lines into the \nConstitution, you can go home and say, ``We had to cut Medicare, Social \nSecurity, and all of those things because the Constitution made me do \nit.'' But did it? Will it?\n  This proposal, as the Senator from Utah well knows, provides that if \n60 people in this body want to vote to unbalance the budget, the budget \nwill be unbalanced and we can have all the deficit spending we want. If \nyou do not think they will do that, look at this chart. This bar \nrepresents the 60 votes it would require to unbalance the budget and \nthese bars represent the votes we made on the 13 appropriations bills \nlast year. The lowest vote on any appropriation bill was 71. On average \nthe appropriations bills, where we do the real spending, passed with \n84.5 votes.\n  So, do you think the Members of the Senate are not going to vote to \nunbalance the budget if it means a cut in Social Security and Medicare? \nWhen you mention those two programs, 100 Senators dive under their \ndesks. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that 60 Senators will \nnot vote to unbalance the budget. Where does that leave you? Let us \nassume that the economy is in a recession, as it was in 1929 and 1930 \nand 1931, and only Government can bring it out and avoid a depression. \nSo somebody comes on the Senate floor and says we have to vote for \nspending money we do not have because people are homeless, out of work, \nand they are hungry; we have to vote to unbalance the budget until we \nget over this recession. Forty-one Senators--a very slim minority--can \nsay, no, we are not going to unbalance the budget. Forty-one Senators \ncan bring this country to its knees by refusing to address a dramatic \neconomic crisis in the country.\n  Do you know another thing I remember about the Reagan years and the \nCarter years? Senators, especially on that side of the aisle, decided \nthey would quit voting to raise the debt limit to match spending. \nThat's liking going into a restaurant and eating the biggest steak and \nwhen they bring the bill, you say, ``I am not going to pay it.'' So \neverybody thought this it would be a great campaign issue to vote not \nto raise the debt ceiling. They said, ``I voted for all these \nappropriations bills, all the spending; but now I have decided I am not \ngoing to vote to raise the debt ceiling.'' That happened five times in \n5 years. And one time we brought the Government to a halt over the \nweekend and a good part of Monday and Friday, and it cost the taxpayers \nof this country $150 million. That is just peanuts compared to the \ndamage we risk under this amendment. Under this amendment, 41 Senators \ncan bring this country to its knees.\n  Do you think when that thing comes up on the floor, though, and \nsomebody says we are going to have to cut Social Security 10 percent, \ncut 20 percent out of Medicare, we are going to have to close 18 \nveterans' hospitals, we are going to have to cut back civil service \npensions, do you think 60 Senators will not vote in a minute to \nunbalance the budget?\n  (Mrs. HUTCHISON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, to the lay people who may not \nunderstand the workings of Congress, here is the way it works. The \nBudget Committee goes into session when we first come into session, and \nthey decide what revenues next year are expected to be, how much we are \ngoing to take in. And then they go through the various budget functions \nand they say, here is how much we are going to spend. And they say, in \norder to have a balanced budget, we have to cut spending by this \namount. Let us assume, just for easy figuring, that they say we are \ngoing to have $2 trillion in revenues and here is our $2 trillion in \nexpenditures, the budget is balanced.\n  They bring it before the Senate. It passes by a lopsided majority. We \npat \n[[Page S2248]] ourselves on the back, give ourselves the good \nGovernment award, and go home happy as a clam.\n  Then, October 1 rolls around and it looks as though the economy is \nnot doing so well. Within 5 or 6 months, it is obvious that we are \ngoing to have a $50 billion deficit.\n  So what happens? Well, somebody goes to court and says, ``Why, those \nclowns told us they had a balanced budget, and look here. They are \ngoing to run a $50 billion deficit.''\n  Who can sue? First of all, will the Federal courts have jurisdiction? \nWe do not know. Not one person in this body can answer that question.\n  Second question: Who has standing to challenge the budget in Federal \ncourt? Everybody? Taxpayers? State and local governments? Foreign \nnationals? We do not know.\n  Third question: What will we do while the current budget is tied up \nin court? We do not know.\n  Fourth question: How will the amendment force Congress to reach an \nagreement as to what they are going to cut or what tax hikes they are \ngoing to adopt? We do not know.\n  Fifth: Would the courts find that enforcement of the balanced budget \namendment is a political question on which they refuse to rule? We do \nnot know.\n  Sixth question: Can the Congress just ignore the amendment as \ndrafted, and go merrily on their way? They probably can, and they \nprobably would.\n  Another scenario: Let us assume that even before October 1, in the \nbeginning of the year 2002, as soon as Congress adopts the budget \nresolution, 6 months before October 1, somebody says, ``Why, you guys \nare crazy. What are you talking about? You're projecting a $2 trillion \nincome. You're not even going to come close.''\n  They go to court even before the year starts and say, ``Those people \nare mucking with the figures, cooking the books. They say they are \ngoing to have an income of $2 trillion when they are going to be lucky \nto have $1.9 trillion. Make them do it right. Make them cut more \nspending or raise taxes.''\n  And let us assume for the purposes of argument that court then says, \n``You're right. I agree with you. Those people have overestimated \nrevenues by $100 billion,'' and issues an order to Congress to close \nthe gap and Congress does not do it. Can the court raise taxes to make \nus comply with this amendment? Maybe.\n  Would that not be a beautiful thing to see? Would that not be \nsomething? James Madison would be whirling so hard in his grave, it \nwould be like a fan in the kitchen. He would be saying, ``What have \nthose clowns done to abdicate their responsibility to another branch of \nGovernment, the one thing I warned against?''\n  Madam President, I could go on with scenarios like this.\n  Senator Johnston has an amendment that is going to clarify this. It \nis going to say the courts can take jurisdiction over these questions. \nI think it ought to be clarified. Can they or can they not? And if the \ncourts cannot take jurisdiction, if the courts have no role to play in \nthis, who is going to enforce it? There is nobody left but us. If we \nare the ones that are already flagrantly violating the constitutional \namendment we are debating here today, we are flagrantly violating it, \ndo you think we are going to correct it?\n  Let us assume, finally, one further scenario. Let us assume that my \ncolleague, Senator Pryor over here, is so upset about the fact that he \ndoes not believe we have a balanced budget, and maybe the court has \nalready said ``You are right. The budget is $100 billion off, but this \nis a political question and we are not going to get involved in it. \nThis would be meddling in legislative affairs and we are not going to \ndo it.''\n  So then Senator Pryor goes to court and says: ``I want an injunction \nto prevent the Treasury Department from issuing one single bond, T-\nbill, or note to pay off that $100 billion deficit for this year.''\n  A court might take jurisdiction of a case like that. The plaintiff \nwould simply be saying that if compliance with the balanced budget \namendment is a political question and the courts are not going to make \nCongress pass a balanced budget, then keep them from doing anything, \nnamely, issuing scrip, bonds, notes to cover the deficit.\n   Some will say the courts will not do that, but in fact they already \nhave. Most people here have heard of Missouri versus Jenkins, the \nKansas City segregation case where the courts ordered the city of \nKansas City to raise taxes. The Supreme Court affirmed it.\n  You know something, Madam President, if I went home to that same \ncoffeeshop I talked about a moment ago and I told my friends sitting \naround the coffee shop in Charleston, AR, that the effect of this \namendment would be to turn the budget over to the courts and the courts \nwould have jurisdiction to raise taxes or cut spending, the balanced \nbudget amendment would not have a 75-percent approval rating; it would \nbe lucky to get a 25-percent approval rating.\n  Madam President, we keep dealing with distractions and issues that \nare not relevant to the real problems of this country.\n  The Contract With America has some things in it which are legitimate \nand which Democrats ought to join Republicans in passing, as we have \nalready done on the congressional compliance question. In thumbing \nthrough the Federalist Papers yet once again this weekend, I found that \nJames Madison talked considerably about the House. Strangely, he did \nnot say Congress or the Senate. He said the House of Representatives \nshould be very careful not to pass a law from which they are protected.\n  So we are 205 years late passing a bill to make us comply with the \nlaws other people have to comply with, and I was happy to vote for that \nbill.\n  But this idea that we are going to do middle-class tax cuts--when it \ncomes to doing what is popular, Madam President, let me tell you \nsomething that is interesting. Seventy-nine percent of the people say \nthey favor a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Over 80 \npercent favor the right-to-know amendment, which is the pending \nbusiness here. The right-to-know amendment simply says if you people in \nCongress are so hot for this amendment and you can balance the budget \nby the year 2002, you tell us now how you are going to cut between $1.5 \nand $2 trillion between now and the year 2002.\n  That is an absurdity on its face. It is as utterly impossible as my \nsoaring out of here into the heavens, flapping my arms.\n  We have a right to know. And the reason everybody is silent is \nbecause they do not have a clue as to how they would even come close to \ncutting that kind of spending. It is ridiculous in the extreme.\n  Yesterday, the Joint Tax Committee, which does the best job of \nestimating, says the Republican tax cuts over the next 10 years--listen \nto this, I say to the Senator--those tax cuts are $704 billion.\n Add that to the trillion-dollar base line just for the first 7 years, \n$704 billion in lost revenue for the middle-class tax cut plus the \ncapital gains tax cuts and the IRA's. That ought to cause people to \nwake up screaming.\n\n  What is the biggest item on the budget now? Interest. Interest on the \ndebt. But talk about how popular this amendment is, the right to know \nis popular, too. Know what else is popular? The idea that if we can \nfind $80 or $200 billion in spending cuts to provide for a middle-class \ntax cut, we should apply that money to reducing the deficit, rather \nthan a tax cut. And 81 percent of the people favor that idea, Senator.\n  I disagree with the President's budget to this extent. I am not \nwilling to accept $190 to $200 billion a year in deficits for the next \n7 or 8 years. We can do better. We can do a lot better. I have seven \nbills pending that will save $133 billion over the next 15 years, $33 \nbillion over the next 5 years.\n  Madam President, we have big problems. We have a crime problem. We \nhave welfare problems. Our educational system has been failing \nmiserably. Our culture is degenerating. On that point, is it not \ncurious that when people are becoming increasingly uncivil to each \nother and we have crime on every street corner, the proposals in the \nHouse are to cut funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, \nthe one station we can watch without getting blood all over ourselves. \nOne small piece of culture left, and they want to torpedo that.\n  That is not enough. They want to abolish the Education Department. \nTake ourselves back to the stone age \n[[Page S2249]] while we are at it. And abolish the National Endowment \nfor the Arts, without which the State of Arkansas probably would not \nhave the Arkansas Symphony. Who cares about the old music that Bach and \nBeethoven and all those guys wrote 200 or 300 years ago? Get rid of \nthat, too. The National Endowment for the Humanities who gave Arkansas \na $50,000 grant when I was Governor and allowed Betty Bumpers to start \nartist programs in every first grade in the State. Get rid of that. \nWhat are we doing teaching first graders about art? What a waste. They \nare trying to scrap every smidgen of culture left in this society.\n  There are not any words that we can put into the Constitution, Madam \nPresident, that are going to stiffen one single spine. Not one word in \nthe Constitution will make somebody vote against Social Security or the \nspace station, the latter, particularly if there is a contract \nproviding 500 jobs in your State. No, words in the Constitution do not \nchange people's character. We vote for what is popular around here.\n  James Madison, again, ``Do not take that stale bait of popularity * * \n*,'' as opposed to what is best for the country. Many of the people of \nthis country think there is enough waste, fraud, and abuse to balance \nthe budget. A lot of them think if we change our salaries and the \npension fund we could balance the budget. Take away our airport \nparking, install term limits. With issues like that, nobody will notice \nmuch of anything we do around here.\n  In August 1993 we did something that we are asking the Republicans to \ndo this year. I will never forget the month or the year. We said we \nwould get the budget deficit going down, and keep it going down. We \nsaid we would do that by raising taxes on the wealthiest 1.2 percent of \nthe people in this country by $250 billion, and cutting spending by \n$250 billion. And we did it. We did it just before the August recess. I \nvoted for it, unhappily. Even though we told people exactly what we \nwere going to cut, exactly what the tax hike would be, we still did not \nget one single Republican vote. Not one.\n  Now the $500 billion in deficit reduction we promised over the next 5 \nyears, has turned into nearly $600 billion, maybe headed for $700 \nbillion. It was the most courageous thing, the most important thing \nthat has been done since I have been in the Senate.\n  I have screamed my head off about the deficit. I have offered \namendments here every fall to cut spending. I might as well be shouting \nin a rain barrel. But we passed that bill, 50 votes from Democrats \nalone, plus the Vice President in the Senate Chamber. Everybody knew \nexactly what we were doing.\n  And now we are saying, You tell us exactly how you will come up with \nalmost $2 trillion in spending cuts in the next 7 years. Why should \nthey not? People on Social Security want to know if they are included. \nPeople on Medicare, people on Medicaid, people who pay taxes, want to \nknow what it will do to them.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Senator, Madam President, he is so eloquent \nin bringing home this point to the American people. We put ourselves \nout here on the line and we cast a tough vote.\n  By the way, I serve on the Budget Committee. I will tell the Senator \nthat Members should have heard the Republicans in the Budget Committee. \nI have their comments in writing. ``This thing will lead to higher \ndeficits. This budget will lead to unemployment. This will be the worst \nthing that ever happened.'' In fact, we have the best economy that we \nhave had in 25 years.\n  So I would say to my friend, since our colleagues will not tell \nMembers what they have in mind for the American people, we have to make \nsome educated guesses on that point. I would ask my colleague this: Is \nit not true that the Republicans said they would not touch Social \nSecurity even though they are not supporting removing it from this \namendment? Have they not said they are taking that off the table?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, the Senator is absolutely right. They \nhave said they will not touch Social Security, and obviously they \ncannot avoid interest on the debt. Although they did not say defense \nwas off the table, they said, ``We will increase defense spending.'' I \nthink one could assume if they increase spending it is also off the \ntable.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I was going to make that point.\n  The contract calls for increases in military spending, even though, \nas we know, we are spending in excess of two to five times than of all \nour enemies combined. So if they take Social Security off the table, I \nsay to my friend, and if defense is taken off the table, and if they \ncome through with a $700 billion tax cut, I ask my friend what is going \nto happen to Medicare? What is going to happen to veterans' benefits? \nWhat is going to happen to crime fighting? What will happen to the \nBorder Patrol? What will happen to roads and highways and freeways and \nresearch on breast cancer that is so important, and AIDS and other \nthings that are real threats to the people of this Nation.\n  If the Senator, who has been around here a lot longer than I, could \npaint that picture I would greatly appreciate it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, let me just say that common sense \ndictates three or four conclusions that seem obvious to me.\n  No. 1, the Contract With America says we will not include Social \nSecurity or interest on the debt. Obviously we cannot do anything about \ninterest on the debt. We have to pay it. As I said, they are proposing \nto increase defense spending. That leaves Medicare, and Medicaid, and \nit leaves nondefense domestic discretionary spending.\n  In order to reach a balanced budget under that scenario, we would \nhave to cut crime prevention, education, highways, law enforcement, \neverything that goes to making us a decent civilization. We would have \nto cut every one of those by at least 30 percent. In my opinion, in \n2002 we would still have a deficit. I appreciate the Senator raising \nthe question.\n  If you want to do what is popular, vote for this amendment. There is \nnot any question about its popularity. Public opinion is contradictory \nabout it because the people also support the right to know amendment \nwhich would require to say what we are going to cut. Seventy-four \npercent of the American people want the middle-class tax cut to be \napplied to the deficit instead of their tax bill. They want that to go \non the deficit. Yet, the same people who are hot for a middle-class tax \ncut ignore the popular will of the people on that one.\n  But I am willing to admit I am going to vote ``no'' on this, and that \nis not the popular vote. So if you want to do what is popular, you vote \n``aye.''\n  If you really, in your heart of hearts, believe that you can meet the \nmandate that I just laid out for you about balancing the budget in the \nyear 2002, for God's sake vote ``aye'' if you think you can do that.\n  If you think the Founding Fathers did not know what they were doing \nwhen they crafted this most magnificent of all organic laws in the \nworld, vote ``aye.''\n  If you are one of the 11 new Senators who came to this body in \nJanuary and you do not have the courage to do what you told those \nvoters you were going to do when you were campaigning about spending \ncuts, you vote ``aye.''\n  If you want to postpone the tough choices until the problem is even \nworse than it is now, vote ``aye.''\n  With an ``aye'' vote, you get 7 more years of grace in which the \nbudget will balloon. The Senator from Utah has a chart over there \nshowing how much the debt has gone up since we have been debating this. \nIf this constitutional amendment were on the books right now, or any \ntime in the future, that chart would be exactly the same. Nothing would \nbe changed by a balanced budget amendment.\n  But if my colleagues believe that the highest calling they have is \ntheir duty to the Constitution, to be honest with their constituents, \nif they believe that their constituents can handle the truth no matter \nhow unpleasant, even though all they have been getting is talk-show \nidiocy, distortions, pap, and partisan snapping, then they should vote \n``no.'' And then they should follow that with a few courageous votes on \ncutting spending, even if it tears their hearts out to cast those \nvotes.\n  Ten times nobler is the man who bit the bullet in his quest to \nfulfill the promise of a great nation than the man \n[[Page S2250]] who reaps the contempt and hatred of historians and, \nthereafter, the people, because political expediency overcame our \nnobler instincts.\n  If you take that stale bait of popularity over what is best for our \ncountry, you are, in effect, saying, ``Let this great Nation perish.''\n  I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am happy to have the Senator from \nArkansas recognized. I hope he will be the last speaker of the day. I \nwould like to say a few words in closing, and we can recess the Senate. \nI am hoping he will be the last speaker.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I thank my distinguished and good friend \nfrom Utah for allowing me to speak at this time. I want to compliment \nmy worthy friend and colleague from Arkansas for delivering one of the \neloquent, forceful, and thoughtful speeches of this debate on amending \nthe Constitution with a balanced budget amendment.\n  Although we always marvel at this great constitutional system that we \nhave, somehow or another, we cannot help tinkering with it. We love to \nmess with our Constitution. Over 10,000 proposals in our some 200 years \nof history have been introduced in the Congress to amend the \nConstitution. But over this same 200-year period, we have adopted only \n17 since our Bill of Rights containing the first 10 amendments was \nenacted.\n  These relatively few amendments which have actually survived the \namending process suggest how very difficult it is to amend the \nConstitution, as our Founding Fathers intended it to be, and also just \nhow high the stakes really are.\n  Efforts to make our Government budget more responsible date back not \njust 2 or 3 years ago, but they date back to the early days of our \nforefathers. And these efforts have taken on various forms from \nreorganizing our budget process to amending the Constitution.\n  Today's debate, whether to authorize a constitutional amendment to be \nsent out to the States to balance the Federal budget, has been \nunfolding, Madam President, since 1982 when the Congress first \nattempted and failed to write a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget.\n  After this first attempt, proponents have pushed and failed to \nauthorize the amending process in 1986, 1990, and 1994.\n  I have participated in each of these four very difficult debates, and \nI have argued at length, not only here but in my home State of \nArkansas, on the merits and the demerits of amending our Constitution \nwith such an amendment.\n  In these debates, the U.S. Senate, and my friends on each side of the \naisle--all of us together--have struggled during this debate to \novercome our differences. But what is so striking today is not our \ndifferences, but our common goal, a goal that every Member of this body \nagrees with: The goal of achieving a balanced budget.\n  No one quarrels with this debate. No one quarrels with this notion. \nNo one quarrels with this goal. It is the one unifying idea that binds \nus. At the same time, it is the course of this particular devise of \nachieving our common goal, a constitutional amendment, which fractures \nus so very deeply, and there is a fundamental reason for this.\n  Americans have shaped their lives through laws, and for more than 200 \nyears, the Constitution has been at the very core, the very center of \nour Nation of laws. It is the world's oldest written charter in \ncontinuous effect.\n  When we change the Constitution, Madam President, we alter who we are \nas a people. We change our lives by changing the way we govern \nourselves. So before taking this ominous step of changing who we are as \na people, we have an obligation to fully explore the consequences of \namending our Constitution.\n  These consequences are neither obvious or simple. By this, I mean \nthat by solving one problem, we may be creating a whole new set of \nproblems. Certainly the consequences of balancing the budget will \ncreate a wide range of hardship and difficulty for some Americans--some \nof which will be foreseen and some of which will not.\n  So before we launch into this long and complex process of changing \nour Constitution of changing our lives, along with those who will \nfollow, the American people deserve and expect our honesty and they \ndeserve our leadership.\n  Madam President, I have been carrying around with me for the past \nseveral weeks a report from the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement \nand Tax Reform. We call this effort in the Senate the Kerrey-Danforth \ncommission, cochaired in a bipartisan manner by Senator Bob Kerrey and \nSenator John Danforth. Senator John Danforth, of course, is no longer a \nMember of this body. I want to congratulate the authors of this report \nand I hold it out to my colleagues and the American people as an effort \nof true leadership and honesty in explaining today's budget dilemma in \nwhich we find ourselves.\n  Finding No. 3 in this report, on pages 10 and 11, tells us a story we \njust cannot run away from. It is found actually on this chart, Madam \nPresident, and it starts in 1963, when mandatory spending, which is \ncomprised mainly of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, military \nretirement, civil retirement, and interest on the debt, amounted to \n29.6 percent of our Federal outlays. We see those combined, net \ninterest on the debt and entitlements, on the chart as mandatory \nspending of 29.6 percent of our Federal outlays.\n  Madam President, we see in the blue-green area of the pie chart what \nhappened also in 1963 in the area of discretionary spending. The \nremaining portion represented some 70 percent of the total Federal \noutlays, while some 30 percent was mandatory.\n  Chart No. 2, Madam President, shows the story when 30 years later, in \n1993, mandatory spending is now at 61 percent, that is, entitlements of \n47 percent, and net interest of 14 percent. Add the two and we find 61 \npercent of our budget is comprised of mandatory expenditures and \ndiscretionary spending shrunk to only 39 of total Federal outlays.\n  The third chart is revealing, Madam President, because the third \nchart indicates what is going to happen in 8 years. Eight years from \nnow, only 1 year after this proposed constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget will go into effect. If we continue as we are at \nthis time, we are going to see mandatory spending increased to 72 \npercent. That is net interest on the debt, 13.8; entitlements, 58.2, \nand discretionary spending, Madam President, down to the very small \npercentage of 28 percent.\n  Now, what does all this mean when we actually put ourselves in this \nstraitjacket of a constitutional amendment over the next 7 years to \nbalance the Federal budget.\n  Two weeks ago, Dr. Robert Reischauer was before the Senate Finance \nCommittee. He was testifying before our committee, and I asked him what \ndoes this mean if we are to balance the budget? His answer, and I \nquote, Madam President,\n\n       I do not think that you can find them out of discretionary \n     spending, especially if you listen to the concerns that many \n     of your colleagues have about defense spending and think that \n     defense spending is over one-half of discretionary spending. \n     Clearly, the major portion of the answer has to lie in the \n     entitlement area or in the tax code. And there is no escaping \n     that.\n\n  Clearly, Madam President, the major portion of the dollars needed to \nbe cut to balance the budget has to come from entitlements or the Tax \nCode, and there is no escape from that fact.\n  In the next question, I asked Dr. Reischauer before the Senate \nFinance Committee, if we exclude Social Security, which we should, from \na balanced budget amendment, then what is going to be left for us to \nfind the funds to balance the budget?\n  Dr. Reischauer responded by citing among others Medicare, Medicaid, \ncivil service, military retirement, veterans pensions, and veterans \ncompensation, student loans, farm price support systems, AFDC, food \nstamps, and SSI.\n  The point is, Madam President, the consequences of a balanced budget \nwill definitely be felt by all Americans, present and future, who \ndepend on these programs which Dr. Reischauer cited in his testimony a \nfew days ago.\n  Now, how will these Americans be affected? This is the question that \nwe in Congress must do our dead level best to be honest with the \nAmerican people about. With no plan set forth to \n[[Page S2251]] achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002, it is \nimpossible, absolutely, totally impossible to tell the people even our \nbest guess of the consequences of balancing the Federal budget.\n  Madam President, I do not wish to blame any one person or any \npolitical party or any sponsor of this particular amendment before the \nSenate today for not having a specific plan because the cuts would be \nextremely painful, extremely unpopular, and standing alone both \nDemocrats and Republicans have much to lose by offering such a plan at \nthis time.\n  In the absence of a plan at this date, a number of studies and \nreports are now coming out, that are now being issued which break down \nin very real terms the effect of actually balancing the budget with \nacross-the-board spending cuts.\n  Madam President, I can say that those findings from these reports are \nsobering. CBO estimates that the balanced budget amendment would \nrequire a cut of $1.2 trillion in Federal spending over the next 7 \nyears. What does that mean? The Treasury Department has now reported \nthat a balanced budget amendment for the State of Arkansas would \nrequire reducing Federal grants and other annual spending in the State \nby some $3 billion--$416 million lost per year in Medicaid, $65 million \nlost per year in highway funding, $225 million a year in lost funding \nfor education, for job training, environment and housing, and $1.1 \nbillion per year in lost benefits for the elderly.\n  These are enormous, unthinkable numbers that mean little when we say \nthem, but what does it mean to actual people? It means that seniors \nwill see massive reductions in health care benefits along with the \nhospitals and the doctors who serve them. In turn, the cost of the \npublic health care burden is going to be shifted to private employers \nand their employees. It means millions of requests by seniors for rides \nto the doctor's office, grocery store, and pharmacy will go unanswered. \nIt means millions and millions of home delivered meals will not get \ndelivered, will not go to the homes of the elderly persons who are \ndisabled.\n  Some now claim that these findings are meant only to spread fear and \nto scare people about the balanced budget amendment. However, Madam \nPresident, I think that the people making this claim are missing the \npoint. Sometimes being honest in budgeting is a very, very frightful \nproposition, but it is my responsibility, it is our responsibility \ncollectively to explain in advance the best way we can--what we are \ngoing to do and how we are going to do it--even if it scares us all.\n  I know, Madam President, that the President has received a lot of \ncriticism in the last few hours about the submission of his budget that \nhe sent to the Congress yesterday.\n  Here is the budget. ``A Citizens Guide to the Federal Budget'' is the \nfirst booklet. We have all of the appendices to the budget that he has \nproposed. We have an ``Analytical Perspective of the Budget of the \nUnited States Government.'' We have ``Historical Tables, Budget of the \nUnited States Government,'' and then finally the document that most of \nus hopefully have seen, the ``Budget of the United States Government,'' \nin a form that I think most of us hopefully can comprehend.\n  What this says, Madam President, is our President has kept faith with \nhis part of the contract. He has submitted a budget. It may be \ncontroversial. As my colleague Senator Bumpers just said, we may not be \nwilling to accept $180 billion deficits into the outyears. But be that \nas it may, this is at least a good faith effort to let the people of \nAmerica know where we stand with the budget, and to know what our plans \nare with the budget.\n  However, as we look around the Senate Chamber today, on the eve of a \nvery critical vote on the balanced budget amendment, the right-to-know \namendment, offered by the distinguished minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, and several colleagues, we find that there is absolutely not \none scintilla, not one scintilla of a plan offered by the proponents of \nthe constitutional amendment to balance the budget, to show us how that \nbudget is going to be balanced, to show us if it is going to require \nnew revenues, or to show us the number of dollars that we are going to \nhave to cut spending.\n  Madam President, here is a blank piece of paper. There is nothing on \nit. And, thus far, this is about all we have from the proponents of \nthis amendment to tell us how they plan to balance the budget.\n  Our colleague, Senator Domenici, the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico and chairman of the Budget Committee, has been very \nstraightforward from the outset of this debate. But should not we be \njust as straightforward about the consequences to millions of Americans \nwho are going to be impacted by these cuts? We should know the plan of \naction. We should know how they propose to balance the budget.\n  No one who is a part of this debate is suggesting we do nothing to \nbalance the budget. That is not an option. We all want to balance the \nbudget. The price of doing nothing is too high. What is at the core of \nthis debate is the right of Americans to see the direction we are \nheading to achieve this goal before we take this drastic step of \namending our 200-year-old Constitution. Without this direction, I \nbelieve such a proposal is going to do more harm than good.\n  During this debate an amendment to exclude Social Security from this \nbalanced budget amendment is going to be offered and I am going to be \nsupporting that amendment. The Social Security System is a 60-year-old \ncontract with the American people. It has worked. It has worked well. \nAnd if changes need to be made, I am willing and ready to consider \nthem. We made some changes back in 1983 that put our Social Security \nSystem back in a very good financial posture. But I will consider them \non their own merit, not as a part of any across-the-board spending cut \nbecause I think our contract with the elderly people of our country as \nthey pay into Social Security is a separate contract which they started \nsome 60 years ago. And this is a contract of 60-year standing that I \nplan to honor and I hope our colleagues in the Senate will honor.\n  The Democratic Joint Economic Committee has recently estimated that \nif both Social Security and Medicare were included in across-the-board \nspending cuts, the average senior citizen in America would lose some \n$2,000 a year in Social Security benefits; some $1,500 a year in \nMedicare benefits. The consequences of this debate to retirees, to \nwidows, to the disabled are too important to subject them to broad \nbrush budget cuts. And I will not support a constitutional amendment \nthat allows this to happen.\n  In last week's debate it was pointed out the balanced budget \namendment does not require a balanced budget. This is true. Section 1 \nof the proposed amendment that is before this body at this time allows \nfor three-fifths of both the House and the Senate to waive the \nrequirement for a balanced budget. So, if the amendment as proposed \ndoes not require a balanced budget, what does it do? That is the \nquestion today.\n  One, this proposal gives the President and two-fifths plus 1 of \neither Chamber a procedural lock on deficit spending and debt ceiling \nlimits.\n  Let us place to one side the argument that we are frustrating the \ndemocratic process by allowing minority rule of our economic order. \nThat point has been made repeatedly. I think it has been made well.\n  Madam President, let us take another look at the amendment and \ncompare that, to see how this proposal fits into the framework, the \noverall global framework of the Constitution. Compare it to, say, the \nfirst amendment.\n  The proposed amendment before us is going to allow, if adopted, a \nsupermajority to waive the requirement of a balanced budget. In this \nrespect, this amendment is truly a first. It is a first in the 200-year \nhistory of our constitutional Republic. We have never had such an \namendment. This is the first time. Let us compare it, if we might, to \nthe first amendment:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \n     abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the \n     right of the people peaceably to assemble; and to petition \n     the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\n  Madam President, nowhere in this language of the Constitution in the \nfirst amendment does it even suggest about providing that: Congress \nshall make no law respecting the establishment of religion unless \nthree-fifths of \n[[Page S2252]] each House passes legislation specifying otherwise. And \nto suggest so would be ludicrous.\n  When we take the oath of office to protect and defend this \nConstitution, do we do so unless three-fifths of each house of Congress \npasses legislation specifying otherwise? Of course not. If the \nproponents of a balanced budget amendment believe it is so important to \nour way of life, why is this procedural loophole included?\n  This is not the only loophole. Let us look at section 6, which \nprovides that the ``estimates of outlays and receipts may be used by \nCongress when drafting legislation to enforce and implement the \nprovisions of this amendment.''\n  This may be the biggest loophole of all. The amendment will be \nenforced by ``estimates,'' agreed to by Congress. Even on our best, our \nluckiest days, estimates are just that, good faith estimates, but often \nthey differ greatly. They change over time. And estimates in the wrong \nhands for the wrong reasons can be very, very destructive.\n  Do we really want to introduce this notion into our Constitution? I \nthink not. It is just one more example of why the balanced budget \namendment will not balance the budget. And what happens, finally, Madam \nPresident, if Congress does not balance the budget? What happens if \nthis straitjacket that we have placed ourselves in is such that we \ncannot abide by those rules? Would the Federal courts be called upon to \nenforce them? Are we going to be like Kansas City when the Federal \njudge, who was unelected, appointed for life said: I will raise the \ntaxes, I will run the schools? Many have grave doubts whether the \ncourts should assume this role. This is the role for the Congress. This \nis a role for the President. Further, even Federal judges today are \nvery skeptical that the courts would assume this particular role.\n  Judge Robert Bork has predicted that ``hundreds, if not thousands, of \nlawsuits would arise from such an amendment.''\n  No tinkering with our Constitution is going to substitute for the \ncourage it will take actually to balance the Federal budget. The \nintroduction of gimmicks and loopholes and uncertainty into the \nConstitution will not give us the courage or the political cover to \nreach this goal.\n  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of \nRights--are housed just a few blocks from here. In fact, this morning I \nwas sitting in my office and I was thinking about this vote that we are \ngoing to have tomorrow, Wednesday, at high noon; a vote whether to \nrequire that the public and the Congress have the right to know \nbasically the glidepath or some of the numbers as to how we are going \nto achieve a Federal budget, if we support this constitutional \namendment.\n  I got to thinking about the Declaration and the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. We talk about them all the time in this body. I \nremembered I had not seen those documents since I was about 16 years of \nage.\n  So I called up the Archives. I said, ``Would it be possible for me to \ncome down on short notice and have explained to me how we protect and \nlook after these very sacred documents?'' So I got in the car. I went \nto the Archives. I found that on each day at 10 o'clock sharp every \nday, except Christmas, on display we find the Declaration of \nIndependence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.\n  These founding documents of our country are in cases shielded by \ntinted glass and inert gases. Each evening these cases are lowered into \na recessed, reinforced vault. If the Capital of our country were \nattacked, the vault would continue to protect its contents long after \nthe city above ceased to exist. The Constitution, the Bill of Rights, \nand the Declaration of Independence for this country would survive long \nafter all of us were gone.\n  The scene at the National Archives, I think, reinforces the reverence \nwe have for these documents. This scene, I think, demonstrates the \ndegree of respect for the Founding Fathers who wrote these particular \ndocuments.\n  While I was standing there this morning--and I took several members \nof our staff, Madam President, to the National Archives to see the \nConstitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights \nonce again--I watched the people as they walked in. As they approached \nthese documents, they approached them with reverence, with quiet, and \ndeep respect for the environment in which they were in.\n  There was a couple. I started visiting with them quietly. They were \nfrom Washington State. I introduced myself. They introduced themselves. \nThey said that this was their very first trip to Washington, DC. They \nsaid that they thought they would never have the opportunity to be so \nclose to the reason that this country has become so great and so \npowerful as it is today.\n  It makes me shudder to think that we would, in effect, remove this \nConstitution from its specially protected environment in the National \nArchives and inscribe on its parchment something that we believe is a \nbad idea. The reverence inspired by the Constitution comes from the \nimpression that it is permanent and that it is enduring. A bad idea \ncannot endure, and we should not discolor the Constitution with it. We \nshould not taint it. We should not stain this magnificent document with \nsuch an untried extreme as this particular amendment presents.\n  Madam President, can we balance the budget without this amendment?\n  Madam President, I see my distinguished friend from Utah rising. I \nwant him to know, if he will allow me about 2 or 3 more minutes, I am \ngoing to sit down and let him conclude today's activities in the \nSenate, if that would be permissible with the distinguished manager.\n  Can we balance the budget without a constitutional amendment? The \nanswer is ``yes.'' Is it going to be easy? The answer is ``no.''\n  The 1990 and 1993 deficit reductions which were passed represent over \n$1 trillion in deficit reduction. I voted for them. We did this without \na balanced budget amendment. We can do it again, and we can do it by \nkeeping the Constitution intact. It is very difficult, and some may not \nhave liked it. It was uncomfortable. It caused heartburn. But I think \nvery few would disagree with the fact that we reduced the deficit of \nthe U.S. Government, and once again, we did it by keeping the \nConstitution of our country intact.\n  Some Democrats lost their seat in this Congress to vote on the 1990 \nand 1993 deficit reduction bills. But these individuals did it anyway \nbecause they knew that their first obligation was to their country, to \ntheir children and to their grandchildren, and they knew they must make \ntough choices. Many who support this balanced budget proposal have \nnever voted for a tough deficit reduction package. To vote on this \namendment does not in any way ensure that they will in the future.\n  Whatever the outcome of this debate might be, Madam President, I hope \nthat I will be able to continue to make the tough votes to reach this \ngoal. I support a balanced budget. But I will not support a bad idea to \nachieve it.\n  To our colleagues in the Senate who have just arrived here--and I \nnote that all 11 have signed a letter recently, dated January 18, 1995. \nThe new freshmen Members of the U.S. Senate which have come from 10 of \nour great States in this Union, have all supported this balanced budget \namendment. I would like to say a word, Madam President, in closing to \nthose fine new colleagues of ours. That is this: This is going to be \nthe easiest vote that they have ever cast. This is an easy vote for \nthem. It is an easy vote for anyone in this body because it says that \nwe are going to propose an amendment to the Constitution that requires \na balanced budget, but it ultimately does not require a balanced \nbudget; that we are going to propose an amendment to the Constitution \nthat says we are going to let the next Congress basically balance the \nbudget. We are going to let the next President basically balance the \nbudget. And what we will be doing in the meantime is sending out press \nreleases and stating what a great thing we have done by supporting a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  Madam President, I hope our colleagues will rethink this position. I \nknow they realize--because they are not only good people, they are \nsmart people--we did not get ourselves as a country, as a Nation, into \nthis predicament in 7 years. And let us be honest, we are not going to \nget ourselves out of it in 7 years.\n  Madam President--and I say to my wonderful friend of long standing \nfrom Utah who has been eloquent in his \n[[Page S2253]] management and his statements on this issue--I would \nlike to conclude my statement this afternoon by quoting a paragraph \nfrom a 1993 book that has just come out. It is called ``Amending \nAmerica,'' written by Richard Bernstein and Jerome Agel. Up here on the \ntop on the cover, I say to my colleague from Utah and the distinguished \noccupant of the chair, it says: ``If We Love the Constitution So Much, \nWhy Do We Keep Trying to Change It?''\n  A paragraph from page 185 in the book states this, which is relative \nto the debate in 1992 on the constitutional amendment:\n  In June 1992, Stanley Collender, the director of Federal budget \npolicy for Price Waterhouse, pointed out another problem with enforcing \nthe amendment. Under present law, no person would have standing to \nbring suit to compel Congress to obey this amendment. If the courts \ncould not enforce it, then the amendment would have no teeth and its \nfailure would breed contempt for the Constitution and the rule of law, \nagain, echoing the disaster of constitutional prohibition.\n  Mr. Collender concluded, ``This whole effort is nothing but a scam.''\n  Madam President, I am not calling this effort a scam, but I do call \nit misguided, and I truly believe that there is another way to attack \nthe national debt and our deficit, and at the same time keep our \nrevered and respected Constitution intact.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, \nfor having the patience to sit and listen and for managing this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I want to make a few comments before we \nclose for the day. If the courts cannot enforce the balanced budget \namendment--and they will not be able to--I do not believe there is any \nway people can meet across the board the standing justiciability and \nthe political questions in order to have the courts enforce the \nbalanced budget amendment. The only way it is going to be enforced is \nthrough moral suasion, because it will be part of the Constitution and \nit will be enforced just like the States enforce their amendments to \ntheir constitutions. They revere their State constitutions and the \nState Governors and legislatures balance the budget in accordance with \nthe State constitution. It will be the same here.\n  Every Member of this body is sworn to uphold the Constitution, and \nthe moral suasion alone will cause us to do what we should. That does \nnot mean we cannot get a three-fifths vote or a constitutional \nmajority. Maybe we can, in cases of severe distress and difficulty. \nThis is the only chance that we have to pass something that will get \nspending under control.\n  If there is ever an argument as to why we need a balanced budget \namendment, the Senator from Arkansas was extremely eloquent in talking \nabout the importance of this budget. The fact of the matter is that \nthis budget agreement, I think, is a great argument for the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment. It is not because I want to criticize \nit so much as it is that the President has thrown in a sponge.\n  If you read this budget, over the next 12 years, we are not going to \ngo toward a balanced budget at all, but we will be at a $200 billion \ndeficit for the next 12 years. What happens to our kids and grandkids? \nWho cares about them? Can we not do something to stop this incessant \nspending? I think we can. Here we have a Democrat and Republican \namendment to do this.\n  Madam President, by codifying these terms and concepts in our \nConstitution, the supporters of the Daschle amendment will \nconstitutionalize the very processes that have produced trillions of \ndollars in red ink. This is the politics of the past. It is business as \nusual.\n  We may find that we have to go about the budget process differently \nat some point in the future. But the Daschle amendment locks us pretty \nmuch into one particular process.\n  Instead of working for change, the supporters of the Daschle \namendment want to freeze the status quo in place. Is that what the \nAmerican people want?\n  I must say, the Daschle amendment fits hand in glove with the Clinton \nbudget--there is no real change there either. President Clinton \npromises at least $200 billion in deficits as far ahead as we can \nproject, year after year.\n  Instead of attacking the deficit, the President's budget plans attack \nthe wallets of our citizens. Our citizens will wind up paying more \ntaxes to pay the ever growing interest on our skyrocketing national \ndebt. And our citizens will pay more for the material things they want \nin life, from housing to automobiles to everyday consumer spending. \nThese deficits will keep interest rates higher than they otherwise \nwould be. These deficits will crowd out the private sector, resulting \nin fewer jobs and lower wages.\n  The President campaigned on change. He has demonstrated he is part of \nthe status quo.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter to me from Lincoln Oliphant be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Republican Policy Committee,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 1994.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Re the Daschle amendment is anti-constitutional\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is the first of two letters that \n     assess the constitutional implications of the Daschle \n     amendment.\n       H.J.Res. 1, proposing an amendment to the Constitution \n     relative to a balanced budget, is being debated on the Senate \n     floor. On Friday, February 3, 1995, Senator Daschle moved to \n     commit H.J. Res. 1 to the Judiciary Committee with \n     instructions to report back forthwith with a Daschle \n     substitute amendment.\n       The Daschle substitute would add to H.J. Res. 1 a new and \n     lengthy and complicated section 9 that requires Congress to \n     use the processes of the Congressional Budget Act to reach a \n     balanced budget. Senator Daschle's section 9 is longer than \n     the original H.J. Res. 1, and it is far more complicated. For \n     example, subsection 9(b) of the Daschle amendment reads as \n     follows:\n       ``The directives required by subsection (a)(3) shall be \n     deemed to be directives within the meaning of section 310(a) \n     of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Upon receiving all \n     legislative submissions from Committees under subsection \n     (a)(3), each Committee of the Budget shall combine all such \n     submissions (without substantive revision) into an omnibus \n     reconciliation bill and report that bill to its House. The \n     procedures set forth in section 310 shall govern the \n     consideration of that reconciliation bill in the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate.''\n       The Daschle amendment sounds like it came out of the Code \n     of Federal Regulations, not the Constitution of the United \n     States, but Article V of the Constitution which governs \n     amendments does not require constitutional amendments to be \n     written elegantly or even well. This paper is not, however, \n     concerned with the coarseness of the Daschle language, nor \n     with its merits per se, but with its fitness for inclusion in \n     the Constitution of the United States.\n  What the Daschle Amendment Means for the Constitution of the United \n                                 States\n\n       The Daschle amendment seeks to take a statute of the United \n     States, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and graft it \n     onto the Constitution of the United States. This appears to \n     mean that a future amendment to the Budget Act would \n     constitute a change in the Constitution of the United States.\n       Section 310 of the Congressional Budget Act, 2 U.S.C. 641 \n     (1988 ed. & Supp. V 1993), was enacted on July 12, 1974, P.L. \n     93-344, Sec. 310, 88 Stat. 315. It was amended on Dec. 12, \n     1985, P.L. 99-177, 99 Stat. 1053, and again on Nov. 5, 1990, \n     P.L. 101-508, 104 Stat. 1388-608, -618, -620. In the future, \n     these kinds of amendments (which were relevant to the Budget \n     Act), and all other amendments to section 310 (no matter \n     their relevance to budgetary matters), will be incorporated \n     into the Constitution of the United States through the \n     language of the Daschle amendment, if ratified.\n       ``Constitutionalizing'' a statute of the United States is \n     unprecedented because it is antithetical to the Constitution \n     of the United States. The Daschle amendment allows Congress \n     and the President (or Congress alone when it overrides a \n     presidential veto) to re-enter the constitutional text at \n     will and change it. This is anti-constitutional.\\1\\\n     \\1\\Footnotes at the end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Daschle amendment is open-ended, there is no limit on \n     future amendments. It would ``constitutionalize'' the \n     Congressional Budget Act on the date of enactment and forever \n     thereafter, however amended. The Daschle amendment could have \n     avoided the possibility of future amendments by providing \n     that the trust funds were to be ``constitutionally fixed'' on \n     a date certain. This would have been a large step away from \n     the charge of anti-constitutionalism, though it would have \n     brought charges of grotesque constitutional drafting because \n     it would have made chunks of the Budget Act a permanent part \n     of the Constitution of the United States. America's \n     Constitution-makers have stayed away from such rigidity \n     because \n[[Page S2254]] they have believed that laws like the Budget Act should \nbe able to be amended without requiring a constitutional amendment.\n       The Daschle amendment is at cross-purposes with the \n     structure and intent of the American Constitution--it \n     threatens such fundamentals as the separation of powers, \n     federalism, and the rule of law, as will be shown below.\n\n\nThe Practical Effect of the Daschle Amendment: The Example of Article V\n\n       Article V of the Constitution provides the sole method for \n     amending the Constitution. It reads in relevant part:\n       ``The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall \n     deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this \n     Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of \n     two-thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for \n     proposing amendment, which, in either case, shall be valid to \n     all Intents and Purposes, as part of this Constitution, when \n     ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the several \n     States * * *''\n       The sole mode of amendment established by the Constitution, \n     therefore, involves only the States and the Congress, and \n     Article V requires the consent of a super-majority of both. \n     The President has no formal role in the proposing or \n     ratifying of constitutional amendments. Hollingsworth v. \n     Virginia, 3 U.S. 378 (1798). The Judicial Branch has no \n     formal role in the proposing or adopting of amendments and \n     only a limited role in reviewing Article V cases. Coleman v. \n     Miller, 307 U.S. 433 (1939) (many issues arising under \n     Article V are political questions which are nonjusticiable).\n       In the ordinary Article V case (the convention method for \n     proposing amendments never having been used), two-thirds of \n     the Senate and two-thirds of the House of Representatives \n     propose an amendment to the Constitution which can be adopted \n     only by the consent of three-fourths of the States. There is \n     no other way to amend the Constitution--unless the Daschle \n     amendment is ratified!\n       If the Daschle amendment is adopted, there will be two \n     additional ways in which the Constitution may be amended:\n       First, if Congress passes a bill to amend relevant sections \n     of the Congressional Budget Act and the President signs the \n     bill, the Constitution will be changed.\n       Second, if Congress passes a bill to amend the relevant \n     sections of the Congressional Budget Act and the President \n     vetoes the bill, Congress can enact the bill unilaterally by \n     overriding the President's veto by a two-thirds vote.\n       By allowing Congress alone, or Congress with the \n     concurrence of the President, to change the Constitution, the \n     Daschle amendment overthrows settled understandings of the \n     separation of powers\\2\\ and federalism.\\3\\ The Daschle \n     amendment is, therefore, anti-constitutional.\n       Additionally, the Daschle amendment is anti-constitutional \n     because it undermines the concept of a written Constitution \n     superior to all other enactments. U.S. Const. Art. VI. The \n     Federalist no. 78 (``No legislative act . . . contrary to the \n     Constitution can be valid''). See also, Marbury v. Madison, 1 \n     U.S. 137, 177 (1803) (``Certainly all those who have framed \n     written constitutions contemplate them as forming the \n     fundamental and paramount law of the nation''). The excerpt \n     from Marbury v. Madison that appears in the Appendix \n     emphasizes this weakness of the Daschle amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Lincoln C.

A statutory provision which is forbidden by the \n     constitution is said to be ``unconstitutional'' (and that is \n     the subject of our second letter on the Daschle amendment), \n     but a proposed constitutional amendment that would stand the \n     Constitution on its head is ``anti-constitutional.''\n     \\2\\The Constitution of the United States is predicated on a \n     separation of the legislative, executive, and judicial \n     powers. U.S. Const. Art. I, Art, II & Art. III. The \n     Federalist No. 47 (``The accumulation of all powers, \n     legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands . . \n     . may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny. \n     Were the federal Constitution, therefore, really chargeable \n     with the accumulation of power . . . no further arguments \n     would be necessary to inspire a universal reprobation of the \n     system. I persuade myself, however, . . . that the charge \n     cannot be supported'').\n     \\3\\The Constitution of the United States is predicated on \n     federalism, a diffusion of powers between the national \n     government and the States, See, e.g., U.S. Const.

The \n     principles, therefore, so established, are deemed \n     fundamental. And as the authority from which they proceed is \n     supreme, and can seldom act, they are designed to be \n     permanent.\n       ``This original and supreme will organizes the government, \n     and assigns to different departments their respective powers. \n     It may either stop here, or establish certain limits not to \n     be transcended by those departments.\n       The government of the United States is of the latter \n     description. The powers of the legislature are defined and \n     limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or \n     forgotten, the constitution is written. To what purpose are \n     powers limited, and to what purpose is that limitation \n     committed to writing, if these limits may, at any time, be \n     passed by those intended to be restrained? The distinction \n     between a government with limited and unlimited powers is \n     abolished, if those limits do not confine the persons on whom \n     they are imposed, and if acts prohibited and acts allowed, \n     are of equal obligation. It is a proposition too plain to be \n     contested, that the constitution controls any legislative act \n     repugnant to it; or, that the legislature may alter the \n     constitution by an ordinary act.\n       ``Between these alternatives there is no middle ground. The \n     constitution is either a superior paramount law, unchangeable \n     by ordinary means, or it is on a level with ordinary \n     legislative acts, and, like other acts, is alterable when the \n     legislature shall please to alter it.\n       ``If the former part of the alternative be true, then a \n     legislative act contrary to the constitution is not law: if \n     the latter part be true, then written constitutions are \n     absurd attempts, on the part of the people, to limit a power \n     in its own nature illimitable.\n       ``Certainly all those who have framed written constitutions \n     contemplate them as forming the fundamental and paramount law \n     of the nation, and, consequently, the theory of every such \n     government must be, that an act of the legislature, repugnant \n     to the constitution, is void.\n       `` * * *\n       ``It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial \n     department to say what the law is. . . . If two laws conflict \n     with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of \n     each.\n       ``So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both \n     the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so \n     that the court must either decide that case conformably to \n     the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the \n     constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine \n     which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of \n     the very essence of judicial duty.\n       ``If, then, the courts are to regard the constitution, and \n     the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the \n     legislature, the constitution, and not such ordinary act, \n     must govern the case to which they both apply.\n       ``Those, then, who controvert the principle that the \n     constitution is to be considered, in court, as a paramount \n     law, are reduced to the necessity of maintaining that courts \n     must close their eyes on the constitution, and see only the \n     law.\n       ``This doctrine would subvert the very foundation of all \n     written constitutions. It would declare that an act which, \n     according to the principles and theory of our government, is \n     entirely void, is yet, in practice, completely obligatory. It \n     would declare that if the legislature shall do what is \n     expressly forbidden, such act, notwithstanding the express \n     prohibition, is in reality effectual. It would be giving to \n     the legislature a practical and real omnipotence, with the \n     same breath which professes to restrict their powers within \n     narrow limits. It is prescribing limits and declaring that \n     those limits may be passed at pleasure.\n       ``[I]t thus reduces to nothing what we have deemed the \n     greatest improvement on political institutions, a written \n     constitution. . . .''\n  Mr. HATCH. Two more things, Madam President. We started this morning \nby pointing out our balanced budget amendment debt tracker. You can see \nwe have been in debate for 9 days now. You can see the green mark is up \nfrom the $4.8 trillion baseline we have. Each day, the national debt is \ngoing up almost $1 billion as we debate this. It is really mind \nboggling.\n  Let me point this out to our general public. This chart is \n``Calculating the Deficit Under President Clinton.'' This budget puts \nus in this deficit picture. We are in 1995, right here. In 1994, the \ndeficit was projected to be 3.2; in 1995, 194.7; in 1996, 192.5; in \n1996, 193.1; in 1997, 193.4, and then 194.4, and on into the future. \nThis is all red ink for our children and grandchildren and everybody in \nthis country.\n  Over the next 5 years, we will have a $1.39 trillion total increase, \nprojected increase in the deficit from 1994 to the year 2000--billions \nof dollars in debt, with not one hope for anybody of bringing that line \ndown unless we pass this balanced budget amendment. That is why we are \nfighting so hard for it now and why we are asking colleagues to \n[[Page S2255]] consider voting for it. We are also asking the people to \nbe heard with regard to this.\n  Eighty-five percent of the people want a balanced budget amendment. \nThere is good reason for it and that is a perfect illustration why. On \nboth of these charts, this continual red-ink deficit, and the continual \ngoing up--even while debating it on a daily basis, it is going up $1 \nbillion a year.\n  I do not want to keep the Senate any longer. We are prepared to close \nthe Senate. I will end my remarks at this point.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2243-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENTS BY THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GEN. EDWARD CRAIG\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nthe Marine Corps' most outstanding leaders, Lt. Gen. Edward Craig, who \nrecently passed away.\n  Lieutenant General Craig was born in Danbury, CT, in 1896. He later \nattended St. Johns Military Academy in Delafield, WI. Upon graduation \nfrom the academy in 1917, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in \nthe Marine Corps, and reported for duty on August 23, 1917.\n  In November 1917, he was assigned to duty with the 8th Marine \nRegiment, and in April 1919, was ordered to foreign shore duty in Haiti \nand later with the Second Provisional Brigade marines in the Dominican \nRepublic.\n  His overseas World War II commands began in the summer of 1943 when \nhe was given command of the 9th Marine Regiment at Guadalcanal. He was \nmy regimental commander. He inspired great confidence in his officers \nand men. He was a superb battle commander. He led this regiment in the \nBougainville invasion that fall. While remaining the colonel in charge \nof this regiment, he was in the forefront in the liberation of Guam, \nfor which he was awarded the Navy Cross. The last of his World War II \ninvolvements included service in the 5th Amphibious Corps in the fall \nof 1944. As the corps operations officer, Lieutenant General Craig \ndesigned and actually participated in the landing and assault on Iwo \nJima in 1944. He returned to the United States from the Pacific in July \n1945.\n  Following the end of World War II, he was again ordered overseas as \nassistant division commander of the 1st Marine Division, reinforced, in \nTientsin, China.\n  On June 1, 1947, he was assigned as commanding general, 1st \nProvisional Marine Brigade, Fleet Marine Force, on Guam, where he \nremained for 2 years.\n  When the Korean conflict began he was assigned to Korea and served as \nthe commanding general of the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade and \nparticipated in fighting around the Pusan perimeter. He later served as \nassistant division commander of the 1st Marine Division and took part \nin the landing at Inchon and operations in northeast Korea.\n  At the time of his retirement on June 1, 1951, he was the director of \nthe Marine Corps Reserve and was a veteran of more than 33 years of \nMarine Corps service.\n  All of his endeavors in the service led to many well-deserved medals \nand honors.

SULLIVAN\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Madam President, I want to pay tribute and offer my \ncongratulations to my dear friend Judge William C. Sullivan on his new-\nfound lifestyle--retirement.\n  Before starting his legal career in 1951, and becoming a circuit \njudge for Talledega County, Bill served in the U.S. Navy; played on a \nsemi-pro baseball league; and was mayor of Lincoln, AL.\n  When recalling my many memories of Judge Sullivan, I remember a \nrather humorous occasion which occurred in the summer of 1954. A police \nchief came to a baseball game in which Sullivan was a player only to \ntell him a gubernatorial candidate, ``Big Jim'' Folsom, wanted to see \nhim. William sent word back to Jim that he would have to wait until the \nend of the game before he would break loose.\n  When the two met, Bill of course in his soiled uniform, Big Jim was \nin disbelief--he even told Bill Sullivan he did not look like a mayor. \nSullivan simply smiled and reminded Big Jim he was only a candidate, \nand not a Governor.\n  The two later reunited when Big Jim swore Bill in as a judge 4 years \nlater.\n  Perhaps Judge Sullivan is most known for a 1962 civil rights case he \npresided over in which the late Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall \nwas an acting attorney.\n  Bill and I share one belief--we both agreed the transition from \nattorney to judge was difficult because once we became judges, we \nsimply acted as referees. Thus, we could not ``slug it out'' in court \nwith other attorneys.\n  Judge Sullivan obviously knew his stuff. He went 20 years without a \nsingle reversal.\n  Bill and his followers are proud of the fine job he did while serving \non the Alabama Pattern Jury Instructions Committee, since it was his \npanel that published a reference book for jury instructions in civil \ncases used by most judges and lawyers in the State today.\n  Bill has said he will not miss the workload, but will miss the \nchallenging cases being played out in the courtroom.\n  Upon his retirement, Talledega lost one of its best judges. I wish \nhim all the best in his retirement and commend him for his leadership \nover the years.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2255-5", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2256]]\n               TRIBUTE TO PUBLISHER W.M. ``BILL'' STEWART\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Madam President, publisher William Mathews ``Bill'' \nStewart passed away on January 21 at the age of 74. A noted \nnewspaperman in the State of Alabama for many years, Bill had been the \nowner of the Monroe Journal and a Monroeville, AL radio station.\n  Bill bought the Journal in 1947, and in 1952 started radio station \nWMFC. He also established WBCA radio in Bay Minette, AL. Since 1958, he \nand his family owned the paper and the radio station. He remained \neditor of the paper until 1989 and was active in its management until \nvery recently. He also owned papers in Bay Minette, Brewton, Camden, \nand Jackson, AL.\n  A native of Autaugaville, Bill was a former president of the Alabama \nPress Association and the American Newspaper Representatives, an \nadvertising agency. He earned his degree in journalism at the \nUniversity of Alabama, was a reporter at the Huntsville Times, and \nserved in the Army during World War II.\n  Bill was also active in his local community. He was a past president \nof the Monroeville Chamber of Commerce and the Monroeville Kiwanis \nClub, and an organizer of the Monroe Country United Way. He was also a \nSunday school teacher. The Kiwanis Club named him ``Man of the Year'' \nin 1996 and ``Citizen of the Year'' in 1990. He devoted most of life to \nbringing information to the people in his region of the State.\n  Bill Stewart was totally committed to his profession and to serving \nhis community through the written and spoken word. He truly understood \nthe power of information and the importance of communication. He was \nknown in the community as a leader dedicated to making his hometown the \nbest place in the world in which to live. He was warm and friendly, and \nthe depth of his compassion for people was reflected through his \nemployment of the disabled. His demeanor was always that of a true \ngentleman.\n  Bill's quiet and calm leadership helped lead Monroeville through the \nsocial changes of the last 35 years. It is never easy being the \npublisher of a small-town newspaper, but he was more willing than most \nto sacrifice popularity for his conscience. He was referred to by his \nminister as a ``tower of righteousness and integrity.''\n  Bill Stewart will be greatly missed by all those who had the pleasure \nof knowing him over the years. I extend my deepest condolences to his \nwife, Carolyn Hall Steward, and her entire family in the wake of this \ntremendous loss.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the Mobile Register \ncommenting on the life and career of Bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Mobile Register, Jan. 24, 1995]\n\n                      Bill Stewart: Editor, Leader\n\n       William M. ``Bill'' Stewart made his money and his \n     reputation the old-fashioned way. He earned them.\n       When his family and friends said farewell to the long-time \n     newspaperman Monday in a Monroeville cemetery, they saluted \n     the former publisher of the Monroeville Journal for his \n     contributions to the newspaper profession--contributions that \n     began at the University of Alabama, where he earned his \n     journalism degree. From an early stint in daily journalism at \n     the Huntsville Times, he went on to discover his real love: \n     community newspapers.\n       Bill Stewart's ensuing achievements were many. He was a \n     former president of the Alabama Press Association, where he \n     championed the rights of the state's newspapers large and \n     small. For a time, he also headed the American Newspaper \n     Representatives, a national advertising service. He had owned \n     or been a partner in newspapers in Bay Minette, Jackson, \n     Camden and Brewton, and he helped found two radio stations, \n     including WMFC in Monroeville, which his family continues to \n     own.\n       But it was his ownership of the Monroe Journal for which \n     Bill Stewart was best known. He bought the paper in 1947 with \n     a partner from Bay Minette, Jimmy Faulkner, and acquired sole \n     ownership of it 11 years later. Devotion to reporting the \n     news of Monroeville and its surrounding rural communities was \n     his hallmark.\n       One notable writer who passed through the Journal's \n     newsroom was syndicated columnist Rheta Grimsley Johnson, who \n     now writes for the Atlanta Constitution and United Feature \n     Syndicates. She worked in Monroeville in 1975, by which time \n     Mr. Stewart's son and daughter-in-law were operating the \n     newspaper. Ms. Johnson, who occasionally writes about her \n     days as a young reporter in South Alabama, recently \n     remembered the paper as ``a model weekly'' that was devoted \n     to and in touch with its readers.\n       ``And that doesn't come easy,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``It's \n     certainly the cleanest newspaper. There's never a typo in the \n     Monroe Journal; if there is, heads will roll.''\n       Today, Bill Stewart's sons Steve and David own and operate \n     the newspaper and radio station. Until their father's death \n     from complications of Parkinson's disease, however, he had \n     maintained a vigorous interest in the family's businesses.\n       It is doubtlessly safe to predict that residents of Monroe \n     County can count on the sons, who have won journalistic \n     accolades in their own right, to carry on the senior Mr. \n     Stewart's commitment to community journalism.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2256-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                BASEBALL\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I will just take a second. I need to \ntestify on another matter, but I want to say a word about baseball.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Baseball?\n  Mr. DOLE. Not basketball, baseball. I note the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Madam President, will the majority leader yield? He said \nhe wanted to make a statement about baseball?\n  Mr. DOLE. Baseball.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Not basketball.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would be happy to make a statement about basketball, \nfootball, hockey----\n  Mr. BRADLEY. The national sport.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank my colleague from New Jersey, one of the great \nplayers of all time.\n  Madam President, for nearly 6 months now, baseball fans all across \nAmerica have patiently stood by watching the transformation of our \nNation's pastime into a crass tug-of-war over money.\n  Multimillion-dollar players and multimillion-dollar owners have \nargued, haggled, argued some more, and ultimately deprived the American \npeople of one of the most exciting seasons in recent memory.\n  After 179 days of confrontation, the players and the owners must now \nput aside their differences and find common ground. Not tomorrow. Not 2 \nweeks from now. But today: Tuesday, February 7. There is simply no more \nsand left in the negotiating hourglass. The integrity of the \ninstitution of baseball is far more important than anyone's bottom \nline.\n  With that said, let me be crystal clear on one important point: \nNeither party--player nor owner--should be looking to Congress for any \nmagic solutions. The magic solution can only be found at the bargaining \ntable.\n  If, for some reason, the players and owners cannot reach an agreement \ntoday, then they should do the next best thing--which is to voluntarily \naccept whatever settlement special mediator Bill Usery may propose. If \nit is good enough for Bill Usery, I am confident it is good enough for \nbaseball.\n  Here is a man who has had long experience, he has worked tirelessly \non this matter as he has done successfully in many other areas. He said \nthis is the toughest he has ever negotiated.\n  But I would just say again, today is the day. We do not have any \nmagic wand up here. Congress cannot solve these things if they cannot \nbe solved in negotiations. So if everything else fails, my advice would \nbe, before 3 p.m. today, they accept the efforts of the negotiator, \nBill Usery.\n  I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I appreciate the remarks of our \ndistinguished majority leader. I hope his remarks are taken very \nseriously by all concerned. We need to resolve this matter very much.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2256-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2256-S2258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               PRESIDENT CLINTON'S IMMIGRATION INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, today, President Clinton announced an \nimportant and innovative new $1 billion immigration initiative to \naddress the problems of illegal immigration. This initiative represents \na coordinated new approach by the Immigration Service, the Customs \nService, and the Labor Department to confront this problem head-on, and \nto do so in ways which protect the rights of law-abiding Americans and \nlegal immigrants.\n  [[Page S2257]] This initiative comes on top of already substantial \naccomplishments by the Clinton administration in the enforcement of the \nimmigration laws. This administration, more than any other, has \nenhanced border enforcement by increasing the ranks of the Border \nPatrol and applying modern enforcement tools. It has sought--and \nreceived--the largest budget increases in the history of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service. It has expanded efforts to \nidentify and remove criminal aliens from the country. And it has \nprovided specific assistance to States which bear the brunt of the \ncosts of illegal immigration.\n  It is clear that effective control of illegal immigration requires \nnot only strong border enforcement, but also removal of the magnet of \nemployment that attracts illegal aliens to the United States.\n  For the past 2 years, the administration has focused unprecedented \nnew resources on the problem of illegal border crossers. The \nadministration's fiscal year 1996 plan will add 700 new Border Patrol \nofficers this year, and bring the total officers added during this \nadministration to 1,750. It will give these Border Patrol officers the \nbackup support they need to do their jobs, by adding 140 support staff \nand by providing additional sophisticated border technology such as \nsurveillance cameras and motion sensors.\n  Millions of people enter the United States for business and tourism \neach year. The administration's goal is to ensure that legitimate \nborder crossers are assisted in entering as rapidly and efficiently as \npossible, and that potential law-breakers are identified and kept out.\n  The administration's proposal will provide 680 new INS inspectors and \n375 new Customs inspectors to facilitate legal entries and to prevent \nsmuggling of aliens, drugs, and other contraband. The plan will provide \nthese inspectors with upgraded lookout systems and other computer \nfacilities for rapid detection of those unqualified for entry. Since \nlegitimate border crossers benefit most by these enforcement \nactivities, the administration is seeking authorization to charge a \nnominal border crossing fee, for use exclusively in upgrading ports of \nentry and in border enforcement.\n  Aliens enter the United States illegally, or overstay legitimate \nvisitor visas, principally because to many employers are willing to \nviolate the law to hire them. The second aspect of the administration's \nproposal will invest an additional $93 million in workplace-related \nenforcement. The administration will add 365 new INS investigators and \n202 Department of Labor wage and hour investigators to target \ngeographical locations and industries where illegal aliens most \ncommonly find employment.\n  The majority of American employers want to comply with the law. But \nmany find it difficult to determine which aliens are eligible to work. \nTo address this problem, the Commission on Immigration Reform has \ncalled for establishment of a nationwide database of INS and Social \nSecurity data that employers can use to verify the work-authorized \nstatus of job applicants.\n  The Commission's recommendation has significant support, but a number \nof critics have raised important questions about the wisdom of a \nnationwide database. Experts in computer privacy and civil liberties \nhave questioned it, and others have suggested that the cost of such a \ndatabase may be prohibitive.\n  The administration's plan is a step-by-step approach to test the \nfeasibility and desirability of the Commission's proposal, and to \nexplore other methods of verifying eligibility for employment. This \napproach will permit us to evaluate the potential benefits and costs of \nsuch reforms. While making real improvements in existing systems now.\n  The third major portion of the administration's plan provides $178 \nmillion in additional funding for the deportation of criminal and other \ndeportable aliens, including a major enhancement of an existing program \nthat permits INS to deport criminal aliens immediately after they have \nfinished serving their criminal sentences. The administration will also \nconcentrate greater resources on locating and deporting noncriminal \naliens who have been ordered deported in the past but have failed to \nleave the country.\n  Madam President, I commend the Administration for its proposal. I \nlook forward to hearings and action by Congress on this critical issue, \nand I ask unanimous recent that a summary of the administration's \nproposed may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Executive Summary--The President's 1996 Immigration Initiative\n\n\n             Strengthening the Nation's Immigration System\n\n       After two years of unprecedented efforts, the President's \n     FY 1996 budget includes an additional $1 billion to further \n     strengthen the Administration's commitment to border security \n     and to its comprehensive strategy ``that addresses job \n     security through worksite enforcement, community security \n     through removal of criminal aliens, and economic security \n     through assistance to states.''\n\n              Strengthen board enforcement and management\n\n       With a record infusion of new resources in 1994 and 1995, \n     this Administration is taking control of the border. The FY \n     1996 budget provides an additional $369 million to \n     strategically reinforce our border strategy and to build on \n     successes. This strategy includes:\n       700 new border patrol agents, 680 new INS inspectors, and \n     165 new support staff, bringing the number of INS personnel \n     devoted to nationwide border control to nearly 9,000, a 51 \n     percent increase over 1993. On the Southwest boarder alone, \n     we will have increased border control staffing (agents, \n     inspectors, and support) by 60 percent by the end of FY 1996.\n       Over 1,000 new INS and Customs inspectors for land ports of \n     entry to complement border enforcement activities and \n     facilitate commercial vehicular and pedestrian traffic;\n       Continued technological improvements, including \n     surveillance cameras, fingerprint technology, encrypted \n     radios, and senors to augment agent effectiveness;\n       Automated lookout systems and case tracking systems to \n     facilitate traffic and inspections processes and provide \n     electronic information exchanges between overseas Consular \n     offices and the domestic inspection process;\n       Enhanced domestic and overseas enforcement and intelligence \n     enforcement resources to deter alien smuggling and the use of \n     fraudulent documents; and\n       A new Border Services User Fee program at land border ports \n     of entry to pay for improvements that will ease traffic \n     congestion, expedite the issuance of Border Crossing Cards \n     and detect fraudulent documents.\n\n        Expand and improve worksite enforcement and verification\n\n       The President's budget includes $93 million to reserve \n     years of inattention to enforcement of labor standards and \n     employer sanctions. The Administration also has firmly \n     endorsed the recommendations of the Jordan Commission to \n     conduct pilots to test various techniques for improving \n     verification of employment authorization and is now seeking \n     substantial funding to implement these pilots. The worksite \n     initiatives will help to ensure that jobs are available only \n     to those who are authorized to work in the United States. The \n     budget enhancement provides:\n       365 new INS investigators--an 85 percent increase over \n     1993--for a targeted enforcement effort in the seven states \n     with the largest number of illegal immigrants and against \n     industries that have historically exploited illegal workers;\n       202 new Department of Labor Wage and Hour investigators and \n     other enforcement personnel to maintain fair and lawful labor \n     practices; and\n       $28 million for several verification pilots, including \n     expanding the INS Telephone Verification System for \n     employers. We also will significantly improve the quality of \n     INS records and make additions to Social Security \n     Administration databases that contain information related to \n     work eligibility.\n\n Triple the number of illegal aliens deported since 1993 and increase \n                               detention\n\n       The Administration's immigration strategy will ensure that \n     more aliens who have been ordered deported or excluded \n     actually depart from the United States. The Administration's \n     FY 1996 budget requests $178 million to expand the capacity \n     to detain and remove both criminal aliens and other \n     deportable aliens. With these resources, the Administration \n     will:\n       Triple the deportation of both criminal and non-criminal \n     aliens from 37,000 in 1993 to more than 110,000 in 1996, \n     based on current projections. Next year, we expect to\n      deport more than 58,000 criminal aliens, more than double \n     the number of criminal aliens we plan to deport in 1995;\n       Increase detention of deportable aliens by adding more than \n     2,800 beds to detention facilities, an increase of 46 percent \n     over 1993;\n       Implement streamlined administrative procedures authorized \n     in the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 \n     to deport aggravated felons, saving costs related to the \n     judicial process; and\n       Ensure that those denied asylum are deported from the \n     United States.\n\n                      Expand assistance to States\n\n       Deterring illegal immigration is the best way to contain \n     the associated costs to states. Beyond this clear federal \n     responsibility to support states by deterring illegal \n     immigration and removing illegal aliens, the \n     [[Page S2258]] Administration is requesting a total of $563 \n     million for direct assistance to states and improved \n     services, including $550 million to offset the states' costs \n     associated with illegal immigrants. Of the total $563 million \n     budget request for assistance and services, $383.4 million \n     represents the increase from FY 1995. See funding summary \n     attached. The resources requested will:\n       Fund the commitment established in 1986 by Congress to \n     reimburse states for the costs of incarcerating illegal \n     aliens. The $300 million in resources requested for \n     incarceration costs represents the full amount authorized and \n     exceeds reimbursements in 1995 by $170 million;\n       Provide $100 million for grants to school districts that \n     enroll large numbers of recent immigrant students--double the \n     amount provided for FY 1995; and\n       Provide $150 million for a new discretionary grant program \n     to help states cover the costs of providing emergency and \n     certain other medical services.\n       Expand the current Law Enforcement Support Center pilot, \n     which assists local law enforcement agencies in determining \n     whether criminals arrested for felonies are non-citizens.\n       Fund a high quality Center for Immigration Statistics to \n     collect, evaluate, and disseminate accurate and timely \n     immigration data to Congress, state and local governments, \n     and the public.\n\n             Deny public benefits to undocumented migrants\n\n       Undocumented migrants should not be eligible for public \n     services or benefits, with very limited exceptions.

CARNEY FROM THE RHODE ISLAND DEPARTMENT OF \n                                 HEALTH\n\n  Mr. PELL. Madam President, at the end of 1994, the Rhode Island \nDepartment of Health suffered an enormous loss--the retirement of James \nE. Carney. Jim was with the department of health for 16 years, serving \nas its director of community affairs for 13 years.\n  And what a job he did. There was no question, no deadline, no request \nthat I or my staff made that Jim Carney could not handle quickly, \ncourteously, and to the point. He was always well informed about the \nactivities and mission of the department, and the need for \ncommunication and coordination with other branches of government. He \nwas a public servant in the very finest sense of the word, and we will \nsorely miss his help, his good humor, and his presence at the \ndepartment of health.\n  Jim was involved in the passage and implementation of many laws and \nprograms, including the HMO Act of 1983; the central cancer registry at \nthe department of health; newborn screening programs, childhood \nimmunization and lead screening programs; oversight of the State \nmedical examiner's office; protection of the rights of the terminally \nill, and promotion of public health research and minority health \nprograms.\n  I regret to hear that Jim has not been in the best of health \nrecently, and, on behalf of myself, my staff, and the people of Rhode \nIsland, I want to wish him a speedy recovery, a long and happy \nretirement, and the best of everything in the future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2259-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF ROBERT J. PFEIFFER\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I have known Robert J. Pfeiffer, the \noutgoing chairman of the Board of Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. for many \nyears. He is an acknowledged and respected leader in the shipping \nindustry in Hawaii and in our Nation. I wish to join the people of \nHawaii in wishing him a happy and rewarding retirement.\n  Bob Pfeiffer was born in Fiji in 1920. As a very young child he came \nto Hololulu, was educated at McKinley High School and became a deckhand \nfor the Inter-Island Steam Navigation Co., Ltd., of which he later \nbecame president.\n  Bob Pfeiffer's career with Alexander & Baldwin [A] began in 1956 \nwhen he joined its subsidiary, Matson Navigation Co., Inc. Matchinal \nCorp., a Matson off-shoot, was a stevedoring and terminal company in \nthe San Francisco Bay area, which Bob Pfeiffer joined as vice president \nand general manager. In 1962 he as promoted to president of Matson \nTerminals, Inc., another Matson subsidiary. He was appointed Matson \npresident and CEO in 1973; he has served as Matson's chairman \ncontinuously since 1979. At Matson, he guided the company through a \nperiod of tremendous growth and success and in the process transformed \nit into one of the world's most efficient, modern ocean transportation \ncompanies.\n  Bob Pfeiffer was named to A's board of directors in 1978; he was \nappointed president of A the next year. He assumed the posts of chief \nexecutive officer and chairman of the board in 1980. Under his \nleadership, A has grown, modernized, and diversified. Bob Pfeiffer \nalso earned the company a solid reputation for involvement in \nphilanthropic activities and community affairs, both in Hawaii and \nCalifornia, its two principal places of business.\n  Today, the Alexander & Baldwin Foundation, which he created, has \nestablished a level of giving in excess of $1 million a year. Bob \nPfeiffer has served on many corporate, professional and non-profit \nboards and organization, often in leadership positions. These include \nFirst Hawaiian, Inc.; First Bank; the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii; \nthe American Bureau of Shipping; the Maritime Transportation Research \nBoard of the National Academy of Sciences, as chairman; and many \nothers.\n  Bob Pfeiffer's community and professional leadership earned him \nnumerous honors. The latest was the presentation to him on January 25, \n1995, of the Charles Reed Bishop Medal by Honolulu's Bishop Museum, \nwhich cited his ``leadership and personal example'' in making A ``a \nleader in corporate citizenship * * * through its exemplary support of \ncommunity organizations * * *''\n  In 1986 the Aloha Council of the Boy Scouts of America honored him \nwith the Distinguished Citizen of the Year Award and in 1985 the United \nSeamen's Service gave him its Admiral of the Ocean Sea Award in New \nYork. Bob Pfeiffer has been granted honorary doctorates by the Marine \nMaritime Academy, the University of Hawaii, and Hawaii Loa College.\n  His outstanding contributions to the State of Hawaii and to our \nNation will not be forgotten.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2259-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2259-S2260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              THREAT OF ORGANIZED CRIME IN EASTERN EUROPE\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Madam President, in May of last year the Senate Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations held a hearing on the growing threat of \norganized crime in Eastern Europe and the countries of the former \nSoviet Union. This hearing featured an historic joint appearance by \nLouis Freeh, the Director of the FBI, Hans-Ludwig Zachert, the \nPresident of Germany's Bundeskriminalamt, and General Mikhail Yegorov, \nthe head of Russia's Organized Crime Control Department.\n  In his prepared statement submitted to the subcommittee, General \nYegorov made reference to an Austrian company by the name of Nordex, \nimplying that its president was an individual known as Umar Vokov, who \nis suspected by Russian authorities of underground criminal activity. \nRecently, the subcommittee has received a letter from the real \npresident of Nordex, a Mr. G. Loutchansky, disputing General Yegorov's \nstatement and denying any relationship between Nordex and Umar Vokov. \nMr. Loutchansky also provided the subcommittee with a letter from the \nRussian Ministry of Internal Affairs to Nordex's attorney in which the \nMinistry accepted Nordex's assurances concerning Vokov and expressed \nregret to Nordex for any inaccuracies in General Yegorov's statement.\n  Mr. Loutchansky had sought to have these letters added to the \nsubcommittee's hearing record in order to correct any misimpressions \nwhich could result from the printing of General Yegorov's original \nstatement. Unfortunately, by the time the subcommittee received Mr. \nLoutchansky's request the hearing record had already gone to print. \nWhile I have directed that Mr. Loutchansky's material be included in \nthe official exhibits to the hearing, I believe it is important that \nthey also be placed on the public record. For this reason, I would ask \nthat the correspondence between Mr. Loutchansky and the subcommittee \nand the letter from the Russian Ministry of the Internal Affairs to \nNordox's attorney be reprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                            Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 1995.\n     Mr. G. Loutchansky,\n     President, Nordex G.m.b.H.,\n     Vienna, Austria\n       Dear Mr. Loutchansky: The Permanent Subcommittee on \n     Investigations has received your letter of December 2, 1994, \n     in which you dispute a statement in the prepared testimony of \n     First Deputy Minister Mikhail Yegorov submitted to the \n     Subcommittee in connection with its May 25, 1994 hearing on \n     ``International Organized Crime and Its Impact on the United \n     States.'' This statement concerned an alleged relationship \n     between your company and an individual named Umar Vokov, who \n     is suspected by Russian authorities of criminal activity. \n     Attached to your letter was a letter from the Russian \n     Ministry of Internal Affairs which \n     [[Page S2260]] accepted your assurances of a lack of any \n     relationship between your company and this individual and \n     expressed regret for any inaccuracies regarding this matter \n     in the statement of First Deputy Minister Yegorov.\n       You have requested that these letters be made a part of the \n     printed record of the Subcommittee's proceedings. Under \n     normal circumstances, the Subcommittee would be happy to \n     accommodate such a request; however, by the time the \n     Subcommittee received your letter, the hearing record was \n     already in the process of being printed. Although the \n     Subcommittee is thus unable to include this information in \n     the printed record, I have directed that it be included in \n     the official exhibits to the hearing. As such the information \n     will become part of the permanent records of the Subcommittee \n     with respect to these proceedings. I will also request that \n     your material be reprinted in the Congressional Record.\n       I thank you for bringing this matter to the attention of \n     the Subcommittee.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sam Nunn.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                       Nordex,\n\n                                    Vienna, Austria; Dec. 2, 1994.\n     Subject: hearing of the Committee on May 25, 1994, Testimony \n         of Mr. Mikhail Yegorov, First Deputy Minister and Head of \n         the Organized Crime Control Department, Russian Ministry \n         of Internal Affairs.\n     Hon. Senator Sam Nunn,\n      Chairman, Committee on Governmental Affairs, Permanent \n         Subcommittee on Investigations, Capitol Hill, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn, In subject Testimony the Russian Deputy \n     Minister stated:\n       ``Vokov's brother Umar is the President of the Austrian \n     company Nordex, located in Vienna, and also suspected of \n     underground business.''\n       This statement of Minister Yegorov went on the \n     Congressional files, and had probably also been picked up by \n     various agencies of the Government of the United States of \n     America.\n       We were very concerned about this statement and its \n     implications, since neither Vokov nor his brother Umar are or \n     were shareholders, directors, or employees of our company or \n     any of their associated companies. We have, therefore, taken \n     up this matter with the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs \n     and enclosed herewith is a copy of their letter, dated \n     November 9, 1994, together with a translation thereof, which \n     I believe clarifies the position.\n       Nordex G.m.b.H. is a very big Trading house based in Vienna \n     and has no connections whatsoever to organized crime or any \n     other illegal activities.\n       It is, therefore, essential that the correction and \n     expression of regret contained in the a/m letter of the \n     Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, dated November 9, 1994, \n     be entered into the public record of your Committee and also \n     passed on to the various governmental organizations, so that \n     the reputation of Nordex G.m.b.H. and its associates, is \n     cleared.\n       May we ask you to kindly confirm the receipt of this letter \n     and for your consent to take the requested steps. If you \n     require any further information, please feel free to contact \n     us.\n       We remain, Sir,\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   G. Loutchansky,\n      President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      Ministry of Internal Affairs\n\n\n                                    of the Russian Federation,\n\n                                    City Moscow, November 9, 1994.\n     To Dr. Gabriel Lansky,\n     Lawyer,\n     Vienna, Austria.\n       Dear Mr. Lansky, The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the \n     Russian Federation has examined your letter of August 29, \n     1994, and subsequent letters, concerning the speech of the \n     First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs, M. Egorov, on May \n     25, 1994, in the course of open hearings of the Permanent \n     Subcommittee on Investigations of the USA Senate on the \n     question of organized crime in the republics of the former \n     USSR.\n       The quotation in your letter has been taken from M. \n     Egorov's written thesis, which was handed to the organisers \n     of the hearings, and not from the transcript of proceedings \n     of his speech in the Subcommittee.\n       Having received your assurances that Umar Bokov is neither \n     an employee, nor a manager, nor a shareholder of either the \n     ``Nordex GmbH'' company or of any of its branches, \n     representative offices or joint ventures, one could state \n     with regret, that an inaccuracy occurred in the quotation, \n     which was caused by two circumstances.\n       Firstly, in the course of the investigation of the criminal \n     case in connection with the murder of a militiamen, Umar \n     Bokov, while given evidence, stated his place of work as the \n     firm ``Nordex'', situated in Vienna, and also presented \n     himself as its president. The preliminary examination proved \n     the existence of a firm with the given name in Vienna and the \n     fact that U. Bokov used to leave for Austria on commercial \n     business trips. There was no need to prove U. Bokov's place \n     of work because he was merely a witness in that case.\n       Secondly, at the stage of translation or typing of M. \n     Egorov's thesis, the important word in this context, \n     ``likely'' (also given in English in the text), which applied \n     to the phrase that U. Bokov is the president of the Austrian \n     company ``Nordex'', was omitted.\n       Expressing regret concerning the inaccuracy, we declare \n     that the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia had no basis \n     for, or intention of, connecting the ``Nordex GmbH'' company \n     and its actual President, G. Loutchansky, with the \n     underground business in general or, in particular, with \n     international drug trafficking.\n       The quotation stated in your letter applies exclusively to \n     Umar Bokov.\n           Yours faithfully,\n                                                  V.P.

Immediately upon filing of the request, the \n     Chief Clerk of the Committee shall notify the Chairman of the \n     filing of the request. If, within three calendar days after \n     the filing of the request, the Chairman does not call the \n     requested special meeting, to be held within seven calendar \n     days after the filing of the request, a majority of the \n     members of the Committee may file in the offices of the \n     Committee their written notice that a special meeting of the \n     Committee will be held, specifying the date and hour of that \n     special meeting. The Committee shall meet on that date and \n     hour. Immediately upon the filing of the notice, the Clerk \n     shall notify all members of the Committee that such special \n     meeting will be held and inform them of its date and hour.\n       (c) Minority Request.--Whenever any hearing is conducted by \n     the Committee or a subcommittee upon any measure or matter, \n     the minority on the Committee shall be entitled, upon request \n     made by a majority of the minority members to the Chairman \n     before the completion of such hearing, to call witnesses \n     selected by the minority to testify with respect to the \n     measure or matter during at least one day of hearing thereon.\n       (d) Public Announcement.--The Committee, or any \n     subcommittee thereof, shall make public announcement of the \n     date, place, time, and subject matter of any hearing to be \n     conducted on any measure or matter at least one week in \n     advance of such hearings, unless the Chairman of the \n     Committee, or subcommittee, determines that there is good \n     cause to begin such hearing at an earlier date.\n       (e) Procedure.--Insofar as possible, proceedings of the \n     Committee will be conducted without resort to the formalities \n     of parliamentary procedure and with due regard for the views \n     of all members. Issues of procedure which may arise from time \n     to time shall be resolved by decision of the Chairman, in \n     consultation with the Ranking Minority Member. The Chairman, \n     in consultation with the Ranking Minority Member, may also \n     propose special procedures to govern the consideration of \n     particular matters by the Committee.\n       (f) Closed Sessions.--Each meeting of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, or any subcommittee thereof, including \n     meetings to conduct hearings, shall be open to the public, \n     except that a meeting or series of meetings by the Committee \n     or a subcommittee on the same subject for a period of no more \n     than fourteen calendar days may be closed to the public on a \n     motion made and seconded to go into closed session to discuss \n     only whether the matters enumerated in paragraphs (1) through \n     (6) would require the meeting to be closed followed \n     immediately by a record vote in open session by a majority of \n     the members of the Committee or subcommittee when it is \n     determined that the matters to be discussed or the testimony \n     to be taken at such meeting or meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of the foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee staff \n     personnel or internal staff management or procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct; to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to \n     public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     or financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person, or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations.\n       A closed meeting may be opened by a majority vote of the \n     Committee.\n       (g) Staff Attendance.--A member of the Committee may have \n     one member of his or her personal staff, for whom that member \n     assumes personal responsibility, accompany and be seated \n     nearby at Committee meetings.\n       Each member of the Committee may designate members of his \n     or her personal staff, who hold a Top Secret security \n     clearance, for the purpose of their eligibility to attend \n     closed sessions of the Committee, subject to the same \n     conditions set forth for Committee staff under Rules 12, 13, \n     and 14.\n       In addition, the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader of \n     the Senate, if they are not otherwise members of the \n     Committee, may designate one member of their staff with\n      a Top Secret security clearance to attend closed sessions of \n     the Committee, subject to the same conditions set forth \n     for Committee staff under Rules 12, 13, and 14. Staff of \n     other Senators who are not members of the Committee may \n     not attend closed sessions of the Committee.\n       Attendance of Committee staff at meetings shall be limited \n     to those designated by the Staff Director or the Minority \n     Staff Director.\n       The Committee, by majority vote, or the Chairman, with the \n     concurrence of the Ranking Minority Member, may limit staff \n     attendance at specified meetings.\n\n\n                            rule 4--quorums\n\n       (a) Testimony.--For the purpose of taking sworn or unsworn \n     testimony at any duly scheduled meeting a quorum of the \n     Committee and each subcommittee thereof shall consist of one \n     member.\n       (b) Business.--A quorum for the transaction of Committee or \n     subcommittee business, other than for reporting a measure or \n     recommendation to the Senate or the taking of testimony, \n     shall consist of one-third of the members of the Committee or \n     subcommittee, including at least one member from each party.\n       (c) Reporting.--A majority of the membership of the \n     Committee shall constitute a quorum for reporting any measure \n     or recommendation to the Senate. No measure or recommendation \n     shall be ordered reported from the Committee unless a \n     majority of the Committee members are physically present. The \n     vote of the Committee to report a measure or matter shall \n     require the concurrence of a majority of those members who \n     are physically present at the time the vote is taken.\n\n\n                            rule 5--proxies\n\n       Proxies must be in writing with the signature of the absent \n     member. Subject to the requirements of Rule 4 for the \n     physical presence of a quorum to report a matter, proxy \n     voting shall be allowed on all measures and matters before \n     the Committee. However, proxies shall not be voted on a \n     measure or matter except when the absent member has been \n     informed of the matter on which he is being recorded and has \n     affirmatively requested that he or she be so recorded.\n\n\n                           rule 6--witnesses\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations will \n     consider requests to testify on any matter or measure pending \n     before the Committee.\n       (b) Presentation.--If the Chairman so determines, the oral \n     presentation of witnesses shall be limited to 10 minutes. \n     However, written statements of reasonable length may be\n      submitted by witnesses and other interested persons who are \n     unable to testify in person.\n       (c) Filing of Statements.--A witness appearing before the \n     Committee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall file a written \n     statement of his proposed testimony at least 48 hours prior \n     to his appearance, unless this requirement is waived by the \n     Chairman and the Ranking Minority member following their \n     determination that there is good cause for failure to file \n     such a statement.\n       (d) Expenses.--Only the Chairman may authorize expenditures \n     of funds for the expenses of witnesses appearing before the \n     Committee or its subcommittees.\n       (e) Requests.--Any witness called for a hearing may submit \n     a written request to the Chairman no later than 24 hours in \n     advance for his testimony to be in closed or open session, or \n     for any other unusual procedure. The Chairman shall determine \n     whether to grant any such request and shall notify the \n     Committee members of the request and of his decision.\n\n\n                           rule 7--subpoenas\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The Chairman or any other member of the \n     Committee, when authorized by a majority vote of the \n     Committee at a meeting or by proxies, shall have authority to \n     subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the production of \n     memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials. When \n     the Committee authorizes a subpoena, it may be issued upon \n     the signature of the Chairman or any other member designated \n     by the Committee.\n       (b) Return.--A subpoena, or a request to an agency, for \n     documents may be issued whose return shall occur at a time \n     and place other than that of a scheduled Committee meeting. A \n     return on such a subpoena or request which is incomplete or \n     accompanied by an objection constitutes good cause for a \n     hearing on shortened notice. Upon such a return, the Chairman \n     or any other member designated by him may convene a hearing \n     by giving 2 hours notice by telephone to all other members. \n     One member shall constitute a quorum for such a hearing. The \n     sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to elucidate further \n     information about the return and to rule on the objection.\n       (c) Depositions.--At the direction of the Committee, staff \n     is authorized to take depositions from witnesses.\n                     [[Page S2263]] rule 8--reports\n\n       (a) Filing.--When the Committee has ordered a measure or \n     recommendation reported, the report thereon shall be filed in \n     the senate at the earliest practicable time.\n       (b) Supplemental, Minority and Additional Views.--A member \n     of the Committee who gives notice of his intentions to file \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views at the time of \n     final Committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be \n     entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file \n     such views, in writing, with the Chief Clerk of the\n      Committee, with the 3 days to begin at 11:00 p.m. on the \n     same day that the Committee has ordered a measure or \n     matter reported. Such views shall then be included in the \n     Committee report and printed in the same volume, as a part \n     thereof, and their inclusion shall be noted on the cover \n     of the report. In the absence of timely notice, the \n     Committee report may be filed and printed immediately \n     without such views.\n       (c) Rollcall Votes.--The results of all rollcall votes \n     taken in any meeting of the Committee on any measure, or \n     amendment thereto, shall be announced in the Committee \n     report. The announcement shall include a tabulation of the \n     votes cast in favor and votes cast in opposition to each such \n     measure and amendment by each member of the Committee.\n\n\n                            rule 9--treaties\n\n       (a) The Committee is the only Committee of the Senate with \n     jurisdiction to review and report to the Senate on treaties \n     submitted by the President for Senate advice and consent. \n     Because the House of Representatives has no role in the \n     approval of treaties, the Committee is therefore the only \n     congressional committee with responsibility for treaties.\n       (b) Once submitted by the President for advice and consent, \n     each treaty is referred to the Committee and remains on its \n     calendar from Congress to Congress until the Committee takes \n     action to report it to the Senate or recommend its return to \n     the President, or until the Committee is discharged of the \n     treaty by the Senate.\n       (c) In accordance with Senate Rule XXX.2, treaties which \n     have been reported to the Senate but not acted on before the \n     end of a Congress ``shall be resumed at the commencement of \n     the next Congress as if no proceedings had previously been \n     had thereon.''\n       (d) Insofar as possible, the Committee should conduct a \n     public hearing on each treaty as soon as possible after its \n     submission by the President. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, treaties reported to the Senate shall be \n     accompanied by a written report.\n\n\n                          rule 10--nominations\n\n       (a) Waiting Requirement.--Unless otherwise directed by the \n     Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations shall not consider any nomination until 6 \n     calendar days after it has been formally submitted to the \n     Senate.\n       (b) Public Consideration.--Nominees for any post who are \n     invited to appear before the Committee shall be heard in \n     public session, unless a majority of the Committee decrees \n     otherwise.\n       (c) Required Data.--No nomination shall be reported to the \n     Senate unless (1) the nominee has been accorded a security \n     clearance on the basis of a thorough investigation by \n     executive branch agencies; (2) in appropriate cases, the \n     nominee has filed a confidential statement and financial \n     disclosure report with the Committee; (3) the\n      Committee has been assured that the nominee does not have \n     any interests which could conflict with the interests of \n     the government in the exercise of the nominee's proposed \n     responsibilities; (4) for persons nominated to be chief of \n     mission, ambassador-at-large, or minister, the Committee \n     has received a complete list of any contributions made by \n     the nominee or members of his immediate family to any \n     Federal election campaign during the year of his or her \n     nomination and for the 4 preceding years; and (5) for \n     persons nominated to be chiefs of mission, a report on the \n     demonstrated competence of that nominee to perform the \n     duties of the position to which he or she has been \n     nominated.\n\n\n                            rule 11--travel\n\n       (a) Foreign Travel.--No member of the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on Committee \n     business unless specifically authorized by the Chairman, who \n     is required by law to approve vouchers and report \n     expenditures of foreign currencies, and the Ranking Minority \n     Member. Requests for authorization of such travel shall state \n     the purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and \n     financial report shall be filed with the Committee within 30 \n     days. This report shall be furnished to all members of the \n     Committee and shall not be otherwise disseminated without the \n     express authorization of the Committee. Except in \n     extraordinary circumstances, staff travel shall not be \n     approved unless the reporting requirements have been \n     fulfilled for all prior trips. Except for travel that is \n     strictly personal, travel funded by non-U.S. Government \n     sources is subject to the same approval and substantive \n     reporting requirements as U.S. Government-funded travel. In \n     addition, members and staff are reminded of Senate Rule \n     XXXV.4 requiring a determination by the Senate Ethics \n     Committee in the case of foreign-sponsored travel. Any \n     proposed travel by Committee staff for a subcommittee purpose \n     must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and ranking \n     minority member prior to submission of the request to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the full Committee. \n     When the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member approve the \n     foreign travel of a member of the staff of the committee not \n     accompanying a member of the Committee, all members of the \n     Committee shall be advised, prior to the commencement of such \n     travel of its extent, nature, and purpose.\n       (b) Domestic Travel.--All official travel in the United \n     States by the Committee staff shall be approved in advance by \n     the Staff Director, or in the case of minority staff, by the \n     Minority Staff Director.\n       (c) Personal Staff.--As a general rule, no more than one \n     member of the personal staff of a member of the Committee may \n     travel with that member with the approval of the Chairman and \n     the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee. During such \n     travel, the personal staff member shall be considered to be \n     an employee of the Committee.\n       (d) Personal Representatives of the Member (PRM).--For the \n     purposes of Rule 11 as regard staff foreign travel, the \n     officially-designated personal representative of the member \n     (PRM) shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and \n     responsibilities as\n      members of the staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations. \n     Furthermore, for the purposes of this section, each Member \n     of the Committee may designate one personal staff member \n     as the ``Personal Representative of the Member.''\n\n\n                          rule 12--transcripts\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep \n     verbatim transcripts of all Committee and subcommittee \n     meetings and such transcripts shall remain in the custody of \n     the Committee, unless a majority of the Committee decides \n     otherwise. Transcripts of public hearings by the Committee \n     shall be published unless the Chairman, with the concurrence \n     of the Ranking Minority Member, determines otherwise.\n       (b) Classified or Restricted Transcripts.--\n       (1) The Chief Clerk of the Committee shall have \n     responsibility for the maintenance and security of classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n       (2) A record shall be maintained of each use of classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n       (3) Classified or restricted transcripts shall be kept in \n     locked combination safes in the Committee offices except when \n     in active use by authorized persons for a period not to \n     exceed 2 weeks. Extensions of this period may be granted as \n     necessary by the Chief Clerk. They must never be left \n     unattended and shall be returned to the Chief Clerk promptly \n     when no longer needed.\n       (4) Except as provided in paragraph 7 below, transcripts \n     classified secret or higher may not leave the Committee \n     offices except for the purpose of declassification.\n       (5) Classified transcripts other than those classified \n     secret or higher may leave the Committee offices in the \n     possession of authorized persons with the approval of the \n     Chairman. Delivery and return shall be made only by \n     authorized persons. Such transcripts may not leave \n     Washington, DC, unless adequate assurances for their security \n     are made to the Chairman.\n       (6) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking notes \n     or quotes from classified transcripts. Their contents may not \n     be divulged to any unauthorized person.\n       (7) Subject to any additional restrictions imposed by the \n     Chairman with the concurrence of the Ranking Minority Member, \n     only the following persons are authorized to have access to \n     classified or restricted transcripts.\n       (i) Members and staff of the Committee in the Committee \n     rooms;\n       (ii) Designated personal representatives of members of the \n     Committee, and of the Majority and Minority Leaders, with \n     appropriate security clearances, in the Committee's Capitol \n     office;\n       (iii) Senators not members of the Committee, by permission \n     of the Chairman in the Committee rooms; and\n       (iv) Members of the executive departments involved in the \n     meeting, in the Committee's Capitol office, or, with the \n     permission of the Chairman, in the offices of the officials \n     who took part in the meeting, but in either case, only for a \n     specified and limited period of time, and only after reliable \n     assurances against further reproduction or dissemination have \n     been given.\n       (8) Any restrictions imposed upon access to a meeting of \n     the Committee shall also apply to the transcript of such \n     meeting, except by special permission of the Chairman and \n     notice to the other members of the Committee. Each transcript \n     of a closed session of the Committee shall include on its \n     cover a description of the restrictions imposed upon access, \n     as well as any applicable restrictions upon photocopying, \n     note-taking or other dissemination.\n       (9) In addition to restrictions resulting from the \n     inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of \n     a Committee meeting, members and staff shall not discuss with \n     anyone the proceedings of the Committee in closed session or \n     reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session \n     unless that person would have been permitted to attend the \n     session itself, or unless such communication is specifically \n     authorized by the Chairman, the Ranking Minority Member, or \n     in the case of staff, by the Staff Director or Minority Staff \n     Director. A record shall be kept of all such authorizations.\n       (c) Declassification--\n       (1) All restricted transcripts and classified Committee \n     reports shall be declassified on a \n     [[Page S2264]] date twelve years after their origination \n     unless the Committee by majority vote decides against such \n     declassification, and provided that the executive departments \n     involved and all former Committee members who participated \n     directly in the sessions or reports concerned have been \n     consulted in advance and given a reasonable opportunity to \n     raise objections to such declassification.\n       (2) Any transcript or classified Committee report, or any \n     portion thereof, may be declassified fewer than twelve years \n     after their origination if:\n       (i) the Chairman originates such action or receives a \n     written request for such action, and notifies the other \n     members of the Committee;\n       (ii) the Chairman, Ranking Minority Member, and each member \n     or former member who participated directly in such meeting or \n     report give their approval, except that the Committee by \n     majority vote may overrule any objections thereby raised to \n     early declassification; and\n       (iii) the executive departments and all former Committee \n     members are consulted in advance and have a reasonable \n     opportunity to object to early declassification.\n\n\n                      rule 13--classified material\n       (a) All classified material received or originated by the \n     Committee shall be logged in at the Committee's offices in \n     the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and except for material \n     classified as ``Top Secret'' shall be filed in the Dirksen \n     Senate Building offices for Committee use and safekeeping.\n       (b) Each such piece of classified material received or \n     originated shall be card indexed and serially numbered, and \n     where requiring onward distribution shall be distributed by \n     means of an attached indexed form approved by the Chairman. \n     If such material is to be distributed outside the Committee \n     offices, it shall, in addition to the attached form, be \n     accompanied also by an approved signature sheet to show \n     onward receipt.\n       (c) Distribution of classified material among offices shall \n     be by Committee members or authorized staff only. All \n     classified material sent to members' offices, and that \n     distributed within the working offices of the Committee, \n     shall be returned to the offices designated by the Chief \n     Clerk. No classified material is to be removed from the \n     offices of the members or of the Committee without permission \n     of the Chairman. Such classified material will be afforded \n     safe handling and safe storage at all times.\n       (d) Material classified ``Top Secret,'' after being indexed \n     and numbered shall be sent to the Committee's Capitol office \n     for use by the members and authorized staff in that office \n     only or in such other secure Committee offices as may be \n     authorized by the Chairman or Staff Director.\n       (e) In general, members and staff undertake to confine \n     their access to classified information on the basis of a \n     ``need to know'' such information related to their Committee \n     responsibilities.\n       (f) The Staff Director is authorized to make such \n     administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry out \n     the provisions of these regulations.\n\n\n                             rule 14--Staff\n\n       (a) Responsibilities--\n       (1) The staff works for the Committee as a whole, under the \n     general supervision of the Chairman of the Committee, and the \n     immediate direction of the Staff Director; provided, however, \n     that such part of the staff as is designated Minority Staff, \n     shall be under the general supervision of the Ranking \n     Minority Member and under the immediate direction of the \n     Minority Staff Director.\n       (2) Any member of the Committee should feel free to call \n     upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with \n     Committee business. Members of the Senate not members of the \n     Committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to \n     time should be given assistance subject to the overriding \n     responsibility of the staff to the Committee.\n       (3) The staff's primary responsibility is with respect to \n     bills, resolutions, treaties,\n      and nominations.\n       In addition to carrying out assignments from the Committee \n     and its individual members, the staff has a responsibility to \n     originate suggestions for Committee or subcommittee \n     consideration. The staff also has a responsibility to make \n     suggestions to individual members regarding matters of \n     special interest to such members.\n       (4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as well \n     informed as possible in regard to developments affecting \n     foreign relations and in regard to the administration of \n     foreign programs of the United States. Significant trends or \n     developments which might otherwise escape notice should be \n     called to the attention of the Committee, or of individual \n     Senators with particular interests.\n       (5) The staff pay due regard to the constitutional \n     separation of powers between the Senate and the executive \n     branch. It therefore has a responsibility to help the \n     Committee bring to bear an independent, objective judgment of \n     proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to \n     originate sound proposals of its own. At the same time, the \n     staff shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of \n     foreign affairs.\n       (6) In those instances when Committee action requires the \n     expression of minority views, the staff shall assist the \n     minority as fully as the majority to the end that all points \n     of view may be fully considered by members of the Committee \n     and of the Senate. The staff shall bear in mind that under \n     our constitutional system it is the responsibility of the \n     elected Members of the Senate to determine legislative issues \n     in the light of as full and fair a presentation of the facts \n     as the staff may be able to obtain.\n       (b) Restrictions--\n       (1) The staff shall regard its relationship to the \n     Committee as a privileged one, in the nature of the \n     relationship of a lawyer to a client. In order to protect \n     this relationship and the mutual confidence which must \n     prevail if the Committee-staff relationship is to be a \n     satisfactory and fruitful one, the following criteria shall \n     apply:\n       (i) members of the staff shall not be identified with any \n     special interest group in the field of foreign relations or \n     allow their names to be used by any such group;\n       (ii) members of the staff shall not accept public speaking \n     engagements or write for publication in the field of foreign \n     relations without specific advance permission from the Staff \n     Director, or, in the case of minority staff, from the \n     Minority Staff Director. In the case of the Staff Director \n     and the Minority Staff Director, such advance permission \n     shall be obtained from the Chairman or the Ranking Minority \n     Member, as appropriate. In any event, such public statements \n     should avoid the expression of personal views and should not \n     contain predictions of future, or interpretations of past, \n     Committee action; and\n       (iii) staff shall not discuss their private conversations \n     with members of the Committee without specific advance \n     permission from the Senator or Senators concerned.\n       (2) The staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings \n     of the Committee in closed session or reveal information \n     conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person \n     would have been permitted to attend the session itself, or \n     unless such communication is specifically authorized by the \n     Staff Director or Minority Staff Director. Unauthorized \n     disclosure of information from a closed session or of \n     classified information shall be cause for immediate dismissal \n     and may, in the case of some kinds of information, be grounds \n     for criminal prosecution.\n\n\n                 RULE 15--STATUS AND AMENDMENT OF RULES\n\n       (a) Status.--In addition to the foregoing, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations is governed by the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate which shall take precedence in the event of a clear \n     inconsistency. In addition, the jurisdiction and \n     responsibilities of the Committee with respect to certain \n     matters, as well as the timing and procedure for their \n     consideration in Committee, may be governed by statute.\n       (b) Amendment.--These Rules may be modified, amended, or \n     repealed by a majority of the Committee, provided that a \n     notice in writing of the proposed change has been given to \n     each member at least 48 hours prior to the meeting at which \n     action thereon is to be taken. However, Rules of the \n     Committee which are based upon Senate Rules may not be \n     superseded by Committee vote alone.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2261-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    UNITED STATES TRADE SANCTIONS ON THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, late yesterday afternoon the Office of \nthe United States Trade Representative received a letter from Wu Yi, \nthe PRC Minister of Trade, stating that the Chinese were prepared to \nresume talks in Beijing next week on the issue of infringements on \nAmerican intellectual property rights.\n  As I noted on the floor of the Senate yesterday, since 1992 the PRC \nhas failed to live up to its obligations under the memorandum of \nunderstanding on intellectual property rights. Factories throughout \nChina, especially in the southern and eastern provinces, continue to \nmass-produce pirated versions of American computer software, compact \ndiscs, CD-ROM's, and video and audio cassettes mostly for sale abroad. \nThe USTR estimates that the sale of these pirated items has cost U.S. \nbusinesses more than $1 billion. Efforts by the USTR to bring the PRC \ninto compliance with the MOU have failed, resulting in the proposed \nsanctions announced by the administration on Saturday.\n  Madam President, I am very pleased that the Chinese Government has \nagreed to resume negotiations over this vitally important issue. A \nstrong and equitable relationship between our two countries is of the \nutmost importance, and I know that no one relished the prospect of a \nprotracted trade dispute. I hope that the PRC will use this opportunity \nto constructively address our grievances, and move toward adopting \nstronger measures to curb economic piracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2264-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2264-S2265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          IS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YES\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, the incredibly enormous Federal debt is a \nlot like television's well-known energizer bunny--it keeps going and \n[[Page S2265]] going--at the expense, of course, of the American \ntaxpayer.\n  A lot of politicians talk a good game--when they are back home--about \nbringing Federal deficits and the Federal debt under control. But so \nmany of these same politicians regularly voted in support of bloated \nspending bills during the 103d Congress--which perhaps is a primary \nfactor in the new configuration of U.S. Senators.\n  This is a rather distressing fact as the 104th Congress gets down to \nbusiness. As of Friday, February 3, 1995, the Federal debt stood--down \nto the penny--at exactly $4,804,906,983,189.27 or $18,239.50 per \nperson.\n  Madam President, it is important that all of us monitor, closely and \nconstantly, the incredible cost of merely paying the interest on this \ndebt. Last year, the interest on the Federal debt totalled $190 \nbillion.\n  Madam President, my hope is that the 104th Congress can bring under \ncontrol the outrageous spending that created this outrageous debt. If \nthe party now controlling both Houses of Congress, as a result of the \nNovember elections last year, does not do a better job of getting a \nhandle on this enormous debt, the American people are not likely to \noverlook it in 1996.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2264-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2265-S2266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                ED LEVI--AN OUTSTANDING ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, today marks the 20th anniversary of the \nswearing-in of Edward Levi as Attorney General of the United States \nunder President Gerald Ford.\n  Throughout our history, we have been fortunate when the right man has \nserved in the right job at the right time. Ed Levi was the right man at \nthe right time when he was nominated by President Ford and confirmed by \nthe Senate as Attorney General.\n  Those were turbulent times. Skepticism and cynicism abounded. The \nDepartment of Justice was still suffering from the Watergate scandal. \nTwo Attorneys General had been indicted. Another had resigned rather \nthan follow a President's order. In just over a year, the Department of \nJustice had three Attorneys General, three Deputy Attorneys General, \nand even more assistant attorneys general. Stories began to surface \nabout abuses committed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation--the arm \nof government entrusted with the investigation of violations of the \nlaw. Select committees were formed to investigate the FBI as well as \nthe CIA and other intelligence agencies. Faith in the fairness and \nintegrity of the administration of Federal justice was at a low ebb.\n  Levi, in his 2 short years as Attorney General, restored that faith. \nHe did it by the sheer force of his own integrity, by a concerted \neffort to articulate the standards that would govern government \nconduct, and by his demonstration to the public that these standards \nwould ensure that our Nation remained a government of laws.\n  There was not time, of course, to do everything. There never is. But \nmuch was accomplished. Standards were formulated to guide the conduct \nof the FBI. As a protection against abuses of the past, guidelines were \ndeveloped for the first time to govern domestic security, foreign \nintelligence and counterintelligence investigations, and other aspects \nof the Bureau's work, including the handling of informants and \nbackground employment investigations.\n  All of these issues were extremely controversial. One statistic \ndemonstrates the profound effect that these guidelines have had on the \nBureau's operation. In July 1973, the FBI had more than 21,000 open \ndomestic security cases. Many were investigations of Americans and \nAmerican groups who were considered to be threats to domestic security. \nAfter the guidelines were adopted, by September 1976, the number was \nreduced to 626. it is even lower today.\n  The test of time has demonstrated that these efforts did not \nhamstring the FBI. They strengthened the Bureau and protected its \nagents. These principles still guide the Bureau's operations.\n  Another controversial practice split constitutional scholars and \nsowed the seeds of Government distrust. When Ed Levi became Attorney \nGeneral, the FBI tapped telephones and planted microphones to gather \nforeign intelligence without any prior judicial approval--that is, \nwithout a warrant. Though approval of the Attorney General was required \nfor this warrantless electronic surveillance, suspicions were rife \nabout who was being wiretapped and how many listening posts existed \nthroughout the country.\n  To reassure the public, Attorney General Levi took\n   several steps. He announced that there were no outstanding instances \nof warrantless taps or electronic surveillance directed against \nAmerican citizens. He then undertook, at every opportunity, to discuss \nthe process and safeguards that guided the use of electronic \nsurveillance. But he realized that he could not eliminate this distrust \nof Government without legislation that would balance the need to \nprotect personal privacy and the need to protect the Nation from \nforeign terrorism.\n\n  He proposed a law that provided a judicial warrant mechanism employed \nby a special court, shaped to meet the particular problems of foreign \nintelligence and to do so within constitutional standards. Just as he \nhad done in drafting the FBI guidelines, he consulted with Congress in \nthe best nonpartisan tradition. Indeed, the legislation was drafted by \nthe staffs of the Department of Justice and the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, working closely with the Attorney General and many Members \nof Congress. I recall frequent conversations with Attorney General Levi \nconcerning this proposed legislation. Soon after its introduction, the \nbill was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee. It was enacted in the next Congress \nas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and it is a tribute to \nAttorney General Levi's principled and effective leadership.\n  Other accomplishments were just as important. As the guidelines \ngoverning decisions about how and when to conduct investigations were \nnearing completion, the process was launched to establish standards to \ngovern the equally important area of prosecutorial decisions--such as \nwhen to charge an accused, when to bargain for a guilty plea, when the \nFederal Government should prosecute an individual already prosecuted in \nState court for a related offense, and when to grant immunity in \nexchange for testimony. Immigration policies were reformulated to deal \nwith illegal immigration within a framework that protected the rights \nof individuals. His comments then are just as relevant today:\n\n       We must remember that we face the problem of unlawful \n     immigration because we remain the world's best hope. \n     Unauthorized immigrants are responding to the same human \n     impulses that motivated each of our forebears. We must \n     address the illegal alien issue in a manner compatible with \n     our democratic values and our tradition as a nation of \n     nations.\n\n  I also recall the time when the Ford administration, acting through \nAttorney General Levi, proposed major new handgun control legislation \nto require a waiting period before a handgun could be purchased. The \nFord administration sought in vain to find a Senator from the \nPresident's own party willing to introduce such legislation. I met with \nthe Attorney General and offered to sponsor the administration's \nlegislation in an effort to advance the debate over handgun control. \nThe Attorney General recognized that any comprehensive effort by the \nFederal Government to stem the tide of violent crime required effective \nhandgun control legislation. The successful and bipartisan enactment of \nthe Brady law in the last Congress owes a great deal to the leadership \nof Ed Levi many years ago.\n  Throughout his tenure as Attorney General, Ed Levi was guided by the \nfundamental principle of equal justice under law for all Americans. He \nbelieved that faith in the law must continually be renewed or else it \nis lost. As he said near the end of his services as Attorney General in \nwords that should still guide us today--\n\n       In a society that too easily accepts the notion that \n     everything can be manipulated, it is important to make clear \n     that the administration of justice seeks to be impartial and \n     fair, and that these qualities are not inconsistent with \n     being effective.\n\n  A grateful Nation pauses today on this anniversary to honor a great \nAttorney General for all he did at a difficult period in our history to \nrestore the Nation's faith in its system of law \n[[Page S2266]] and justice. Ed Levi is a profile in courage, and a \nproud example for all citizens of excellence in the law and justice at \nits best.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2265-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 HOMICIDES BY GUNSHOT IN NEW YORK CITY\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Madam President, the administration has come under much \ncriticism lately for its alleged failure to provide leadership on \nissues that are important to the nation. The 1996 Immigration \nInitiative announced by the administration this week, however, belies \nthese contentions. The administration's policy proposal on this \nextremely important issue is thoughtful and comprehensive, and I \napplaud it.\n  The administration's initiative recognizes, as do the people of this \ncountry, the need to formulate an effective response to the problem of \nillegal immigration, and proposes increased resources not only for \nborder enforcement, but also increased resources to eliminate the job \nmagnet that will continue to draw undocumented aliens into the country \nregardless of the success of our border policy. The initiative also \nreflects a desire to improve our ability to deport those aliens that \nhave been identified as deportable, and to assist States that have long \nborne the burdens of our inability to prevent illegal immigration.\n  For each of these objectives the administration has proposed the \ncommitment of substantial resources; yet, at the same time, the \ninitiative contains little that unnecessarily feeds the anti-immigrant \nxenophobia that has characterized the immigration policy debate in \nrecent years. Rather, the administration's proposal takes a measured \nyet aggressive approach to the problems we must face. In short, while \nit has taken an undeniably firm stance against illegal immigration, the \nadministration has not succumbed to the belief that immigration in all \nits shapes and forms is a bad thing. Quite the contrary: the initiative \nreflects the fact that, as the President has said, an effective \nimmigration policy must combine deterrence of illegal immigration with \nan encouragement and celebration of legal immigration.\n  I look forward to working with the administration and my colleagues \nin the Senate to effect this delicate balance, and to implement an \nimmigration policy that is both tough and fair. The administration's \nproposal is certainly a great step in this direction.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2266-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2266-S2267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n SENATOR CLAIBORNE PELL'S SPEECH BEFORE THE GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW \n                CENTER ON THE LAW OF THE SEA CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, on Friday, January 27, 1995, Senator \nClaiborne Pell spoke at the Georgetown University Law Center on the \ntopic of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. During \nthat speech, Senator Pell made a very strong case for United States \nratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty.\n  As many of my colleagues may already know, Senator Pell has been a \nleading advocate for promoting the peaceful uses of the oceans for more \nthan four decades. I believe he first became interested in the subject \nas a young man in the service of the U.S. Coast Guard--an interest he \nhas continued to pursue with energy and imagination since he was \nelected to the Senate in 1960.\n  While the national security implications associated with the Law of \nthe Sea Convention have been widely discussed over the years, I do not \nbelieve that as much attention has been focussed on the economic \nimplications of the treaty. In that regard, Senator Pell's speech on \nJanuary 27, very clearly spelled out the economic importance of the \ntreaty to the United States. I found his arguments most useful in \ngaining a fuller appreciation of the treaty's many provisions.\n  I know that Senator Pell very enthusiastically endorsed President \nClinton's decision to sign the Law of the Sea Convention and to seek \nthe advice and consent of the Senate to its ratification. And, that he \nbelieves it to be of the utmost importance that the United States \nbecome a party to this important convention as soon as possible.\n  I am confident that Senator Pell is willing and eager to play an \nactive role in educating this body on the very important issues \nassociated with the Law of the Sea Convention. I hope that the Senate \nwill have an opportunity to address this subject during the 104th \nCongress.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Senator \nPell's speech at Georgetown University Law Center be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                   Address by Senator Claiborne Pell\n\n       It is a great pleasure to join you here this evening at the \n     Georgetown University Law Center to discuss the United \n     Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This is a subject \n     that is near to my heart and one that I have been involved \n     with for much of my working career.\n       With its transmission to the Senate in October and entry \n     into force in November, the Convention has again moved to the \n     fore as an issue for public debate.\n       These events make today's symposium particularly timely, \n     and I want to thank the organizers, and especially Mr. Eric \n     Fersht, for their outstanding work. The panels you have heard \n     from provide a truly exceptional array of information about \n     the Law of the Sea Convention.\n       The initial support for this idea was led by Arvid Pardo, \n     Malta's delegate to the United Nations, with his famous \n     ``Common Heritage of Mankind'' speech before the United \n     Nations General Assembly in 1967.\n       The Convention then became the interest of many people. I \n     remember particularly the ``Pacem in Maribus''--Peace on the \n     Seas--meetings organized by Elizabeth Mann Borgese.\n       Her book, The Ocean Regime, published in 1968, gave written \n     expression to the ideas that were to gain a wider audience \n     through Pacem in Maribus, on their way to being embodied in \n     the negotiated texts of the Law of the Sea Convention.\n       For me the dream began even earlier. It was during my \n     service in the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II that I \n     wrote my first memorandum on the subject to Admiral Waesche, \n     then Commandant of the Coast Guard. And even before that I \n     had been appointed by President Eisenhower as a Delegate to \n     the first meeting of IMCO (the International Maritime \n     Consultative Organization.)\n       My service on the staff of the San Francisco Convention \n     that prepared the UN Charter, just fifty years ago this \n     summer, further confirmed me in my belief that ways could be \n     found to create a working ocean peace system.\n       The Law of the Sea Convention is the product of one of the \n     more protracted negotiations in diplomatic history. When the \n     process began, the Vietnam War was nearing its peak; the Cold \n     War was at its height; it had been only five years since the \n     construction of the Berlin Wall.\n       I was proud to serve as a delegate and observer to those \n     early Law of the Sea negotiations, one of the few who had \n     also attended a Pacem in Maribus meeting. My enthusiasm led \n     me in 1967 to introduce the first Senate Resolution calling \n     on the President to negotiate a Law of the Sea Convention.\n       That resolution and a draft treaty that I proposed in 1969 \n     led to the Seabed Arms Control treaty, which was ratified by \n     the Senate in 1972. This little-known treaty has permanently \n     removed nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction \n     from the ocean floor, which is seventy percent of the earth's \n     surface.\n       It has been signed by nearly 100 countries, it works, and \n     it provides a good precedent for the Convention on the Law of \n     the Sea.\n       With the Seabed Arms Control Treaty as my model, you can \n     appreciate my enthusiasm for the Law of the Sea Convention. \n     In my view there are few actions that the Senate can take in \n     the year or two ahead that can have greater long term \n     benefits for the world as a whole than to ratify this Treaty.\n       The implications for world peace are enormous; the \n     potential for trade and development is equally far-reaching. \n     I hope this Convention will not be caught up in a spate of \n     politics as usual, but will be seen in the framework of a \n     renewed commitment to bipartisanship in foreign policy.\n       The old saying was that ``politics stops at the water's \n     edge.'' That would be an apt motto for our consideration of \n     Law of the Sea, since its scope begins precisely at ``the \n     water's edge.''\n       Let me outline just a few of the reasons that have come to \n     make me such a strong supporter of the Convention.\n       Of greatest importance, the Convention will enhance our \n     national security, because it establishes as a matter of \n     international law, freedom of navigation rights that are \n     critical to our military forces.\n       [[Page S2267]] At the Foreign Relations Committee's hearing \n     on the Convention in August, Admiral William Center--whom you \n     heard this morning--testified, ``The Convention underpins \n     strongly the worldwide mobility America's forces need. It \n     provides a stable legal basis for governing the world's \n     oceans. It reduces the need to fall back on a potentially \n     volatile mixture of customary practice and gunboat \n     diplomacy.''\n       The Secretary of Defense, William J. Perry, also supports \n     prompt Senate action ``to send a strong signal that the \n     United States is committed to an ocean regulatory regime that \n     is guided by the rule of law.''\n       I have heard arguments that the Convention's provisions on \n     freedom of navigation are not really important because they \n     reflect customary international law. I disagree with that \n     argument.\n       Customary international law is inherently unstable. \n     Governments can be less scrupulous about flouting the \n     precedents of customary law, than they would be if such \n     actions are seen as violating a treaty.\n       Moreover, not all governments and scholars agree that all \n     of the critical navigation rights protected by the Convention \n     are also protected by customary law.\n       They regard many of those rights as contractual and, as \n     such, available only to parties to the Convention.\n       For example, it was not long ago that the United States \n     claimed a territorial sea of only three miles. Now it is \n     twelve. I am certain there are countries that would like to \n     expand their territorial sea even further. Only the \n     Convention establishes limits on countries' claims to \n     territorial seas as a matter of international law.\n       These navigational rights are of very real importance to \n     our armed forces. There have been recent situations where \n     even U.S. allies denied our forces transit rights in times of \n     need.\n       For example, during the 1973 Yom Kippur war our ability to \n     resupply Israel was critically dependent on transit rights \n     through the Strait of Gibraltar. In 1986, U.S. aircraft \n     passed through the Strait to Strike Libyan targets in \n     response to that government's acts of terrorism directed \n     against the United States.\n       On February 11, 1992, the USS BATON ROUGE (SSN689) was \n     struck by a Russian Sierra-class attack submarine while on \n     patrol in the Barent Sea, off the major naval port of \n     Murmansk. The USS BATON ROUGE, a Los Angeles-class attack \n     submarine, was submerged at a depth of 59 feet at the time of \n     the collision, in waters claimed by Russia as territorial, \n     but considered by the United States to be high seas.\n       In addition, the following examples are situations where \n     having the Law of the Sea Convention in effect might have \n     made a difference:\n       Between 1961 and 1970, Peru seized 74 U.S. fishing vessels \n     over disputed tuna fisheries.\n       In 1986, Ecuador interfered with the USAF aircraft flight \n     over the high seas 175 miles from the Ecuadorian coast.\n       Since 1986, Peru has repeatedly challenged U.S. aircraft \n     flying over its claimed 200 nautical mile territorial sea. \n     During several of these challenges, the Peruvian aircraft \n     operated in a manner that unnecessarily and intentionally \n     endangered the safety of the transiting U.S. aircraft and its \n     crew.\n       This includes an incident where a U.S. C-130 was fired upon \n     and a U.S. service member was killed.\n       In 1986, two Cuban MIG-21 aircraft intercepted a USCG HU-\n     25A Falcon flying outside of its 12 nautical mile territorial \n     sea, claiming it had entered Cuban Flight Information Region \n     (FIR) without permission.\n       In 1988, Soviet warships intentionally ``bumped'' two U.S. \n     warships engaged in innocent passage south of Sevastopol in \n     the Black Sea.\n       In 1984, Mexican Navy vessels approached U.S. Coast Guard \n     vessels operating outside Mexican territorial waters and \n     interfered with valid USCG law enforcement activities.\n       Libyan claims to the Gulf of Sidra have resulted in \n     repeated challenges and hostile action against U.S. forces \n     operating in high seas.\n       During the 1980's, transits of the Northwest Passage by the \n     USCG POLAR SEA and POLAR STAR were challenged by the Canadian \n     government.\n       I do not doubt that, if necessary, the United States Navy \n     will sail where it needs to to protect U.S. interests. But, \n     if we reject the Convention, preservation of these rights in \n     non-wartime situations will carry an increasingly heavy price \n     for the United States.\n       By remaining outside of the Convention, the United States \n     will have to challenge excessive claims by other states not \n     only diplomatically, but also through conduct that opposes \n     these claims. A widely ratified Convention would \n     significantly reduce the need for such expensive operations.\n       it would also afford us a durable platform of principle to \n     ensure support from the American people and our allies when \n     we confront claims we regard as illegal.\n       The Convention's provisions on freedom of navigation are \n     also vitally important to the U.S. economy and the thousands \n     of U.S. workers whose jobs are dependent on exports and \n     imports. We live in an interdependent world, and 80 percent \n     of trade between nations in this interdependent world is \n     carried by ship.\n       Oil is one example of this. In 1993, 44 percent of U.S. \n     petroleum products supplied came from imported oil. This oil \n     was carried on tankers that every day pass through straits, \n     territorial waters, and exclusive economic zones of other \n     nations.\n       The U.S. has a vital interest in the stability of the \n     international legal order that serves as the basis for this \n     commerce. We also have an interest in avoiding higher prices \n     for consumers and job losses that can result from costly \n     coastal state restrictions on navigation.\n       The benefits of the Convention extend to many other areas. \n     Protection of submarine cables is one example. The new fiber \n     optic cables that connect the United States to other \n     countries are crucial for international communications and \n     our increasingly information-based economy.\n       These cables are enormously expensive. A new fiber optic \n     cable connecting the United States to Japan can carry up to \n     one million simultaneous telephone calls, and is valued at \n     $1.3 billion. The total value of existing cables is measured \n     in the many billions of dollars.\n       When these cables are broken, U.S. companies, and \n     ultimately U.S. consumers, incur huge repair costs. The \n     Convention contains new provisions that strengthen the \n     obligation of all states to take measures to protect the \n     cables, and cable owners.\n       Past U.S. concerns with the Convention's provisions on deep \n     seabed mining--concerns that had prevented the United States \n     from signing the Convention--were resolved in an agreement \n     signed in July at the United Nations in New York.\n       Earlier today, you heard about this subject from Wes \n     Scholz, the head of the U.S. delegation to the negotiations \n     on the Part XI Agreement. He and his negotiating team did a \n     truly superb job in adjusting the Convention's provisions on \n     seabed mining to provide a workable framework for the 21st \n     century.\n       Looking to the future, U.S. interests in the Convention lie \n     not only in what it is today, but in what it may become. Just \n     as form and substance have been given our Constitution by the \n     courts, so too will future uses of the oceans be influenced \n     and shaped by decisions made under the Convention.\n       With the Convention's entry into force last November 16th, \n     the United States stands on the threshold of a new era in \n     oceans policy. Under the Convention, U.S. national interests \n     in the world's oceans would be protected as a matter of law. \n     This is a success of U.S. foreign policy that will work to \n     our benefit in the decades to come.\n       The question on many people's minds now is: will the Senate \n     act on the Convention during this, the 104th Congress?\n       I think that those who support the treaty should help make \n     the case for its approval. The benefits of the Convention are \n     many. We should not be shy in making them known. The \n     consequences of not ratifying the Convention are also many. \n     Those too should be made known.\n       Over the past 25 years, the Convention and its supporters \n     have overcome many obstacles. The same tenacity and \n     commitment that brought the Convention to where it is today \n     will be needed to take the Convention the next step.\n       U.S. ratification of the Convention may not come quickly, \n     but I am confident it will come. It is up to us to make that \n     happen sooner rather than later. And when it happens, that \n     for me will be a nearly life-long dream come true.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2266-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:24 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill; in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to eliminate \nthe penalties imposed on States for noncompliance with motorcycle \nhelmet and automobile safety belt requirements, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n         motorcycle helmet and safety belt penalty elimination\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, section 153 of the Intermodal \nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA] of 1991 (Public Law 102-\n240) penalizes States that do not institute mandatory motorcycle helmet \nand seatbelt laws. Today, I will introduce a measure to repeal this \npatently unfair provision that forces States to transfer scarce \nconstruction funds to other programs.\n  The November elections have shown that the American people want more \ndecisionmaking authority with their State and local governments as \nopposed to heavy handed Federal mandates. Furthermore, outlining how a \nState spends its own money, which is collected through the consumer gas \ntax, infringes on States' ability to control their own budgets. \nDangling essential highway construction money in front of States to \ncoerce them into adopting helmet and seatbelt laws is fiscal blackmail. \nState governments are aware of the need for safety programs and I do \nnot support Washington's micromanagement of issues that should clearly \nbe left up to the States.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of highway safety. However, \nmandatory motorcycle and seatbelt laws do not guarantee safety. In \nfact, of the 10 safest States in which to ride \n[[Page S2269]] a motorcycle, 7 do not require mandatory helmet use for \nadults. Furthermore, New Hampshire, which does not have mandatory \nhelmet and seatbelt laws, has been ranked as one of the five States \nwith the best highway safety record in the Nation, as far as fatalities \nper million miles traveled.\n  Mr. President, highway safety education programs are the key to \nhighway safety and I believe that States have the expertise and know-\nhow to develop their own programs without Federal intimidation. I \ninvite my colleagues to join me in supporting their States' highway \ndepartments and highway users by repealing helmet and seatbelt \nmandates.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 361. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide that \nthe monthly amounts paid by a State to blind disabled veterans shall be \nexcluded from the determination of annual income for purposes of \npayment of pension by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                  legislation to assist blind veterans\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, since the mid-1930's, New York \nState has paid blind disabled veterans a monthly annuity. Qualified \nveterans--of which there are less than 2,000--receive monthly payments \nof $41.66, the same amount as has been paid since the program's \ninception.\n  The blind annuity has not been adjusted upward, because should a \nState decide to increase its blind annuity, the U.S. Department of \nVeterans Affairs would respond by reducing Federal pensions paid to \nthese individuals by the same amount. Thus, there would be no net \nbenefit for veterans receiving the annuity.\n  The legislation that I and my distinguished colleague from New York, \nSenator Moynihan, are reintroducing today will prevent the VA from \npenalizing blind veterans, should any State undertake or increase a \nblind annuity. Charity begins at home. My legislation will allow States \nto compensate those who have paid a very high price in defense of our \ncountry, at no cost to the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 361\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN AMOUNTS FROM INCOME \n                   DETERMINATION FOR PENSION PURPOSES.\n\n       Section 1503 of title 38, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking out ``and'' at the end of paragraph (9);\n       (2) by striking out the period at the end of paragraph (10) \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(11) amounts equal to amounts paid to a veteran by a \n     State under a program of such State to make monthly payments \n     to qualifying veterans who are blind and totally \n     disabled.''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. MIKULSKI:\n  S. 362. A bill to amend the Metropolitan Washington Airports Act of \n1986 to provide for the reorganization of the Metropolitan Washington \nAirports Authority and for local review of proposed actions of the \nAirports Authority affecting aircraft noise; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   washington airport act amendments\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce S. 362, the \nMetropolitan Washington Airports Act Amendment of 1995.\n  In light of the Supreme Court's decision last month which compels \ncongressional action, I am sponsoring this legislation which finally \neliminates congressional oversight over the Airports Authority Board of \nDirectors, and makes this Board more accountable to the communities it \nserves. Similar legislation was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by my colleague, Mrs. Morella of Maryland.\n  This legislation will amend the Metropolitan Washington Airport Act \nof 1986 by reorganizing the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority \nand providing for greater local involvement in the management of Dulles \nand Washington National Airports.\n  I believe in strong local involvement in the management of our \nairports. The Airports Authority Board structure which was struck down \nrecently by the Supreme Court did not adequately incorporate \nrepresentation of local communities. The legislation will restore the \ninvolvement of communities in this region into the management of the \nWashington area airports by reorganizing the Airports Authority Board \nof Directors into 11 members who reside in the Washington, DC, region. \nThese board members will be appointed by the chief executives of \nVirginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, the Virginia State \nlegislature, or by the local council of governments.\n  The legislation also ensures local involvement in any decision by the \nWashington Metropolitan Airports Authority Board of Directors which \ncould result in a change in aircraft noise in the vicinity our local \nairports. The legislation mandates that a local group of citizens, the \ncommittee on noise abatement, be notified by the Board of any decision \naffecting noise abatement so that they have the opportunity to review \nthe proposed action. In the interest of the citizens most affected by \naircraft noise, I feel that local oversight is important in any airport \nauthority decision involving the serious issue of noise abatement.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree with me that airports should be \naccountable to the communities they serve, and I hope we will see \nenactment of this legislation during the 104th Congress. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 362\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1 SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Metropolitan Washington \n     Airports Act Amendments of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to improve water quality within the Rio Puerco \nWatershed, New Mexico, and to help restore the ecological health of the \nRio Grande through the cooperative identification and implementation of \nbest management practices that are consistent with the ecological, \ngeological, cultural, sociological, and economic conditions in the \nregion, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                        rio puerco watershed act\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation that will authorize a coordinated approach for restoration \nof the Rio Puerco Watershed, which at 7,000 square miles is the largest \ntributary to the Rio Grande in terms of area and sediment. The Rio \nPuerco was once known as New Mexico's breadbasket, with water supply \nand soil tilth to support that reputation.\n  Over time, extensive ecological changes have occurred in the Rio \nPuerco Watershed, some of which have resulted in damage to the \nwatershed that has seriously affected the economic and cultural well-\nbeing of its inhabitants. This has resulted in the loss of existing \ncommunities that were based on the land and were self-sustaining. Mr. \nPresident, a healthy and sustainable ecosystem is essential to the \nlong-term economic and cultural viability of the region.\n  According to the Bureau of Land Management, the Rio Puerco \ncontributes only 6 percent of the total water but over 50 percent of \nthe sediments which enter the Rio Grande. Accelerated, progressive soil \nerosion within the basin threatens not only the sustained productivity \nof the rangeland watershed, but also the middle Rio Grande aquatic \nsystem, irrigators dependent on those waters, and the economic \nfoundation of the Mesilla Valley dependent on Elephant Butte Reservoir.\n  A substantial proportion of the rural population is concerned about \nits ability to maintain a traditional lifestyle with an economy which \nis natural resource based and dependent upon the productivity of land \nwith multiple ownership. The vast Rio Puerco drainage system is a \nmosaic of land ownership and agency management. No single agency has \nwatershed-wide expertise and management responsibility. It is \nimperative that the numerous agencies and individuals with resource \nmanagement responsibility--Indian pueblos, Federal and State agencies, \nand private citizens--work\n together to develop a plan for and implement an effective Rio Puerco \nWatershed management program.\n\n  This legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to lead and \ncoordinate a management program in the Rio Puerco Watershed with the \nadvice and input of a Rio Puerco Management Committee composed of the \nvarious landowners, affected Indian pueblos, local, regional, State, \nand Federal governments, and other interested citizens.\n  The committee will prepare a management plan to identify reasonable \nand appropriate goals and objectives for land owners and managers in \nthe Rio Puerco Watershed; to describe potential alternative actions to \nmeet the goals and objectives; to recommend voluntary implementation of \nappropriate best management practices on both public and private lands; \nto provide for cooperative development of management guidelines for \nmaintaining and improving the ecological, cultural, and economic \nconditions on both public and private lands; and other activities that \nwill promote cooperation and information sharing among those that own \nand manage land in the Rio Puerco Watershed.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that Senator Domenici is a cosponsor of \nthis legislation. It is our hope that this legislation will advance the \nrestoration of and maintenance of a healthy Rio Puerco Watershed that \nwill serve New Mexico and its citizens in the future as well as it has \nserved us in the past. We have a lot of work ahead of us. A clear path \nmust be outlined and a base of authorization, from which this program \ncan be funded, established. Most importantly, this legislation \nauthorizes an approach that brings all of the stakeholders together. \nThe Federal Government cannot, and should not, undertake this effort \nalone. The support and contributions of local citizens, tribes, \ngovernmental entities, and others is crucial. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the full \ntext of my remarks and this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 363\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rio Puerco Watershed Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) over time, extensive ecological changes have occurred \n     in the Rio Puerco watershed, including--\n       (A) erosion of agricultural and range lands;\n       (B) impairment of waters due to heavy sedimentation;\n       (C) reduced productivity of renewable resources;\n       (D) loss of biological diversity;\n       (E) loss of functioning riparian areas; and\n       (F) loss of available surface water;\n       (2) damage to the watershed has seriously affected the \n     economic and cultural well-being of its inhabitants, \n     including--\n     [[Page S2271]]   (A) loss of communities that were based on \n     the land and were self-sustaining; and\n       (B) adverse effects on the traditions, customs, and \n     cultures of the affected communities;\n       (3) a healthy and sustainable ecosystem is essential to the \n     long-term economic and cultural viability of the region;\n       (4) the impairment of the Rio Puerco watershed has caused \n     damage to the ecological and economic well-being of the area \n     below the junction of the Rio Puerco with the Rio Grande, \n     including--\n       (A) disruption of ecological processes;\n       (B) water quality impairment;\n       (C) significant reduction in the water storage capacity and \n     life expectancy of the Elephant Butte Dam and Reservoir \n     system due to sedimentation;\n       (D) chronic problems of irrigation system channel \n     maintenance; and\n       (E) increased risk of flooding caused by sediment \n     accumulation;\n       (5) the Rio Puerco is a major tributary of the Rio Grande, \n     and the coordinated implementation of ecosystem-based best \n     management practices for the Rio Puerco system could benefit \n     the larger Rio Grande system;\n       (6) the Rio Puerco watershed has been stressed from the \n     loss of native vegetation, introduction of exotic species, \n     and alteration of riparian habitat which have disrupted the \n     original dynamics of the river and disrupted natural \n     ecological processes;\n       (7) the Rio Puerco watershed is a mosaic of private, \n     Federal, tribal trust, and State land ownership with diverse, \n     sometimes differing management objectives;\n       (8) development, implementation, and monitoring of an \n     effective watershed management program for the Rio Puerco \n     watershed is best achieved through cooperation among affected \n     Federal, State, local, and tribal entities;\n       (9) the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the \n     Director of the Bureau of Land Management, in consultation \n     with Federal, State, local, and tribal entities and in \n     cooperation with the Rio Puerco Watershed Committee, is best \n     suited to coordinate management efforts in the Rio Puerco \n     watershed; and\n       (10) accelerating the pace of improvement in the Rio Puerco \n     watershed on a coordinated, cooperative basis will benefit \n     persons living in the watershed as well as downstream users \n     on the Rio Grande.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend certain Federal civil rights statutes to \nprevent the involuntary application of arbitration to claims that arise \nfrom unlawful employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, \nsex, national origin, age, or disability, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                 civil rights procedures protection act\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill \nthat I also introduced in the 103d Congress. This bill mirrors a House \nbill introduced last year by Representatives Patricia Schroeder, Edward \nMarkey, and Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky as companion legislation to my \noriginal bill, S. 2012, the Protection From Coercive Employment \nAgreements Act of 1994.\n   [[Page S2272]] This bill addresses a rapidly growing practice in \nemployment relations--the practice of requiring employees to submit \nclaims of discrimination or harassment to arbitration as a term or \ncondition of employment or advancement, and prohibiting the employee \nfrom resolving their claim in a court of law.\n  This bill amends seven specific civil rights statutes to make clear \nthat the powers and procedures provided under those laws are the \nexclusive ones that apply when a claim arises. The legislation would \ninvalidate existing agreements between employers and employees that \nrequire the employment discrimination claims to be submitted to \nmandatory arbitration.\n  The statutes this will would amend are title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964, section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act, section 1977 of the Revised Statutes, \nthe Equal Pay Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and the Federal \nArbitration Act [FAA]. The amendment to the FAA extends the protections \nof the bill to claims of unlawful discrimination that arise under State \nor local law, and other Federal laws that prohibit job discrimination.\n  Mr. President, I want to reiterate that this legislation, as in the \ncase of S. 2012, is in no way intended to bar the use of voluntary \narbitration, conciliation, mediation or other informal quasi-judicial \nmethods of dispute resolution. In fact, I strongly support the use of \nvoluntary alternative dispute resolution methods as a way of reducing \nthe caseloads of civil and criminal courts where appropriate.\n  This bill closes a widening loophole in the enforcement of civil \nrights laws in our Nation. An entire industry--Wall Street--and a \ngrowing number of companies and firms in many other industries have \nbeen able to circumvent formal legal challenges to their unlawful \nemployment practices in court--a right intended to be protected by the \nstatutes this bill amends.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nand make permanent the deduction for health insurance costs of self-\nemployed individuals; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            health insurance deduction for the self-employed\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I rise to urge my colleagues in \nCongress to work quickly to pass legislation to correct a serious \nproblem affecting our Nation's farmers, ranchers, and small businesses.\n  As you know, the 25-percent tax deduction for the health insurance \ncosts of self-employed individuals expired on December 31, 1993. This \nprovision is absolutely critical to the health care concerns of small \nbusiness owners and farmers who conduct their businesses as sole \nproprietors. While the 25-percent health costs tax deduction enjoys \nbroad bipartisan support, it was not restored last year when the \nprospects for broader health care reform collapsed.\n  We should expect the outcry from small businesses to be deafening \nthis \n[[Page S2273]] April unless we move quickly to extend this provision \nbeyond its December 31, 1993 expiration date. Further, it is \nindefensible that our tax laws tell some businesses that they can \ndeduct 100 percent of their health costs, while others, mostly smaller \nbusinesses, are told they can deduct none of their health care costs.\n  The health of a farm family or small business owner is no less \nimportant than the health of the president of a large corporation, and \nthe Internal Revenue Code should reflect this simple fact.\n  That's way I am reintroducing legislation to restore tax fairness for \nsole proprietors who acquire health insurance coverage for themselves \nand their families. My bill would renew the 25-percent health insurance \ntax deduction as if it had not expired in December 1993. It also \nexpands the current 25-percent deduction to 100 percent over the next \nseveral years. As a result, sole proprietors would receive the exact \nsame tax treatment that large corporations now enjoy.\n  Almost no one disagrees that the tax code unfairly discriminates \nagainst self-employed business owners with respect to health care \ncosts. Yet, Congress has always scrambled to simply retain the current \n25-percent health tax deduction.\n  We can no longer afford to allow this provision to be held hostage to \nsunset provisions or politics. So long as we turn a blind eye to this \nproblem, millions of Americans are prevented from purchasing adequate \nand affordable health care for themselves and their families.\n  We ought to move to correct this matter without further delay. This \nmatter needs immediate attention.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 368. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat installment sales of certain farmers not be treated as a \npreference item for purposes of the alternative minimum tax; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             tax treatment of installment sales legislation\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \nrectify a serious tax problem confronting our family farmers.\n  The Internal Revenue Service [IRS] has, in my opinion, mistakenly \ntaken a position that may preclude our farmers from using deferred \npayment grain contracts, which have been routinely used in their \nbusinesses for decades. In my judgment, the IRS' position imposes an \nunintended and unacceptable financial hardship on the farming industry.\n  Let me briefly explain. For years, family farmers have used deferred \npayment grain contracts to sell their commodities to grain elevators to \nhelp manage the business income. A typical grain contract between a \nfarmer and grain elevator calls upon a farmer to sell and deliver grain \nto a grain elevator--often because the farmer does not have adequate \nstorage--for a fixed amount. In many cases, one or more payments paid \nby the elevator to the farmer under the contract occur after the close \nof the farmer's taxable year.\n  For regular tax purposes, farmers are allowed to defer income from \nthe deferred payments under the grain contracts in computing their \nregular tax liability. But because the IRS apparently views all \ndeferred payment grain contracts as installment sales, it now requires \nthem to add back this income in computing the Alternative Minimum Tax \n[AMT] in the tax year preceding the year of payment. As a result, \nthousands of family farmers are facing hefty tax bills because they are \nbeing whip-sawed by an AMT provision which effectively repeals their \nability to use such contracts.\n  To make matters worse, many farmers were advised by tax experts that \nsome kinds of traditional deferred payment grain contracts do not \namount to an installment sale that would required and AMT calculation. \nFor this reason, they did not make an AMT adjustment on their income \ntax returns. Now they are being told by the IRS that they owe large tax \nbills on income that they will not receive until later.\n  That is why I am introducing legislation to ensure that our family \nfarmers are allowed to engage in deferred payment transactions and get \nthe same kind of tax treatment they have always received.\n  I do not believe that Congress intended this kind of tax treatment \nfor farmers using deferred payment grain contracts for legitimate \nbusiness purposes. It seems to me that the IRS position is based upon \nan incorrect interpretation which ignores the fact that our family \nfarmers are, by law, permitted to manage their business operations on a \ncash basis.\n  My bill would simply make clear the original intent of Congress in \nthe Tax Acts of 1986 and 1987, which was to allow farmers to continue \nto receive the tax benefit provided from the use of cash method \naccounting and from installment sales for their deferred payment grain \ntransactions.\n  I urge my colleagues to include this much-needed legislation in any \nrevenue measure considered by the Senate this year.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2268-3",

Mr. President, I rise today to present the \nremarks of a courageous woman, Devorah Halberstam, whose son Ari was \nbrutally murdered by Rashid Baz on March 1, 1994, in a cowardly act of \nterrorism on the Brooklyn Bridge.\n  Mrs. Halberstam's statement before New York State Supreme Court \nJustice Harold Rothwax on January 18, 1995, took place before the \nsentencing of Rashid Baz, who subsequently received 141 years in prison \nfor a single count of second-degree murder, 14 counts of attempted \nmurder in the second-degree, and one count of criminal use of a firearm \nin the first-degree.\n  Mr. President, what happened that day on the Brooklyn Bridge was \nnothing less than an act of terrorism and we should call it just that. \nAri Halberstam was murdered for one reason: He was a Jew.\n  In her piognant statement before the court, Mrs. Halberstam relates a \ntearful plea that she hopes that what happened to her and her family, \nnever happen to any other family. Her statement is a powerful one and I \nurge my colleagues to read it so that they may gain a greater insight \ninto the sorrow and grief suffered by a woman whose son was taken from \nher in an act of terrorism.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of Mrs. Halberstam's statement be \nincluded in the Record following the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The statement follows:\nStatement by Mrs. Devorah Halberstam Before State Supreme Court Justice \n                    Harold Rothwax, January 18, 1994\n\n       Your Honor: Fourteen boys testified before this Court. \n     Fourteen very special young men whose pure and innocent lives \n     are dedicated to the betterment of our world. Fourteen \n     adolescents whose own lives were forever changes on the \n     Brooklyn Bridge less than a year ago on March 1st.\n       But the youngest of the students--the fifteenth--his voice \n     was silent. And will remain silent forever.\n       Ari's blue eyes were deep as the ocean--windows to a soul \n     in which I swam and energized myself every day of his 16 \n     brief years.\n       A soul who feared nothing but the Almighty, whose humility \n     was an inspiration, whose days and nights were testimony to \n     the heights of human endeavor and aspiration.\n       A soul hand-picked by the Lubavitcher Rebbe and the Rebbe's \n     wife, to serve as their surrogate child from earliest \n     infancy, to be surrounded by their holiness and kindness and \n     universal love.\n       A gem of a human being who combined the rigors of Chassidic \n     life with its long days of study, with a grace on the \n     basketball court that was star quality. A mere child who \n     would jump at the opportunity--and they were numerous--to \n     relinquish his own bed to a tired guest. A prince of a boy \n     who was generous to a fault with his time--always ready to \n     listen to a troubled friend.\n       But above all he loved his family, especially his sisters \n     and brothers.\n       That, your honor, was my son Ari.\n       That, your honor is the witness who could not be here to \n     testify.\n       Which is why I have gathered what fragments are left of my \n     energy and sanity, your honor, to address this court today.\n       On May 6, 1977, I was blessed and overjoyed as my first \n     born son Ari came into this world.\n       On March 1, 1994 I was there at his side watching as the \n     final color of life ebbed from his dying face. And on that \n     day, I too died your honor. And my husband.\n       Our lives will never be the same. Yes, my life has been \n     forever shattered by the hot bullet released by Rashid Baz's \n     cold and calculating and viciously Jew-hating hand.\n       Your honor, we are compelled to look at the shocking and \n     outrageous events that are going on in our world.\n       Several weeks ago, Islamic terrorists highjacked a French \n     airliner with nearly 200 passengers. Their intent was to \n     explode the jet in the heart of Paris in a suicide mission \n     that would have killed thousands.\n       Their mission was not the complete success they had hoped \n     for--instead of thousands, only five innocent civilians were \n     actually murdered.\n       That very week, an Islamic terrorist--explosives strapped \n     to his body--detonated himself beside a crowded public bus in \n     the heart of Jerusalem. His mission was not the complete \n     success he had hoped for--because only one person was \n     seriously wounded, four others less seriously. The 50 \n     passengers on the target bus were miraculously unharmed.\n       Two years ago, Islamic terrorists attempted to detonate the \n     World Trade Center hoping to collapse a 110 story building \n     and kill tens of thousands of our fellow Americans.\n       Their mission was not the complete success they had hoped \n     for--because only 6 were actually killed and dozens more \n     wounded.\n       On March 1st of last year an Islamic terrorist armed with \n     an arsenal of sophisticated weapons stalked a van carrying 15 \n     Rabbinical students on the Brooklyn Bridge with the intent to \n     kill them all. His mission was not the complete success he \n     had hoped for--because only one of the fifteen was killed--\n     And that as you know, was my precious son Ari.\n       Your honor. The civilized world cannot afford ``failures'' \n     like these.\n       Each day, innocent people--men, women and children--are \n     being targeted in the cross hairs of these mass murderers who \n     would kill and wound indiscriminately, not only others, but \n     even themselves.\n       They murder with the sanction and participation of \n     governments in Teheran and \n     [[Page S2275]] Baghdad, Damascus, Lebanon, Tripoli and \n     Khartoum. Governments whose representatives roam our streets \n     freely. Whose diplomatic pouches--laden with plastic \n     explosives and conventional weapons--are inviolate. Whose \n     treacherous plans sews destruction, mayhem and terror in the \n     hearts of civilized people everywhere.\n       They murder with the blessing of fanatical religious \n     leaders--some of whom are guests in this great land.\n       They murder in the name of a god they call ``Allah the \n     Merciful.''\n       These killers are a disgrace to all people of faith, \n     including the many millions of their own coreligionists who \n     pray for peace in their hearts but dare not speak peace \n     because they fear for their lives.\n       These murderers respect no territorial boundaries. They \n     obey no law. They view anybody and everybody, but especially \n     Jews, as fair game. They believe--not without justification--\n     the more blood they shed the more ready the world will be to \n     capitulate to their nefarious and bloodthirsty aims.\n       A cowardly world hands down token sentences to those who \n     are apprehended. Spineless western governments discreetly \n     free some of the most wanton mass killers--releasing them \n     into the hands of the very fundamentalist, dictatorships and \n     theocracies which dispatched them in the first place.\n       They do this in order to improve their balance of trade, or \n     worse yet, as a payoff, selfishly and foolishly hoping to \n     forestall further acts of terrorism against their own people \n     and on their own territory. This, your honor, is the world we \n     live in. And the time has come to say, ``Enough, we won't \n     take it anymore.''\n       I have addressed you on behalf of a civilized world which \n     will be further threatened, further\n      degraded, and further destabilized if this killer gets \n     anything less than the maximum sentence you can give.\n       The man you will sentence today, Rashid Baz, killed my \n     baby. And robbed Nochum Sossonkin of his youth. And he felt \n     immune and invincible because the world's track record in \n     dealing with his kind is an embarrassment to all civilized \n     and justice-loving people.\n       The jury which declared this murderer guilty showed \n     incredible personal courage in reaching its verdict. Because \n     the community of Islamic terrorists is as vindictive as it is \n     sadistic.\n       Yes, Rashid Baz's mission on the Brooklyn Bridge was a \n     failure. Because 14 of his 15 intended victims are still \n     alive.\n       But for me, my husband, my aged parents, and my four other \n     children--as for the mothers and fathers and grandparents and \n     sisters and brothers and sons and daughters of the other \n     murder victims from those other ``failures'' I mentioned \n     before--his mission was a success.\n       For we will never see our Ari again * * * For I will never \n     see my tall, beautiful, kind, scholarly, charming, friendly \n     16 year old son grow to maturity * * * For my younger \n     children will never again have the loving, compassionate \n     guidance of the older brother they adored * * * For my \n     husband and I will never see the grandchildren we had \n     expected.\n       And the generations upon generations of descendants that \n     were to have come from Ari will never be--generations that \n     were meant to replace and replenish the catastrophic loss of \n     Jewish life that is our legacy from the Holocaust.\n       On March 1st Rashid Baz murdered Ari. But he also sentenced \n     me and my family to a lifetime of mourning. To an endless \n     series of sleepless nights. To a wound which can never heal. \n     To a living death which chips away at us, measured in the \n     slow cadence of endless seconds * * * to a limbo of \n     joylessness which will end only when we ourselves are \n     reunited with Ari.\n       Indeed, there is nothing that can happen here today, \n     nothing you or anyone else can do to bring Ari back. There is \n     no way to give me back all those years of joy, love and \n     worry. There is no sentence that you can give Baz for my \n     murdered heart or for the security that was robbed from the \n     lives of my children and replaced instead with cobrays, \n     glocks and terror.\n       What can you say to Ari's sister Sara who grew up side by \n     side with him and was her best friend throughout her life?\n       Or Chanie, his sister who fears going into any taxicab.\n       Or Mendy, Ari's brother, who looked up to Ari as his mentor \n     and protector. And who lost his older brother on the day of \n     his birthday.\n       Or Ari's four year old brother, who keeps asking me when \n     Ari will be back. And whose last prayer at night is I love \n     you Ari with my whole heart please come back home.\n       Your honor, our pain is too great to bear. We long for our \n     son constantly. We listen for his footsteps and voice in hour \n     home.\n       Yet life must go on, and justice, the inadequate justice \n     that humans can mete out, must be done.\n       And now, your honor, it is your responsibility to show \n     courage, and demonstrate that we in America are not cowards. \n     That we do not capitulate to the blackmail of terrorism. That \n     we value life and liberty. That those who would presume on \n     American hospitality and freedom in order to bring \n     civilization to its knees will find no refuge in this land. \n     And that here, at least justice will prevail, and this cold \n     blooded killer will never see the light of freedom again so \n     long as he lives.\n       There is no death sentence in New York State. If there \n     were, I would surely be tempted to ask for it.\n       Because death would send a message to the world that \n     America knows how to deal with terror.\n       And death, too, might have brought a measure of finality to \n     the horror me and my family have to live with.\n       But death, unfortunately, is not an option.\n       Which is why I beseech you, your honor, from a heart filled \n     with pain and anguish, in the name of civilization and the \n     values we hold dear, in memory of my son, and out of basic \n     consideration for me and my family--sentence Rashid Baz to \n     the very same sentence to which he sentenced us--namely, that \n     not a day, not an hour, not a minute or a second of his life \n     should go by without him being reminded of what he has done.\n       Remorse? The only remorse he has is over his faulty aim, \n     and the fact that his mission was not completed entirely.\n       This murderer must live and die behind bars and barbed \n     wire. He must spend the remainder of his natural life caged \n     like the remorseless creature that he is. Deprived of any of \n     the rights or freedoms he mocks. Separated from any \n     opportunity to continue in his ways. Reduced to a number in \n     the impersonal hell of prison. Consigned to a life of living \n     death until God takes him and renders the eternal justice \n     which we on earth cannot.\n       Your honor, this is the least you can do. Unfortunately, it \n     is also the most.\n       Thank you.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2274-4", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2275-S2276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          CRUELTY TO PATIENTS\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the more thoughtful writers \non our scene today is Joan Beck with the Chicago Tribune.\n  Recently, she had a column on our national health care system that \ntakes a slightly different perspective on where we are and some of our \nproblems.\n  I believe her comments merit serious consideration.\n  We are talking about some modification of the health care system this \nyear.\n  On the floor of the Senate, several of us on both sides of the aisle \nhave talked about the need for bipartisan cooperation.\n  I hope we can go ahead.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to read the Joan Beck column, \nand I ask to insert it into the Record at this point.\n  The column follows:\n\n Cruelty to Patients--Nation's Health Care System Needs an Examination\n\n                             (By Joan Beck)\n\n       Even without new federal legislation, health care in \n     America is changing rapidly. Many of these changes are \n     worrisome. Some are deadly scary.\n       Increasingly, the focus of medical care is becoming to \n     reduce costs, to do only the minimum possible for patients, \n     to wring money out of the system for a new set of corporate \n     providers.\n       Fewer people are now allowed by HMOs and insurance company \n     rules to see specialists. Far more surgery--more than half in \n     many hospitals--is being done on an outpatient basis, often \n     with assembly-line rules. Hospital stays after childbirth are \n     often numbered in hours, not days.\n       Hospitals are cutting nursing staffs, lowering the level of \n     patient care and substituting other caregivers with less \n     training and lower pay. Teaching hospitals, with their higher \n     costs and heavy load of patients needing specialized \n     treatment, are getting squeezed.\n       Many doctors, like Ma and Pa stores swallowed up when a \n     Wal-Mart comes to town, are losing their independence to a \n     whole new world of corporate-managed health care.\n       Physicians, in fact, don't really seem to be major players \n     in the health-care business these days. Politicians, \n     administrators, employers, insurance companies, even the \n     financial markets, are shaping the future of health care to \n     an extent that makes many people highly uncomfortable--and \n     may endanger their health.\n       There is a new emphasis on efficiency, not on \n     humanitarianism and healing. Hospitals are competing for \n     contracts from insurance companies, HMOs and big employers to \n     care for large groups of people, often for a fixed, per-\n     person fee. Then they must try to push down their costs \n     however they can--by eliminating unnecessary tests and \n     treatments, by being more efficient, by avoiding as many \n     high-cost procedures as possible, perhaps even by taking \n     risks with patients' health.\n       Federal efforts to pass national health-care legislation \n     seem to be in hiatus for now, although Illinois Sen. Paul \n     Simon has been trying to talk up the issue again. There are \n     new threats to make drastic cuts and changes in Medicare and \n     Medicaid. Congress may do some tinkering with insurance \n     regulations.\n       But in the immediate future, changes in health care will \n     not come from Washington. There will be more efforts by \n     hospitals to trim costs. More efforts from HMOs, insurers and \n     employers to get discount prices. More pressures on \n     physicians to follow HMO and insurance company rules. More \n     attempts at \n     [[Page S2276]] change by the states, particularly California, \n     Minnesota, Washington, Hawaii and Pennsylvania. And more \n     lamenting that while the increase in costs is slowing down, \n     health care still takes 14 percent of the gross national \n     product.\n       It is difficult to measure the impact of all of these \n     changes on the nation's well-being. But a useful yardstick is \n     to evaluate how these changes affect the way physicians can \n     do their job and how well they safeguard patient choice in \n     their doctors.\n       Doctors should be the ones to decide the future of health \n     care in the United States--not Hillary Rodham Clinton or Ira \n     Magaziner or Newt Gingrich or Bob Dole or the Republicans or \n     the Democrats or Prudential or Humana or General Motors or \n     Exxon.\n       It's disappointing to see how little impact doctors have \n     actually had on the health-care debate and on the future of \n     health care and how quietly most of them have gone along with \n     restrictions on how they care for patients.\n       Medical societies, of course, have issued proposals and \n     lobbied legislators. The American Medical Association has a \n     big lobbying arm in Washington and in 1990 proposed its own \n     Health Access America plan. The Journal of the American \n     Medical Association has published hundreds of articles and \n     proposals, as have other medical journals. But these efforts \n     have not had major impact on the future of health care.\n       It is taken for granted among health-care reformers that a \n     major factor in high costs has been overtreating by \n     physicians who stand to make a buck by doing so. Yet these \n     same reformers assume that the same physicians can be trusted \n     not to undertreat patients when the economic incentives are \n     reversed.\n       Undertreatment is hard to define and, often, to detect. \n     It's difficult to measure outcomes; the data is subject to \n     interpretation, not only for individuals, but for HMO \n     populations, communities and states. Monitoring and \n     evaluation protocols are not well developed. Clinical \n     guidelines need further development if they are to be used as \n     protection against undertreatment. Databases that will permit \n     comparisons are still far from adequate.\n       People must rely on their physicians to withstand pressures \n     to undertreat, to do what's best for patients regardless of \n     new and increasing incentives to do less than that.\n       If the kinds of changes now happening in health care really \n     reflect advances in medicine and commendable efforts to \n     reduce unnecessary expenses and unneeded treatment, we should \n     all be cheering. But how can we be sure that pressures from \n     insurers and employers and HMOs won't push doctors and \n     hospitals to cut even more corners that will risk patients' \n     health?\n       There is still an enormous reservoir of trust in physicians \n     in this country. But it will be increasingly hard for doctors \n     to keep that trust and to deserve it in the new regimes of \n     red tape and cost controls. They will have to figure out how \n     to control the health-care system, not be controlled by \n     others. And they will have to stand up for patients against \n     the cost-cutters and the administrators when they interfere \n     with optimum treatment if we are to be comfortable and safe \n     with our health care in the future.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/07/senate-section/article/S2275-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\n\n Mr. HATCH.
