Mr. President, we have had a victory--at least a \ntemporary victory, but a good victory--with the IRS. Fifty-seven of us \nintroduced a bipartisan bill, Senator Dorgan leading for the Democrats, \nmyself for Republicans. The bill was introduced to do for farmers what \nhas been the law since 1981, that if deferred sales contracts were \nused, farmers were still taxed on the year that the money was received.\n  The IRS made a ruling that for alternative minimum tax purposes that \nincome would be taxed the year that the sale was made, not the year \nthat the\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\nmoney was received. Well, obviously this, if it were to go forward, \nwould create a tremendous hardship in the agricultural community \nbecause farmers would be taxed on two crops in 1 year, rather than the \nplanning that normally goes on in cash accounting farming.\n  Common sense and reasonableness have prevailed at the IRS. Last night \nat about 6:30 I received a telephone call from the IRS stating their \ndecision to delay for 1 year the enactment of their latest rule so that \nfarmers now will be able to do during the current tax filing system \nwhat they have been doing for the last 15 years, to just keep on \naccounting for their income for tax purposes the way that it has \nlegally been done.\n  Then just within the last hour Commissioner Richardson had delivered \nto me her letter in response to my letter of December and also the \nlatest recommendations as far as the regulations are concerned \nimplementing her decision.\n  The fact of life is, Mr. President, that the Internal Revenue Service \nwas aware of 57 Members of this Senate in a bipartisan spirit--and \nmaybe her decision was because she is an appointment of the President \nand that it then reflects the new attitude at the White House of \nbipartisanship during this congressional session.\n  Regardless of what brought this about, I am thankful that common \nsense and reasonableness have prevailed. I thank each of my 57 \ncolleagues who have been involved in this issue for their timeliness in \nhelping us sponsor this legislation, getting it in. We will now move \nforward to change an erroneous IRS ruling that has been backed up by an \nerroneous district court case so that law reflects what Congress has \nintended since 1981 when deferred sales contracts were made legal and, \nsecond, when we passed the alternative minimum tax legislation in 1986.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the documents I have referred to be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Treasury,\n\n\n                                     Internal Revenue Service,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 1997.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: In your December 31, 1996 letter, \n     you asked me how farmers could comply with the Internal \n     Revenue Service's position on the treatment of deferred \n     contract commodity sales for alternative minimum tax (AMT) \n     purposes on their 1996 federal income tax returns. You also \n     asked that the Service provide guidance about complying with \n     its position ``before the traditional farmer tax filing \n     deadline of March 1, 1997.''\n       As you and I have discussed, the position of the Service is \n     that for AMT purposes income from deferred contract commodity \n     sales must be reported in the year of sale. However, some \n     taxpayers have been reporting income from such sales for AMT \n     purposes in the taxable year they received their payments--\n     not the year of sale.\n       Earlier today, the IRS issued a Notice, a copy of which is \n     enclosed, advising those who have not followed the Service's \n     position how they should report deferred contract commodity \n     sales for AMT purposes on their returns for 1996. Basically, \n     for 1996 tax returns, taxpayers should make no changes in how \n     they have been reporting sales--even if contrary to the \n     Service's position.\n       The Notice also provides guidance about how to change the \n     method of reporting deferred contract commodity sales for AMT \n     purposes. Taxpayers who follow that guidance will receive \n     audit protection with regard to the AMT issue for all open \n     years unless they are currently under audit for this issue.\n       The way deferred contract commodity sales are reported for \n     the AMT is a ``method of accounting'' for tax purposes. The \n     law provides that the method of accounting a taxpayer uses \n     for tax purposes, even if it is not the correct method, \n     cannot be changed without the prior consent of the \n     Commissioner.\n       The Service will issue automatic consent procedures for \n     taxpayers to follow to change from the accounting method they \n     currently use. This change must be made on a taxpayer's \n     federal income tax return for the 1997 tax year. Thus, \n     taxpayers do not need to change how they report deferred \n     contract commodity sales until filing their 1997 returns.\n       I hope this information is helpful to you. Please let me \n     know if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Margaret Milner Richardson.\n\n        Part III--Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous\n\n       Notice of intent to issue guidance allowing farmers to \n     expeditiously change their method of accounting for deferred \n     payment sales contracts in computing alternative minimum tax.\n\n\n                              Notice 97-13\n\n       Summary: The Internal Revenue Service intends to provide \n     approval for taxpayers engaged in the business of farming to \n     change their method of accounting for the income from certain \n     deferred payment sales contracts for purposes of computing \n     their alternative minimum tax (AMT). Farmers will be allowed \n     to change to a permissible method of accounting for this \n     income, effective for taxable years beginning after December \n     31, 1996, by attaching Form 3115 to their 1997 federal income \n     tax returns to be filed during 1998. Farmers who change their \n     method of accounting in accordance with this procedure will \n     then receive audit protection with respect to the use of an \n     impermissible method of accounting for all taxable years \n     prior to the change, in accordance with generally applicable \n     rules.\n       Background: The Service has received numerous inquiries on \n     the proper treatment, for AMT purposes, of income from the \n     sale of products raised by farmers or other inventory \n     property sold in the ordinary course of the farming business \n     under deferred payment sales contracts. A deferred payment \n     sales contract is one where at least one payment is to be \n     received after the close of the taxable year in which the \n     product is sold.\n       Section 56(a)(6) of the Code provides that, in computing \n     alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI), income from the \n     disposition of property such as farm products is determined \n     without regard to the installment method under Sec. 453. \n     Thus, a farmer using the cash method, who sells farm products \n     under a deferred payment sales contract and does not elect \n     out of the installment method of reporting, must include in \n     AMTI in the year of the sale both the cash received and the \n     fair market value (or the issue price) of the deferred \n     payment obligation. Otherwise, the farmer is using an \n     impermissible method of accounting. If the farmer elects not \n     to apply the installment method to the sale, and reports the \n     income in the year of the sale, there is no AMTI adjustment \n     with respect to the sale.\n       Section 446(e) generally provides that a taxpayer that \n     changes its method of accounting must secure the \n     Commissioner's consent before computing income using the new \n     method. In general, taxpayers who wish to change their method \n     of accounting must file Form 3115, Application for Change in \n     Accounting Method, with the Commissioner within the first 180 \n     days of the taxable year in which the taxpayer desires to \n     make the change, and must pay a user fee (ranging from $500 \n     to $900). Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.446-1(e)(3)(i). In addition, \n     Sec. 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii) authorizes the Commissioner to \n     prescribe administrative procedures setting forth the \n     limitations, terms and conditions necessary to obtain consent \n     to change a method of accounting.\n       Automatic change in method of accounting: The Service will \n     issue guidance that will allow farmers currently using an \n     impermissible method of accounting for income from the sale \n     of farm products under deferred payment sales contracts for \n     AMT purposes to automatically change to a permissible method \n     of accounting. Under the forthcoming guidance, farmers will \n     be allowed to request the method change by attaching Form \n     3115 to their timely filed 1997 federal income tax return \n     (due in 1998). No user fee will be required.\n       The method change will be effective for taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 1996. In addition, the method \n     change will result in audit protection for all prior taxable \n     years with respect to the impermissible method of accounting \n     (i.e., the examining agent will not propose that a farmer \n     change the impermissible method of accounting for any prior \n     taxable year) in accordance with generally applicable rules. \n     See Rev. Proc. 92-20, Section 10.12, 1992-1 C.B. 685. Farmers \n     currently using an impermissible method of accounting for \n     such sales should continue to use that method in computing \n     AMT for taxable years ending prior to January 1, 1997.\n       The automatic method change procedure will not be available \n     to farmers who have received written notification from an \n     examining agent (e.g., by examination plan, information \n     document request, notification of proposed adjustments or \n     income tax examination changes) prior to January 28, 1997, \n     specifically citing as an issue under consideration the \n     farmer's method of accounting for income from sales of farm \n     products under deferred payment sales contracts for AMT \n     purposes. In addition, the guidance will not apply if the \n     farmer's method of accounting for such income for AMT \n     purposes is an issue under consideration by an appeals office \n     or a federal court.\n       Drafting information: The principal author of this notice \n     is William A. Jackson of the Office of Assistant Chief \n     Counsel (Income Tax and Accounting).

Mr. President, for my 85 colleagues who have served \nwith me in past Congresses, what I am going to speak of is nothing new. \nIt is about the lack of discipline and integrity in financial \naccounting at the Pentagon. This lack of integrity and discipline in \naccounting is the basis for the waste of the taxpayers' money that we \nhave had at that institution for a long period of time.\n  But for the nine Republicans and six Democrats who are new Members of \nthis body, I would ask them to be cognizant of the fact that what I am \naddressing is a crusade that I have been on for a long period of time \nto bring accountability to the expenditure of taxpayers' money at the \nDepartment of Defense. It is especially important for us Republicans to \nmake sure that we are accountable for the taxpayers' money at the \nDefense Department where we tend to be somewhat lax, let me say, \ncandidly. We should expect the same sort of accountability that we \nexpect of liberals in this body when they spend money through the \nvarious domestic departments of Education, Labor, Health and Human \nServices and other departments of State government that maybe we \nRepublicans ride herd on to a greater extent than we do the Defense \nDepartment.\n  So that subject is a breakdown of discipline and integrity in \naccounting at the Pentagon. When Mr. John Hamre became Comptroller of \nthe Defense Department in 1993, I felt very hopeful. He made a personal \ncommitment to clean up the books and to get control of the money. I \nreally believed that he would get the job done. In fact, I have \ncomplimented him on this floor several times for making some changes--\nmaybe not as fast as I would like to have had them made, but making \nchanges. That is quite an accomplishment in that very bureaucratic \norganization.\n  So I have been working on him, specifically on the issue of unmatched \ndisbursements. And, of course, as I have indicated, I thought we were \nmaking progress. Well, my confidence in Mr. Hamre has been shaken by a \npiece of paper that I am going to submit for the Record, which is \nfloating around the Pentagon. I hope Mr. Hamre will reject this paper \nand thus restore my confidence. This piece of paper was brought to my \nattention by a concerned citizen. It is draft bill language. It is \nstill under review, but it has lots of momentum. This language, if \napproved by Congress, would significantly loosen--in other words, going \nin the opposite direction of where we ought to be going--control over \nprogress payments. The Department of Defense pays out about $20 billion \na year in progress payments. So we are not talking about peanuts; we \nare talking about big chunks of money.\n  The language of this draft legislation tells me that Mr. Hamre and \nhis lieutenants in the Pentagon are ready to throw in the towel on this \nproblem. They have decided the accounting problem is just too big and \ntoo complicated to fix. They seem to be saying, ``Let's forget about \naccounting today; we will try to fix it tomorrow.''\n  The experts at the General Accounting Office are evaluating the \nmeaning of this language, and their verdict isn't in yet. But a \npreliminary reading tells me that this language is bad medicine for the \ntaxpayers. It's going to cut down on accountability at the Defense \nDepartment. It would make a bad situation worse. It would fix nothing. \nThe DOD Inspector General has been keeping a close eye on the problem \nfor a long time.\n  IG audit reports consistently show that the Department of Defense \nregularly violates the laws that this language would undo. This is like \nlegalizing the crime. Instead of fixing the problem, just legalize the \ncrime. The bureaucrats will be able to relax. The guillotine hanging \nover their heads to be accountable is gone. They don't have to worry \nabout breaking the law and getting into trouble. It's OK. Go ahead and \ndo it.\n  In a nutshell, Mr. President, these are the shortcomings the language \nwould sanction:\n  Problem No. 1: The Department of Defense is unable to quantify and \nmeasure work progress on the factory floor.\n  Problem No. 2: If you can't accurately measure work performance, how \ndo you make progress payments? You don't know how much to pay or what \nmoney to use.\n  Do you use fiscal year 1996 R funds, or do you use fiscal year 1994 \nprocurement money? Those are some examples. But they would have much \nmore leeway in making this decision. Less accountability.\n  Problem No. 3: If you don't know how to measure progress, or how much \nto pay, or what you are getting, you can't do normal bookkeeping, and \nso you are not as accountable.\n  This is why the Department's books are in shambles. When a Department \nof Defense check goes out the door, chances are it's in the wrong \namount. It could be an overpayment, an underpayment, an erroneous \npayment, or even a fraudulent payment. I have documented proof that a \nnumber of people have literally stolen millions of dollars through this \nlax process.\n  Without accurate bookkeeping, it is impossible to control the money. \nThe Pentagon check writing machine is stuck on automatic pilot, and \nnobody seems to know how to stop it.\n  This language would lock the checkwriting machine on autopilot.\n  Mr. President, the Pentagon bureaucrats want to create a pool of \nmoney down at the business end of the DOD pipeline--where money is \ndisbursed. They would do this by breaking down the integrity of the \nappropriation accounts established in law. That would allow them to \nmake payments without regard to statutory law and the Constitution, as \nthey once did before we abolished the memorable ``M'' account slush \nfunds. The ``M'' accounts were closed by Congress in 1990.\n\n  This language, then, in this proposed draft would subvert the \nappropriations process. Every member of the Appropriations Committee \nought to be concerned about this. Each year, that committee takes the \nDOD budget and carefully segregates the money in many different \naccounts. The amounts provided for each account are specified by the \nlaw. Under the law, the money must be expended for the purpose for \nwhich it was appropriated in the times allowed.\n  DOD bureaucrats are thumbing their noses at the appropriations \nprocess and the law. The IG tells us they do it with regularity--but at \nsome risk.\n  Well, this language would remove all of that risk. It would authorize \nthem to tear down the account barriers so carefully put up by the \nAppropriations Committee. If we are going to protect the taxpayers' \nmoney, if we are going to make the Department of Defense accountable, \nthat's not right.\n  The Department of Defense should not be authorized to merge \nappropriation accounts downstream at the contract level, unless they \nare first merged upstream by Congress in law.\n  If the money is to be pooled at the contract level, then Congress \nmust make some kind of corresponding adjustment in the way those moneys \nare appropriated. Otherwise, the appropriations process might become \nirrelevant down the road.\n  Mr. President, as I close, I want to say that I have already brought \nthis language to the attention of my friend from Alaska, Senator \nStevens, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I \nhave found him so many other times so respectful of the judgments that \nhave been presented to him and his cooperation on other committees \nwhere he can raise very important questions. So I don't have any doubt \nbut what this concerns Senator Stevens, and Senator Stevens will look \ninto it and find a solution, but not let the Defense Department get \naway with their irresponsible draft language that would give them an \nopen door to doing just about whatever they want to do.\n  I have asked Senator Stevens to urge Mr. Hamre to reconsider this \nproposal and find some other way to fix the problem. I also ask my \nfriend, John Hamre, to carry out his responsibilities under the Chief \nFinancial Officers' Act of 1990, the CFO Act. Under that act, he is \nsupposed to be tightening internal controls and improving financial \naccounting.\n  This language would move accounting in the opposite direction--the \nwrong direction. It would loosen internal controls and set accounting \naside until some unknown future date.\n\n[[Page S696]]\n\n  Mr. President, this draft language floating around the Defense \nDepartment at this point needs close scrutiny. It really worries me, \nand it should worry the taxpayers because there is going to be less \naccountability of bureaucrats, who are responsible for spending the \nmoney, to the taxpayers if we would change existing law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the document I referred to earlier be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Excerpt From Draft Bill\n\n     SEC.  . ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACT FINANCING PAYMENTS.\n\n       Section 2307 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection (i):\n       ``(i) Accounting for Payments.--Payments under this section \n     based upon a contract that is funded by multiple \n     appropriations or multiple subdivisions within one \n     appropriation may be paid from any one or more of the \n     appropriations or subdivisions thereof funding the contract. \n     However, proper accounting adjustments shall be made to \n     conform to the requirements of subsection (a) of section 1301 \n     of title 31 upon final payment for the items or services \n     delivered and accepted in performance of the contract.''.\n\n\n                           Sectional Analysis\n\n       This proposal would authorize the Secretary of Defense, \n     when making contract financing payments for a contract funded \n     by multiple appropriations or multiple subdivisions within an \n     appropriation, to charge any one or more of the \n     appropriations or subdivisions thereof. The benefit of this \n     section under 10 U.S.C. Sec. 2307, ``Contract Financing'' is \n     to the temporary spreading of payments for work-in-process \n     costs across appropriations funding the contract. This \n     legislative relief will permit us the flexibility to exercise \n     our stewardship over the public moneys more efficiently and \n     effectively.\n       This section remedies a long standing and on-going problem \n     in the current contract payment process that attempts to \n     assign contract financing payments to a specific \n     appropriation when the process is not capable of efficiently \n     providing the need information. The Department of Defense \n     (DOD) uses the contract financing authority at 10 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2307, as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation \n     Part 32, for many of its contracts. These provisions \n     authorize the disbursement of funds to a contractor prior to \n     the acceptance of goods and services. Contract financing \n     includes advance, partial payments under cost reimbursable \n     contracts and progress payments. Pursuant to this authority, \n     contractors receive progress payments from DOD to finance \n     work performed under DOD contracts. These payments for work-\n     in-process may be for specific work or tasks, or for \n     production line setup and equipment or tooling for the entire \n     contract and in some cases are not tied to specific work or \n     tasks. The contracts are often funded with multiple and \n     different appropriations.\n       In order to comply with 31 U.S.C. Sec. 1301, which requires \n     that appropriations be applied only for the purpose for which \n     they were made, payments based upon the contractor's work-in \n     process costs must be identified to specific work or tasks \n     and the related appropriation funding the effort. However, \n     given that the nature of the cost incurred during the work-\n     in-process period may be funded by multiple appropriations \n     and therefore, cannot be efficiently identified to a specific \n     appropriation, compliance with 31 U.S.C. Sec. 1301 is \n     difficult and time consuming Furthermore, it is not cost \n     effective or realistic to require additional government or \n     contractor information or effort to determine the specific \n     chargeable appropriations while making payments for work-in-\n     process costs and for costs which are essentially a means of \n     temporary financing for the contractor. In fact, this \n     additional administrative work to develop the information \n     would not significantly improve the precision of the estimate \n     but would further increase the contractor and taxpayer costs. \n     Currently, unless the specific line item and appropriation \n     are identified to the payment office, contract financing \n     payments are spread pro-rata across the appropriations \n     funding the contract. During the work-in-process period, \n     adequate controls exist to ensure that no appropriation is \n     charged more than is available in the appropriation and, \n     furthermore no payment is made without receipt of a proper \n     government approved authorization to make the payment against \n     the proper contract. The problem, however, is that this \n     method is not in compliance with 31 U.S.C. Sec. 1301.\n       The enactment of this bill permit this accounting \n     flexibility when viewed in conjunction with 31 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1301. The effect would be to provide a specific \n     statutory exception to the requirements of 31 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1301 until payment is made.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while the Senator from Iowa is here, I \nwanted to comment on some remarks he made at the start of his \npresentation.\n  As the Presiding Officer and other Members may know, Senator Grassley \nand I have cosponsored and introduced last week a piece of legislation \ndealing with this current Internal Revenue Service problem on the \nalternative minimum tax that is going to affect a lot of farmers in our \npart of the country.\n  I agree with the Senator from Iowa that the news that came out of the \nInternal Revenue Service this morning is indeed good news. The Internal \nRevenue Service, this morning, has indicated that it will, in effect, \nnot enforce in 1996 a provision that it was intending to enforce, which \nwe believe is a misinterpretation of tax law. What IRS was intending to \ndo, in effect, on the alternative minimum tax was to force a number of \nfamily farmers to pay taxes on income they have not yet received.\n  We do not believe Congress ever intended for that kind of enforcement \nto occur, or for that interpretation of tax law to exist. We think the \nIRS was wrong.\n  The Senator from Iowa and I have repeatedly contacted the \nadministration. I have visited with the Secretary of the Treasury and \nothers to make this case. But, in any event, on a bipartisan basis, as \nthe Senator from Iowa and I introduced legislation with 54 cosponsors--\nthe Republican leader the Democratic leader are on the bill--it is \nclear, or would have been clear, it seems to me, to the IRS and \nTreasury that this legislation will pass in this Congress and in effect \nsay to the IRS that your interpretation of the law is wrong.\n  I think the IRS has, to its credit, understood now that to enforce in \nthis year and put a fair number of farmers at risk--asking them to pay \ntaxes on income they have not yet received--would be really a travesty \nof justice. The IRS today has taken the position that they will allow \nfarmers to file tax returns in 1996 as they have in the past with \nrespect to deferred contract commodity sales. And I commend them for \ntaking that position.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of the IRS and the Treasury Secretary on \nthis issue. It is the right thing to do. It is what the Senator from \nIowa and I and others have been advocating they do.\n  So we have made some incremental progress today. That ought to be \ngood news for farmers who have been worried about this issue of how the \nIRS will enforce and treat and audit the deferred contract commodity \nsales.\n  I just wanted to follow the remarks of the Senator from Iowa to say \nthat I am pleased to work with him on it. It is an example of a \nbipartisan effort to fix a problem, and we have at least gone part of \nthe way to fix this problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S696-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, this is to express my deep concern over a \ndecision President Clinton made last year concerning the Anti-Terrorism \nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, but it has only recently come \nto light.\n  When President Clinton signed the antiterrorism bill into law on \nApril 24 of last year he made a promise to the American people--a \npromise never to give in to terrorism or to terrorist forces. The \nPresident vowed to stand firm against nations that support terrorism \nand use violence and bloodshed for political ends. The President was \nright in his resolve.\n  As the world's only superpower, the United States must set an example \nfor all nations. We must not allow the cowards responsibility for such \natrocities as the downing of Pan Am Flight 103, the bombing of the \nWorld Trade Center, or the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal \nbuilding to gain from their actions.\n  That is why Congress included strict provisions in the Anti-Terrorism \nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 to isolate terrorist \norganizations and those who support them. Section 321 of the law \nprohibits U.S. businesses from engaging in any type of financial \ntransactions with countries known to support international terrorism. \nThis is an important weapon in our arsenal against terrorism that must \nbe rigorously enforced.\n  Doing business with state sponsors of terrorism provides such rogue \nnations with links to the outside world and means for financing their \nugly agenda. Any such financial transaction may well return in the form \nof violence against the American people, our allies or other innocent \nvictims.\n  President Clinton purported to support this policy. In his address to \nthe Nation on signing the antiterrorism bill, the President announced \nthat America must resolve ``to hold fast against the forces of violence \nand division * * * guard against them, speak against them and fight \nagainst them.'' Unfortunately, the President has not lived up to his \nown words.\n  As reported in the Washington Post last week, only 4 months after \nsigning the antiterrorism bill, President Clinton made a special \nexemption in the law for Sudan, one of the seven nations classified by \nthe Department of State as a state sponsor of terrorism. The exemption \nwas made specifically to allow California-based Occidental Petroleum \nCorporation to negotiate with the Sudanese Government for a stake in a \n$930 million oil deal. The President made this decision despite the \nState Department's finding that Sudan is second only to Iran in its \nsponsorship of Islamic extremists engaged in terrorism against United \nStates allies in the Middle East and against the United States itself.\n  Mr. President, I find these actions on the part of the President \nunconscionable, and I trust that most of my colleagues agree. This, \nunfortunately, is only the latest example of the flip-flopping on \nAmerican foreign policy that marked the first term of President \nClinton. Yet this particular change of heart may well be the most \ndangerous. The United States and our allies have known for decades that \nif we give terrorists an inch, they will take a mile. The more \nconcessions we make, the more power we give to the forces of evil. It \nappears to me that our Commander in Chief engaged in the very practice \nhe condemned in April.\n  The American people should not stand for such deception. President \nClinton has an obligation to every American ever hurt by terrorism and \nevery American who may be threatened by terrorism in the future to do \nwhat he said he would--stand firm. I truly hope the President will do \njust that and reverse his exemption of Sudan from the list of nations \nbarred from doing business with American firms.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl).

JOHN KNEW THE MEANING OF AMERICA\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, a week or so ago--it was on January 13, \n1997, to be exact--I was among those present at what proved to be a \ndelightful memorial service for a gentleman whose life had demonstrated \nhis understanding of, and his fidelity to, both the miracle and the \nmeaning of America. His name was Jeffrey St. John who had died on \nJanuary 3.\n  I attended the memorial service not because I was a close personal \nfriend of Jeffrey St. John--I wish I could claim to have been, but \nbecause I admired so very much his remarkable talent and his unyielding \ncourage in defending principles that deserve to survive. So just about \neverybody else present that afternoon had known Jeffrey St. John, and \neverybody else was equipped with personal anecdotes that more often \nthan not demonstrated the good humor of their departed friend.\n  Mrs. St. John, Kathryn is her name, was there, of course--a charming \nlady who undoubtedly was a great source of strength to her husband \nduring the years that he so unfailingly stood in defense of \nconservative principles.\n  Mr. President, following this occasion, which Mr. St. John would have \nenormously enjoyed--and, who knows, there's a better than even chance \nthat he was indeed sitting on a cloud up there somewhere--I asked Paul \nWeyrich, one of America's most effective defenders of conservatism and \nfreedom, to prepare for me a brief personal history of Jeffrey St. \nJohn.\n  Mr. Weyrich readily agreed to do so despite his own hectic schedule \nas president of the Free Congress Foundation and its myriad of \nactivities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Weyrich's review of \nMr. St. John's life be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S698]]\n\n               Jeffrey St. John--Journalist and Historian\n\n                           (By Paul Weyrich)\n\n       On January 3, 1997, a great American passed away at his \n     home in Randolph, VA. Jeffrey St. John was a noted author, \n     journalist, broadcaster, and historian. He was one of the \n     first conservative news commentators aired on national radio \n     and television; his career included work as business \n     correspondent for the Today show, a long-time news \n     commentator for CBS-TV, CBS Radio, and Mutual Broadcasting, \n     and as a news director for ABC radio. He produced and \n     moderated TV and radio shows for stations in Washington, San \n     Francisco, and New York. He wrote and narrated Headlines and \n     History, a daily radio feature translated into 26 languages \n     and broadcast by the Voice of America. Over the years, he \n     received two Emmy Awards for his work in television.\n       Mr. St. John was a prolific author and columnist. His \n     commentaries were carried in the New York Times, the Wall \n     Street Journal, Chicago Tribune, and Christian Science \n     Monitor. He was a syndicated columnist for Copley News \n     Service, and wrote regularly for Saturday Review, Barron's, \n     and Nation's Business and other publications. He was the \n     author of eight books.\n       One of Jeffrey St. John's greatest works was a trilogy on \n     the formation and adoption of the Constitution, establishment \n     of the first Congress, and drafting of the Bill of Rights. \n     The trilogy was published during 1987-92 by Jameson Books. \n     Former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Warren Burger, was \n     so impressed with Mr. St. John's historical works that the \n     Chief Justice wrote the foreword to each of the three \n     volumes. Chief Justice Burger then, as chairman of the \n     Bicentennial of the United States Constitution, distributed \n     the set to every high school and college library in America. \n     Jeffrey St. John used the unique approach of writing about \n     these crucial historical events from the viewpoint of a \n     reporter observing the developments.\n       His journalistic efforts earned for him numerous awards. He \n     received the Benjamin Franklin National Press Foundation \n     Award for his writings on the Constitution from the U.S. \n     Press Foundation; and the George Washington Medal of Freedom \n     from the Freedoms Foundation in Valley Forge for a radio \n     series on the Life and Legacy of George Washington.\n       Mr. St. John covered the Korean War as a combat writer and \n     photographer for Pacific Stars and Stripes and in 1956 was an \n     on-the-spot reporter for the Suez crisis. He subsequently \n     served as a correspondent at the United Nations and at the \n     White House during the Eisenhower administration. In 1966, he \n     was the Conservative Party candidate for Congress for the \n     seat vacated for New York Mayor John Lindsay.\n       Jeffrey St. John loved his country. He proudly served in \n     the Marine Corps. He cherished our Constitution and other \n     documents of our Founding Fathers. His life and journalistic \n     efforts provide unique documentation of high quality for the \n     preservation of democracy. America has lost a true patriot \n     and a journalistic giant.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week, I introduced legislation to \nenhance the economic security of older Americans and small businesses \naround the country. The bill, known as the Family Heritage Preservation \nAct, would repeal the onerous Federal estate and gift tax, and the tax \non generation-skipping transfers. Fifteen Senators have joined me as \ncosponsors of this very important initiative.\n  Mr. President, most Americans know the importance of planning ahead \nfor retirement. Sometimes that means buying a less expensive car, \nwearing clothes a little longer, or foregoing a vacation or two. But by \ndoing with a little less during one's working years, people know they \ncan enjoy a better and more secure life during retirement, and maybe \neven leave their children and grandchildren a little better off when \nthey are gone.\n  Savings not only create more personal security, they help create new \nopportunities for others, too. Savings are really investments that help \nothers create new jobs in the community. They make our country more \ncompetitive. And ultimately they make a citizen's retirement more \nsecure by providing a return on the money invested during his or her \nworking years.\n  So how does the Government reward all of this thrift and careful \nplanning? It imposes a hefty tax on the end result of such activity--up \nto 55 percent of a person's estate. The respected liberal professor of \nlaw at the University of Southern California, Edward J. McCaffrey, \nobserved that ``polls and practices show that we like sin taxes, such \nas on alcohol and cigarettes.'' ``The estate tax,'' he went on to say, \n``is an anti-sin, or a virtue, tax. It is a tax on work and savings \nwithout consumption, on thrift, on long-term savings. There is no \nreason even a liberal populace need support it.''\n  At one time, the estate tax was required of only the wealthiest \nAmericans. Now inflation, a nice house, and a good insurance policy can \npush people of even modest means into its grip. The estate tax is \napplied to all of the assets owned by an individual at the time of \ndeath. The tax rate, which starts at 37 percent, can quickly rise to a \nwhopping 55 percent--the highest estate tax rate in the world.\n  As detrimental as the tax is for couples, it is even more harmful to \nsmall businesses, including those owned by women and minorities. The \ntax is imposed on a family business when it is least able to afford the \npayment--upon the death of the person with the greatest practical and \ninstitutional knowledge of that business' operations. It should come as \nno surprise then that a 1993 study by Prince and Associates--a \nStratford, CT, research and consulting firm--found that 9 out of 10 \nfamily businesses that failed within 3 years of the principal owner's \ndeath attributed their companies' demise to trouble paying estate \ntaxes; 6 out of 10 family owned businesses fail to make it to the \nsecond generation; 9 out of 10 never make it to the third generation. \nThe estate tax is a major reason why.\n  Think of what that means to women and minority-owned businesses. \nInstead of passing a hard-earned and successful business on to the next \ngeneration, many families have to sell the company in order to pay the \nestate tax. The upward mobility of such families is stopped in its \ntracks. The proponents of this tax always speak of the need to hinder \n``concentrations of wealth.'' What the tax really hinders is new \nAmerican success stories.\n\n  With that in mind, the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business \nidentified the estate tax as one of small business's top concerns. \nDelegates to the conference voted overwhelmingly to endorse its repeal.\n  Obviously, there is a great deal of peril to small businesses when \nthey fail to plan ahead for estate taxes. So many small business owners \ntry to find legal means of avoiding the tax or preparing for it, but \nthat, too, comes at a significant cost. Some people simply slow the \ngrowth of their businesses to limit their estate tax burden. Of course, \nthat means less investment in our communities and fewer jobs created. \nOthers divert money they would have spent on new equipment or new hires \nto insurance policies designed to cover estate tax costs. Still others \nspend millions on lawyers, accountants, and other advisors for estate \ntax planning purposes. But that leaves fewer resources to invest in the \ncompany, start up new businesses, hire additional people, or pay better \nwages.\n  The inefficiencies surrounding the tax can best be illustrated by the \nfindings of a 1994 study published in the Seton Hall Law Review. That \nstudy found that compliance costs totaled a whopping $7.5 billion in \n1992, a year when the estate tax raised only $11 billion.\n  The estate tax raises only about 1 percent of the Federal \nGovernment's annual revenue, but it consumes 8 percent of each year's \nprivate savings. That is about $15 billion sidelined from the Nation's \neconomy. Economists calculate that if the money paid in estate taxes \nsince 1971 had been invested instead, total savings in 1991 would have \nbeen $399 billion higher, the economy would have been $46 billion \nlarger, and we would have 262,000 more jobs. Obviously, the income and \npayroll taxes that would have been paid on these gains would have \ntopped the amount collected by the Government in estate taxes.\n  There have been nine attempts to reform the estate tax during the \nlast 50 years. Few would contend that it has been made any fairer or \nmore efficient. The only thing that has really changed is that \nlobbyists and estate planners have gotten a little wealthier. Probably \nthe best thing we could do is repeal the estate tax altogether. That is \nwhat I am proposing in the Family Heritage Preservation Act.\n  Mr. President, the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax \nReform, which studied ways to make the\n\n[[Page S699]]\n\nTax Code simpler, looked at the estate tax during the course of its \ndeliberations just over a year ago. The Commission concluded that ``it \nmakes little sense and is patently unfair to impose extra taxes on \npeople who choose to pass their assets on to their children and \ngrandchildren instead of spending them lavishly on themselves.'' It \nwent on to endorse repeal of the estate tax.\n  I invite my colleagues to cosponsor the Family Heritage Preservation \nAct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S698-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR PAUL TSONGAS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

His battles were many, and so were his \nvictories. His grace and courage will stand for many of us as beacons \nin our own lives.\n  Paul befriended me when I was running for the Senate.

We all did.\n  When he served in the Senate, one of the items in his office was a \nframed quotation from one of John Adams' many letters to his wife, \nAbigail. The Massachusetts College of Art had produced it in January \n1980. I had admired it on visits to Paul's office and when Paul left \nthe Senate, he sent it to me, with a handwritten note. I treasure them \nboth, and the feeling behind John Adams' words:\n\n       I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty \n     to study mathematics and philosophy * * * in order to give \n     their children a right to study painting, poetry, and music * \n     * * May 12, 1780.\n\n  I believe Paul Tsongas took this message to heart, and that it guided \nmuch of what he did. The country is fortunate to have had such service \nfrom such a man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S699-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PAUL TSONGAS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with a great sense of sadness that I \nrise today to pay tribute to a man who epitomized personal and \npolitical courage and a fervent commitment to public service--Senator \nPaul Tsongas.\n  Paul and I both came to Congress in 1974, as part of the so-called \nWatergate class and we were together in the Senate from 1981 to 1984. \nIn all that time, while we didn't always see eye to eye on every issue, \nour deep friendship and appreciation for each other never diminished.\n  Throughout his entire life, Paul Tsongas built on the strong belief \nin public service that he learned while a Peace Corps volunteer in \nEthiopia and country director in the West Indies.\n  Whether it was in his hometown of Lowell, MA, where he served as a \ncity councilor; or as a one-term Senator, who pushed through what \nPresident Carter called the most important conservation legislation of \nthe century, the Alaska Lands Act of 1980; or even as a Presidential \ncandidate and later cochairman of the Concord Coalition, preaching the \ngospel of a balanced budget, Paul Tsongas always had the best interests \nof his fellow citizens in mind.\n  In all the time I knew him, Paul Tsongas never wavered from the \nfirmly held beliefs and principles that guided his public and private \nlife. What is more, Paul was never afraid to speak his mind or voice an \nopinion, no matter how controversial or unpopular.\n  The courage was never more evident than in his hard fought battle to \nconquer the health problems that plagued him for more than a decade and \neventually took his life. When Paul was diagnosed with cancer in 1983, \nhe gave up what was then a promising political career in the U.S. \nSenate to undergo radical treatment and rehabilitation.\n  After his amazing recovery, Paul stayed close to his family arguing \nthat no man ever died wishing he'd spent more time with his business.\n  But the pull of the arena was too strong for Paul Tsongas and after \nbeing cleared by doctors to resume his political career he began what \nmost observers termed a futile campaign to unseat George Bush.\n  But, what he lacked in fiery oratory he made up for with a \ncommonsense agenda that appealed to Democrats across the country. While \nPaul failed to gain the Democratic nomination he never lost his dignity \nor the trademark dry wit that always characterized him.\n  Teddy Roosevelt once said that of public service ``It is not the \ncritic that counts. * * * The credit belongs to the man who is actually \nin the arena; whose face is marked by dust and sweat and blood; who \nstrives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows \nthe great enthusiasm and great devotions, and spends himself in a \nworthy cause, who at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high \nachievement; and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while \ndaring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and \ntimid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.''\n  Paul Tsongas knew well both the joys of victory and the anguish of \ndefeat. No matter what adversity befell him, be it personal or \npolitical, he never paused from his tireless efforts to improve the \nworld around him. For all those in the Senate and throughout the \ncountry who valued his wise counsel and commitment to public service he \nwill be sorely missed.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Niki and his three \ndaughters Ashley, Katina, and Molly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S699-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I do want to announce at this point also for \nthe information of all Senators, there will be no recorded votes for \nthe remainder of the day. There will be opportunity for Members to \nattend committee hearings, confirmation hearings and begin to have \nhearings on legislation, but there will be no recorded votes this \nafternoon.\n  It is our hope that we will be able to have debate this afternoon on \nthe nominee to be head of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, Mr. Cuomo. We have not been able to get a time worked out \non that, an agreement where we would be able to have a vote in the \nmorning, but we would like to be able to get the debate done this \nafternoon. So any Senators who would like to speak on that may want to \ndo that, and then maybe we can complete it in the morning, hopefully \nget a vote sometime early in the morning between perhaps 9:30 and 10.\n  We have run into a couple little bumps in the road. We may not be \nable to get that agreement worked out, but we are still working on it. \nWe also expect to be able to vote on Thursday morning then, probably \nagain between 9:30 and 10 o'clock, on Mr. Daley to be the Secretary of \nCommerce.\n  So we will definitely have one vote on Thursday, and we may have a \nvote on Wednesday on the other nomination. We will let Senators know \nlater in the day if that is worked out. With that, Mr. President, I \nwould be glad to yield the floor to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I ask the leader to address one \nother scheduled vote this week. The majority leader, as a member of the \nRules Committee, is aware the committee voted in the affirmative on the \nnew Architect of the Capitol. At some point the Senate will turn its \nattention to a vote. It is historic.\n  Mr. LOTT. We did not factor that into our thinking, but we would like \nto do that tomorrow if we could, I believe.\n  Do we need a recorded vote on that?\n  Mr. WARNER. Certainly this Senator would not so desire.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let us check and see what the precedents are on whether or \nnot a recorded vote is necessary. I know we have come up with a very \nstrong nominee----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. Hantman.\n  Mr. LOTT. Which has been approved unanimously by the Rules Committee. \nWe would like to formally complete his confirmation by the full Senate. \nWe will check on when we might do that. We could do that tomorrow, but \nwe might be affected by whether a recorded vote will be in order. We \nwill check into it and get back to the Senator and notify all Senators \nlater on today.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the majority leader. I, too, thank him for his \nparticipation in the selection of the Architect of the U.S. Capitol.\n  Mr. President, I would like to proceed as if in morning business for \nthe stipulated period of not to exceed 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S700-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S700-S702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE 1997 INAUGURAL CEREMONIES\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on Monday, January 20, the U.S. Congress, \nthrough the auspices of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural \nCeremonies, hosted the 53d Inauguration of the President and Vice \nPresident of the United States.\n  In addition to the senior Senator from Virginia, who served as \nChairman, the members of the committee included: Senator Wendell H. \nFord, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives Newt Gingrich, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, \nand House Majority Leader Richard Armey.\n  With over one-quarter million people gathered on the west front of \nthe U.S. Capitol and the Mall, and millions more watching on television \nand listening on radio--throughout the United States and around the \nworld--William Jefferson Clinton reaffirmed the oath of office as the \n42d President, and Albert Gore, Jr. reaffirmed the oath of office as \nthe 45th Vice President of the United States.\n  This ceremony--at which the President and Vice President, standing \nbefore the people's elected representatives, are sworn to execute the \nwill of the people as expressed by Congress--is central to America's \ngovernance, making the United States, the oldest, continuous, \nconstitutional democratic republic in the World.\n  The ceremony has grown by tradition and precedent since George \nWashington first took the constitutionally prescribed oath of office as \nthe Nation's first President.\n  It commemorates the peaceful transition of power and the continuity \nof leadership conceived by our Founding Fathers and reflected in both \narticle II and the 20th amendment of the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n\n                         Article II, Section 1\n\n       * * * Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the \n     Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal \n     to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which \n     the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or \n     Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or \n     Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an \n     Elector.\n       The Electors Shall meet in their respective States, and \n     vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall \n     not be an Inhabitant of the Same State with themselves. And \n     they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of \n     the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and \n     certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of \n     the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. \n     The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the \n     Senate and House of Representatives, open all the \n     Certificates and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person \n     having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, * \n     * *\n       Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall \n     take the following Oath or Affirmation:--``I do solemnly \n     swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office \n     of President of the United States, and will to the best of my \n     Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the \n     United States.''\n\n                              Amendment 20\n\n       Section 1. The terms of the President and Vice President \n     shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms \n     of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3rd day of \n     January, of the years in which such terms would have ended if \n     this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their \n     successors shall then begin.\n\n  Mr. President, the objective of the Joint Congressional Committee on \nInaugural Ceremonies was to ensure that the swearing-in ceremony was \nconducted in a manner reflecting dignity on the Office of the \nPresident, the Congress, and the U.S. Supreme Court--the three coequal \nbranches of our Government.\n  To achieve this end, Congressional staff, military personnel, \nExecutive Branch employees, and volunteers worked for more than 6 \nmonths to plan and executive this ceremony inaugurating the President \nand Vice President.\n  Viewing the ceremonies from the Capitol grounds or on television, it \nis difficult, if not impossible, to appreciate all the planning and \neffort that goes into an inaugural swearing-in ceremony and the \nluncheon that follows.\n  Every possible detail from the precise words used to introduce the \nPresident and his escorts to the platform to the location of television \ncameras had to be considered, reviewed and agreed to by representatives \nfrom the Congress, the Office of the President, the media, and numerous \nsecurity organizations.\n  Particular commendation goes to the outstanding program participants \nwhose lasting contributions of prayers, songs and poetry made this such \na memorable, historic day in the continuing life of America.\n\n[[Page S701]]\n\n  To put the many thousands who came to the Capitol in a proper spirit, \nthe morning began with a sing-along of patriotic music led by the U.S. \nMarine Band. So far as we can determine, this was a first.\n  The sing-along was followed by musical presentations by the choir \nfrom the College of William and Mary from Williamsburg, VA, and the \nchoir from Hampton University from Hampton, VA.\n  The Rev. Billy Graham and the Rev. Gardner C. Taylor offered prayers. \nJessye Norman, the Children of the Gospel Mass from the Washington \nPerforming Arts Society, the Immanuel Baptist Church Choir and \nOrchestra of Little Rock, Santita Jackson, and the Resurrection Choir \nlifted our spirits with song. The scholar Miller Williams presented an \noriginal poem written specifically for this occasion.\n  And for the first time, which I find astonishing, the Pledge of \nAllegiance was recited at the inaugural swearing-in ceremony.\n  Eagle Scout David Morales, a junior at James Madison High School in \nVienna, VA, was selected to lead the Pledge. His performance was a \ntribute to the scouting movement and to the youth of our great Nation.\n  The Architect of the Capitol was tasked with the substantial \nlogistical responsibilities of building the platform, arranging the \nseating, installing security fences, and maintaining the grounds.\n  The Capitol Police, the U.S. Secret Service, the Metropolitan Police \nDepartment, and the National Park Service had to consider every \nmovement of the President and Vice President, how to afford security \nand, at the same time, provide the viewing public and other \nparticipants maximum opportunity to view their national leaders.\n  Everyone involved in carrying out this enormous task can take great \npride in the high degree of professionalism with which they performed \ntheir duties.\n  The timing of all aspects of the ceremony, beginning with the \ndeparture of the traditional congressional escort committee going to \nthe White House, meeting the President and bringing him to the Capitol, \nand ending with the President's departure from the Capitol following \nlunch required intense cooperation and coordination between the Office \nof the President and the Congress. Both were given in full measure on \nthis challenge and all others.\n  A very special commendation goes to Terry McAuliffe and Ann Jordan, \nthe co-chairmen of the President's Inaugural Committee. Their \ndirections were well and carefully carried out by Tim Keating.\n  The traditional congressional luncheon honoring the President and \nMrs. Clinton, and the Vice President and Mrs. Gore--from the brief \nspeeches to the beggars pudding--was judged a success. Grayson \nWinterling, Ginny Sandahl, and Dot Svendsen deserve special recognition \nfor their astute and sensitive planning and execution of every luncheon \ndetail.\n  Beginning 100 years ago, with the inauguration of William McKinley in \n1897, Congress has hosted a luncheon for the President and Vice \nPresident. This year our luncheon theme was the inauguration of John \nAdams and Thomas Jefferson in 1797.\n  The menu for the luncheon was based on foods Adams and Jefferson \nmight have enjoyed in their time, and the memento provided each guest \nwas a magnifier glass similar to ones used in that era.\n  As the chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural \nCeremonies, and on behalf of the committee and the entire Congress, the \nsenior Senator from Virginia extends a grateful thanks to all who \nhelped make this historic swearing-in ceremony possible, including:\n  The staff of the Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies: Susan \nAheron Magill, executive director; John Chambers, deputy director; Jack \nHoggard, Bobbie Kilberg, M.L. Faunce, Robert Paxton, Amelia Fields, \nJanel Ellison, Eric Ruff, Ned Monroe, John Campbell, Bill Sweeney, Eric \nPeterson, and Jennifer Joy Wilson.\n  The staff of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration: \nGrayson Winterling, staff director; Kennie Gill, Chris Shunk, Bruce \nKasold, Ginny Sandahl, and Sherry Little.\n  The representatives of Joint Congressional Committee Members: Eileen \nMandell, Doriene Steeves--Senator Warner; Allison Berger--Senator Ford; \nSusan Wells, Julie Morrison, Hardy Lott--Senator Lott; Martha \nMorrison--Speaker Gingrich; Sharon Daniels, Karen Brooke--\nRepresentative Gephardt; and Leah Levy, Representative Armey.\n  The Armed Forces Inaugural Committee: Chaired by Maj. Gen. Tom Foley, \nCommander, Military District of Washington, the Armed Forces Inaugural \nCommittee was responsible for more than 10,000 military troops who \nprovided invaluable manpower to carry out the day-long inaugural \nfestivities.\n  General Foley was assisted by Tom Groppel, Military District of \nWashington, who has directed the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee in \nsix previous inaugural ceremonies.\n  In addition, other key military personnel included Maj.

Mr. President, last Thursday 48 Senators representing \nthe Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition, which I chair with Senator \nMoynihan, my colleague from Vermont Senator Leahy, and Senators from \nother States hard hit by skyrocketing heating prices and cold weather, \nsent a letter to President Clinton asking him to release $300 million \nin emergency low income home energy assistance funds [LIHEAP].\n  The 1997 Omnibus Appropriations Act allows the President to release \nup to $420 million in LIHEAP emergency funds. In the Northeast and \nMidwest, the price of home heating oil has jumped over 25 percent from \nlast year, while natural gas and propane prices in all cold weather \nStates are significantly higher. The Reverend Dr. Robert E. Martin of \nNewport, VT recently wrote me that the propane bill of the Lowell \nCongregational Church has risen 52 percent over last year. Any \ndistribution of emergency LIHEAP funds must take into account this rise \nin fuel prices, which in Vermont, so far, has been worse than the \nweather.\n  Mr. President, the rising cost of energy weighs heavy on low-income \nworking Americans who devote about 12 percent of their income to energy \nbills. The elderly and disabled low-income individuals relying on \nsupplemental security income spend on average 19 percent of that income \non energy bills, and families with children living on Aid to Families \nWith Dependent Children devote almost 25 percent of their benefits to \nenergy bills.\n  Although many State regulations prohibit utilities from terminating \nservice for nonpayment during the winter, households that rely on home \nheating oil, propane, and wood do not have this same safety net. These \nhouseholds must pay for services up front or face fuel cut offs. With \nthe prolonged spike in fuel prices, additional Federal funds are needed \nto prevent many families from having to face life threatening cold this \nwinter.\n  Mr. President, freezing temperatures and high fuel prices are a \nrecipe for disaster for low-income Americans. Forty-eight Senators from \nboth parties are urging President Clinton to act quickly so that low-\nincome Americans do not have to choose between heating and eating this \nwinter.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor for others who desire to speak on \nthis important issue.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I always appreciate working with the Senator from \nVermont and the Senator from Massachusetts. We have been on the floor \nbefore talking about low-income energy assistance, and we really have \nto be on the floor today speaking about this.\n  Sometimes we talk about these issues, and we just talk. It may not be \nconnected to people's lives. But what we say today on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate is connected to people's lives in many of our States.\n  It is between 8 and 15 degrees below zero in most of Minnesota today. \nIt might get to zero this daytime.\n  Mr. President, we have had a brutal winter in our State and, in \naddition, as the Senator from Vermont mentioned, natural gas prices are \nup 60 percent from last year's prices, heating oil is up 40 percent \nover last year, and the cost of propane is 60 percent higher than last \nyear.\n  Our State is colder than it was last year. It costs much more to heat \na home. These oil prices have skyrocketed, and this means we have a \ncrisis, all in capital letters.\n  Mr. President, the Governor, Governor Arne Carlson, has used $9 \nmillion of the State's fund for additional assistance, but we have in \nfiscal year 1997 additional money, several hundreds of millions of \ndollars, for emergency energy assistance. It is an emergency.\n  In Minnesota, we have about 300,000 citizens who are dependent upon \nthis lifeline program. It is not a large grant. It averages about $350, \nbut for many of these citizens--many of them elderly, many of them \nchildren--this is a lifeline program, without which either people go \ncold or people huddle in one room in their home. I wish that was an \nexaggeration, but it is not. I have visited with these families. Our \npeople somehow figure out how to pay for their heat, but then they \ndon't have enough money to buy food or they don't have enough money to \nbuy prescription drugs that they need. This is a particular problem \nwith the elderly.\n  Mr. President, we are going to run out of assistance. We are going to \nhave a dire situation in Minnesota. This is no melodrama on my part. It \nis time this emergency money be released.\n  Almost every day I am on the phone talking to the White House, \ntalking to Health and Human Services, the Office of Management and \nBudget, and I don't speak on the floor of the Senate today to point the \nfinger, because I believe that in the next few days--the sooner the \nbetter--the White House will release this money.\n  Last year, I went to the President--other Senators joined: Senator \nKennedy, Senator Jeffords, and others--and just made the request face \nto face. I said, ``Mr. President, I don't want people to go cold in my \nState.''\n  This is not an exaggeration. I am sure that this money will be \nreleased, but today on the floor of the Senate, my appeal to the White \nHouse is: Please, make the decision. Please, make the decision today. \nPlease release the funding. Time is not neutral. Time is not on our \nside. It doesn't do any good to get the funding in April. We need this \nassistance for vulnerable citizens in our cold-weather States, and we \nneed it now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I intend to speak to the Senate about \nthis same subject that my friend, Senator Wellstone, spoke to. I think \nall of us have understood his strong leadership on this issue a year \nago or 2 years ago and before he was elected. Now he is again battling \naway on the same issue with the same powerful voice, and I join in \nexpressing strong appreciation for all of his leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S702-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S702-S703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IDEA\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, on the issue others have spoken to, I \nwant to add my strong voice in hope and anticipation of the President's \nrelease of these emergency LIHEAP funds to help the families in the \nNortheast and Midwest. I think all of us have understood the \nextraordinary hardships and loss of lives that are affecting people in \nthe Midwest, and people are hurting in my part of the country, in the \nNortheast, as well, with the soaring heating bills this winter.\n  The reduced benefit levels and the skyrocketing prices of home \nheating oil have been a double whammy for the 5 million low-income \nfamilies nationwide who receive LIHEAP assistance.\n  Federal funding for LIHEAP is already near an all-time low--listen to \nthis, Mr. President--down from $2.1 billion in 1985 to $1 billion \ntoday. In Massachusetts, Federal fuel aid has declined from $87 million \nto $41 million over that same period, about half of the resources in \ndollars. When you measure it out in terms of inflation, it is even less \nthan that. When we see what has happened to the cost of home heating \noil, we will see that people are in dire straits.\n  Local fuel assistance directors have been successful in past years in \nstretching the limited LIHEAP funds to serve as many needy families as \npossible. This winter, however, low stocks have sent heating oil prices \nthrough the roof, causing excessive hardships to LIHEAP recipients \nacross the Nation.\n  According to the Massachusetts Division of Energy Resources, the cost \nof home heating oil has risen 20 percent, and, in some communities, \nconsiderably higher, from some 95 cents a gallon in December 1995, to \nover $1.15 today. Despite the oil companies' efforts to bring their \ninventories to last year's levels, heating oil prices still remain high \nbecause of increased world demand.\n  This rise in heating oil prices has imposed a heavy burden on low-\nincome families, many of whom must devote a significant portion of \ntheir limited resources to paying their energy bills.\n  Who are these families, Mr. President? Forty-three percent of the \nrecipients for the LIHEAP program are elderly or disabled citizens. \nThey spend an average of 19 percent of their income to keep their homes \nwarm in the winter, whereas middle-income families devote 4 percent.\n  That is who we are talking about: elderly people, the neediest people \nwho are living and affected by this colder climate, are spending way \nout of proportion of their income in order to just remain warm.\n\n  The AFDC recipients spend as much as 25 percent of their income for \nhome heating. At the same time, these families are hard pressed and \nstruggle to pay their bills for food, rent, and health care.\n  A decade ago, LIHEAP assistance could sustain a low-income family \nthrough an entire winter, purchasing as much as 750 gallons of heating \noil. Today, the higher cost of heating oil and the lower benefit levels \nwill only purchase a third of that amount. Some 10 years ago, there was \nthe ability to address this issue for the neediest families for the \nwinter and now a third of the winter, even with these resources that \nwould be available.\n  Many local fuel assistance directors are already planning for the \nworst. According to Jim Murphy, whose TRI-CAP Community Action Program \nserves 1,500 clients in Malden, MA, over 40 percent will be without any \nheating assistance at the end of next week unless emergency funds are \nprovided.\n  Other communities in Massachusetts are facing a similar crisis. In \nBoston, as many as 2,000 families, out of 13,000 served by LIHEAP, have \nrun out of heating oil. An additional 4,500 households will be at risk \nin the next few weeks. We are talking the next 2 to 3 weeks.\n  In economically distressed towns like Gloucester, many working \nfamilies involved in the fishing industry have already exhausted their \nannual benefits. According to Eliott Jacobson, chairman of the New \nEngland Energy Directors Association, charities are being tapped for \nadditional assistance 2 months ahead of schedule, taxing their limited \nresources to serve the community.\n  Clearly, without an immediate release of emergency funds, little \nrelief is in site for these families. If another cold spell strikes, \neven more families will be without protection.\n  As we mentioned, 49 Senators wrote to the President last week \nrequesting the release of the emergency LIHEAP funds before more cold \nweather grips the country. This year, $420 million in emergency funds \ncould be made available at the President's discretion. The letter sent \nto the President Thursday requested $300 million of that amount. I hope \nall of my colleagues will support this necessary action and will \nsupport action by the President to respond to these very important and \ncritical needs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S703-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S703-S704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE PRESIDENT'S EDUCATION BUDGET\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on another item, I want to draw the \nattention of the Senate to President Clinton's announcement today for \nmaking education a top priority in his balanced budget plan. The \nPresident has announced the proposal and recognizes the importance of \ninvesting in education as the cornerstone of a stronger future for the \nNation.\n  In the coming years, a college education will be more important than \never. We know that by the year 2005, 60 percent of all of the new jobs \nwill require not only a high school education, but also skills in the \nutilization of computers. So the President's program is focused on a \nnumber of priority areas. I will introduce at the end of my statement a \nbrief summary of those items, but I would like to just mention some of \nthose which I think are most important.\n  First of all, to try and assure working families in this country that \nnot only high school will be available, but really the 13th and 14th \ngrades, the first 2 years of college, would be available as well. That \nis being done in a number of ways:\n  First, with a $10,000 deduction for the payments of tuition that will \nbe available to working families and middle-income families, what they \ncall the Hope Tax Credit, which will be a $1,500 credit for the sons \nand daughters who are going to college.\n  This would amount to the payment in full of tuition for 67 percent of \nall the community colleges in the country; and then an expansion of the \nPell grants by some $300 to a maximum of $3,000 for those individuals \nwho are eligible for Pell grants. That is a very important and \nsignificant commitment. That will mean about 130,000 more students \nacross this country will be able to take advantage of the Pell grants.\n  Then there are the changes in the Pell grant provisions that will be \nprimarily targeted upon older students, those who have been out in the \nwork force and are coming back, those who are 24 or 25 years old or \nolder. I do not know whether the distinguished Chair has had the kind \nof opportunity I have had to visit some of the community colleges in \nhis own State as I have in Massachusetts. We find changes which are \ntaking place where the makeup of the student body is considerably \nolder.\n  Changes in the Pell language are going to make available 218,000 \nadditional slots for those individuals who are returning to college to \nupgrade their skills, which is very important.\n  We also have a strong commitment in the areas of literacy. We will \nsee an expansion of the Work-Study Program, which provides important \nopportunities for students to help work their way through college. It \nis an absolutely vital link to permit students to match together what \nthey are able to earn in the summertime by working, with what they earn \nworking under the\n\n[[Page S704]]\n\nWork-Study Programs. There is a strong commitment to fulfill the \nPresident's commitment to try to make sure that every third grader is \nable to read by the year 2000. It is an important program that really \nbuilds upon the successful programs of the past. We will have more of a \nchance to review those in the Labor and Human Resources Committee later \nin the session.\n  We also see the willingness to try to help and assist those \ncommunities where a third of all of the high school students are going \nto school in dilapidated buildings. The Educational Facilities \nImprovement Act is a program that was developed by Senator Carol \nMoseley-Braun and has been a very creative program which will be \naddressed in the President's program.\n  Finally, the President makes a strong commitment in the area of \ntechnology, about $2 billion over the next 5 years, to try to make sure \nthat we are going to have technology--hardware and software--and, most \nimportantly, trained teachers that will be able to use technology to \nhelp students learn more.\n  A number of States, including my own State of Massachusetts, are now \ninvolved in what we call the Net Day Program--there are 12 other States \ninvolved in it--where we have been able to bring the Software Council, \nthe leaders of business in software, the Telecommunications Council, \nwhich represents the best in terms of telecommunications, the unions, \nworking all together in order to provide wiring and also computers to \nthe classrooms and schools of Massachusetts.\n  We were 48th out of 50 at the start of this whole effort; and we are \nnow, I believe, leading all the States in the number of classrooms that \nwe have already wired for the Internet with the help of this voluntary \nprogram which is very successful. More than 600 schools have now been \nadequately wired. We intend, within the next 15 months, to have the \napproximately 2,700 schools in Massachusetts achieve that.\n  We have benchmarks to be able to assess where we are. The next \nbenchmark will be in April of this year. But nonetheless, this kind of \ncommitment by the administration to technology and teacher training is \nenormously important.\n  It is our understanding that the new education programs and the \nstrong commitment to education is paid for in the President's balanced \nbudget. We will see the details of the President's budget in the next \n10 days. But today we commend his strong commitment to education.\n  We are looking forward to working in our committee, the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee, under the chairmanship of Senator Jeffords, \nwho has had a long and distinguished career of bipartisan leadership in \neducation, to maintain the Nation's commitment to strengthen academic \nachievement and accomplishment. We should continue to support local \nschool reform efforts and to help provide seed money to communities to \nhelp bring technology into their schools--and to help ensure that \ntechnology is available to schools in all parts of the country. In \naddition, we will continue to make college more accessible and \naffordable for all students.\n  We have every expectation that colleges and universities will join us \nin this partnership to increase accessibility and affordability and \nthat they will not respond by raising tuition. We will work with them \nover the course of this Congress to ensure that this happens.\n  To reiterate, I commend President Clinton for making education a top \npriority in his balanced budget plan. The President's proposal \nrecognizes the importance of investing in education as the cornerstone \nof a stronger future for the Nation.\n  In the coming years, a college education will be more important than \never. By 2005, 60 percent of all jobs created will require education \nbeyond high school. A college graduate earns almost twice what a high \nschool graduate earns, and almost three times what a high school \ndropout earns.\n  But too often, college is priced out of reach for many families. From \n1980 to 1990, the cost of college rose by 126 percent, while family \nincome increased by only 73 percent.\n  To meet the rising cost of college, students and their families are \ngoing deeper and deeper into debt. In the 1990's, students have \nborrowed more in student loans than in the three preceding decades \ncombined. In 1996 alone, students borrowed $30 billion--a 65-percent \nincrease since 1993. Since 1988, borrowing in the Federal student loan \nprogram has more than doubled.\n  The President's proposal recognizes that making college more \naccessible and affordable is a top priority for the Nation. His \nproposal increases funding for higher education, provides tax cuts for \neducation, and cuts student loan fees.\n  Under the proposal, funding for higher education will increase by 20 \npercent by 2002, including a $1.6 billion increase in Pell grants. The \nPell grant maximum will increase by $300 in the first year to $3,000, \nto give 130,000 low-income students greater access to college. With \nreforms in eligibility rules, the proposal will also help over 200,000 \nadults obtain the extra education and training they need to compete in \nthe modern workplace.\n  The proposal targets tax cuts for education to help students and \nworking families. Students with incomes below $70,000 would benefit \nfrom the $1,500 Hope Tax Credit, which makes 2 years of community \ncollege affordable.\n  All families with incomes below $100,000 may take advantage of a \n$10,000 tuition tax deduction. The President's budget also provides for \npenalty free withdrawals from IRA's to pay for education expenses. \nStudent loan fees will be cut in half, saving students $2.6 billion \nover the budget period. The College Work-Study Program will be expanded \nto help up to 1 million students gain work experience while they earn \nmoney for college.\n  In the area of elementary and secondary education, the President's \nproposal provides significant support for school reform.\n  The Information Age has arrived, yet millions of children attend \nschool in conditions inadequate to modern needs. By the year 2000, 60 \npercent of new jobs will require skills possessed by only 22 percent of \nthe young people entering the labor market. Already, more than half of \nhigh-wage jobs require the use of network computers. Jobs that require \ncomputers pay 15 percent more, on average, than those that do not.\n  Schools across the country are struggling to repair decrepit \nfacilities, let alone develop modern classrooms. Fourteen million \nchildren in a third of the Nation's schools are learning in substandard \nclassrooms. Yet enrollments are at an all-time high of 52 million \nstudents and are continuing to rise.\n  We must also do more to help children learn to read--40 percent of \nall children now read below their grade level. Higher standards are \nclearly needed to encourage reading and other basic academic skills.\n  The President's proposal responds to these needs by investing almost \n$2 billion in improved education technology over the budget period--a \n$252 million increase in fiscal year 1998 alone.\n  The President's plan will also invest $2.45 billion over the budget \nperiod in the America Reads Challenge, to help children read well by \nthe third grade. It invests $5 billion to improve school facilities. \nFunding for Goals 2000 will increase to help children meet higher \nacademic standards. Funding for charter schools will increase. The \ntitle I program and the Eisenhower Teacher Training Program will \nreceive increases to give students the extra help they need to improve \ntheir skills.\n  President Clinton's plan is effective and comprehensive. It sets the \nright priority for education, and the right priority for the Nation's \nfuture. President Clinton has proved once again, that he truly is the \neducation President, and I look forward to working with all Members of \nCongress to achieve these essential goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S703-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S704-S709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONTROLLING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND PROTECTING JOBS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last week I introduced a bill to control \nillegal immigration and protect U.S. jobs. I would like to take a few \nminutes to expand on that bill.\n  Last year, Congress passed landmark immigration reform legislation \nintended to curb illegal immigration.\n  But that Republican legislation addressed only half of the illegal \nimmigration problem. Republicans did not get the job done. So today, \nwith the support of our Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, I introduce \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S705]]\n\nto address the unfinished business of controlling illegal immigration.\n  Immigration experts, policy think tanks, and blue-ribbon commissions \nover the past two decades all agree that effective enforcement against \nillegal immigration requires two steps.\n  We must stop people from crossing our borders illegally. But, we must \nalso combine our border enforcement efforts with effective workplace \nenforcement to deter employers who hire illegal workers.\n  The Clinton administration should be commended for their aggressive \nenforcement strategy at the border. By the end of this year, the \nClinton administration plans to have increased the Border Patrol from \nunder 4,000 agents in 1993 to 6,859 agents--a 73-percent increase. And \nlast year's immigration bill reenforced this increase by authorizing an \nadditional 1,000 Border Patrol agents for each of the next 3 years.\n  In addition, last year's immigration bill contained new, stiff \npenalties against the crime syndicates that smuggle illegal immigrant \nworkers into the United States.\n  But Republicans neglected the second key element of a successful \nimmigration enforcement strategy, which is workplace enforcement to \ndeny jobs to illegal immigrant workers. There is one reason, and one \nreason only, that illegal immigrants come to America: to find jobs. \nLast year's Republican immigration bill did almost nothing to address \nthis problem. We will never reduce illegal immigration significantly \nuntil we shut off the job magnet that draws illegal immigrants to this \ncountry.\n  That was the conclusion of the Select Commission on Immigration and \nRefugee Policy in 1981, the so-called Hesburgh Commission. And it was \nthe conclusion of the Jordan Commission in 1994. The Jordan Commission \nstated, ``Reducing the employment magnet is the linchpin of a \ncomprehensive strategy to reduce illegal immigration.''\n  Consider the following fact. The Immigration and Naturalization \nService says that at least 40 percent, and possibly half, of the \nillegal immigrant population in the United States actually entered the \ncountry legally, but stayed on and worked illegally after their visas \nexpired. They came here originally as tourists or students, but \noverstayed their visas and are now illegally taking American jobs.\n  No amount of border enforcement will stop this major source of \nillegal immigrant workers. They arrive at our airports and at our \nborders with genuine passports and visas. There is no way to know that \ntheir real plans are to stay and work illegally.\n  The only way to deter this kind of illegal immigration is to deny \njobs at the workplace. Rather than just beefing up our Border Patrol, \nwe must also increase the capacity of the Immigration Service and the \nDepartment of Labor to protect American jobs by finding illegal \nimmigrants in the workplace and prosecuting unscrupulous employers who \nhire and abuse them.\n  In 1986, Congress made it illegal for employers to hire illegal \nimmigrant workers. But today it is far too easy for these workers to \npose as legal immigrant workers or even U.S. citizens by using false \ndocuments.\n  We must also find new and better ways of assisting employers to \ndetermine who can and who cannot work in the United States. Under the \ncurrent failed system, employers often cannot distinguish a real green \ncard and makes someone eligible to work from a good fake.\n\n  Last year, the Senate adopted a proposal that Senator Simpson and I \ndeveloped that contained aggressive pilot programs to test new and \nbetter ways of addressing this problem. Upon the completion of these \nprograms, the President was required to submit to Congress a \ncomprehensive plan that would enable employers to know with greater \ncertainty whom they can and cannot hire. Without such a plan, illegal \nimmigrants will continue to take American jobs from working families by \nthe hundreds of thousands each year.\n  But Republicans in Congress, under pressure from lobbyists \nrepresenting the employers, met in secret last summer and dropped this \nvital provision from the bill. They put in its place a weak requirement \nfor only a single pilot program. And they stripped the bill of the \nrequirement that the President present to Congress for its approval a \ncomprehensive plan for denying jobs to illegal immigrant workers. \nInstead of standing up for working families and protecting their jobs, \nthey chose to coddle unscrupulous employers who hire and abuse illegal \nimmigrants to make a buck.\n  Our Democratic message to working families today is that we will not \ntolerate the loss of hundreds of thousands of your jobs each year. Last \nyear's Republican immigration bill simply sets adrift the urgently \nneeded workplace enforcement under our immigration laws to protect \nthese jobs. Democrats say that working families need to be assured that \ntheir jobs will be protected under our immigration laws.\n  The bill I introduce today:\n  Provides the workplace enforcement we need to protect U.S. jobs. It \nincreases the number of Department of Labor Wage and Hour \ninvestigators. These investigators will target employers who hire \nillegal immigrants to evade labor standards. And it provides funding \nfor additional INS personnel to enforce our immigration laws in the \nworkplace.\n  It increases penalties for employers who hire illegal workers. And it \nallows judges to double an employers penalties if they have violated \nboth immigration and labor laws.\n  It mandates the President to fix the broken employment verification \nsystem. Currently employers have an obligation to verify whether those \nthey hire are authorized to work in the United States. But, the \nverification system in place now does not work. My bill requires the \nPresident to propose a plan to Congress within 3 years for an improved \nemployment verification system.\n  It prevents employers from discriminating against American and legal \nimmigrant workers by making some workers go through more hoops to get a \njob than others, just because they may look or sound foreign.\n  Finally, my bill provides needed protections for battered immigrants. \nMany battered immigrants are afraid to seek protection from their \nabusers because they fear they will be deported or cannot find work to \nsupport their children. This bill removes the hurdles for battered \nimmigrants, and protects their ability to qualify for green cards and \njobs.\n  Last year's illegal immigration bill addressed only half the problem. \nThe bill I introduce today will complete the picture and protect jobs \nfor working families. And I look forward to working with our new \nImmigration Subcommittee chairman, Senator Abraham, and the Republican \nleadership to see early enactment of this important measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be included at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 103\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, there are those moments as we navigate \nthrough life's journey in which our path crosses with people of genuine \ncharacter and compassion. When we come about one of these persons, it \nis as if a window is raised allowing the spring breeze to enter our \nvery soul. On these rare occasions, our spirit is lifted causing us to \nbelieve anew in the goodness of God and the magic of his gift to \nmankind. Mr. Albert Colmer Weeks of Pascagoula, MS, is one of these \nrare people.\n  Known as ``Skeeter'' to his friends--who are many--his life is a \ntestament of service, love, and dedication to his family and community. \nWhile Skeeter counts Pascagoula as his home, he was born in Ponchatula, \nLA, and moved at the age of 3 to Perkinston, MS, where his father \nserved as a coach, athletic director, and later vice president and dean \nof men at Perkinston Junior College. After completing high school in \nPerkinston in 1944, Skeeter was appointed a page in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives by his uncle and former Congressman, Hon. Bill Colmer.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I also worked for Representative \nColmer as his administrative assistant for 4 years. The fateful year in \nwhich I crossed paths with Skeeter in a large and substantive way was \n1968. By that time, Skeeter had been working for Ingalls Shipbuilding \nfor 9 years as director of public relations.\n  As director of public relations at Ingalls Shipbuilding, Skeeter was \nthe one individual most responsible for planning, directing, and \ncoordinating the launching, christening, and commissioning of hundreds \nof ships for the United States Navy. Skeeter is a big part of the \nreason Ingalls is today known as America's Shipyard. His \nprofessionalism, attention to detail, and customer oriented service \nethic has endeared him to many of our nation's political leaders--from \nPresident's to Cabinet Secretaries to Secretaries of the Navy--over the \nspan of almost 40 years.\n  On January 31, 1997, Skeeter will be retiring from Ingalls \nShipbuilding. Behind he will leave a legacy of 38 years in service to \nIngalls, the city of Pascagoula, Jackson County, the State of \nMississippi, and indeed, the country as a whole. Skeeter is a veteran \nof the United States Navy, a 1951 graduate of Mississippi State \nUniversity, and a man of honor.\n  To his wife, Janet, and his children Leah and Alice, I say thank you. \nWe have all borrowed Skeeter's time and talent for years, a gift he has \nfreely given us. Beginning Saturday, February 1, 1997, you have him all \nto yourself. It is your gain, and with this gain we give you our \ngratitude and envy.\n  As Skeeter turns the page and begins this new chapter in his life, I \nam reminded of a verse penned by Robert Louis Stevenson:\n\n       So long as we love we serve; so long as we are loved by \n     others, I would almost say we are indispensable; and no man \n     is useless while he has a friend.\n\n  In celebration of this special event, I am proud to declare to the \nU.S. Senate, Albert Colmer Weeks is my friend. Enjoy your retirement, \nSkeeter. You have richly earned it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S709-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S709-S712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTES TO SENATOR PAUL E. TSONGAS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last Thursday, January 23, many of us in \nthe Senate and House of Representatives attended the funeral service in \nLowell, MA, for our outstanding former colleague in the Senate, Paul E. \nTsongas, who died on January 18. The service was extremely moving, and \nthe eloquent eulogies by his friends and his three daughters were \npowerful tributes to Paul's extraordinary life and career. I believe \nthat these tributes will be of interest to all of us in Congress, and I \nask unanimous consent that they may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tributes were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Funeral Service for Paul E. Tsongas, Transfiguration Greek Orthodox \n                  Church, Lowell, MA, January 23, 1997\n\n\n               eulogy by former senator warren b. rudman\n\n       Niki, Ashley, Katina, and Molly, family of Paul Tsongas, \n     former colleagues from the Congress, distinguished guests, \n     Gov. Wald, friends: I appreciate this opportunity to be with \n     you today, to tell you all how proud I am to have called Paul \n     Tsongas my friend. How fortunate I am to have called him a \n     friend, a colleague, and a man who became a very large part \n     of my life. To celebrate his life and to recognize the \n     tremendous purpose and courage with which he lived is why we \n     gather here today. Paul as we all know was a soft-spoken man, \n     of tremendous charm, and wonderful wit. He was one of the \n     most decent, compassionate human beings you would ever want \n     to meet. So when people talk about him, the words \n     ``tenacious'' or ``determined'' have not often been the first \n     that I used to describe him. But I am here to attest that I \n     have never--not in the foxholes of Korea, not in the halls of \n     Congress--never met a more determined, or more courageous man \n     than Paul Tsongas. Another son of this Commonwealth, \n     President John F. Kennedy, concluded his Pulitzer Prize-\n     winning book, ``Profiles in Courage,'' with this marvelous \n     statement, which applies to our friend, Paul, and I want to \n     share it with you this morning: ``Without belittling the \n     courage with which men have died, we should not forget those \n     acts of courage, with which men have lived. The courage of \n     life is often a less dramatic spectacle than the courage of \n     the final moment, but it is no less a magnificent mixture of \n     triumph and tragedy. A man does what he must, in spite of \n     personal consequences; in spite of obstacles, and dangers, \n     and pressures.'' And that is the basis of Paul--human \n     morality. In whatever arena of life one may mast the \n     challenges of courage, whatever may be the sacrifices he \n     faces, each man must decide for himself the course he will \n     follow. The stories of past courage can define that \n     ingredient, they can teach, they can offer hope, they can \n     provide inspiration, but they cannot supply courage itself. \n     For this, each man--and I would add parenthetically--each \n     woman, must look into his own soul. Paul Tsongas met the \n     challenges of courage, solidly, and squarely. And he asked us \n     to do the same. He asked that we each look into our soul, and \n     find the best within ourselves. To find our courage, and to \n     help us do so, he led us by example. Time and time again fate \n     threw enormous obstacles and road blocks in his path, but \n     each time, Paul looked within his soul and responded with \n     courage, determination, and driving purpose. I often marveled \n     at Paul's resolution and strength as we traveled this country \n     for the last four years. I wondered what made him persevere. \n     After all, having faced the condition that would've caused \n     most men to lead a more guarded existence, Paul ran for \n     president. But after I came to know him better, I have \n     realized what motivated him. In short, Paul has an intense, \n     profound, and enduring love for his family. Ashley, Katina, \n     and Molly, I'm here today not only to mourn your loss and to \n     celebrate your dad's life, but to affirm that which you \n     already know, you were his inspiration and his motivation. It \n     was out of love for you that your father found the courage to \n     persevere, and to succeed. He wanted the best for your; for \n     your generation. And he was willing to fight and to overcome \n     great hurdles so you too might have the chance to achieve \n     your dreams. Paul looked for the best in people. He asked us \n     to put aside petty differences, and shun the path of least \n     resistance. He asked that we, as a generation, pay our own \n     bills. He implored our government's fiscal irresponsibility, \n     because Paul Tsongas--like Thomas Jefferson--felt it was \n     immoral, and I heard him use that word so often, immoral, for \n     one generation to bind another, because it refused to live \n     within its means. We will leave here today, saddened by his \n     passing, inspired by his life, enriched by his friendship. We \n     truly give thanks to the Almighty for this marvelous life.\n\n\n                       eulogy by brian j. martin\n\n       My family. My city.\n       Those were the two things that Paul Tsongas cared about \n     most in the world.\n       That's probably not news to anyone here, but it is \n     important to remind ourselves of that fact, because it is the \n     essence of the man we are remembering here this morning.\n       It is not a complicated concept, In fact, it is beautiful \n     in its simplicity. Many of us\n\n[[Page S710]]\n\n     share this philosophy, but few of us live it as well as he \n     did.\n       His family. His city.\n       His family grieves today, but they also know they have been \n     blessed to have had a husband, a father, a brother, an uncle \n     and son-in-law like Paul.\n       I would like to say to Nikki: You are one of the strongest \n     women I've ever known. You have my utmost admiration and \n     respect.\n       You and Paul lived the greatest love story I could imagine. \n     No book, no movie could tell a better one.\n       I would like to say to Ashley, Katina and Molly: You \n     probably think the pain you feel today will never go away, \n     but trust me, it will. In its place you will have wonderful \n     memories of all the happy times you spent with your father. \n     They will bring you great comfort, and inspire you every day \n     of your life.\n       His family, his city.\n       Lowell is my city, too, and I have to admit I was worried \n     for it when I heard Paul had died.\n       What are we going to do without Paul?\n       Then it hit me.\n       Paul's greatest gift to Lowell was not the National Park, \n     the Lowell Plan, the Boott Mills, the arena or the Spinners.\n       It wasn't bricks or mortar, an organization or even a \n     baseball or a hockey team.\n       It wasn't his influence or his ability to bring people \n     together to make things happen.\n       Nor was it the great credit and recognition he brought to \n     the city of Lowell through his public service in Washington.\n       Although I must say, he did make us proud to be from \n     Lowell.\n       At one time, when people asked me where I was from, I'd \n     say, ``Boston,'' or ``Massachusetts.''\n       Now I proudly say, without hesitation, ``I'm from Lowell.'' \n     And when they ask me, ``Where's that?'', I tell them, ``Next \n     to Dracut.''\n       Paul's greatest gift to his family, to his city, and to all \n     of us was himself.\n       He inspired us.\n       He gave us a shinning example of how to live our lives to \n     the fullest, and to make a difference.\n       He taught us what was truly important in life . . . what \n     our priorities should be. Nobody knew how to stop and smell \n     the roses better than Paul Tsongas.\n       He also showed us how to be brave.\n       His ability to deal with adversity was truly amazing. He \n     taught us never, ever to give up.\n       Paul has motivated me, he has inspired me, and most \n     importantly, prepared me to carry on his vision for Lowell. I \n     can't wait to get started.\n       And I'm not the only one who feels this way. Because of \n     Paul Tsongas, there are many others in this city who want to \n     continue his work, to make Lowell one of the best cities in \n     the country.\n       Some people say we'll never see his like again. But people \n     probably said the same thing when Franklin Roosevelt or John \n     Kennedy died.\n       It is true that there will never be another Paul Tsongas, \n     but there's always someone to pick up the torch and carry on.\n       ``We all will die someday,'' Paul wrote. ``And on the next \n     day, the sun will still be shinning somewhere, the rain will \n     still be falling somewhere, and the moon and stars will still \n     be in their place. The earth is timeless, not those who \n     inhabit it. . . .\n       ``And eventually, the next generation will have its term at \n     the helm.''\n       Perhaps someone right here in this church will someday \n     become a city councilor, a congressman, a senator, or even \n     president, because he or she was inspired by Paul Tsongas.\n       Today, when I look around the city, I don't despair or \n     worry. I think of Paul fondly when I see things he has done \n     to make Lowell better . . . and then I look to see what I can \n     do to make it better still.\n       So Paul, don't worry about a thing. We'll pick up the ball \n     . . . we'll finish the game.\n       We'll fight hard, and we'll win. Just like you.\n       And you know, I've got a funny feeling that you knew all \n     along that we would.\n       I'll miss you, old friend.\n       I love you . . . and I thank you.\n\n\n                      eulogy by dr. tak takvorian\n\n       There are moments . . . there are moments when the future \n     is open. There are moments when all the preparations in life: \n     the education, the retirement plans, the hopes and the dreams \n     are laid aside, and something happens that is fundamentally \n     unplanned; something happens that we cannot control, and we \n     are left with no notion of what comes next.\n       A frightening moment. And yet this moment represents \n     something that is a fundamental gift, an amazing thing, a \n     positive moment, a creative moment, a moment when we have no \n     choice, but a moment when the future is open to us.\n       It is a moment when not our plans, but maybe some far \n     deeper sense of who we are can take control, sustain us and \n     make the future happen.\n       At such a moment, success is measured not by health, but by \n     the depth of our very own soul and conviction, by how deeply \n     we laugh and how deeply we hurt and by confronting the crux \n     of who we are.\n       That moment has come and gone for Paul Tsongas, and in it \n     we have witnessed his success and we see our own \n     vulnerability. It seems as though he would always be here, \n     and yet how more precious is the fleeting gift. None of us \n     wants it to happen this way--not cancer and not in our youth. \n     Maybe a heart attack, if it has to be, but not the big C. It \n     is unnerving how much we presume it cannot happen to us.\n       And yet Paul met that moment--his moment--his defining \n     moment--with courage, with determination, with good humor and \n     a smile--always that self-effacing, Mona Lisa grin, \n     infectious in its breadth and optimism, contagious in its \n     enthusiasm and conviction.\n       I remember the first time we met; my job was to describe \n     radical new treatment for a failing situation. I found him \n     hiding in the waiting area under a pile of newspapers--which \n     was to become his familiar insignia.\n       In my nervousness in the presence of such a great man, I \n     was wordy in my speech. He listened intently, but it was \n     Nicki who asked the questions. With an intensity rooted in \n     conviction he simply said, ``Let's do it.'' No debate. No \n     challenge. No discussion. Just a commitment and resolve to \n     battle on.\n       He did set down the rules, though. In exchange for being \n     the model patient, he wanted an equal partnership, an honest \n     relationship, the best that medicine could offer, and nothing \n     less than a total commitment from me, including a promise to \n     laugh at his witty jokes!\n       I knew then and there that I was in the presence of a one-\n     of-a-kind, special guy, and I dug in my heels and braced \n     myself for the ride of a lifetime, only now ended. We bonded \n     then and there, and I joined the community of friends who \n     benefited from his aura.\n       I want to tell you a story about one of my heroes of all \n     times. He happens to be Jeremiah, but he could have been Paul \n     Tsongas. One day he carried a clay pottery flask into a \n     courtyard, explaining to all who had gathered that they were \n     doing wrong in the sight of God. He then smashed the pottery \n     to the ground to demonstrate what God was going to do to \n     them. The priests had him arrested, beaten and put into the \n     stocks overnight.\n       And in the morning they took him out of the pillory, and he \n     should have gone home, and he should have licked his wounds, \n     and he should have been quiet. But not my Jeremiah. He turned \n     on them, hurling further insults, and when questioned why he \n     was inviting more punishment, Jeremiah cried out: There is a \n     fire shut up in my bones, that is so powerful that I am weary \n     from trying to hold it in. There is a fire shut up in my \n     bones, that is so powerful that I am weary from trying to \n     hold it in.\n       A fire shut up in his bones. Something to live for that was \n     more important than anything else in the world. An authentic \n     center. A core. A fire in the bones that will make you fully \n     alive in a way that you have never been and you will never be \n     any other way.\n       Paul Tsongas was my Jeremiah. Paul Tsongas had an authentic \n     core and knew that fire in his bones. He had a passion and \n     courage for life that was more powerful, more important than \n     anything else in the world and we were all witness to that. \n     Although I knew him personally but 14 brief years, I am the \n     richer for it because I came to know the essence of the man. \n     I came to know the courage of the man combating his cancer \n     and confronting his own mortality.\n       I came to know the courage of the man who signed onto \n     experimental and dangerous therapy when the bounds of \n     conventional medicine had failed. The courage of the man \n     whose initial hopes for cure were dashed, repeatedly, only to \n     fight the battle again and again and again. The courage of \n     the man who often said he would re-choose a life with cancer \n     rather than forego the lessons of these last fourteen years.\n       In the last years of his life, rather than dying day by \n     day, predictably he chose to live day by day. In his \n     proximity to death for many a year, he never lost sight of \n     his own priorities, and they encompassed a far more expansive \n     view of life than most of us could ever have, in which even \n     the trivial took on importance. In his proximity to death, he \n     remained selfless and he never stopped giving.\n       And rather than retreat behind the mask of self-pity and \n     involution he reached out with that extended warm handshake, \n     always volunteered, which was empowering, creating a mutual \n     healing bond, charged and energized in its commonality.\n       His illness gave him an entitlement to speak out freely on \n     all issues, without political encumbrance. It was the \n     obligation of his survival, and he defended it with a moral \n     imperative. His was a ``return to a journey of purpose''. But \n     to cancer patients everywhere it had an even more universal \n     message.\n       In fact, in a life rich with accomplishments, his most \n     unique contribution, which humbly even he did not fully \n     realize, may have been his role as consummate messenger to \n     countless others living with cancer. He was their model for \n     cancer survivorship.\n       He was a model of courage, empowering them to fight their \n     own malignancies and to find that strength to do so within \n     themselves; a model even to me, his doctor, when I broke my \n     neck in the surf and needed guidance and encouragement to \n     move on. He showed them how far one could go and that they \n     too, even in the shadow of cancer, could go for their dreams \n     and never abandon their beliefs. Win or lose, no dream is too \n     large not to be pursued at any risk, compared to the risk of \n     life itself.\n       He did not compose his life or construct his life or \n     carefully plan or reason it out or discipline it or calculate \n     how to advance within it--he just tried to live it. He just \n     tried to find that authentic center, that core of who he was \n     and to live it for all it was worth, no matter what the \n     consequences.\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\n       The man seemed bigger than life due to the enormity of his \n     ideas and accomplishments, but what remains are the memories \n     of the essence of the man. Cancer did not kill his spirit, \n     his humor, his shy warmth, and these are the gifts that we \n     will have forever. It was his quiet, unforced, completely \n     natural, sincere love and joy of humankind that attracted us \n     all to him, and he never let us down. He loved people. He \n     loved children. He loved his family and friends. He loved \n     this town. He loved this country and what it might become. We \n     all felt safe in his intellect, loved in his heart and ample \n     in his company.\n       An authentic core. A fire in the bones that could not be \n     extinguished by cancer.\n       He never came to age and walk on safer ground and treasure \n     the memory of what he had accomplished, but therefore time \n     will never dim for him what others lose or never find or \n     never even seek. He possessed life with so much more, when \n     ill-health, and not the vision, deceived him.\n       In closing, let me quote from the poem Ulysses by Alfred \n     Lord Tennyson:\n\n     . . . Come, my friends,\n     'Tis not too late to seek a newer world,\n     Push off, and sitting well in order smite\n     The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds\n     To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\n     Of all the western stars, until I die.\n     It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;\n     It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,\n     And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.\n     Though much is taken, much abides; and though\n     We are not now that strength which in old days\n     Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;\n     One equal temper of heroic hearts,\n     Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will\n     To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\n\n       My belief is that our only hope is to have a lot more \n     heroes. A lot more heroes of mythic proportion, a whole lot \n     more men like Jeremiah, Ulysses and Paul Tsongas, who are \n     willing to live life fully and authentically. His life \n     challenges us to live life from the very depths of who we \n     are, with a love that grips at our guts, tugs at our hearts \n     and with a . . . was my patient, my friend, and my hero, Paul \n     Tsongas.\n       May God in His wisdom give us the strength in our similar \n     journeys and keep ever illuminated the inspiration that he \n     was for us.\n\n\n                       eulogy by f. michael kail\n\n       The very things that made Paul Tsongas different--unique--\n     as a politician made him special as a person. And that is \n     what I would like to share with you today. This is not meant \n     to be sad, Niki asked that it not be sad. And I don't think \n     Paul would mind if this made you secretly smile a little.\n       To begin with, there is what the press is fond of calling \n     the ``self-deprecating,'' or as one paper put it ``self-\n     depreciating'' humor. I remember a birthday party for Niki in \n     the mid-1980s. Paul looked great, but his hair was definitely \n     not all the way back from the chemotherapy. Niki was \n     beautiful, but had misplaced her contacts and was forced to \n     wear some old, very non-designer glasses. Towards the end of \n     the evening Paul rose, to propose a toast to Niki, whom he \n     asked to rise as well. He looked at her and then turned to \n     the guests, all of whom were waiting expectantly for some \n     memorable words. Paul did not disappoint. Gazing into Niki's \n     glasses and then rolling his eyes up to his bald head he \n     said, ``I am sure, seeing us standing before you tonight, you \n     can understand the true meaning of ``Love at first sight.''\n       Of course, there's the legendary directness and the \n     competitiveness. It showed up not only in the uphill \n     campaigns and the senior swimming meets, but everywhere. One \n     night we were at a particularly boring show and Paul \n     buttonholed me to talk in private. At the time we each had \n     two children. Without any preliminaries he asked, ``Are you \n     and Wendy going for three.'' I said, ``We've got the Jeep and \n     the Chevy and our oldest child is only nine, why do we need . \n     . .'' He cut me off, with a really withering look and said, \n     ``No, are you going for another kid.'' Without thinking, or \n     asking what business it was of his, I said ``Yeah, are you?'' \n     He shot back, without a moment's reflection, ``Sure.'' But \n     for that conversation there might never have been a Molly \n     Tsongas or a Katie Kail.\n       And then there is the extraordinary sense of timing, the \n     daring and the luck. I don't only mean in deciding to run as \n     a Democrat for a House seat in a district that had been \n     Republican for nearly a century or risking that same seat, \n     after it had become safe, to challenge the only African \n     American in the Senate, or seeing an opening when a sitting \n     President's poll numbers were in the stratosphere. I mean \n     even in board games. There was this Trivial Pursuit grudge \n     match between the families on New Year's Eve, 1984. Both \n     teams were on the verge of the winner's circle, but we were \n     up first, and victory was clearly in our grasp. Our question: \n     ``How many colored squares make up a Rubik's cube?'' Our son, \n     Tommy, who was 6 whispered 54; I ignored him, did some quick \n     calculations, and said 128. Tommy was right. Paul pulled the \n     card with the Tsongas question. I was hoping for ``Name Alex \n     Haley's third novel'' or ``Where was Sky King's ranch'' or \n     ``What emblem is in the center of the Pakistani flag?'' But, \n     no. I could not--and still cannot--believe the question he \n     had drawn: ``What is the address of the White House?''\n       When I think of these stories and others I have heard they \n     do make me think of Paul Tsongas and the lessons of his life: \n     Follow your instincts; Ask the tough questions; Listen to \n     your children; Take what you do seriously, but not yourself; \n     and And never give up.\n       Paul Tsongas was a one of a kind. And we will miss him more \n     than words can say.\n\n\n                         eulogy by dennis kanin\n\n       I first met Paul a quarter of a century ago at the \n     Middlesex County Reform Caucus. I was a delegate from \n     Cambridge and he was one of three candidates vying for two \n     slots on the reform ticket for County Commissioner. That was \n     the first time that I had the chance to vote for the man \n     whose campaigns I would manage, whose House and Senate \n     offices I would run, who would become my law partner and \n     dearest friend. I voted for the other guys. They were friends \n     of mine and I didn't know Paul. But I redeemed myself when \n     the race went to a second ballot. That was after I asked the \n     three of them who they were supporting for President that \n     year. My two friends hemmed and hawed and told me--\n     correctly--that one's personal choice for President had no \n     relationship to running a county. When I asked the stranger \n     from Lowell, he didn't bat an eye and answered matter-of-\n     factly ``John Lindsay''. Although I was no Lindsay fan (and I \n     suspect Paul was his only supporter in Massachusetts that \n     year), with those two words, Paul won my vote--and more.\n       It was a defining incident--a window into the personality \n     of Paul Tsongas. I was soon to discover that this was the \n     most centered and secure person I have even known--at peace \n     with who he was. Perhaps that's why he was so honest, \n     sometimes so painfully honest as we on his young staff used \n     to grumble. We failed to grasp that it was that politically \n     reckless candor--that refusal to evade when faced with tough \n     questions--that was Paul's hallmark and his greatest \n     political strength. Voters felt instinctively that even if \n     they didn't totally agree with him they could trust him--and \n     they were right.\n       Two years later, I had signed on to run Paul's longshot--\n     and I mean longshot--candidacy for Congress. I came up to \n     Lowell for a first strategy meeting the week Ashley was born \n     and she was all Paul wanted to talk about. A democratic state \n     committeeman from Lawrence was meeting with us and when Paul \n     said he had been in the birthing room with Niki as Ashley was \n     born, the committeeman said ``That must have been \n     disgusting''. I still remember Paul's reply ``Actually Jake, \n     it was the most beautiful experience of my life.'' Even then, \n     his family was his focus.\n       Although I had worked in many campaigns up till then--I was \n     in my late 20's--I had never met a politician quite like \n     Paul. When he made a decision, he did it quickly--some would \n     say impulsively--and was willing to take big risks. When he \n     ran for the Senate in 1978 he first considered the idea on \n     April 30th of that year and announced his candidacy 18 days \n     later. He was simply undaunted by the most formidable of \n     odds. So when he sat down on the couch in my office at Foley, \n     Hoag at the end of 1990 and said ``I have a crazy idea . . \n     .'' I knew I was in trouble. Those five words were the \n     starting signal for one of the most underfinanced and \n     improbable presidential campaigns in history. It seemed like \n     a crazy idea then. It doesn't now.\n       We all have our fears but Paul seemed to have so few. I \n     will never forget that terrifying night in 1983 when we \n     crossed the Allenby Bridge between Jordan and Israel, on \n     foot, alone, in pitch blackness--something no civilian had \n     ever done and lived to tell--because Paul didn't want to miss \n     a critical meeting with Prime Minister Begin in Jerusalem the \n     next morning. I still remember King Hussein waving us good \n     luck as we left his palace for the bridge and Rich Arenberg \n     and I trembling as we walked across in single file behind \n     Paul using him as a shield to protect us--his aides--against \n     sniper fire while he just chuckled at our timidity.\n       Paul was tough but he was also remarkably gentle and \n     caring. In our 25 year history together, I can't remember \n     when he truly lost his temper. I'm not counting when he \n     played softball or charades. And even in the hours of his \n     greatest adversity, he wanted to know how you were doing. A \n     few months ago I was suffering from a couple of ruptured \n     disks--not one of your major ailments--and Paul kept asking \n     how I was doing when he couldn't even get off the bed. But \n     that's how he was.\n       Paul saw the value in every situation, no matter how bad it \n     might seem on the surface. Two weeks ago yesterday when \n     we talked to him about the lack of success with the first \n     shunt procedure, he smiled and said ``What do you mean it \n     wasn't successful? I'm here aren't I?'' When an \n     interviewer asked him about his cancer back in 1984 Paul \n     said that if hadn't had it, he would never have come to \n     fully appreciate so much of what was staring him in the \n     face--the beauty all around us that we take for granted. \n     In reading his book Heading Home the other night, I found \n     this passage describing the most poignant lesson he drew \n     from his adversity. He wrote: ``After the children were in \n     bed, Niki and I would talk about the pleasure of being \n     together like this. We had experienced the power and the \n     glory, the excitement and glamour of national politics . . \n     . But in the next room asleep were what gave us true joy. \n     And we had each other . . . the cancer had\n\n[[Page S712]]\n\n     caused me to understand what truly made me happy and what \n     counted.''\n       I think it is important to remember that Paul had always \n     tried, even before he learned he had cancer, to balance \n     family and career. As it was, he rarely went on the usual \n     circuit of Washington cocktail parties and trade association \n     receptions because he wanted to be home with Niki, Ashley, \n     Katina, and Molly. We on his staff who had no kids or failed \n     to share his priorities found this maddening--and Paul knew \n     it and didn't care. But the cancer did crystallize his \n     feelings further and he found, as he put it, that ``the \n     family was where I fulfilled my human aspirations. The Senate \n     had become an obstacle to that.''\n       Paul found his happiness--real happiness--planting flowers \n     in Kittredge Park or being out on the boat at the Cape with \n     Niki and the kids or sitting around a Thanksgiving dinner \n     with his family and close friends or watching Ashley play \n     rugby or Katina at hockey or Molly dancing.\n       His values seemed old-fashioned to some but I don't think \n     Paul Tsongas ever felt emptiness from the day he married \n     Niki. A few weeks ago, someone at the hospital asked Paul how \n     he was doing and he replied ``fine . . . as long as Niki's \n     only three feet away''. While he was strong for others she \n     was his strength, whether it was campaigning for him around \n     the country or caring for him through their long and \n     courageous struggle together.\n       Paul told Carol Beattie, his nurse at Dana Faber that he \n     had accomplished what he wanted most his remarkable 13\\1/2\\ \n     years since he learned he had cancer--to see his daughters \n     grow up. I would add that they didn't just grow up; they grew \n     up to be people with the same kind of values and decency and \n     caring as Niki and Paul. That is quite a testament.\n       Senator Kennedy called Paul a profile in courage and he \n     surely was--a profile in both personal and political courage. \n     His presidential campaign epitomized both those qualities. \n     Paul had won 10 primaries and caucuses to Bill Clinton's 13 \n     when he decided to drop out. He knew that if stayed in, he \n     could deny Clinton the nomination and assure himself the role \n     of a kingmaker at the convention. But that was not the \n     purpose of his candidacy. Paul had run because he believed in \n     something. While he lost the Presidency, he had won something \n     that was for him far more profound. He had changed the debate \n     about the future of his country and about its ability to \n     confront the federal deficit. That, too, grew out of his \n     experience with cancer and his determination not just to know \n     his children but to secure their future and that of their \n     generation--what he called ``the obligation of my survival''. \n     It took courage to run in the first place, risking ridicule--\n     and it was there in the early days. It took courage and \n     integrity to insist that a candidacy of principle could not \n     compromise on principles. Now the issues he raised in 1992 \n     are at the center of America's public discourse. He lit the \n     way.\n       I have often thought that I didn't have living heroes but I \n     realize now that I was wrong. Paul was my hero. I wish I \n     could have told him that before he died. What I did tell him \n     was that I loved him and what a good friend he was but I know \n     that in that I am not alone. For so many others across this \n     city that he helped to rebuild, across this state that he \n     loved and served so well, across this land that he awakened \n     to a new reality, and across the generations to come whose \n     freedom from unsustainable debt will be his legacy; they have \n     lost a good friend as well.\n\n\n                        eulogy by ashley tsongas\n\n       Our father's love for us was fundamental to our lives. You \n     don't question the existence of the ground you walk on or the \n     air you breathe, and we never doubted the existence of our \n     father's love. Even in the middle of a four-hour car ride, \n     when the incessant sound of snapping gum and the muffled \n     screams of smaller, weaker children emanating from the back \n     seat had begun to wear on his nerves, and it became \n     abundantly clear that he didn't like us too much at tha \n     moment, it would never occur to us that we had been ejected \n     from our position at the center of his universe.\n       And then further down the road, when we'd exhausted \n     ourselves and drifted into sleepy silence as a Red Sox game \n     crackled on the radio, he'd reach back and touch each one of \n     us and we'd be reminded how much we loved him too.\n       I'm having trouble realizing he's gone. During the events \n     of the last couple of days I keep wondering at the absence of \n     a keynote speaker, expecting my dad to walk in at any moment. \n     It's hard to believe the man who offered to fax me a copy of \n     his less-than-impressive college transcript when I was \n     stressing about my grades is no longer going to offer me \n     academic solace. And at rugby, it won't be the same without \n     my dad in the sidelines armed with apple cider and blind \n     admiration.\n       And with the absence of my father, who treated me as a \n     person with legitimate ideas from as far back as I can \n     remember, I know that I wil now have to push myself to come \n     up with real answers instead of easy ones. But these things \n     and countless more were merely expressions of his love for \n     me. And though my dad's no longer here, his acts of love over \n     the last 22 years have created a kind of momentum that will \n     carry me through the rest of my life.\n\n\n                        eulogy by katina tsongas\n\n       When confronted with the possibility that he might not live \n     to see us grow up, my father became concerned about our \n     future and valued the time which he was able to spend with \n     us. His realization of his own mortality shaped the way in \n     which he lived his life with us, but he did not allow it to \n     dictate how he lived. He was able to live in the present \n     while always providing for our future.\n       Each time he defeated his illness he made the best of the \n     time he earned. We lived the last 13 years in a way which was \n     normal, and that normality is what made them so great and \n     what gave me so many great memories. But these memories were \n     not forced; they were not created by my father as a way to \n     ensure that he would not be forgotten. The memories I have of \n     the last 13 years are memories of a father who loved me and \n     made the best of the time he had. He never let anything get \n     in the way.\n       In thinking about my father in the last few days, I have \n     realized what an extraordinary man he was. I have never been \n     able to understand what it was exactly that inspired those \n     New Hampshire campaigners to work day and night for a cause \n     which was less than promising. I know now what it is they \n     saw, and it remains with how many lives he touched and how \n     many people grew to love him. I only wish that I could have \n     realized how great he was when I was still able to tell him.\n       My dad's ability to live a normal life at home is what now \n     makes it possible for me to see him as the amazing man that \n     he was, but remember him as my father. Dad, we just wanted to \n     tell you that we are going to be okay. You've made our city, \n     state, country, world and home better and more importantly \n     you married an incredible woman who is the best mother we \n     could hope for. We miss you so much, and we're going to miss \n     you every day for the rest of our lives. We love you, Dad.\n\n\n                        eulogy by molly tsongas\n\n       One day in fifth grade, my principal announced over the \n     intercom that all the fifth-graders should report to the \n     playground. We followed orders and made our way outside, \n     where I was stopped dead is my tracks by the most humiliating \n     sight my 11-year-old eyes had ever beheld. There was my dad \n     handing out trash bags to my skeptical classmates and \n     encouraging them to participate in picking up all the trash \n     scattered around the playground.\n       If I wasn't mortified enough, he had packages of Oreos and \n     Fig Newtons as our reward--two per person. As if any \n     respectful fifth-grader ever ate Fig Newtons. I scurried to \n     pick up every piece of trash and shove every Fig Newton down \n     my throat to end this fiasco as soon as possible and send my \n     dad on his way.\n       Looking back, I realize that I was not surprised to see him \n     do this. I did not even question him. But I know that he was \n     just trying to get me involved in keeping my school and city \n     clean, that I had a place to be proud of and I would not \n     allow others to do the job for me. Through bringing me around \n     to the developments on the arena, the ball park or even the \n     making of a new Market Basket, he made me realize someone as \n     normal as my dad could make a difference if they just get up \n     and do it. This spirit of his is something I will always \n     remember and hopefully lead my life by.\n       However, in the long run, the politician or the man of \n     Lowell is not who I am going to miss. I'm going to miss my \n     dad and the way he always ate his English muffins with butter \n     and jam, or how he'd wake up at 8 o'clock and swim across \n     Schoolhouse Pond, or water Kittredge Park, or seeing him \n     excitedly jump out of his chair during charades, or how he'd \n     take us to some random field to play baseball, or how he'd \n     tell me that I was a good kid. I'm even going to miss him \n     helping me make my bed or trying to pick up my clothes from \n     the bathroom floor.\n       No matter how many times I reassure myself that he had a \n     wonderful life, he did a lot of amazing things, some of which \n     I've just realized, nothing can make me stop wishing that my \n     dad was here right now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S709-3", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S712-S713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PAUL TSONGAS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, when then-Representative Paul Tsongas of \nLowell, MA, was running for the U.S. Senate in 1978, a newspaper \ncolumnist referred to him rather dismissively as ``an obscure first-\nterm Congressman.'' Candidate Tsongas responded quickly to correct the \nerror, saying, ``I'm an obscure second-term Congressman.''\n  That was Paul Tsongas, meticulous with the facts, parrying an attack \nwith laughter, and always keeping on course to his goal.\n  Mr. President, Paul Tsongas embodied the best qualities of a public \nservant. Uppermost in his mind was the responsibility to make his \ncommunity, his district, his State, his Nation, his world a better \nplace than he found it. Part of that responsibility was to speak \nplainly the truth as he saw it, even when speaking the truth might \nundermine his own ambitions.\n  During the 1992 Presidential campaign, for example, Senator Tsongas \ninsisted on warning the American people, over and over, about the \nlooming\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\nthreat posed by our national deficit. He refused to embrace tax cuts, \ninstead insisting that fiscal responsibility and prudent policy were \nthe keys to bringing the Federal budget back into balance.\n  Because we shared a commitment to deficit reduction, Senator Tsongas \ncame to Wisconsin in 1992 to campaign for me in my Senate race. Deficit \nreduction was the centerpiece of my campaign effort, and, like Senator \nTsongas, I took the position that massive new tax cuts would undermine \nour efforts to reach a balanced budget. It was heartening to me to have \nSenator Tsongas' support and encouragement.\n  His principles of fiscal responsibility and prudent policymaking led \nSenator Tsongas, after ending his quest for the Presidency, to join \nwith another former Senator, Republican Warren Rudman, to form the \nConcord Coalition, an organization that has become one of the leading \nvoices for deficit reduction.\n  While I did not have the opportunity to serve with Senator Tsongas, \nour philosophies often crossed paths. I have been proud to have had the \nsupport of the Concord Coalition on various deficit-reduction efforts, \nand I have been inspired by Senator Tsongas' vision, energy, courage, \nand dedication, both on this issue and in the practice of public \npolicymaking generally.\n  Mr. President, I had only recently begun my own career in public \nservice when Paul Tsongas announced he would not run for re-election in \n1984, because he had been diagnosed with non-Hodgin's lymphoma. He \nwanted, he said, to spend more time with his family.\n  He endured bone-marrow transplants, a treatment that was experimental \nat the time, and he eventually came back, first to chair the \nMassachusetts Board of Higher Education, then to run for President and \nthen to cofound the Concord Coalition.\n  Even as he was working in the highest circles of American politics, \nhe always kept close contact with his beloved hometown of Lowell, where \nhe served on the city council in the late 1960's and where he is \nrecognized as one of the community leaders who help revive that former \nmill town.\n  Mr. President, in April 1963, Paul Tsongas was serving in the Peace \nCorps in Ethiopia, and he wrote then-Atty. Gen. Robert Kennedy, asking \nfor help in securing a party worker's job in the upcoming national \nelections. In that letter, the 22-year-old Tsongas told Kennedy, ``I \nfeel confident that I have the raw material to become a successful \npublic servant.''\n  A typical understatement from Paul Tsongas, Mr. President. He will be \nmissed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Parliamentary inquiry, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator is \npermitted to speak up to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S712-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S713-S715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak a little bit about \nthe balanced budget amendment which is being brought forward on this \nfloor in the near future. It is obviously one of the most significant \nitems that this Congress will deal with. As we all know, in the last \nCongress it passed the House and unfortunately failed here in the \nSenate by one vote.\n  So it is a matter of substantive policy which we must attend to, and \nwhich we as a Congress should pass. There are a lot of reasons for \npassing the balanced budget amendment. The most important, in my \nopinion, is that we put in place procedures in this Nation which will \nnot allow one generation to take from another generation its \nopportunity for hope and for economic prosperity. Unfortunately, every \ntime we go to the well and borrow money here, as a Congress, we are \nrequiring our children to pay that debt. It truly is unfair for one \ngeneration, which has benefited so much from the greatness and energy \nand prosperity of our Nation, to be taking from another generation its \nability to also benefit from that greatness, energy, and prosperity. \nBut that is what we do, we run up the debt of the United States and \npass it on to the next generation.\n  In dealing with the balanced budget, there has been a lot of \ndiscussion as to how it should be structured, how this constitutional \namendment for a balanced budget should be structured. One of the \nprimary arguments that has been made, on the other side of the aisle \nespecially, is that any balanced budget amendment must not include in \nits calculation the receipts that flow into the Social Security trust \nfund for the purposes of determining whether or not the Government is \nin balance. This is what is known as the Social Security argument.\n  I think it is put forward for a variety of reasons, some of them \nsubstantive and, regrettably, some of them political. We all know \nwhenever you raise the issue of Social Security you not only gather the \nattention of a number of Americans but, in many instances, if you raise \nit in certain ways you scare a lot of Americans because many Americans' \nlifestyles, their ability to exist financially and their capacity to \nmake it from day to day, depend on their capacity to receive Social \nSecurity and the support of Social Security. It has been an \nextraordinarily successful program.\n  But, in the context of the balanced budget amendment, the way it is \nbeing presented is, I think, a bit of an obfuscation of what is \nactually the situation. Because what is being represented, if you want \nto get down to the simplest statement of it, what is being represented \nis that today the Social Security funds are essentially being raided to \noperate the Federal Government. That is the basic argument that is \nbeing made on the other side. And the argument therefore follows that \nwe should not do that, we should only use revenues that are available \nfor the purposes of operating the Government in order to operate the \nGovernment.\n  In other words, if we raise $1 of taxes to pay for defense or to pay \nfor education or to pay for any variety of things that we do at the \nFederal level, that is where that dollar should go. But if we raise $1 \nfor purposes of the Social Security trust fund through the withholding \ntax, if we raise that dollar, it should only be spent on Social \nSecurity. And to set up a balanced budget amendment which may in some \nway use those dollars to operate the general Government is unfair and \ninappropriate to seniors who deserve that money to support them.\n  This argument makes sense just stated in that way. But it does not \nmake any sense if you look at the substance of the way Social Security \nworks. Today, in fact, it raises some very serious concerns about what \nthe promoters of this argument really want to do with the Social \nSecurity trust fund. Because today the way the Social Security trust \nfund works is this. You pay $1 into the Social Security trust fund. \nThat $1, as a working American--whether working on an assembly line in \nDetroit or whether you are working as a computer programmer in New \nHampshire --you pay $1 into the Social Security trust fund and that \ndollar is immediately paid out to support somebody who is on Social \nSecurity today. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system. Today, under \nthe system as it is structured, more people are paying into the fund \nthan are taking out of the fund in total dollars. If you discount \ninterest payments as a technical thing, basically you are paying $29 \nbillion more into the Social Security fund than is taken out of the \nSocial Security fund, for the purposes of paying seniors their support \nunder Social Security.\n  So the senior citizen might say, or some from the other side of the \naisle seem to be saying, ``Well, that $29 billion should be available \nto Social Security and only Social Security. Because, after all, it was \nraised with Social Security taxes.'' I am willing to accept that as an \nargument; as an argument. But how does it actually work? How does it \nactually work?\n  Under the law, what do the Social Security trustees do with this \nextra $29 billion they will receive this year that they are not going \nto pay out in benefits? Do they invest it in the private\n\n[[Page S714]]\n\nsector or put it in a savings account designated to a senior's name? Do \nthey in some other way hold that asset for the benefit of that senior \ncitizen, for the benefit of a senior citizen or for the benefit of the \nwage earner who paid into the trust fund? No, they do not. They do not. \nWhy don't they? Because, under the law, the Social Security trustees \ncan only do one thing with that surplus, with that extra $29 billion \nthey are taking in this year they are not spending for benefits. They \ncan only lend that money to the Federal Government. They cannot lend it \nto anybody else. They can only lend it to the Federal Government under \na special loan document that yields a special interest payment.\n  So the money goes back to the Federal Government and is spent by the \nFederal Government as a loan. That means the $29 billion is not in some \nspecial savings account for a senior citizen or for the wage earner who \npaid it in. It is not in some special stock agreement, stock \ncertificate. It is not invested in IBM or General Motors, or not \ninvested in a mutual fund like the Fidelity fund. It can only be \ninvested in the Federal Government.\n  Of course, what is the Federal Government going to do with that $29 \nbillion? Is it going to sit on it? Hold it under a mattress? Of course \nnot. What the Federal Government does with that $29 billion is it \noperates the Government of the United States. If the $29 billion that \nis being lent to the Federal Government by the Social Security system \nwere not available to the Federal Government, the Federal Government \nwould have to go out, theoretically, and borrow it from somebody else, \nborrow it in the marketplace by issuing Treasury notes. So, what you \nhave here, essentially, is a pay-as-you-go system. Everything that is \npaid in is paid out. But to the extent it is not paid out, to the \nextent there is a surplus, the money has to go to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  What the other side is saying is the Federal Government should not be \nallowed to use that money for the purposes of accounting for its \nbudget, as to whether or not it is balanced. As a practical effect, \nwhat does that mean? What does it really mean, what they are saying? It \nmeans one of two things. It means either: First, they want all that \nsurplus invested in something other than Federal-issued debt, they must \nwant it invested in the stock market or maybe they want to invest it in \nreal estate, or maybe they want to invest it in futures funds or maybe \nthey want to buy into the Albanian Ponzi scheme. But they do not want \nit invested in the Federal Government. That is the first thing it \nmeans. That is the first alternative.\n  I have to say that is a very dangerous idea. Many people have \nconsidered that idea and it has been of significant concern. But to \njust arbitrarily say the Federal Government will not be able to borrow \nmoney from the Social Security fund and therefore somebody else is \ngoing to have to borrow the money, they are going to have to lend it to \nsomebody else, is to say you are going to privatize--that is what they \nare suggesting--they are going to suggest privatizing the surplus of \nthe Social Security fund. Not designated to any individual contributor \nor taxpayer, which I happen to think makes sense, but, rather, just \nsimply you cannot invest Social Security funds in the Federal \nGovernment any longer, you have to invest in some other vehicle. That \nis, in practice, what they are proposing. They are not saying that \nbecause they are using the political cover of this hocus pocus about \nSocial Security.\n  But in practice, that's exactly what they are presenting as their \nconcept. OK.\n  If that isn't the alternative, if the alternative is you should have \nto invest in something other than the Government with the Social \nSecurity surplus, then the other alternative is--what they are saying--\nwe're looking at a bookkeeping event, because if the Federal Government \nis allowed to borrow the money from the Social Security trust fund, if \nthe Federal Government is allowed to borrow the surplus from the Social \nSecurity trust fund, then what is the difference from today? There \nisn't any difference.\n  Today, the Federal Government, for the purposes of operation, borrows \nthe money from the Social Security trust fund, gives the Social \nSecurity trust fund a debt instrument and pays interest on it. What \nthey are suggesting is either, one, that shouldn't occur under their \nproposal, which means they are calling for the privatization of the \nsurplus, or, two, if it should occur, then there's no difference from \ntoday, they're just talking about a bookkeeping event. Instead of the \nFederal Government accounting for it one way, the Federal Government \nwill account for its borrowing another way. But the fact of the matter \nis, the Federal Government is still borrowing the money, and there will \nbe absolutely no difference.\n  So this argument from the other side is highly specious. It cannot be \ndefended on the basis of substance. It can be defended on the basis of \npolitics, I admit to that. This is great politics: Let's trot out the \nold Social Security again. Let's scare the seniors. But on the basis of \nsubstance, it has no legs. All you have to do is look at the fact of \nthe matter and recognize it has no legs, because I don't think these \nfolks over there on the other side of the aisle who are suggesting this \nare suggesting we privatize the surplus, that we allow the surplus to \nbe willy-nilly invested in the market.\n  I happen to think there are some strong arguments--this is another \nwhole issue--if we are taking that surplus and rather than taxing it, \nrather than raising it through taxes, allowing the wage earner to \nretain that surplus, give them a tax cut, basically, on their payroll \ntax and let them put that surplus, that percentage of their payroll tax \nthat represents that surplus, which is about 1 percent, in their own \nsavings account so they can save for themselves for retirement. But \nthat is not the issue here.\n  The issue here is whether the other side really believes they want to \nprivatize the surplus, and if it is not their position they want to \nprivatize the surplus, essentially what they are saying is they want a \nbookkeeping event to occur, because they are still going to let the \nFederal Government borrow the money under one scenario, under a \nbalanced budget, and they borrow it under one set of books. Without the \nbalanced budget, they would balance it under another set of books. But \nas a practical matter, the effect would be the same. The budget would \nbe balanced.\n  Is my time expired? I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what we have here is a great political \ngame. There are a lot of people who don't want a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget because they don't want the Federal \nGovernment to be put under the restraint of fiscal responsibility, and \nthey ought to step forward and say that. They should not be hiding \nbehind the Social Security argument, because it is fallacious, as I \nhave just mentioned.\n  Or--here is another point--if they are going to make this point with \nthe Social Security trust fund, that it should be outside the unified \nbudget, that it should not be part of the budgeting process and the \nsurplus should not be accounted for under the process, but that we \ncreate a new accounting method, which has the same effect as a \npractical matter, then why aren't they making the same point with the \nMedicare trust fund?\n  Why? Well, I will tell you why. Because if they were to make that \npoint with the Medicare trust fund, you would see that their argument \nwould require them to fill a huge Medicare hole. Medicare is going \nbroke. The trust fund is going broke. It does not have a surplus.\n  Here is a chart that has just been put up. This chart reflects how \nmuch the Medicare trust fund is going broke. This is a bar chart, and \nwe can see the Medicare trust fund began last year, I guess, actually, \nin the deficit. Then next year, it is a $48 billion deficit; in 2005, \nit is a $91 billion deficit, and it is a geometric progression from \nthere, reflecting the tremendous imbalance in the Medicare trust fund, \nwhich we all know exists which, unfortunately, was denied during the \nelection and any proposals to address it. I happen to have a couple \nthat are fairly substantive which have been met with a bit of \ndemagoguery.\n  The fact is, this exists, and the question becomes, why wouldn't the \npractical arguments that are being made on\n\n[[Page S715]]\n\nSocial Security for taking it off budget be made on the trust fund for \nMedicare to take it off budget?\n  The obvious reasons are that the folks on the other side who are \nmaking this argument are not making this argument for substantive \npurposes, they are making it for political purposes. The politics of \nthe situation require that they not talk about the Medicare trust fund \nproblem, but rather that they talk about a nonexistent Social Security \nissue, as of today--a major Social Security issue down the road, but as \nof today, a nonexistent Social Security problem.\n  But if they were to raise the Medicare issue, then they would have to \nask about how they are going to address the fund question, because if \nyou use their logic for the Medicare trust fund, they would have to \ncome up with a proposal this year, if the balanced budget amendment \nwere passed with the Social Security language that has been proposed, \nbut if that Social Security language was also applied to Medicare--\nMedicare being a trust fund as important to seniors as Social Security, \nI would argue, and, in many instances, even more important because it \nis a health care insurance--well, then this year they would have to \ncome up with a proposal to bring into balance the Medicare trust fund \nto the tune of $48 billion--$48 billion. And that would create some \nsignificant policy questions.\n  That is exactly what we should do, of course, and exactly what I hope \nwe will do. But the fact is, the reason it is not being discussed in \nthis debate is because it means you have to face up to the hard policy \ndecisions that are involved in balancing the Medicare trust fund.\n  So if you are going to separate the Social Security trust fund, why \nnot separate the Medicare trust fund? The fact that they are not \nseparated, I think, shows the political nature of this Social Security \nargument.\n  So that is just a quick recitation or response, if you will, to those \nfolks who got on the floor today giving us the Social Security sales \npitch.\n  The fact is that the initial proposal to take Social Security out of \nthe balanced budget amendment proposal means one of two things: One, \nthey either want to privatize the surplus and have it invested in \nplaces other than the Federal Government or, two, they are just going \nthrough a bookkeeping game, because the Federal Government will \ncontinue to borrow the money.\n  The fact that they haven't included the Medicare trust fund only \nreinforces the superficiality of their position and the fact that their \nposition is political and not substantive.\n  There is going to be a lot more discussion about the balanced budget \namendment before we get to the end of this road, before we get to a \nvote. We are going to hear a lot about Social Security. But I do hope \nthat people will look beyond the language of the debate and actually \nlook at the substance, because on the substance, the Social Security \nargument, as presented--the Social Security position, as presented--\ndoes not have any legs. You could present it so it did have legs, but, \nin this instance, that is not the case.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S713-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S715-S716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON RULES AND ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, as everyone knows, the Governmental \nAffairs Committee has begun an investigation into foreign campaign \ncontributions and fundraising activities of the 1996 Presidential \ncampaign. I believe that it is appropriate at the outset to set forth \nexactly what we were about, to discuss the committee's jurisdiction, \nthe scope of its investigation, its purpose, and what principles we \nwill apply in resolving the issues that will face us. The reasons to \ndiscuss this now at this time are several.\n  First, we who are on the committee and in the Congress need to remind \nourselves of these basics so we may keep our focus in the days ahead.\n  Second, the American people need to understand the nature and purpose \nof our work in order that they will respect the process and the results \nof our efforts.\n  Third, it is necessary to respond to some of the questions in the \nmedia and elsewhere as to the committee's role and purpose.\n  Mr. President, my own analysis of these issues is just that; it's my \nown analysis. It is certainly subject to other views by other people. \nHowever, I do believe that there are certain principles that apply to \nour endeavor that can be gleaned from the Constitution, from the rules \nof the U.S. Senate, from court interpretations and, hopefully, from \ncommon sense in applying the lessons learned from the successes and \nfailures of other committee investigations.\n  Mr. President, the granting of the legislative power to Congress in \narticle I of the Constitution includes the power to investigate. As the \nSupreme Court held 70 years ago, ``A legislative body cannot legislate \nwisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the \nconditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change; and \nwhere the legislative body does not possess the requisite information--\nwhich not infrequently is true--recourse must be had to others who do \npossess it.'' So long as an investigation addresses issues that can be \nthe subject of legislation, the investigation is constitutionally \npermissible. Some of the most important inquiries the Congress has \nconducted in the past two centuries have involved the role of money in \npolitics and its effect on policy: the Credit Mobilier scandal of the \n1870's; an investigation of corporate campaign contributions in the \n1912 campaign, at which Theodore Roosevelt testified concerning his own \ncampaign; and, of course, the investigation of the 1972 Presidential \ncampaign.\n  Congress' powers to investigate broadly encompasses all areas of the \noperation of the Federal Government, as well as flaws in the electoral \nsystem that makes the Government accountable to the American people. As \nChief Justice Warren stated, the investigatory power ``encompasses \ninquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as \nproposed or possibly needed statutes. It includes surveys of defects in \nour social, economic, or political system for the purpose of enabling \nthe Congress to remedy them. It comprehends probes into departments of \nthe Federal Government to expose corruption, inefficiency, or waste.''\n  Indeed, President Woodrow Wilson wrote that, ``Unless Congress have \nand use every means of acquainting itself with the facts and the \ndisposition of the administrative agents of the government, the country \nmust be helpless to learn how it is being served. * * *'' Then he went \non to say, ``The informing function of Congress should be preferred \neven to its legislative function. * * * The only really self-governing \npeople is that people which discusses and interrogates its \nadministration.''\n  Although every committee in this body exercises oversight \njurisdiction, the full range of the Senate's informing functions is \ngranted to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. Its \njurisdiction includes the effectiveness of the operations of all \nbranches of Government, including misfeasance, corruption, and \nconflicts of interest. It is broad enough to include Presidential \ncampaigns and even congressional campaigns if they are relevant to and \nreflect upon the way our Government currently operates. No other \ncommittee has within its investigatory authority the entire range of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee's jurisdiction, which is as broad as \nthe Constitution permits.\n  The investigation we are now undertaking is neither a criminal \ninvestigation nor a seminar on campaign finance reform, although, it \ninvolves elements of both. Based on the information before us at this \ntime, it is an inquiry into illegal or improper campaign finance \nactivities in the 1996 Presidential campaign and related activities. \nThis means, however, that any facts that may have occurred before the \n1996 campaign that are relevant to or shed light upon that campaign or \nthe operation of our Government may also be subject to our inquiry. \nSuch a scope will necessarily involve examining our current campaign \nspending laws and how they operate.\n  Now, certainly, our work will include any improper activities by \nRepublicans, Democrats, or other political partisans. It is of extreme \nimportance that our investigation and our hearings be perceived by the \nAmerican people as being fair and evenhanded. This does not mean that \nwe must strain to create some false balance or that we have some sort \nof party quota system. It simply means letting the chips fall where \nthey may. We are investigating activities here, not political parties.\n  While no one should be shut off for partisan advantage, we must have \na sense of priorities based upon the seriousness of the activities or \nallegations\n\n[[Page S717]]\n\nthat come to our attention. Otherwise, we will be at this much longer \nthan anyone will want us to be. Neither I nor anyone else can determine \nat the outset all of the activities or areas that we will investigate. \nAs matters arise, the committee will simply have to make those \ndeterminations.\n  It should be pointed out that these questions are not under the \nexclusive province of the majority. I have the greatest respect for \nSenator John Glenn, the ranking Democrat on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. His many years of service in this body have demonstrated \nbeyond question his integrity and his love of his country. We are \nworking together with our staffs to ensure that all information is \nequally available to appropriate staff members and committee members. \nWe hope that in all cases the work of the committee can be done by the \nstaff in a cooperative fashion. Consensus should emerge on which issues \nare the most serious and those matters which will receive the greatest \nconsideration. But if legitimate disagreement arises as to priorities, \nthe majority will in no way limit the minority's rights to investigate \nany and all parties within the jurisdiction of the committee. Moreover, \nthe minority will be given the opportunity to call witnesses in for \npublic hearings if we cannot agree upon a joint witness list.\n\n  Although I believe these comments are sufficient to describe what the \ncommittee plans to examine, I expect to receive further inquiries. So I \nwill outline the following as some specific areas we will consider, \nalthough this is obviously not an exclusive list:\n  A. Whether the Presidential campaigns, national political parties, or \nothers engaged in any illegal or improper campaign activities, or \nwhether illegal campaign contributions were made to such entities, in \nconnection with or relevant to the 1996 Presidential campaign.\n  B. Whether, during the course of the 1996 Presidential campaign, \nexecutive branch employees maintained and observed legal barriers \nbetween fundraising and the official business of governing.\n  C. Whether Presidential campaigns remained appropriately independent \nfrom the political activities pursued for their benefit by outside \nindividuals or groups.\n  D. Whether any U.S. policies or national security decisions were \naffected by, No. 1, contributions made to or for the benefit of the \nPresident or, No. 2, improper actions of any executive branch employee \nor former employee.\n  E. Whether our existing campaign finance laws, including laws \ngoverning the disclosure of contributions to entities established for \nthe benefit of public officials, should be substantially revised and, \nif so, in what manner.\n  F. Whether, based on the results of this investigation, laws other \nthan campaign finance laws, such as the laws regulating the conduct of \nFederal officials and employees, should be revised, and, if so, in what \nmanner.\n  The committee does not intend to examine specific allegations of \nwrongdoing that Congress has already previously considered.\n  Now, a significant portion of our inquiry will necessarily focus on \nthe executive branch. This is consistent with Congress' historical \nfunction and obligation to conduct oversight of the executive branch. \nIt is a part of our system of checks and balances. It is, by its very \nnature, somewhat of an adversarial process. As Justice Jackson wrote, \nthe Constitution ``enjoins upon its branches separateness but \ninterdependence; autonomy but reciprocity. Presidential powers are not \nfixed but fluctuate, depending upon their disjunction or conjunction \nwith those of Congress.''\n  Each branch of government has its rightful prerogatives, Mr. \nPresident. And just as Congress must understand its prerogatives and \nresponsibilities in this process, so must the executive branch. And \nclearly, part of the executive branch's proper role is to protect the \nrightful prerogatives of the President and the Presidency, but also to \nprovide prompt, truthful information when Congress requires it when it \nis needed to fulfill Congress' responsibilities. It is important that \nthe executive branch refrain from claiming privileges that are \ninappropriate or simply do not exist.\n  For example, executive privilege, though not specifically granted to \nthe President in the Constitution, is an implied power that has been \nrecognized by the courts over the years. Presidents are entitled to \ncandid advice from their aides concerning important policy matters that \nwould not be forthcoming if it were subject to exposure by Congress or \nanyone else. One the other hand, the privilege does not extend to \nwrongdoing and it does not extend to any and all information that may \nprove embarrassing to the President or others. Although it has not been \ncourt tested, Senator Sam Ervin, chairman of the Watergate Committee, \nalways took the position that matters that were purely political were \nnot covered by executive privilege when confronted with a legitimate \ncongressional need. What the courts have held is that when it is based \nonly on the broad claim of the public interest in confidentiality, \nexecutive privilege may be outweighed by other considerations. In other \ninstances, claims of executive privilege are strongest when invoked in \nthe areas of military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security \nsecrets.\n  Presidents have handled the executive privilege issue with regard to \ncongressional investigations in different ways. President Nixon fought \nhis executive privilege claim all the way to the Supreme Court and \nlost. President Reagan during the Iran contra investigation waived all \nexecutive privilege and attorney client privilege claims that he may \nhave had. Also, President Carter waived all privileges when the \nactivities of his brother were investigated. As instructive examples of \nthe cooperation of these two Presidents, they both allowed \ncongressional examination of all documents, and President Reagan even \nprovided his personal notes and diary entries.\n  The President and others have correctly pointed out that the American \npeople are tired of petty partisan bickering and the meanness that \nsometimes seem to pollute the atmosphere in Washington, DC. While this \nis undoubtedly accurate, I believe the American people also want us to \nstand for something, including the truth. That makes it our obligation \nto find it and lay it out. So the question becomes: Can we carry out \nour responsibilities and assist the American people in learning the \ntruth about the strengths and weaknesses of the operation of their \nGovernment without engaging in mean spiritedness or partisan warfare? \nFrom time to time in our history, when the occasion required it, \nMembers of this body have put partisanship aside, vocally criticized \nand even filed suit against an administration of their own party. \nFormer Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee and former Senator \nWarren Rudman of New Hampshire come to mind. I have no doubt that my \nDemocratic colleagues on the committee and in this body will do the \nsame if the evidence calls for it. And I pledge my every effort to \ninsure that their actions are not met with attempts to obtain partisan \nadvantage.\n\n  But let us be frank at the outset. The extent to which we can have a \nthorough, bipartisan investigation without many of the recriminations \nwe have seen in the past is going to depend in large part upon the \nattitude of those in the White House and the executive branch. The same \ncan be said of the length of our inquiry. If one looks solely to the \npast, there is little reason to be optimistic. We have seen what \nappears to be a grudging release of information in drips and drabs and, \nseemingly, only when forced to. We have seen the broadest claims of \nexecutive and attorney client privilege in our history. We have seen \nall manner of delaying tactics which congressional oversight committees \nclaimed were intended to avoid scrutiny by Congress, where \nnoncooperation has been stretched past the cutoff dates of committee \ninvestigations or even sessions of Congress. Accusations have abounded \nthat disclosure has been withheld until after the Presidential election \nto avoid scrutiny by the people. We understand the nature of that game \nand we will not play it. We will do whatever is necessary and proper to \nmake sure that such actions are not rewarded, including the \ncontinuation of investigations and the institution of court proceedings \nwhen appropriate.\n  It doesn't have to be that way. I am still optimistic that it won't \nbe that way. I think it possible that the President may have been \noverlawyered in\n\n[[Page S718]]\n\nthe past; that while strategies may have been employed that were clever \nlegal defense strategies, they were perhaps detrimental to the good of \nthe country and even to the President himself. I am hoping for a new \nday. I am hoping the committee can establish its willingness to proceed \nin good faith. There is a new team in the White House, individuals with \nexcellent reputations who commend respect. I am hoping that the new \nWhite House counsel will understand that his position is one of counsel \nto the office of the President. He is not the President's personal \nattorney.\n  And I cannot believe that the President does not want to get to the \nbottom of the serious allegations that have been made. In the first \nplace, he took an oath of office to preserve, protect, and defend the \nConstitution, including his article II responsibility to take care that \nthe laws are faithfully executed. The President has publicly \nacknowledged that some of the DNC's contributions were illegal. Since \nunder the best of interpretations, these are matters that reflect upon \nhim and his Presidency, he above all should want to seen them cleared \nup, and I believe that he does. I would like to think that the \nPresident would be outraged at this turn of events and feel \nan obligation and responsibility to get to the bottom of the matter, \nincluding clearing the names of anyone who may have been unjustly \naccused.\n\n  Nor is it enough to simply call for campaign finance reform. I trust \nthat my position on this issue is well known. I cosponsored along with \nSenator McCain and Feingold, campaign finance reform legislation in \n1995, my first year in the Senate. I was for campaign finance reform \nwhen campaign finance reform wasn't cool. I have long thought we simply \nspend too much time soliciting too much money from too many people who \nare interested in legislation that we consider. I'm not sure that the \nsolution is and I am hopeful that part of what this investigation will \ndo is examine our campaign finance system and seek out ways in which we \ncan improve it. But those of us with responsibilities in this area, \nwhether it be the President or Members of Congress, cannot let the call \nfor reform serve to gloss over serious violations of existing laws. If \nwe do that the reform debate will be cast in a totally partisan context \nand insure that, once again, campaign finance reform will be killed.\n  The question constantly arises as to when public hearings will begin. \nInterestingly, Democrats, Republicans, the White House, and the news \nmedia all are seemingly interested in having hearings as soon as \npossible--I would guess all for different reasons. I share that desire. \nHowever, the committee's obligation is not to do it early but to do it \nright. Certain things should be kept in mind by those who, on a daily \nbasis, ask when hearings will begin. In the first place, establishing a \nhearing date, or even a target date when dealing with such a broad \narray of matters as listed above, would be nothing more than guesswork. \nThe hearings should begin as soon as the matters have been properly \ninvestigated and not before. Time spent in proper investigation and \npreparation prevents disjointed hearings and saves time in the long \nrun. This is not a matter of hauling a bunch of people whose names have \nbeen in the paper before the camera and hurling charge at them.\n  This committee as presently constituted and my chairmanship came \nabout less than 3 weeks ago. We must rely extensively upon new staff \nthat is just being hired and we do not have a full complement yet. \nClearances must be obtained. Facilities must be set up. Documents must \nbe gathered and carefully reviewed. A check of the history of other \nmajor committee investigations reveals that 3 or 4 months of \ninvestigation and preparation before the beginning of the hearing phase \nis the norm. That is not to say that it will take our committee that \nlong. I am hopeful that it will not. But it will take whatever it \ntakes. And as I have stated, the level of cooperation we receive from \nthe White House and the rest of the executive branch is directly \nrelevant. Most importantly, of course, one cannot tell in the beginning \nof an investigation what leads may be developed.\n  One final thought: Most of us did not come to Washington to tear \ndown, but to build up. But, the Founding Fathers did not believe that \nthe errors of government were self-correcting. They knew that only \nconstant examination of our shortcomings, and learning from them, would \nenable representative government to survive for hundreds of years past \ntheir own time. They believed correctly that this process makes America \nstronger, not weaker. We are heirs to that legacy, and we will strive \nto be deserving of it, by taking this step toward restoring the \npublic's confidence in the Government for which our forebears were \nwilling to sacrifice everything.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOhio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to my \nfriend, the senior Senator from Tennessee and the chairman of our \ncommittee, and heard him describe an investigation that he plans to \nconduct as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. I welcome \nhis comments.\n  As the ranking member of the committee and as someone who was \nchairman for some 8 years, this can be a most important hearing for our \ncommittee. Today I want to publicly pledge to him my best efforts to \ncooperate in establishing the bipartisan atmosphere that he called for \nand that I believe Senator Thompson genuinely wants to have as we go \nforward.\n  I am pleased that Chairman Thompson in his opening remarks mentioned \nthe importance of defining the scope of the investigation and its \npurpose. He also talked about principles that should be applied if the \ninvestigation is to be successful. I will refer back to these \nprinciples a little later in my remarks. But I think it was helpful \nthat Chairman Thompson included a partial list of areas to be \nconsidered. There is no question that the issues raised in his list are \namong those that ought to be examined, and I support them. I agree with \nhim fully when we talk about the informing function of Congress, but I \nagree with it more as a starting point than as an end to our \ninvestigation.\n\n  I think it becomes far more meaningful that instead of just limiting \nthis to the 1996 Presidential campaign, we also use this informing \nfunction to recommend what can be done about the situation we are \ninvestigating. I think that is what the American people want.\n  So I think that a more meaningful, fair list must include additional \nquestions about improper practices in national campaigns. In addition \nto looking at the problem of foreign contributions, which certainly \nshould be looked at, the Governmental Affairs Committee must look, for \nexample, at the problem of soft money used by unregistered \norganizations without disclosure and without limitation to influence \nelections, and the misuse of Government offices and staff for political \npurposes, and abuses of power in coercing campaign contributions, the \nmisuse of charitable and other organizations and promises of special \naccess to Government-elected officials. The Governmental Affairs \nCommittee should look into these types of practices whether examples \nare found in connection with the executive or the legislative branch.\n  My point, Mr. President, is this: There is no end to the questions \nthat might be asked about improper or illegal fundraising and spending \nin political campaigns. So we need to establish objectives for the \ninvestigation without making the inquiry too narrow and thereby risk at \nleast a perceived partisan approach. Defining the committee's \nobjectives will help determine the scope of the investigation, but, \nmost of all, the committee's scope should be determined by the \ncommittee's purpose in these investigations. Any major Senate \ninvestigation --and this will be one--ought to have a clear purpose.\n  To make an analogy, I recall many of my colleagues asking on this \nSenate floor not too long ago when we were considering United States \nentry into Bosnia, what is the exit strategy? Demands were made for an \nexit strategy before there would be a vote.\n  That was a reasonable question then, and I think it is a reasonable \nquestion in regard to this inquiry. In each context, the exit strategy \nis inseparably linked to purpose. What is the purpose of this \ninvestigation? Or perhaps the better question to ask now is, what \nshould be the purpose of this investigation?\n\n[[Page S719]]\n\n  The chairman has stated he intends this exercise to inform the \npublic. That is one of our purposes as an oversight and investigatory \ncommittee, so I support that fully and completely. I do not think it is \nenough that we view our purpose as informational only. We need to take \nthe next step. We need to correct the problems with our campaign \nsystem. That is what the American public wants. I think that is what we \nwant on both sides of the aisle. That is what both political parties \nhave said they want. It means that to correct the problems, we are \ngoing to have to investigate then wherever those problems may be, not \njust on a narrowly defined limit of the last election.\n  All the questions posed by my distinguished colleague in his remarks \npoint to campaign finance practices that may be illegal or, if not, in \nmy view ought to be illegal. I happen to think that the reform of \ncampaign finance laws should be our daily objective in this Congress. \nHowever, I am convinced that the fight over passing real campaign \nfinance reform will not be won until the pressure from the American \npeople becomes overwhelming, and I think these hearings and this \ninvestigation can make that interest overwhelming. That is the reason I \nthink we should go the next step.\n  This investigation, if done right--and I am convinced it will be--\ncould be the vehicle to create that pressure. But it will not happen if \nthis investigation somehow turns into partisan pointing and bickering \nback and forth, and I do not think it will happen if the inquiry drags \non into next year, an election year, when changing the campaign finance \nlaws will be virtually impossible.\n\n  If we do not use this unique opportunity to reach real reform, the \nAmerican people will have a tendency to say a pox on both our houses, \nand I think they will probably be right.\n  So I say to Chairman Thompson and my Republican colleagues, let us \nnot only inform but let us take that next step of enactment of campaign \nfinance reform this year as our goal and as a major purpose of this \ninvestigation. Inform, certainly, but take the next step as well.\n  Let us examine the most important and egregious set of political \nfundraising and spending practices--not just pointing at one spot but \nlet us look at the practice. Let us write a report this year that tells \nthe American people really how badly this system has been operating and \nhow it should be fixed. And Heaven knows, we are experts on it because \nwe deal with this system every day and every time we have to run for \nreelection. And then let us go out and fix it before the year is over.\n  Is there misuse, for instance, of nonprofits and tax exempts? There \nis misuse of foreign funds; we know that. What are the major misuses of \nsoft money? What are the misuses of Government itself? And wherever we \nneed to go to get information that helps us correct those problems and \nothers is where we should go.\n  These, Mr. President, are my thoughts about purposes and scope and \nduration of this investigation. So I think we need to devote the next \nfew weeks to an effort hopefully integrating Chairman Thompson's vision \nof this investigation with what I have suggested here today, that we go \nbeyond just the informational role and try and make some suggestions to \nfix the system.\n  Then we need to come back to the Senate--together perhaps--and \npresent our plan for approval by the full body because the Senate will \nbe very much involved with this whole effort. This inquiry presents us \nwith an opportunity to accomplish something together. We have had \npeople on both sides of the aisle this year in positions of leadership \nand regular membership talk about how we must work together this year. \nWe have come off a couple of bruising years here in the Congress of the \nUnited States, so I view this inquiry as an opportunity, truly an \nopportunity as Democrats and Republicans that will be worthwhile and \nlasting for the American people.\n  As I indicated earlier in my remarks, I wish to address the issue of \nprinciples in the conduct of this investigation. The Senator from \nTennessee made some very constructive remarks in his presentation \nregarding the role of the minority and the relationship of majority to \nminority in the conduct of this investigation, and I thank him for that \nand I wish to elaborate on them just a little bit.\n  First, to assure that the committee's investigation is fair, \nbipartisan, and legislatively productive, I think it is vital the \nSenate define the scope and procedures and duration of the \ninvestigation in the omnibus committee funding resolution.\n  Now, a definition of scope and duration will enable the Senate in \nproviding funds for the investigation to establish what it is \nauthorizing, the subjects about which it wishes to learn from the \ncommittee, and when it wishes the committee to report. There should \nalso be a specification of even-handed procedural ground rules for the \ninvestigation.\n  For example, the majority and minority should have contemporaneous \naccess to all documentary evidence received by the committee. The \nmajority and minority should have the right to be present at and \nparticipate equally in all depositions and investigatory interviews. \nAnd the majority and minority should have equal opportunity to obtain \nand present relevant testimonial and documentary evidence on the \nsubjects of the committee's inquiry.\n  These are just safeguards for a fair and bipartisan inquiry which is \nin keeping with contemporary Senate practice. This is the way the last \nseveral Senate investigations have been done, and Senate practice from \ninvestigations of this kind dictate that it should be expressly spelled \nout before the actual investigating begins so we do not get into an \nunpleasant disagreement in the middle of the hearings.\n  Also, the minority should have sufficient personnel and resources to \nenable it to take part fully in acquiring and analyzing evidence. That \nmay be a problem because ordinarily the committee split on resources \nhere in the Senate is one-third/two-thirds. I do not anticipate that is \ngoing to change in this investigation. But it means on the minority \nside, that to have an even prospect of having an even ability to look \nat areas we might want to explore, we are at a disadvantage going in.\n  So it is obvious that many issues will have to be negotiated in order \nto reduce the risk that the Governmental Affairs investigation \ndegenerates into a partisan finger pointing exercise. I certainly do \nnot want to see that happen.\n  All of us in the Senate, and in particular all of us on the \ncommittee, have a grave responsibility. That responsibility is to \nensure that this investigation moves forward in a constructive and \nbipartisan manner. I look forward to mutual respect among all \nparticipants. Most of all, we need to enter into this with the \ninterests of the American people uppermost in our minds, rather than \nany partisan political advantage. And that means looking in all \ndirections, wherever we find any information that may direct us to what \nI see as the secondary objective of our hearings, and that is not only \nto inform but to recommend ways to correct these problems so we do not \ngo on into the next election with some of the same abuses taking place \nall over the country that occurred in this last election.\n  My distinguished chairman has said this is his aim. I certainly take \nhim at his word. He is a man of his word. I know that. We want to work \ntogether on this. So I hope we can come quickly to an agreement on \nscope, on time, on process, on cost of the investigation, and place \nthat agreement in the funding resolution for the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  This can be a most important activity we are about to embark on here. \nFrom all appearances it is going to be fairly long and arduous, and I \nthink it is important we set these kinds of rules before we get going; \nnot important just for us on a personal basis here, but it is important \nthat somebody work this out for the American people. That is what this \ncommittee has the opportunity to do.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Brownback]. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S716-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S720-S722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S720]]\n\n\n\n                        THE SITUATION IN BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I recently returned from a trip to NATO \nheadquarters, to the headquarters of the United States European \ncommand, in Stuttgart, and Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island joined me \nfor a trip to the former Yugoslavia. While in Bosnia we visited \nSarajevo, Tuzla, Simin Han, Hajvazi, and Mostar. We also visited Zagreb \nin Croatia and Belgrade in Serbia. I want to share the impressions and \nconclusions that I gained during the course of this trip.\n  The situation within Bosnia is relatively stable. The forces of the \nNATO-led Implementation Force that ended its deployment in December \n1996, accomplished its mission of separating the forces of the former \nwarring factions, overseeing the placing of heavy military equipment in \ncantonment areas, and generally creating an environment in which \ncivilian aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement could be carried out. \nThe NATO-led stabilization force, which is scheduled to remain in \nBosnia for 18 months from December 1996, is essentially continuing the \nmission of keeping the peace and creating a secure environment.\n  I was heartened that some institutions of the Government of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina have been formed. In our separate meetings with the \nthree Presidents and two Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I \nwas struck by their avowed intention of working together to implement \nthe Dayton agreement. There will, of course, be problems and \nfrustrations as they seek to work together, but I believe that these \nday-to-day problems can be overcome if the immediate and middle term \nchallenges I am about to discuss can be satisfactorily addressed.\n\n\n                          immediate challenges\n\n  The next year is going to see many significant challenges to peace in \nBosnia, and here are two:\n  First of all, a ruling of the international arbitration tribunal \nprovided for in the Dayton agreement is due to be handed down on \nFebruary 14, this year, concerning the disputed portion of the Inter-\nEntity Boundary Line in the Brcko area. Brcko was the scene of ethnic \ncleansing by the Bosnia Serbs of Bosnian Moslems, who were the majority \nthere prior to the war. Brcko is located in the narrowest area of the \nPosavina corridor that separates the Serb Republic from the territory \nof the Bosniac-Croat Federation and which essentially also divides the \neastern and western portions of the Serb Republic. In view of Brcko's \nstrategic location, Bosnian Serb Premier Gojko Klickovic recently told \nreporters that Serbian forces were prepared to launch a Bosnia-wide war \nif the Serbs lost control of the city in the arbitration process.\n\n  Brcko is located in the United States sector of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. Having visited with Maj. Gen. Montgomery Meigs and his \ntroops, I know that they are prepared to handle any military \ncontingency that might arise. It would be suicidal for the Bosnian \nSerbs to resort to force in view of the overwhelming advantage that the \nSFOR forces have, but emotions run very high over this issue. Even if \nthe Bosnian Serbs did not resort to force, the lack of cooperation that \nwould surely result from an adverse arbitration ruling would complicate \nfurther the implementation of the civilian aspects of the Dayton \nagreement.\n  A second immediate challenge relates to Eastern Slavonia, a strip of \nland in easternmost Croatia that borders on Serbia and northern Bosnia \nand Herzegovina.\n  A United Nations peacekeeping force has been administering Eastern \nSlavonia as it transitions back to the full control of the Government \nof Croatia. The mandate of the United Nations Transitional \nAdministration in Eastern Slavonia ends on July 15, 1997. There are \npresently about 120,000 Croatian Serbs in Eastern Slavonia, half of \nwhom were driven out of their homes in other parts of Croatia, \nparticularly the Krajina. If the Croatian Serbs determine that they are \nunable to live in peace in Eastern Slavonia, their only alternatives \nare to go to Bosnia or Serbia. Neither place has the resources to \nabsorb the Croatian Serbs and their departure, forced or voluntary, to \neither place would be highly unsettling.\n  It is important for the international community to clearly notify the \nCroatians that they must reassure the Croatian Serbs that their rights \nwill be respected so they will remain in Croatia. It must be made clear \nto the Croatian Government that its relationship to the West and its \naccess to western institutions will depend upon its treatment of the \nSerb minority within its borders.\n\n\n                         Middle Term Challenges\n\n  Mr. President, our visit to Bosnia and the region have convinced me \nthat there will be a need for an outside armed force in Bosnia beyond \nthe 18 months mission of the stabilization force.\n  That is the most important, significant conclusion that I reached, \nwhich is that at the end of this 18-month period there still will be a \nneed for an outside armed force in Bosnia. I base that conclusion on \nthe following factors:\n\n\n                        resettlement of refugees\n\n  The Dayton agreement provides for the early return of all refugees \nand displaced persons to their homes. There are an estimated 1.2 \nmillion refugees and displaced persons in Bosnia and another 900,000 \nelsewhere, primarily Western Europe. There are an estimated 330,000 \nrefugees, mostly Bosnian Moslems, in Germany alone.\n  The homes that these approximately 2.1 million people have the right \nto return to are either destroyed or are presently occupied by other \nrefugees or displaced persons. As reconstruction lags, the problem \nremains acute.\n  Additionally, the animosities that gave rise to the war and the \nhorrible atrocities committed against civilians have not disappeared \nand serve to discourage people from returning to their homes of origin.\n  These obstacles to resettlement were dramatically brought home to me \nduring a visit to U.S. Observation Post Rock located in the vicinity of \nthe former Bosnian Muslim town of Hajvazi that is now just within the \nSerb area of Bosnia. Across the ravine from the observation post one \ncan see a house occupied by the Bosnian Serb police. The police are \ndetermined first to prevent Bosnian Muslims from returning and second \nto bring Bosnian Serbs in to occupy the houses in the town. The Muslim \nmosque lies in rubble.\n  Most dramatic of all, however, is the interior of the observation \npost itself. A pillar in the middle of the observation post contains \nthe bloody handprint of a young child and the cement floor of the \nstructure had to be covered with wood flooring because the blood stains \nwere so ingrained they could not be cleaned. The United States \ncommander described the building as a slaughter house where Muslims \nwere put to death. It is difficult to imagine Muslims and Serbs living \npeacefully side-by-side in the shadow of such recent atrocities, even \nputting aside their previous history.\n  We also visited Mostar, a city in which both Bosnian Muslims and \nBosnian Croats have lived since pre-war days. Mostar was the site of \nheavy fighting between Muslims and Croats prior to the so-called \nWashington Agreement which brought an end to Muslim-Croat fighting and \nenabled them to join forces against the Bosnian Serbs. Subsequent to \nthe Washington Agreement, Mostar sustained heavy damage from punitive \nshelling by the Bosnian Serbs who controlled the high ground \nsurrounding the city. Despite extensive construction efforts funded by \nthe European Union which sought to make a model of Mostar for Muslim-\nCroat cooperation, the terrible scars of the fighting are still visible \nin Mostar, particularly in the Muslim section of the city which \nsustained most of the damage, bearing witness to the cruel shelling and \nsmall arms fire that indiscriminately targeted civilians there.\n  Another complicating factor as to why it is going to be impossible to \nleave without some kind of a follow-on force after 18 months from last \nDecember, has to do with war criminals.\n\n\n                             war criminals\n\n  Article IX of the General Framework Agreement, which with its several \nannexes make up the Dayton Agreement, specifically recites ``the \nobligation of all Parties to cooperate in the investigation and \nprosecution of war crimes and other violations of international \nhumanitarian law.'' The authorities of the Serb Republic have refused \nto hand over former President Radovan Karadzic and former military \nchief General Ratko Mladic, both of whom\n\n[[Page S721]]\n\nhave been indicted by the International Tribunal for the Former \nYugoslavia at the Hague. In a January 2, 1997, letter to new U.N. \nSecretary General Kofi Anan, Serbian Republic President Biljana Plavsic \nchallenged the legal foundation of the international tribunal and \nstated that ``It is our firm belief that if we were to hand over Dr. \nKaradzic and Gen. Mladic for trial, this would, in fact, threaten the \nexisting peace.''\n  NATO policy established first for the implementation force and \ncontinued for the stabilization force is not to search for indicted war \ncriminals and to apprehend them only if they are encountered by the \nNATO-led force as it carries out its duties and only if apprehending \nthem would not put the SFOR troops at significant risk. This policy \ndecision is influenced no doubt by the lesson the international \ncommunity learned during the U.N. operation in Somalia when United \nStates and allied troops conducted a manhunt for General Aideed with \ndisastrous results.\n  The United Nations has distributed posters with the photos of the \nindicted war criminals so that the stabilization force troops will be \nin a position to apprehend them if they are foolish enough to attempt \nto pass through a checkpoint or otherwise come in contact with those \nforces. In early January, one such indicted war criminal, a Bosnian \nCroat who was the former police chief in Vitez and has been indicted \nfor overseeing the inhumane treatment of Bosnian Muslim civilians, did \nencounter an SFOR patrol. He was not apprehended because the patrol \nmembers were not carrying a U.N. poster and were unsure that he was a \nsuspect, although they thought he might well be. They should have \ndetained him until they were able to make sure whether he was or was \nnot a suspect but they did not.\n\n  It should be noted that General Mladic, an indicted war criminal, \nwhile at large still is not really a free man. His location, where he \nis surrounded by heavily armed loyal troops, is known and his movement \nis restricted because of his fear of making contact with our troops. He \nis in a sense already in prison. Nevertheless, Mladic and former \nPresident Karadzic have not been turned over to the international \ntribunal and there are no signs that they will be turned over during \nthe 18-month timeframe in which SFOR is operating.\n  In an attempt to address the problem of apprehending war criminals, \nformer Secretary of Defense Perry and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff General Shalikashvili proposed the creation of a special \nparamilitary police force to our NATO allies in December. The proposal \nreportedly did not resonate well with our allies.\n  The next complicating factor for why the 18-month period is not going \nto prove sufficient for the Dayton accords to be fully implemented is \nthe lack of reconciliation.\n\n\n                             reconciliation\n\n  With dim prospects for the return of refugees and displaced persons \nto their homes, with the refusal of the Serb Republic authorities to \nhand over Karadzic and Mladic, the most prominent of the indicted war \ncriminals, with the ever visible physical scars and undoubtedly even \nmore long lasting internal scars of this terrible conflict, and with \nthe absence of a free and independent media, as I will discuss a little \nlater, I am convinced that reconciliation of Muslims, Croats, and Serbs \nwill not occur sufficiently during the 18-month mandate of the \nstabilization force and that the Dayton accords will not be fully \nimplemented during that period. A final complicating factor was to do \nwith police forces.\n\n\n                             police forces\n\n  The NATO-led forces have been extraordinarily successful in \nimplementing the military aspects of the Dayton agreement. The \nsubregional arms control agreements, although poorly respected by the \nBosnian Serbs, coupled with the American organized equip and train \nprogram for the Bosniac-Croat Federation, will result in rough military \nparity between the Federation and Bosnian Serb armies. Many of the \nformer military troops have been demobilized and returned to civilian \nlife and those who remain in uniform are tired of war. The police \nforces of the three entities are, however, not subject to the military \naspects of the Dayton agreement and thus not expressly controlled by \nthe stabilization force.\n  In Annex 11 to the Dayton agreement, the parties expressly requested \nthe U.N. Security Council to establish a U.N. International Police Task \nForce [IPTF]. The IPTF, a force of approximately 1,600 unarmed \nofficers, unlike the NATO-led force, was not granted enforcement \nauthority and was and is limited to functions such as monitoring, \nobserving, inspecting, advising, and the like. These functions were \nbased upon the reasonable expectation that the police forces of the \nparties would possess limited capabilities. Unfortunately, many Bosnian \npolice elements are relatively heavily armed and are trained and \nequipped to operate as small military units. Based upon their \nsuspicions of their counterparts, they are reported to have secretly \nstockpiled huge amounts of weapons and ammunition. In November, joint \nsurprise inspections of police stations by implementation force troops \nand the IPTF resulted in the confiscation and destruction of a large \nnumber of unauthorized weapons, mainly small arms and ammunition \nalthough numerous mines and light mortars were also discovered. Since \nthat time, the New York Times reports that local police units have \nhidden their military equipment.\n  For the many reasons cited, and others, I am convinced that there \nwill be a need for an armed outside force in Bosnia as a follow-on \nforce after SFOR's 18-month mandate expires. Before I discuss such a \nfollow-on force further, I want to address other pressures that bear on \nBosnia.\n\n\n                            Other Pressures\n\n  Mr. President, the parties to the General Framework Agreement for \nPeace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the long title of the Dayton \nagreement, include the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic \nof Croatia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia--hereafter referred \nto as Serbia. The Governments of Croatia and Serbia were wisely \nincluded because of the influence they have over the three factions in \nBosnia and because events within their territories could have a \nspillover effect in Bosnia.\n\n\n                                 serbia\n\n  While in Belgrade, we were able to witness first hand the daily \ndemonstrations being mounted by the students and the opposition \ncoalition named ``Together.'' The specific catalyst for the \ndemonstrations in Belgrade and the democratic demonstrations in other \ncities throughout Serbia was Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's \nattempt to deny the opposition the victories they achieved in municipal \nelections in Belgrade and 13 other Serbian cities last November. But \nthe demonstrations are fueled also by dissatisfaction over an economy \nwrecked by mismanagement, corruption, and international sanctions, by \ndistortions and lack of reporting of events by the government \ncontrolled television stations, and by the recognition that Milosevic's \nsupernationalism was the major cause of the war that helped unravel \nYugoslavia. Milosevic is doing all that he can to buy time but he is \nlikely to be devoured by the nationalistic tiger he unleashed. \nAccordingly, for better or worse, Milosevic specifically and events in \nSerbia generally do not have the influence or impact that they \npreviously had on Bosnia.\n\n\n                                Croatia\n\n  President Franjo Tudjman's poor health and the accompanying \nsuccession puzzle are distracting Croatia over virtually all other \nconcerns. Additionally, Croatian authorities realize that they must \nhave Western approval if Croatia is to have any chance of economic \nassistance and trade. These factors hopefully will prevent Croatia from \nusing a heavy hand in its dealings with the Croatian Serbs in Eastern \nSlavonia. I remain cautiously optimistic that common sense will prevail \nand Croatian policies will not cause a mass exodus of Croatian Serbs \nwhen the U.N. mandate expires there on July 15.\n\n\n                               The Media\n\n  As in Serbia, the government controlled media, particularly \ntelevision, in Bosnia continuously presents a drumbeat of propaganda \nthat fuel ethnic stereotyping and hatred. While this is most vitriolic \nin the Bosnian Serb stronghold in Pale, it is unfortunately echoed in \nSarajevo and Mostar.\n  A free and independent media, especially television modeled after CNN \nand the British Sky News, along with\n\n[[Page S722]]\n\ngood entertaining programs and objective, fair news presentations, \nwould be very helpful. Only a small minority of people who have \nsatellite dishes receive objective news. It is only through a free and \nindependent media that Muslims, Croats and Serbs can understand the \natrocities that were committed. Such an understanding would be the \nfirst step towards reconciliation and ultimate survival of a multi-\nethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\n                   Accomplishments of NATO-led Force\n\n  Mr. President, as I have already noted, the NATO-led implementation \nforce and its successor, the stabilization force, have been \nextraordinarily successful in implementing the military tasks of the \nDayton agreement. This first ever NATO peace enforcement mission is an \nunqualified success so far. It is a particularly important achievement \nbecause it also involves the forces of non-NATO nations.\n  During our stay at Multinational Division North, the United States \nsector headquarters in Tuzla, we were able to travel to Simin Han where \nthe Russian airborne battalion is located. It was wonderful to observe \nthe excellent relationship between the U.S. commander, Maj. Gen. Monty \nMeigs, and his Russian counterpart. The Russian commander, his \nsubordinate officers and troops were extremely proud of their role in \nthe U.S. sector. I spoke to a number of U.S. soldiers who have been \nconducting joint patrols with the Russian troops and they were \nunanimously upbeat about the Russians whom they described as excellent \nsoldiers.\n  In our visit to the French sector headquarters of the Multinational \nDivision Southeast in Mostar, we were briefed by the French Commander, \nhis German Chief of Staff, and his Spanish, French, Italian, and German \nstaff officers. It was encouraging to see how easily these NATO allies \nwork together. It was one of the best military briefings I have ever \nreceived and the graphics they used were among the best I have seen. \nThe ability of our European NATO allies to work together so \nprofessionally, in this case under a French commander, gives me hope \nfor the success of NATO's European Security and Defense Identity \ninitiative, particularly once France returns to NATO's integrated \nmilitary structure.\n  The participation of the forces of members of NATO's Partnership for \nPeace and their smooth integration into the NATO-led IFOR and SFOR \nmission are testament to the success of Partnership for Peace. Despite \nearly criticisms of that program as a stalling tactic to gain time \nwhile NATO enlargement could be worked out, Partnership for Peace, with \nits emphasis on peacekeeping, has been a major success in leading the \nway to the participation of a host of nations in international peace \noperations.\n  The success of the NATO-led multinational peace enforcement mission, \nboth during IFOR and now SFOR, is extraordinarily important for the \nfuture. The United States cannot be the world's policeman but the world \nneeds a trained, equipped, and ready force to respond at the early \nstages of a crisis that threatens international peace and security. \nEvents might have been very different in former Yugoslavia if such a \nforce could have been deployed to Croatia in the summer of 1991 when \nthe fighting between the Croatian Army and the Croatian Serbs backed by \nthe Yugoslav People's Army first began. Such a deployment could have \nserved to nip the crisis in the bud, saved tens of thousands of lives, \nand set the stage for a negotiated settlement before nationalist \nfervors were fanned beyond control.\n\n\n                       Follow-on Force for Bosnia\n\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that the SFOR mission duration of 18 \nmonths will not be sufficient for peace to gain a firm enough foothold \nin Bosnia and I fear that, in the absence of an outside armed force, \nthe conflict will reignite.\n  I believe that the participation of United States combat troops on \nthe ground in Bosnia should terminate with the end of SFOR's 18 month \nmandate. The United States is the only nation in the world with global \ncommitments and the capability to meet those commitments. Only the \nUnited States can defeat aggression in the Persian Gulf or on the \nKorean peninsula or wherever it might threaten our vital interests. But \nthe United States cannot afford to have its forces tied down \nindefinitely in Bosnia where our interests are real but not as vital as \nfor the Europeans. The United States had to take the lead in \nnegotiating and implementing the Dayton peace agreement because our \nEuropean allies and friends were not ready to do so. Our participation \nin IFOR and now SFOR will have given our European allies 2\\1/2\\ years \nto become ready. It is time for them to start preparations now to \nfulfill that role to ensure that peace does not unravel in their \nneighborhood after SFOR's mandate ends 18 months after December 1996. \nThe United States can and should still remain involved with logistic, \nintelligence, and other support activities.\n  Fortuitously, NATO is now developing a European Security and Defense \nIdentity [ESDI] within the Alliance to permit the European NATO \nnations, with NATO consent, to carry out operations under the political \ncontrol and strategic direction of the Western European Union [WEU] \nusing NATO assets and capabilities. This initiative is tailor-made for \na follow-on force to SFOR. And there is no reason why the Partnership \nfor Peace nations should not be included as they have been in IFOR and \nSFOR. It will not happen, however, without firm pressure from the U.S. \nCongress and the administration and notice of our intent now to give \nour European friends plenty of time to prepare to take over leadership \nof the follow-on force to SFOR after 18 months, should such a force be \nneeded as I predict it will be.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, the end of the cold war has unleashed the forces of \nnationalism, ethnic hatred, and religious fanaticism. In Bosnia, this \nhas led to the death of approximately 210,000 people, including about \n150,000 civilians. More than 2.5 million Bosnians out of a prewar \npopulation of 4.4 million were forced to flee their homes, 2.1 million \nBosnians are still refugees or displaced persons.\n  The NATO-led IFOR and SFOR have done and are doing an extraordinary \njob in implementing the military tasks of the Dayton peace agreement. \nCivilian implementation and reconstruction lag behind, however. While \nthere are encouraging signs with the formation of central government \ninstitutions, they are still fragile and reconciliation among the \nBosnian Muslims, Croats, and Serbs has barely begun.\n  There will be a need for a follow-on outside armed force in Bosnia \nonce SFOR's 18-month mandate is finished. United States combat forces \nshould not remain on the ground in Bosnia beyond that time. The \nEuropean Security and Defense Identity initiative within NATO provides \na mechanism for a follow-on force to sustain the peace there. Our \nEuropean NATO allies and European friends, particularly those \nparticipating in NATO's Partnership for Peace Program, need to begin \nplanning now to provide the follow-on force.\n  IFOR and SFOR have been extremely successful multinational peace \nenforcement missions. The international community needs to be able to \nfield trained, equipped, and ready forces to nip crises in the bud. \nHopefully, IFOR and SFOR and a Western European Union follow-on force \nfor Bosnia can provide the model for the international community in \nother regions of the world.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to eliminate certain benefits for Members of Congress, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                        THE CITIZEN CONGRESS ACT\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I introduce the Citizen Congress \nAct, a bill that ends many of the perks and privileges that separate \nMembers of Congress from the American people.\n  Our Founding Fathers envisioned a Congress of citizen legislators who \nwould leave their families and communities for a short time to write \nlegislation and then return home to live under the laws they helped to \npass. Unfortunately, we have strayed far from that vision. A strong \nperception exists among the American people that elected officials in \nWashington have placed themselves above the laws and separated \nthemselves from the public with perks and privileges. Enacting term \nlimits would be the best way to re-create a citizen legislature, and I \nremain committed to passing a term limits amendment to the \nConstitution. In the meantime, reforming congressional pensions, pay, \nand perks offers an immediately achievable step toward making Congress \nmore directly responsible and accountable to the American people.\n  When I was elected to the U.S. Senate a little more than 2 years ago, \nvoters placed their trust in me to help change the way the U.S. \nCongress does business. With passage of the Congressional \nAccountability Act and tough lobbying reform in the last Congress, we \nhave begun serious, bipartisan reform efforts. But we cannot afford to \nstop there.\n  Congressional perks and privileges are not limited to gifts from \nlobbyists and exemptions from certain laws. In fact, most people would \nbe surprised--even shocked--to know that Members of Congress can \nreceive free health care from military hospitals or that they receive \nautomatic cost-of-living adjustments [COLA's] for their salaries and \npensions. We must address these issues as well. To continue building \nconfidence in our Government, we must continue building confidence in \nthe people who serve there.\n  Today, I join my colleague from Colorado, Senator Wayne Allard, in \nreintroducing a comprehensive congressional reform bill. The \nlegislation, entitled the Citizen Congress Act, will help restore faith \nand trust in our Government by attacking the ``10 Pillars of Perkdom.'' \nThe 10 Pillars include:\n  Eliminating the taxpayer subsidy of congressional pensions.\n  Eliminating automatic cost-of-living adjustments for congressional \npensions.\n  Eliminating automatic pay raises for Members of Congress.\n  Requiring a rollcall vote for any pay raise.\n  Requiring public disclosure of all Members' Federal retirement \nbenefits.\n  Banning personal use of officially accrued frequent flier miles.\n  Banning taxpayer-financed mass mailings.\n  Restricting use of military aircraft by Members of Congress.\n  Prohibiting free treatment at military medical facilities.\n  Banning special parking privileges at Washington-area airports.\n  A companion bill, H.R. 436, was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Mark Sanford.\n  At a time when everyone is tightening their belts to balance the \nFederal budget and restore confidence in our Government, it is only \nright that Members of Congress eliminate the perks and privileges that \nare not necessary to conduct congressional business. The Citizen \nCongress Act launches the next stage of Government reform by focusing \non the Members of Congress themselves. I encourage my colleagues to \njoin me in passing this important legislation and bringing Congress \nanother step closer to the American people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 205\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

App. 2453).\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original \nsponsor of the citizen Congress Act with my distinguished colleague \nfrom Tennessee, Senator Bill Frist. As a Member of the other body, I \nwas an original sponsor of this bill with Representative Mark Sanford, \nwho reintroduced the CCA earlier this month.\n  This legislation is an important element of true political reform. A \nfirst step was the passage of the Congressional Accountability Act \nwhich applied labor laws to Congress. The next important step is the \nCitizen Congress Act. This act is to be a reminder to members of both \nlegislative bodies that we are citizen legislators in the true sense of \nservice as envisioned by our Founding Fathers.\n  The CCA is a comprehensive bill which eliminates many of the perks \nand privileges which Congress are afforded. It uses the congressional \npension system to encourage limited service and calls for full \ndisclosure of estimates of our retirement benefits. It also eliminates \nthe automatic COLA for Member's salaries. If we want a salary increase, \nwe will have to vote for an increase. The CCA disallows any personal \nuse of frequent flier mileage accrued on official business. This bill \nwould limit the use of frequent flier miles for only trips to and from \nthe Senator's State. The CCA also bans all postal patron franked \nmailings. This means no more unsolicited mailings to constituents.\n  Also, Senators will no longer be able to travel on military aircraft, \nexcept where there is space available on already scheduled military \nflights or where there are no commercial flights to a specific \ndestination. Members will\n\n[[Page S729]]\n\nno longer receive free medical attention at military hospitals unless \nthey are veterans and can receive this medical benefit like any other \nveteran. Finally, the CAA eliminates special parking privileges for \nMembers of Congress, Supreme Court Justices, and foreign diplomats at \nWashington National and Dulles airports.\n  I believe this will make us more responsive to our constituents \nbecause no longer will we have the special privileges which citizens \nare not given. Legislators should have to walk in the same shoes as \neveryone else, thus making them more sensitive to the concerns and \ntrials of the constituents which we are serving.\n  Again, I thank Senator Frist for all his hard work and effort in this \nendeavor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 206. A bill to prohibit the application of the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act of 1993, or any amendment made by such act, to an \nindividual who is incarcerated in a Federal, State, or local \ncorrectional, detention, or penal facility, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\nThe Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 Prisoner Prohibition Act \n                                of 1997\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the reason I came to the floor today was not \nto talk about the balanced budget amendment, which I have been happy to \ndo, but I came here because I am going to introduce legislation today \nthat will exclude prison inmates from the protections of the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act.\n  Why would I want to do something like that? Well, when this bill came \nto the Senate floor approximately 2 years ago, I offered an amendment \nat that time that said I want people's religious freedoms restored but \nI think we have to be careful about prisoners and they should not be \npart of this because they are going to take advantage of it. Well, they \nare taking advantage of it. One prisoner in New York has filed 3,000 \nlawsuits.\n  What are these lawsuits about?\n  In Nebraska there was a lawsuit filed because an inmate thinks he is \na woman trapped in a man's body and strip searches by male prison \nofficials are not allowed by his religion. Should we take up the \ncourts' time with this type of litigation?\n  We have another case where a satanic group--they are in prison, of \ncourse--filed suit because they were not given unbaptized baby fat for \ntheir candles.\n  About 40 percent of the courts' time, the Federal court's time in \nNevada is taken up with this kind of stuff.\n  In Nevada we have an inmate suing a chaplain for refusing to conduct \na marriage ceremony for this man and his male friend. The plaintiff and \nhis friend are both members of the Universal Life Church which he \nclaims allows two people of the same sex to marry.\n  In Nevada inmates allege their inability to practice a religion is \nbeing denied in violation of the first amendment because they want \nspecial services, including incense and special jewelry.\n  Mr. President, this is serious business that the prisoners have made \na mockery of. My amendment should have passed when I offered it. We \nshould make sure that this nonsense is stopped. There are protections \nin my legislation. If someone is being denied their religious \npractices, certainly there are protections there. But protections of \nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act would be denied these prisoners, \nand I believe rightfully so.\n  As I indicated, I addressed this problem several years go. The \nproblem is inmates abuse the special protections provided under the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act. During consideration of this bill in \n1993 or 1994, I offered an amendment to exempt prisoners from the \ncoverage of this act as I have indicated. I did so then because I \nfeared these special protections would be abused by inmates. They have \nbeen abused by inmates. Whatever I said on the Senate floor was not \nenough, because they have even outdone my expectations.\n  I say, regrettably, I wish I would have been wrong. I wish that I had \nbeen wrong and that these inmates would not have abused the legislation \nthat did pass. But it is apparent now that inmates are in fact abusing \nthe special rights under this act.\n  I have worked with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my friend \nfrom the State of Utah, to address the larger problem of frivolous \nprisoner lawsuits, and we were able to accomplish something last year, \nmaybe not enough. We may even need to revisit that to find out if we \nwere able to plug all the holes with the Prisoner Litigation Reform \nAct.\n  I believe we need to do more to curb the ongoing abuses occurring \nunder the Religious Freedom Restoration Act despite the Prisoner \nLitigation Reform Act.\n  Today I am introducing this bill which will prohibit the application \nof the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to inmates in a Federal, \nState, or local penal facility. I intend to meet with the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States so that she appreciates the growing \nlitigation that they face in the area. Criminals should not enjoy the \nsame rights and privileges as law-abiding citizens. The sad commentary \nin our present system, Mr. President, is they enjoy more rights than \nmany people who are outside prisons.\n  We need not go through the litany of cable television, gyms better \nthan people can buy membership in on the outside, libraries that are \nunsurpassed, exercise areas, food, three square meals a day, nice clean \nclothes. They have a pretty good deal. One of the deals I do not think \nthey should have is the ability to file these lawsuits with an unending \narray of ideas at the expense of the taxpayers.\n  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act sought to provide the legal \nprotections supporting the right to freely exercise one's religious \nbeliefs. Providing inmates with these same rights, I said, was a \ndisaster and was a recipe for disaster; and it has been proven to be an \nunderstatement.\n  Our courts now have to spend their time wading through lawsuits filed \nby inmates that are ridiculous, for lack of a better description. I \nhave described some of these lawsuits this morning. I have described \nthem in the past. I ask my colleagues to join with me to take this \npressure off our court system and off the taxpayers of this country. \nThis is wrong, what they are doing, and we have the obligation to stop \nit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Coats, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Lieberman, and \n        Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 207. A bill to review, reform, and terminate unnecessary and \ninequitable Federal subsidies; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n              the corporate subsidy reform commission act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto establish an independent, nonpartisan Commission to eliminate \ncorporate pork from the Federal budget.\n  The nine-member Commission, called the Corporate Subsidy Reform \nCommission, would be charged with reviewing all Federal subsidies to \nprivate industry, including special interest tax provisions. The \nCommission would identify those programs which are unnecessary, unfair, \nor not in the clear and compelling public interest, and recommend them \nto Congress for reform or termination. Congress would then be required \nto consider and vote on a comprehensive corporate subsidy reform \npackage under expedited floor procedures.\n  Mr. President, our Nation cannot continue to bear the financial \nburden of servicing an ever-growing $5.3 trillion national debt--which \nequates to more than $19,000 in debt for every man, woman, and child in \nthe country. We are asking millions of Americans--from families who \nreceive food stamps to our men and women in uniform--to sacrifice in \norder to rein in our annual budget deficits and begin to pay down that \ndebt.\n  As a matter of simple fairness, we have an obligation to ensure that \ncorporate interests share the burden of deficit reduction. Last year, \nthe CATO Institute and the Progressive Policy Institute identified 125 \nFederal programs that subsidize industry to the tune of $85 billion \nevery year, and the Progressive Policy Institute found an additional \n$30 billion in tax loopholes for powerful industries.\n  The American public cannot understand why we continue to pay these \nhuge subsidies to corporate interests,\n\n[[Page S730]]\n\nat a time when we are asking average private citizens to tighten their \nbelts. Corporate pork cannot be justified in an environment where our \nhighest fiscal priority is balancing the Federal budget.\n  Let me say very frankly that I do not generally like the idea of \ncommissions. It is a sad commentary on the state of politics today that \nthe Congress cannot even cut those programs that are obviously \nwasteful, unnecessary, or unfair. Unfortunately, however, Members of \nCongress have demonstrated time and again their unwillingness to cut \nprograms that serve their own interests.\n  For many years, I have tried to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending \nfrom the annual appropriations bills--with only limited success, I must \nadmit. A little over a year ago, I offered an amendment to eliminate 12 \nparticularly egregious corporate pork barrel programs, and I garnered \nonly 25 votes in the Senate.\n  Clearly, Members will not gore their own ox, unless others are forced \nto do the same. The recently ordered military base closures were \nfinally accomplished only through the workings of an independent \ncommission established by Congress. It appears we have reached a point \nthat, unless congress is forced to act to eliminate programs, it will \nnot. Perhaps independent commissions are the only fair way to ensure \nthat neither side is given an advantage to protect their special \ninterest corporate pork.\n  The independent commission and expedited congressional review process \nestablished by this legislation would depoliticize the process and \nguarantee that the pain is shared. In reality, the corporate pork \ncommission is probably the only means of achieving the meaningful \nreform that the public and our dire fiscal circumstances demand.\n  Mr. President, corporate pork wastes resources, increases the \ndeficit, and distorts markets. Corporate pork has no place either in a \nfree-market economy or in a budget where we are asking millions of \nAmericans to sacrifice for the good of future generations.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank my \ncosponsors on both sides of the aisle--Senators Thompson, Kerry, \nFeingold, Kennedy, Coats, Glenn, Lieberman, and Brownback--and \nCongressman Kasich, who will introduce similar legislation in the \nHouse. I also want to thank the several private organizations who have \nlent their good names in support of this legislation--the Progressive \nPolicy Institute, Citizens Against Government Waste, and Friends of the \nEarth--and I ask unanimous consent that statements of support from \nthese organizations be included in the Record. With their help, I \nintend to pursue this effort in the 105th Congress to \nenactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n\n  S. 208. A bill to provide Federal contracting opportunities for small \nbusiness concerns located in historically underutilized business zones, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n                        The Hubzone Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I introduce the HUBZone Act of 1997. \nThe purpose underlying this bill is to create new opportunities for \ngrowth in distressed urban and rural communities, which have suffered \ntremendous economic decline. This legislation would provide for an \nimmediate infusion of cash through the creation of new jobs in our \nNation's economically distressed areas. During the 8 years I served as \nGovernor of Missouri, I met frequently with community leaders who were \nseeking help in attracting business and jobs to their cities, their \ncentral downtown areas, their towns, and the rural areas of the State. \nWe tried various programs, including the enterprise-zone concept, and \nwe met with limited success. I am proud of the successes that we \nachieved there. But now, as U.S. Senator and as chairman of the \nCommittee on Small Business, I continue to receive similar pleas for \nhelp. I hear the concerns expressed to me by people from all over my \nState. Since we have had the opportunity to expand hearings in other \nStates, we have heard from other States as well.\n  So far, nothing that we put in place is the best formula for bringing \neconomic hope and independence to these communities. The message, \nhowever, has changed somewhat. Although help from the Federal \nGovernment has been forthcoming, there is still high unemployment and \npoverty. For example, when I was talking about a summer jobs program \nwith one very, very good community leader, he told me that the summer \njobs program was nice, but, he said, ``Stop sending me job training \nmoney. What we need right here in this part of the city is jobs, and \nmore jobs. We have all the job training money we need. We need jobs to \nput these young people to work.'' And that is a problem that I hear \ntime and time again.\n  Last March, I chaired a hearing before the Committee on Small \nBusiness on revitalizing inner cities and rural America and S. 1574, \nthe HUBZone Act of 1996, which is nearly identical to the bill I am \nintroducing today. Testifying before the committee were the cofounder \nand employees of e.villages, which has established a data management \nenterprise at Edgewood Terrace, an assisted multifamily housing project \nright here in Washington, DC. Residents of the housing project have \nbeen trained and they have established a new enterprise, Edgewood \nTechnology Services, or ETS, which to me is a prototype HUBZone \nbusiness.\n  The HUBZone Act of 1997 can have an important impact on our Nation's \neconomically distressed inner cities as housing and income subsidies \nare reduced and put under constraints and as we work toward the \nnational goal of moving people off the welfare rolls and into \nmeaningful jobs.\n  Testifying in support of the HUBZone Act of 1996 was C. Austin Fitts, \ncofounder of e.villages, who testified about the ``significant \nrelationship between'' S. 1574 and Federal housing policy. Ms. Fitts \nemphasized the importance of this legislation to create new inner city \njobs for unemployed or underemployed residents.\n  The income generated by these new HUBZone jobs can offset the \nreduction of housing and income supplements. Furthermore, as an \nemployee of ETS testified in support of the HUBZone bill, ``We at \ne.villages are encouraged that the Congress is trying to find some ways \nto get work for us to do, and to enhance our standard of living.''\n  I do not claim that the HUBZone Act of 1997 is going to solve all the \nproblems, but I think it is a significant step in the right direction. \nThese people who benefited from an enterprise started up in an assisted \nhousing development without the benefit of the HUBZone provisions know \nthat their example of success can be expanded. It can work and it can \nwork on a broader basis. And it can bring more and more people into \nproductive employment.\n  What distinguishes the HUBZone Act of 1997 from some other excellent \nproposals and well-intentioned efforts is that this bill would have an \nimmediate impact on economically distressed communities. In recent \nyears, numerous legislative proposals have stressed the importance of \nchanging the U.S. Tax Code and providing other incentives to attract \nbusinesses to the needy communities. Many of these proposals have \nmerit, and I have supported them. As I said, I have supported \nenterprise zones. I have recommended it to the Missouri General \nAssembly. As Governor, I signed it into law. I saw it work. I saw it \ncould bring benefits to areas of high unemployment. I urge my \ncolleagues on other committees to take a look at those measures which \ncan have an impact. No one of them is going to be the total solution. \nLet us move forward on all of them.\n\n  But I ask my colleagues to focus on the critical differences between \nthose proposals and the provisions of the HUBZone Act of 1997. Under \nthe HUBZone bill, entire communities would benefit because we would \ncreate absolute incentives for small businesses to operate and provide \nemployment directly within America's most disadvantaged inner city \nneighborhoods and in the areas of high unemployment and poverty in \nrural areas. It is a matter of timing. The HUBZone Act of 1997 helps \ncommunities and their residents now. This bill is a matter of direct \nfocus. This is not just incentives; this is bringing business to the \nareas of high unemployment and high poverty.\n  Specifically, the HUBZone Act of 1997 creates a new class of small \nbusinesses eligible for Federal Government contract set-asides and \npreferences.\n  To be eligible, a small business must be located in what we call a \nHistorically Underutilized Business Zone--\n\n[[Page S731]]\n\nthat is where HUBZone comes from, Historically Underutilized Business \nZone--and not less than 35 percent of the work force must reside in a \nHUBZone. That is a key difference between some of the programs that are \ninitially targeting to bring jobs to areas of need, bring jobs where \nsocial problems had flared up, such as the Watts riots many years ago.\n  It is important to contrast the HUBZone proposal with the Executive \norder promulgated by President Clinton to establish an empowerment \ncontracting commission. I commend the President for focusing on the \nvalue of targeting Federal Government assistance to low-income \ncommunities, but I think the program falls short of meeting the goal of \nhelping low-income communities and their residents. For example, under \nthe President's plan, any business, large or small, located in a low-\nincome community, would qualify for a valuable contracting preference, \neven if it does not employ one resident of the community. This is \nclearly a major deficiency or loophole when trying to assist the \nunemployed or underemployed.\n  A further weakness in the President's proposal is the failure to \ndefine more clearly criteria which makes a community eligible for this \nprogram. Unfortunately, we see the possibility, and it has been set \nforth in specific detail by the inspector general of HUD, that a lack \nof objective criteria may invite other influences in the political \nselection of an area to receive these preferences.\n  We must avoid creating another Federal Government program that ends \nup helping well-off individuals and companies while failing to have a \nsignificant impact on the poor, the unemployed and the underemployed.\n  I think the HUBZone Act of 1997 can and will make a difference. It \nmakes a contracting preference available only if the small business is \nlocated in an economically distressed area and employs 35 percent of \nits work force from a HUBZone. This is a significant difference and one \nthat is clearly designed to help attack deeply seated poverty in too \nmany areas of the United States.\n  To qualify for the program, the small business must certify to the \nAdministrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration that it is \nlocated in a HUBZone and will comply with certain rules governing \nsubcontracting. In addition, a qualified small business must agree to \nperform at least 50 percent of the contract in a HUBZone, unless the \nterms of the contract require they be located outside the HUBZone. That \nwould happen, for example, with a service contract requiring the small \nbusiness' employees and workers be present in a Government-owned or \nleased building. In the latter case, no less than 50 percent of the \nwork must be performed by employees who reside in a HUBZone.\n  Mr. President, the HUBZone Act of 1997 is designed to cut through \nGovernment redtape, while stressing a streamlined effort to place \nGovernment contracts and new jobs in economically distressed \ncommunities. Americans don't want another new law that creates a \ncottage industry of consultants necessary to fill out Government \npaperwork for a new Federal program.\n  Many of my colleagues are familiar with SBA's 8(a) Minority Small \nBusiness Program and the sometimes cumbersome rules for small \nbusinesses seeking to qualify for the program. Typically, an applicant \nto the 8(a) program has to hire a lawyer to help prepare the \napplication and shepherd it through SBA. The procedure can take months. \nIn fact, Congress was forced to legislate the maximum time the agency \ncould review an application in our last-ditch effort to speed up the \nprocess.\n  The HUBZone Act of 1997 is specifically designed to avoid \nbureaucratic roadblocks that have delayed and discouraged small \nbusinesses from taking advantage of Government programs. Simply put, if \nyou are a small business located in a HUBZone and you employ people \nfrom a HUBZone, at least 35 percent, then you are eligible. Once \neligible, the small business notifies the SBA of its participation in \nthe HUBZone program and is qualified to receive Federal Government \ncontract benefits.\n\n  My goal is to have new Government contracts being awarded to small \nbusinesses in economically distressed communities. Therefore, I have \nincluded some fairly ambitious goals for each Government agency to \nmeet.\n  In 1998, 1 percent of the total value of all prime Government \ncontracts would be awarded to small businesses in HUBZones. The goal \nwould increase to 2 percent in 1999, 3 percent in 2000 and 4 percent in \nthe year 2001 and each succeeding year.\n  HUBZone contracting is a bold undertaking. Passage of the HUBZone Act \nof 1997 will create more hope for inner cities with high unemployment, \ndistressed rural communities where poverty and joblessness reign and \nhave too long been ignored. Most importantly, passage of the HUBZone \nAct will create hope for hundreds of thousands of underemployed or \nunemployed who long ago thought our country had given up on them. The \nhope is tangible; the hope is for jobs and income.\n  I think this bill can deliver. I soon hope to chair additional \nhearings before the Committee on Small Business on the HUBZone Act of \n1997 and the role our Nation's small business community can play in \nrevitalizing our distressed cities and counties. I firmly believe the \nHUBZone proposal has great merit. I urge my colleagues to study this \nproposal and give me their comments. I ask for cosponsors and I ask for \ngood ideas. There are many, many ideas which have been incorporated in \nthis bill that were presented to me by colleagues, both on the Small \nBusiness Committee and elsewhere.\n  I ask all of my colleagues, particularly if they are concerned about \nunemployment and underemployment in areas of their States--and I know \nof very few States that don't have that problem--I ask them to sit down \nwith us and talk about how we can make this a better program. I would \nlike to see it passed. I think it could provide a very significant \nboost and help get our country on the right track.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-\nsection analysis of the provisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 208\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, last year I was shocked to learn of \nthe huge difference that exists between the Federal penalties for \ntrafficking powder cocaine and for trafficking the exact same amount of \ncrack cocaine.\n  Right now, selling five grams of crack cocaine results in the same 5-\nyear mandatory minimum prison term as selling 500 grams of powder \ncocaine. Selling 50 grams of crack cocaine gets you a 10-year minimum \nsentence, while you'd have to sell 5,000 grams of powder cocaine to get \nthe same 10 years in prison.\n  While these penalties are vastly different--100 times greater if you \nsell crack cocaine--the damage caused by these criminal acts are the \nsame. Lives are lost, families are destroyed, careers are ruined, and \nour Nation itself is seriously threatened.\n  Tough penalties are necessary to send a clear signal that the United \nStates will not tolerate selling illegal drugs. The answer to the \nproblem presented by this wide difference in penalties is not to lower \npenalties for selling crack cocaine but to increase the penalties for \nselling powder cocaine.\n  Therefore, my legislation is very simple and very clear. \nTrafficking--that is the manufacture, distribution, or sale--of 50 \ngrams of powder cocaine will result in a 10-year minimum sentence--the \nsame as dealing in crack cocaine.\n  Manufacture, distribution or sale of 5 grams of powder cocaine will \nresult in a 5-year minimum sentence--the same as dealing in crack \ncocaine.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass a bill that \ndeters the use of all cocaine--powder and crack.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 210. A bill to amend the Organic Act of Guam, the Revised Organic \nAct of the Virgin Islands, and the Compact of Free Association Act, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                         Amendment Legislation\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send to the desk for appropriate \nreferral legislation dealing with the several issues of the territories \nof the United States and the freely associated States. This is \nlegislation that is similar to measures reported by the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources at the end of the last Congress and could \nnot be considered prior to adjournment, although we had managed to work \nout the text with both the House and the administration. I want to \nacknowledge the contribution of the staff of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, as well as the Resource Committee in the House as \nwell.\n  Section 1 of the legislation proposed will extend the agriculture and \nfood programs that the United States provides for the populations on \nthe atolls in the Marshall Islands affected by the nuclear testing \nprogram for an additional 5 years.\n  The support program was initiated under the trusteeship and continued \nunder the Compact of Free Association for a limited time period. \nUnfortunately, the atolls are not yet capable of fully supporting the \npopulations, and an additional extension time is necessary.\n  The amendment will also alter the program to reflect changes in \npopulation since the effective date of the compact. I visited many of \nthese areas last year and certainly concur with the recommendations in \nsection 1.\n  Section 2 of the legislation would repeal a provision of law dealing \nwith the American Memorial Park in Saipan that would permit the \ngovernment of the Commonwealth to take over the park. While I think \nsome transfer could be considered of the marina area if the \nCommonwealth were interested, I think that the actual war memorial and \ninterpretive areas should remain under the jurisdiction of the National \nPark Service during the remainder of the lease.\n  Section 3 of the legislation makes a series of technical amendments \nto permit each of the three educational institutions in the freely \nassociated States to operate independently as land grant institutions \nrather than having to operate as a College of Micronesia.\n  I visited that college and was very impressed with the dedication and \nthe commitment of those who were responsible for education as well as \nthe people of the area. They are very proud of that institution. I can \ntell you, Mr. President, there is a tremendous sacrifice being made to \nfoster higher education in the College of Micronesia.\n  These amendments, as we propose, reflect the new status of the \nrepresentative Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, \nand the Republic of the Marshall Islands and were requested by the \nPresident of the College of Micronesia-FSM when Senator Akaka and I \nvisited the campus last year.\n  Section 4, hopefully, will resolve a different issue and one that is \ndifficult for Guam relating to the disposal of real property that the \nDepartment of Defense no longer needs for military purposes. These \nlands were acquired by the United States for defense purposes after \nWorld War II when Guam had been liberated from occupation by Japan and \nwhile Guam was a closed defense area.\n\n[[Page S735]]\n\n  We have the residents of Guam and their attitude where they have \nindicated that they are prepared to support the Federal Government of \nthe United States as they are a territory, but did so with the \nexpectation--in other words, the people of Guam expected that those \nlands, if no longer needed for defensive purposes, would be returned to \neither public or private ownership in Guam.\n  The Department of Defense presently owns about one-third of Guam, \nalthough we have been able to return several parcels over the past few \nyears. As part of the discussion on the Commonwealth, the \nadministration had agreed to similar general transfer language, but \nwhen we considered this legislation last year, the Fish and Wildlife \nService testified in opposition. The Fish and Wildlife Service, in \ntestifying in opposition, said that they had a desire to acquire some \nportions for a wildlife refuge.\n  I am going to talk a little bit about the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nServices' interest in acquiring this refuge because I think there is a \nlack of continuity that deserves some examination.\n  I am not going to go into the curious presentation from the Service \nat our hearing or the question that they are unwilling to expend any of \ntheir own money on the eradication of the brown snake, which has \nvirtually overrun the island, but only note they were able to block any \nagreement on land transfer previously.\n  What I am proposing this year is a general transfer authorization for \nall lands except those within the proposed overlay that would be a \nrefuge overlay that are identified on a map that is subject to transfer \nonly by statute. That, hopefully, will release the other lands to Guam.\n  No specific disposition is recommended for the other lands, and \nCongress will consider them on a parcel-by-parcel basis as they become \nsurplus to defensive needs. This will allow both Guam and the Fish and \nWildlife Service to make their case, assuming both want the lands, or \nanyone else.\n  I note that Congress, not the Executive, has the plenary authority \nunder the Constitution to deal with territories and with the disposal \nof Federal properties. So it is appropriate that Congress--Congress--\ndecide on the disposition of these lands when the time is right. And I \nthink the time is right. The people of Guam have waited long enough.\n  I also note that this is the only method I can think of that will \nguarantee the Government of Guam an opportunity to participate in the \nprocess. I hope that the administration will support the public \nprocess.\n  One of the inconsistencies here in this land that is in dispute, \napproximately 2,000 acres that is held by the Department of Defense--\nclearly the defensive requirements are no longer pertinent that \nnecessitate the Department of Defense to hold this land. So it is \nbasically surplus land. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in its \ninterest in acquiring the land, the rationale is to protect the various \nspecies on the island and maintain a natural habitat. Some of the \nspecies may be facing endangerment.\n\n  The inconsistency here is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's \ninability to address what is eradicating many of the species that are \nin decline and may be in danger. That is the brown snake. The island is \nvirtually overrun with the brown snake. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService refuses to initiate any action to eradicate the brown snake, \nwhich is really causing the decline in various other species that are \nunique to the island.\n  So I think it is fair to say that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nhas been somewhat irresponsible in its obligation to address the \nperpetrator causing the decline of the various birdlife on Guam and \nother species because the ferociousness of the brown snake is such that \nit has really taken over the island. And they refuse to spend any of \ntheir own money.\n  I had an opportunity to visit with the Governor of Guam. We had an \nevening at his residence. He brought several of the brown snakes in \ncages and gave us a little rundown of what the brown snakes were doing \nin overrunning Guam and the inability of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService to meet its obligation to address any type of control, of \npredator-type control, to reduce and eliminate this.\n  So I think it is fair to say the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has \nhad its opportunity. They cannot justify taking land and just holding \nit in a habitat without addressing their obligation to try to enhance \nthe species native to Guam by eradicating the brown snake. So until \nthey come up with some kind of realistic program, I do not have much \nsympathy for their claim for further land.\n  I think this land should go to the Commonwealth of Guam and be \ndisposed of under the legislative jurisdiction by the elected people of \nGuam and get on with it. I intend to pursue that with a great deal of \nenergy to ensure that we see that land transferred over to Guam for \ntheir disposition and designation as they see fit. I think they are the \nmost appropriate ones to address some procedure relative to the concern \nof the brown snake and its continued expansion over the land mass of \nGuam.\n  Section 5 of the legislation--I might add further, the Fish and \nWildlife Service testified last year that they had 18 listed species on \nGuam. I am told that three are extinct and five more no longer occur on \nGuam. At the rate that the Fish and Wildlife Service is dealing with \nthe brown snake, this will be probably the only refuge dedicated to an \nextinct species.\n  I think that says something about the stewardship of the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service with regard to the unique species that were native \nto Guam, and now the brown snake has taken over and that seems to be \ntaking care of whatever is left. But the Fish and Wildlife Service \ncontinues to, I think, neglect its responsibility.\n  Moving on, section 5 of the legislation, Mr. President, makes a \ntechnical change in statutes dealing with drug enforcement to provide \nequal treatment for all the territories as we contemplated when the \noriginal act passed.\n  Section 6 of the legislation would make two changes to the Revised \nOrganic Act of the Virgin Islands. The first would authorize the \nissuance of parity rather than priority bonds secured by the Rum fund--\nan authority generally available in the States; and the second would \nprovide that the Governor would retain his authority when absent from \nthe territory on official business, which is often the case.\n  Section 7 of the legislation provides for an economic study \ncommission for the Virgin Islands. I think the idea of a study on what \nthe future holds is important and timely. I want to emphasize that I \nwant this commission to focus directly and quickly on realistic \neconomic alternatives that are helpful to the Virgin Islands and the \nCongress and not produce a theoretical tome to gather dust on a shelf.\n  Section 8 clarifies the availability of assistance from the Public \nHealth Service in the radiation related medical surveillance and \ntreatment programs provided under section 177(b) of the Compact of Free \nAssociation in the Republic of the Marshall Islands to persons directly \nexposed as a result of the nuclear testing program in the Marshall \nIslands.\n  We observed those areas when we were over there last year, as well as \nmeeting with the people. I think this is an appropriate action.\n  Section 9 would clarify that residents of the freely associated \nStates who are lawfully admitted to the United States under the Compact \nof Free Association are eligible for assistance under certain programs. \nThis assistance had been provided before the effective date of the \nCompact under the Trusteeship and subsequently until a particularly \nstrained and convoluted interpretation by attorneys who demonstrated a \nquestionable familiarity with English created a problem. As usual, the \nanswer was that the interpretation didn't make a lot of sense and was \ncontrary to past practice, but if Congress disagreed, it could clarify \nthe law. Well I disagree and this language should clarify the law. One \nproblem that was raised is that under current law, aliens are given a \npreference over United States citizens and that creates inequities in \nsmall areas like Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands. The answer, of course, is to treat residents of the freely \nassociated States like United States citizens, not to fabricate a legal \nopinion to deny them benefits altogether. Section 9\n\n[[Page S736]]\n\nwould provide equal but not preferential treatment, and I think that is \nfully in line with our intent under the Compact in encouraging \nresidents of the freely associated States to come to the United States \nfor work and study.\n  Section 10 would provide the consent of the United States to two \namendments to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act as required by the \nAdmissions Act for the State of Hawaii. This language was requested by \nthe administration and is supported by the Hawaii delegation and I'm \npleased to say by my colleagues, Senators Inouye and Akaka.\n  Section 11 would provide for an economic study commission for \nAmerican Samoa similar to that provided for the Virgin Islands. Like \nthe Virgin Islands Commission, the Secretary of the Interior will be a \nvoting member ex officio in recognition of his responsibilities. Given \nthe unique cultural situation in American Samoa and the importance of \nland tenure and Matai rights, three of the seven members of the \ncommission will come from nominations by the Governor. Unlike the \nVirgin Islands, American Samoa still relies on annual appropriations \nfor both operations and infrastructure, and the commission is directed \nto focus on the needs in those areas over the next decade and look to \nways to minimize that dependence. As part of its report, the commission \nis directed to provide an historical overview of the relationship \nbetween American Samoa and the United States and include copies of \nrelevant documents in an appendix to the report. I want to emphasize \nthat this is an overview and I do not want the commission to depart \nfrom its focus on what economic opportunities exist to replicate \nscholarly studies. There are certain constraints on economic \ndevelopment in American Samoa as a result of its status outside the \ncustoms territory of the United States, for example, and that needs to \nbe noted.\n  Mr. President, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources plans to \nhold a hearing on this legislation on February 6. I hope to be able to \nreport the measure and have it considered by the Senate prior to the \nFebruary recess. I hope that the administration will support this \nmeasure, although I know they dislike commissions and studies. I am not \na great fan of them either, but from time to time a fresh look at a \nproblem can be useful. I do not want these commissions to go beyond \ntheir limited life and I want them to produce something useful. I hope \nthe administration will agree with the unique circumstances surrounding \nthese provisions and the need for them. and recognize the obligation \nthat we have to these areas under the Organic Act of Guam and the \nrevised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands and the Compact of Free \nAssociation Act that mandates an oversight and continued responsibility \nby the Federal Government.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                                 S. 210\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The President shall designate one of \n     the appointed members of the Commission to be Chairman.\n       (2) Members of the Commission appointed by the President \n     shall be persons who by virtue of their background and \n     experience are particularly suited to contribute to \n     achievement of the purposes of the Commission.\n       (3) Members of the Commission shall serve without \n     compensation, but shall be reimbursed for travel, subsistence \n     and other necessary expenses incurred by them in the \n     performance of their duties.\n       (4) Any vacancy in the Commission shall be filled in the \n     same manner as the original appointment was made.\n       (c) Purpose and Report.\n       (1) The purpose of the Commission is to make \n     recommendations to the President and Congress on the policies \n     and actions necessary to provide for a secure and self-\n     sustaining future for the local economy of American Samoa \n     through 2020 and on the role of the Federal Government. In \n     developing recommendations, the Commission shall--\n       (A) solicit and analyze information on projected private \n     sector development, including, but not limited to, tourism, \n     manufacturing and industry, agriculture, and transportation \n     and shifting trends based on alternative forecasts of \n     economic, political and social conditions in the Pacific;\n       (B) analyze capital infrastructure, education, social, \n     health, and environmental needs in light of these alternative \n     forecasts;\n       (C) assemble relevant demographic, economic, and revenue \n     and expenditure data from over the past twenty-five years;\n       (D) review the application of federal laws and programs and \n     the effects of such laws and programs on the local economy \n     and make such recommendations for changes in the application \n     as the Commission deems advisable;\n       (E) consider the impact of federal trade and other \n     international agreements, including, but not limited to those \n     related to marine resources, on American Samoa and make such \n     recommendations as may be necessary to minimize or eliminate \n     any adverse effects on the local economy.\n       (2) The recommendations of the Commission shall be \n     transmitted in a report to the President, the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and \n     the Committee on Resources of the United States House of \n     Representatives no later than June 30, 1999. The report shall \n     set forth the basis for the recommendations and include an \n     analysis of the capability of American Samoa to meet \n     projected needs based on reasonable alternative economic, \n     political and social conditions in the Pacific Basin. The \n     report shall also include projections of the need for \n     direct or indirect federal assistance for operations and \n     infrastructure over the next decade and what additional \n     assistance will be necessary to develop the local economy \n     to a level sufficient to minimize or eliminate the need \n     for direct federal operational assistance. As part of the \n     report, the Commission shall also include an overview of \n     the history of American Samoa and its relationship to the \n     United States from 1872 with emphasis on those events or \n     actions that affect future economic development and shall \n     include, as an appendix to its report, copies of the \n     relevant historical documents, including, but not limited \n     to, the Convention of 1899 (commonly referred to as the \n     Tripartite Treaty) and the documents of cession of 1900 \n     and 1904.\n       (d) Powers.\n       (1) The Commission may--\n       (A) hold such hearings, sit and act at such times and \n     places, take such testimony and receive such evidence as it \n     may deem advisable: Provided, That the Commission shall \n     conduct public meetings in Tutuila, Ofu, Olosega, and Tau;\n       (B) use the United States mail in the same manner and upon \n     the same conditions as departments and agencies of the United \n     States; and\n       (C) within available funds, incur such expenses and enter \n     into contracts or agreements for studies and surveys with \n     public and private organizations and transfer funds to \n     Federal agencies to carry out the Commission's functions.\n       (2) Within funds available for the Commission, the \n     Secretary of the Interior shall provide such office space, \n     furnishings, equipment, staff, and fiscal and administrative \n     services as the Commission may require.\n       (3) The President, upon request of the Commission, may \n     direct the head of any Federal agency or department to assist \n     the Commission and if so directed such head shall--\n       (A) furnish the Commission to the extent permitted by law \n     and within available appropriations such information as may \n     be necessary for carrying out the functions of the Commission \n     and as may be available to or procurable by such department \n     or agency; and\n       (B) detail to temporary duty with the Commission on a \n     reimbursable basis such personnel within his administrative \n     jurisdiction as the Commission may need or believe to be \n     useful for carrying out its functions, each such detail to be \n     without loss of seniority, pay or other employee status.\n       (e) Chairman. Subject to general policies that the \n     Commission may adopt, the Chairman of the Commission shall be \n     the chief executive officer of the Commission and shall \n     exercise its executive and administrative\n\n[[Page S738]]\n\n     powers. The Chairman may make such provisions as he may deem \n     appropriate authorizing the performance of his executive and \n     administrative functions by the staff of the Commission.\n       (f) Funding. There are hereby authorized to be appropriated \n     to the Secretary of the Interior such sums as may be \n     necessary, but not to exceed an average of $300,000 per year, \n     in fiscal years 1997, 1998 and 1999 for the work of the \n     Commission.\n       (f) Termination. The Commission shall terminate three \n     months after the transmission of the report and \n     recommendations under subsection (c)(2).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 211. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend the \nperiod of time for the manifestation of chronic disabilities due to \nundiagnosed symptoms in veterans who served in the Persian Gulf war in \norder for those disabilities to be compensable by the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs; to the Committee on Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n         The Persian Gulf War Veterans Compensation Act of 1997\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased and proud to \nintroduce a bill today that will address a serious problem faced by \nmany Persian Gulf veterans--the denial of their claims for VA \ncompensation based solely on the fact that their symptoms arose more \nthan 2 years after they last served in the gulf. This bill is a \ncompanion to H.R. 466 introduced recently by Congressman Lane Evans, \nranking minority member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and an \noutstanding, energetic, and dedicated veterans' advocate.\n  This bill would extend from 2 to 10 years the time by which a veteran \nmust develop symptoms after departing the gulf to be eligible to file \nfor VA disability compensation.\n  While this legislation is simple and straight forward, there are a \nnumber of reasons that I am introducing it that require some \nelaboration.\n  Over a month ago Congressman Evans and I sent a joint letter to VA \nSecretary Jesse Brown asking him to administratively extend the \npresumptive period from 2 to 10 years. We pointed out that the VA had \ndenied about 95 percent of Persian gulf veterans' claims for \nundiagnosed illnesses and noted that in House testimony last March \nSecretary Brown himself said that ``most of the people we are denying, \na large percentage of the people that we are denying, do not have a \ndisease within the 2-year period.'' The Secretary added that there was \na need to examine health problems emerging after that time period.\n  Mr. President, our letter also noted that continuing disclosures \nabout possible exposures of our troops in the gulf to chemical weapons \nmake it clear that it may take many years before we have a full \nunderstanding of what occurred during the Persian Gulf war and how \nthese events affected our veterans. In closing, we stressed that gulf \nwar veterans must be given the benefit of the doubt.\n  Although Secretary Brown has not yet replied to our letter, I know \nthat he is a fearless and deeply committed advocate of our Nation's \nveterans and fully shares my view that America's veterans must always \nbe given the benefit of the doubt. Under his leadership, the VA is now \nreviewing 11,000 cases to ensure that Persian Gulf veterans are indeed \ngiven the benefit of the doubt in the development and adjudication of \ntheir compensation claims.\n  Secretary Brown, at the request of President Clinton, is formulating \na plan to expand the deadline for compensation which is to be submitted \nto the President in March. I anticipate that the administration will \nextend the deadline and believe that when this occurs they'll want \ncongressional authorization. This bill is intended to grant them that \nauthority.\n\n  Mr. President, so that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nbetter understand my reasons for introducing this bill and why I \nbelieve the administration must and will extend the deadline for filing \ngulf war claims, permit me to list some of the key factors involved:\n  Sick Persian Gulf veterans shouldn't be kept in limbo, waiting years \nfor the completion of research that should have been done years ago on \nthe long-term health effects of low-level exposures to chemical and \nother agents;\n  In this connection, the experience of atomic veterans for over 50 \nyears is hardly encouraging, with disputes among scientists persisting \nabout the long-term effects of exposure to low-level radiation and \nabout the validity of U.S. Government-funded radiation dose \nreconstructions--dose reconstructions which continue to be a major \nfactor in denial of the vast majority of atomic veterans' claims for VA \ncompensation;\n  While I'm pleased that research is finally taking place after a delay \nof over 5 years stemming from DOD's contention that there were no \nchemical exposures and that low-level exposures had no health effects, \nI fear there is a possibility that the etiology of Persian Gulf \nillnesses may never be known because needed scientific data was not \ncollected immediately after the war and because of the complexity of \nfiguring out the synergistic effects of various combinations of harmful \nagents present during the gulf war.\n  DOD and CIA are developing new information about possible chemical \nand other exposures during the gulf war that could further complicate \nthe search for the causes of illnesses, while the media sometimes carry \ncontradictory reports on such exposures that add to the uncertainties \nand anxieties of veterans and their families;\n  There are a number of serious diseases that are not manifested until \n10 years or more after initial exposure to harmful agents.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to the brave \nMinnesota veterans of Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm whom I met \nwith over a month ago. These Minnesota veterans who are my mentors told \nme about the illnesses and symptoms they developed after the war, \nincluding skin rashes, hair loss, reproductive problems, memory loss, \nheadaches, aching joints, and internal bleeding. They said that they \nare scared to death about their health problems. I was deeply moved by \ntheir accounts and pledged to do all I could to help them. Moreover, I \nwas distressed to learn that as of last month, out of 171 Minnesota \ngulf veterans who had filed disability claims, only 18 were receiving \nfull or partial disability benefits.\n  As part of an action plan to help Minnesota gulf veterans, I told \nthem that Congressman Evans and I were writing to Secretary Brown to \nextend the 2-year period to 10 years. This initiative was supported \nboth by Minnesota Persian Gulf veterans and State veterans' leaders and \nthe bill I'm now introducing is a logical followup to the letter sent \nto Secretary Brown.\n  I am very pleased to note that this legislation is supported by the \nAmerican Legion and the Vietnam Veterans of America and I urge my \ncolleagues to join these organizations in strongly supporting this \nbill.\n  I dedicate this bill to the patriotic and courageous Minnesota \nveterans who served in the Persian Gulf war.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 211\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Persian Gulf War Veterans \n     Compensation Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF PRESUMPTIVE PERIOD FOR MANIFESTATION OF \n                   CHRONIC DISABILITIES DUE TO UNDIAGNOSED \n                   SYMPTOMS IN VETERANS WHO SERVED IN THE PERSIAN \n                   GULF WAR.\n\n       Subsection (b) of section 1117 of title 38, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(b) The provisions of subsection (a) shall apply in the \n     case of a disability of a veteran becoming manifest within 10 \n     years after the last date on which the veteran performed \n     active military, naval, or air service in the Southwest Asia \n     theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 212. A bill to increase the maximum Federal Pell Grant award in \norder to allow more American students to afford higher education, and \nto express the sense of the Senate; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n        The Affordable Higher Education Through Pell Grants Act\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on January 21 I cosponsored S. 212, the \nSenate leadership's version of President Clinton's education tax \ndeduction and credit plan. As an educator for 20\n\n[[Page S739]]\n\nyears and a Senator who believes in education, I couldn't be more \nenthusiastic that the President and the leadership have chosen to \ninvest $35 billion over the next 5 years into higher education in this \ncountry. This is a marvelous goal and I support it without hesitation.\n  When it comes to investing a large sum of money into education, with \nthe goal of making education more affordable for more students and \nworking families, I think that it is important to explore every viable \noption. The tax system is one way to distribute money to working \nfamilies. Another existing system is the Pell Grant Program, which is \nalready geared toward targeting money at the students who are most \nlikely not to attend college because of a lack of funds. Currently, \nPell Grants go almost exclusively to lower income families. But that is \nnot how Pell was designed. It was designed to reach families based on \ntheir need, not based on their income. If the Pell Grant Program were \nto be funded up to its authorized level, it would be of great benefit \nto many middle-class families as well as lower middle-class families. \nBecause Pell is a proven entity and a great deal could be gained by \ninvesting in it, I rise today to introduce a second option on how to \nbring higher education into the reach of more Americans.\n  It is both saddening and shameful that in this country, the best \npredictor of attending college is the family income. We have engineered \na system in this country where the doors to college are closed for \nthose who have the most to gain from higher education. Only 16 percent \nof college freshmen come from households earning $20,000 a year or \nless. Only half of them actually graduate by age 24, and those that \ndrop out cite the expense of college as their No. 1 concern. Clearly, \nwe are doing an inadequate job of addressing the financial needs of our \nNation's college bound youth. According to David Wessel of the Wall \nStreet Journal, three-quarters of higher income students attend \ncollege. Half of middle income students attend college. But just one-\nquarter of poorest income students attend college.\n  As reported by the New York Times, ``the impact of [financial \npressures on the poor] has been camouflaged by the steady growth in \ncollege attendance by more affluent students and by older people. But \nstudents from poor families have increasingly been left behind.'' The \nproportion of students earning college degrees by age 24 from families \nin the richest quarter of the population has jumped from 31 percent in \n1979 to 79 percent in 1994. But the rate among students from families \nin the poorest population over the exact same years, 1979 to 1994, has \nstayed dead flat at 8 percent.\n  Looked at another way, affluent students in 1979 were 4 times more \nlikely to graduate from college at 24 than poor students, but 10 times \nmore likely in 1994. According to Thomas Mortenson, a higher education \npolicy analyst in Iowa City, ``there has been a redistribution of \neducational opportunity. We have a greater inequality of educational \nattainment by age 24 than at any time during the last 25 years. Lower \nincome kids are having a terrible time in higher education.''\n  Mr. President, 25 years ago, the Pell Program was created to respond \nto these discrepancies. The goal of Pell grants was to target funds \ntoward those families that were likely to send their children to \ncollege but couldn't afford to. Consequently, Pell grants have no \nincome limit. Even a family with a very high income is eligible for \nPell, if it can be shown that they have need--for example, if they have \nseveral children and all the kids are in college, they are supposed to \nfall under the umbrella of the Pell Program. Pell grant awards go first \nto the neediest students, and are phased out as need decreases.\n\n  It was hoped that the Pell Program would pay off in three very \nimportant ways. First, it would enable more motivated but financially \ninsecure students to gain the skills necessary to have productive \nlives. Second, it would increase the number of students enrolled in \ninstitutions of higher learning, and therefore reduce the cost of \nhigher education for everyone. Third, it would provide to the Nation \nall the wonderful benefits of a well-educated population--a skilled \nwork force, an improved ability to compete with other nations, a more \nfinancially secure country.\n  The Pell Grant Program has done a world of good. Over the 25 years, \n68.2 million awards have been given out to an estimated 30 million \nstudents. Millions of lower income students have been able to attend \ncollege thanks to Pell. While Pell itself has been unable to actually \nreduce college tuitions, it is frightening to imagine how expensive \ncolleges would be without the Pell Program, and how few lower income \nfamilies would be able to obtain diplomas. In terms of overall effect \nof the Pell Program on our country, it is almost impossible to \noverstate the significance of having educated so many people who \notherwise would have been unlikely to have increased their standard of \nliving and the standards of their families and those around them.\n  When Pell was created, it bore a price tag of $47.5 million--in 1971 \ndollars, $118 million in 1997 dollars--and benefited 176,000 grant \nrecipients. By 1980 it aided 2.7 million students, and today, the Pell \nGrant Program invests $6.4 billion a year into the education of 3.6 \nmillion grant recipients a year. We should not misinterpret the growth \nof this program as having successfully met the need for the program; \nhowever, Pell Grants are something of which the Congress should be \nextremely proud.\n  Let me explain how the Pell Program works, and how it manages to \ninvest money right where it is needed. The formula is simple. First, \nthe ``expected family contribution'' is determined through a formula \nused for all Federal student aid programs. The nickname for the \nexpected family contribution is EFC. The EFC takes into account the \nfamily income, the number of dependents in the family, the number of \nfamily members currently receiving aid or attending college, and \ncertain assets if the family earns more than $50,000 a year.\n  Here's an example. A typical two-earner family with an income of \n$50,000 that has one dependent child in college would be expected to \ncontribute $4,000 per year toward their child's education. The EFC is \nthen subtracted from the maximum Pell Grant award, which under current \nlaw is authorized to be $4,500. If you add up the cost of the child's \ntuition, fees, room, board, and books and it comes out to more than \n$4,500, then that family could expect to receive $500 in Pell grants.\n  This example also succeeds in demonstrating the problem with the Pell \ngrant system. Currently, the Pell maximum award is, indeed, authorized \nto be $4,500. However, because there was not enough money available for \nthe Pell Program last year, the appropriators lowered the Pell maximum \naward to only $2,700. That means that the average three person family, \nwhich I have described above, will not receive a Pell grant award if \ntheir income is over $38,600.\n\n  You see, Pell, as originally designed, is supposed to benefit the \nmiddle class. But for this to be successful, enough money must be \nallocated to the program so that the appropriations process can provide \nthe statutory maximum award for each student.\n  But this has seldom happened over the years. While the statute sets \nthe maximum award, limited funds available for the program have meant \nthat appropriations language has almost always reduced the maximum \naward.\n  Because the appropriations process reduces the maximum Pell award \nevery year, the purchasing power of Pell grants has dwindled in \nrelation to college costs. During the 80's and 90's, college costs have \nincreased at an annual rate of between 5 percent and 8 percent, \nincreases that have always outpaced inflation. In 1980, the average \nPell award of $882 paid 26 percent of the total annual cost of \nattendance for a 4-year public institution--$3,409--as compared to \ntoday, when the average award of $1,579 pays only 16 percent of total \ncosts of $9,649. This, in light of the fact that, as stated in the \nHigher Education Act, the purpose of the Pell Grant Program is to \nprovide an award that ``in combination with reasonable family and \nstudent contribution and--other Federal grant aid--will meet at least \n75 percent of a student's cost of attendance.''\n  In real dollars, appropriations for the Pell Grant Program have \nincreased by almost 50 percent since 1980. However, the appropriated \nmaximum grant has\n\n[[Page S740]]\n\nincreased only 34 percent, which means that if inflation is factored \nin, the maximum award has fallen 13 percent. The result is that few \nfamilies with incomes above $30,000 are likely to qualify for Pell. \nLast year, 54 percent of Pell recipients had incomes of less than \n$10,000.\n  This is where the bill I introduce today comes in. At a similar cost \nto the President's tax deduction and credit proposals--$35 billion over \n5 years--my bill would increase the maximum Pell grant award to $5,000 \nfrom the present level of $2,700, thus bringing the award to the level \nat which it was created, adjusted for inflation. With the maximum \nincreased, two intents would be accomplished. First, lower income \nstudents would be entitled to a larger award, thus having more \nopportunity to attend college. Second, because the maximum is \nincreased, more students--including students from middle income \nfamilies--would be eligible for Pell grants.\n  Here are a few illustrations. Under current law, a single, \nindependent student with no children is ineligible for even a minimum \nPell grant award if she has an income of over $9,800. My bill would \neffectively double the income eligibility; a single student with no \nchildren with an income of over $16,200 would still be eligible for \nPell. If that student is a single parent, with two children, her income \ncould be as high as $50,600 and she would still be eligible for Pell, \nas opposed to current law, which would eliminate her eligibility at an \nincome of $38,800.\n  Parents trying to put a dependent child through college would also \nbenefit from this bill. For example, a two-parent family with one child \nin college under current law is eligible only if their income is lower \nthan $38,600. My bill would raise this eligibility to just under \n$50,000. Under Pell as it exists today, a family with four children in \ncollege receives the minimum award for each of their children as long \nas their income is lower than $72,600. Under this bill, an average \nfamily with four children in college would receive the minimum award \nfor each child even if their income was as high as $107,300.\n\n  Now let me take a moment to explain why my proposal and the Clinton \nproposal are so deserving of the attention and support of this body.\n  These days, parents putting children through college, and young \nadults trying to do it on their own, are facing an increasingly \ndaunting challenge. According to the college board, tuition costs have \ngone up more than 40 percent since 1985. Expressed in constant 1994 \ndollars, in 1985 tuition at the average private college was $10,058. By \n1994, it was $14,486--a 44 percent increase. The average public college \ntuition was $2,095 in 1985. By 1994, it was $2,948--a 41 percent \nincrease.\n  Last year alone, college tuition went up 6 percent, more than double \nthe rate of inflation. Since 1980, college tuition has risen faster \nthan medical costs, and more than twice as fast as family income.\n  For the last 10 years, tuition increases at State universities, \ncommunity colleges, and technical colleges in Minnesota have ranged \nfrom 2 to almost 9 percent every single year. The largest trend in \ntuition increases began in the early 1980's. Since then, tuition at the \nUniversity of Minnesota has risen 264 percent while the Consumer Price \nIndex has gone up 71 percent--available chart shows only the increase \nbetween 1981 and 1992, that is why its numbers are smaller. Next \nacademic year, a freshman at the UM Liberal Arts College will pay \n$3,618, plus a higher activity fee, plus a new $135 computing fee.\n  All over Minnesota--at private schools, public universities and \ncolleges--tuition is going up faster than personal disposable income \nper capita.\n  Meanwhile, Government and private aid has declined. Federal \nappropriations for student aid fell 9 percent between 1980 and 1993 \nwhile States allocations fell 13 percent between 1986 and 1992. \nCorporate and private giving is far too small to offset these declines. \nLast year, the Federal Government spent nearly 40 percent less than it \ndid the year before to help young people in Minnesota pay for college \nwith Perkins loans. That's $1.5 million less in loans--3,214 fewer \nstudents getting help with their educations. Overall, public subsidies \nto higher education have shrunk from 45 percent of higher education's \nrevenues in 1980 to 35 percent today, most of it to public \nuniversities. Today, more than 80 percent of America's college students \nstudy at public universities.\n  The trend in Federal aid to post-secondary students is towards more \nloans and away from grants. Although more money is now available to \ncollege students, a greater proportion of it must be paid back. \nAccording to the college board, the Federal Government invested 80 \npercent of its higher education budget into Grants and only 20 percent \nin loans. Today, those numbers are almost exactly reversed. This is a \ntrend that affects poorer students much more than those who are \nwealthier, as poor students are forced to ask themselves--what if I \ndon't graduate, what will I do with my debt? For these students, Pell \nGrants are a lifeline that keeps being pulled out of their reach.\n  Between 1985 and 1994, the share of college costs covered by the \nmaximum Pell grant has steadily fallen for all types of institutions. \nFor example, at a private university, a Pell Grant covered about 17 \npercent the cost of attendance in 1985. By 1994, that fell to about 10 \npercent. Similarly, at a public university, a Pell Grant paid for about \n50 percent of college costs in 1985. In 1994, that figure was down to \nabout 30 percent.\n  As a result, the average debt of those emerging from higher education \ngrows at a rate much greater than inflation. Six-and-a-half million \nstudents, nearly half of the Nation's enrollment, have loans totaling \n$23.8 billion. Student borrowing has grown at an average rate of 22 \npercent per year since 1990, outpacing personal income growth four \ntimes over.\n  At Moorehead State University in Moorehead, MN, students are \ngraduating with a staggering amount of debt. The average student \ngraduating this spring who finished her degree in 4 years owes $10,762. \nFor those who take 5 years to graduate, their debt is even higher, an \naverage of $11,450. Those figures are both much higher than only 4 \nyears ago.\n  The Minnesota State Colleges and Universities report that students \ngraduating from 2-year colleges incur debt of $8,000 to $10,000. Those \nattending State universities are coming out of school with $15,000 to \n$20,000 of debt.\n  It should be no surprise that defaults cost the Federal Government \nover $2 billion a year.\n  It's not only students that are increasingly saddled with debt. \nParents are borrowing more and more in order to finance their \nchildren's educations. The average loan in the PLUS Program--parental \nloans for undergraduate students--between 1992 and 1993 jumped from \n$3,260 to $4,525. In addition, the loan volume for the program grew by \n26 percent.\n  If you are a student planning to attend college, or a parent planning \non paying for your child, you'd better start saving now. Even if you \nplan to send your child to a State school, and even if you start saving \n17 years in advance, you are going to have to start putting away a \nchunk of change.\n  Put together, rising costs of education and decreasing Government aid \nspells a greater burden on students and their families--a burden that \nis often impossible to initiate, and at times, if attempted, impossible \nto sustain.\n  But it's crazy for us to allow this to go on. Education is the key to \nthe economic security of this Nation. By the year 2000, 50 percent of \nall new jobs will require a college education. It is not only our duty \nand obligation to assist these students in their higher education \nendeavors, it is essential for our country's future.\n  Higher education pays off. Every year of higher education increases \nan individual's income between 6 and 12 percent. In fact, a college-\neducated male earns 83% more during his lifetime than a noncollege-\neducated male.\n  Education is married to earnings potential. A high school dropout can \nexpect to earn, on average, under $13,000 a year; a high school \ngraduate, under $19,000; while a college graduate can earn over $32,000 \nand a master's degree recipient can earn over $40,000; a doctoral \nrecipient can earn over $54,000; and a professional degree recipient \nearns, on average, over $74,000.\n\n  A recent survey of managers showed that an investment in the \neducational\n\n[[Page S741]]\n\nlevel of their work force resulted in twice the return in increased \nproductivity of a comparable increase in work hours and nearly three \ntimes the return of an investment in capital stock.\n  Data from the Society of Research also reveals that poverty rate \ndeclines as education levels increase. According to the 1992 Census, \nalmost a quarter of the children under the age of 6 in the United \nStates live in poverty. For many, the opportunity for a higher \neducation lies only in the availability of Pell grants. Therefore, the \nPell Grant Program is integral in breaking the chain of poverty. In \nfact, a national study conducted in 1995 revealed that AFDC recipients \nreceiving financial aid are 80 percent more likely to graduate college \nand obtain permanent jobs.\n  Families who live in the middle or higher socio-economic bracket will \nsend their children to college regardless of available financial \nassistance. Such is not the case for low income groups. Cut backs in \nfinancial assistance correlate to lack of enrollment and long term \nattendance among lower socio-economic groups. Without the availability \nof Pell grants, low income students will not have the opportunity for \nadvanced degrees.\n  Mr. President, these are the reasons that I am introducing this bill. \nUltimately, education is what separates those who achieve from those \nwho can never realize the American Dream. The Government needs to \ninvest in its citizens if democracy is to flourish, if we are to \ncompete in the global marketplace, and if we are to live up to our \nresponsibility to the American people.\n  As we plan for our country's future and that of its youth, let us be \nsure that a higher education is available and accessible for all. Let's \ncreate a system in the 21st century in which the No. 1 predictor of \ncollege attendance is not income, but rather desire.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 212 and to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 212\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Arenson)\n\n       As state governments keep whittling away their support for \n     higher education, tuition at public institutions is likely to \n     continue rising as financial aid shrinks, moving college \n     further beyond the reach of poor students, education experts \n     say.\n       ``There has been a redistribution of educational \n     opportunity,'' said Thomas G. Mortenson, a higher education \n     policy analyst in Iowa City and a senior scholar at the \n     National Council of Educational Opportunity Associations in \n     Washington.\n       To some experts, New York State is a case in point. Earlier \n     this month, Gov. George E. Pataki proposed to increase \n     tuition at New York's public universities by $400 a year and \n     reduce state aid for the state's neediest students. Tuition \n     at both the State University colleges and City University \n     would rise to $3,600 a year at CUNY's four-year colleges and \n     $3,800 a year at SUNY's.\n       Governor Pataki's proposals are not certain to be adopted; \n     the Legislature rejected similar cuts last year. But experts \n     say that higher tuition and reduced aid are inevitable.\n       ``It's not this 400 bucks that Governor Pataki is \n     proposing, it's the general pattern,'' said Arthur Levine, \n     president of Teachers College at Columbia University.\n       At the City University of New York, which charged no \n     tuition until 1976, tuition now accounts for 43 percent of \n     the four-year college's budget, up from 19 percent seven \n     years ago, CUNY's current budget proposal shows. Students \n     there say any increases strain their stretched personal \n     budgets.\n       ``If tuition goes up, I don't think I will have to drop \n     out, but it will not be pleasant,'' said Michelle Whitfield, \n     a 34-year-old Harlem resident who is a voice student at \n     Brooklyn College's Conservatory of Music.\n       She works 30 hours a week as a temporary worker doing word \n     processing on Wall Street to pay for college and to support \n     herself and her elderly mother. She earns too much to qualify \n     for financial aid, she said, but had to withdraw from college \n     last spring when she ran out of money. Although she is back \n     in school, she said she might have to sit out future \n     semesters if costs rise.\n       Higher-income and middle-income students have been going to \n     college in evergreater numbers as college becomes an \n     increasingly important factor in earning a decent salary. But \n     lower-income students are going in about the same proportions \n     that they did in the 1970's.\n       For decades, public universities have remained an important \n     source of higher education for those who cannot afford \n     private institutions. Today, more than 80 percent of \n     America's college students study at public universities.\n       But while these universities are still considerably less \n     expensive than most private colleges, they, too, are \n     increasingly pricing themselves beyond the means of the \n     poorest Americans, experts say.\n       Morton Owen Schapiro, dean at the University of Southern \n     California and a specialist in the economics of higher \n     education, said that tuition at public colleges and \n     universities had risen by an annual average of 4 percent to \n     4.5 percent after inflation since the late 1970's, well ahead \n     of the growth in financial aid.\n       ``That is going to hurt a lot of people,'' he said, adding \n     that while some private colleges offer generous financial aid \n     to needy students, most of them go to public institutions.\n       He and Michael S. McPherson, president of Macalester \n     College in St. Paul, Minn., have found that public subsidies \n     to higher education have shrunk from 45 percent of higher \n     education's revenues in 1980 to 35 percent today--most of it \n     to public universities.\n       Compounding the financial problems of many students are \n     continuing cuts in financial aid. Federal Pell grants, aimed \n     at helping the nation's neediest students pay expenses other \n     than tuition, now amount to a maximum of $2,700 for students \n     at public four-year colleges. Mr. Mortenson calculates that \n     had they kept pace with inflation, they would amount to more \n     than $5,500 today.\n       For many students, state tuition support has declined, too. \n     For 20 years, New York's Tuition Assistance Program--\n     available to students with incomes below a certain level--had \n     always covered tuition at the public universities for \n     students who qualified. But in 1995, New York reduced the \n     maximum award for public university students to 90 percent of \n     tuition.\n       And now Governor Pataki has again proposed that students \n     who receive Pell grants are well as state tuition assistance \n     should receive less from the state program.\n       To some extent, the impact of these financial pressures has \n     been camouflaged by the steady growth in college attendance \n     by more affluent students and by older people. But students \n     from poor families have increasingly been left behind.\n       Mr. Mortenson has found that the proportion of students \n     earning college degrees by age 24 from families in the \n     richest quarter of the population (in 1994, those with \n     incomes above $65,000) has jumped sharply, to 79 percent in \n     1994 from 31 percent in 1979. But the rate among students \n     from families in the poorest population (with 1994 incomes \n     below $22,000) stayed flat over the same years, at about 8 \n     percent.\n       Looking at the trend another way, affluent students were \n     nearly four times as likely as the poorest ones to graduate \n     from college by age 24 in 1979, but nearly 10 times as likely \n     in 1994. ``We have greater inequality of educational \n     attainment by age 24 than at any time in the last 25 years,'' \n     Mr. Mortenson said. ``Lower income kids are having a terrible \n     time in higher education.''\n       In 1995, City University surveyed 545 CUNY students who had \n     left the university system even though they were in good \n     academic standing. Thirty-four percent cited lack of money or \n     the need to work as the reason. When the City University \n     raised tuition by $750 in 1995 and New York State cut \n     financial aid, the university saw a sudden drop in \n     undergraduates: 138,000 students enrolled at its four-year \n     colleges, 4,500 fewer than the previous year and about 6,500 \n     fewer than projected.\n       ``I am convinced that the reason was simply financial,'' \n     said the university's Chancellor, W. Ann Reynolds. ``Students \n     needed to have much more cash on the barrel. I am convinced \n     that we are denying opportunity for poor students to go to \n     college.''\n       City University, the nation's largest urban university \n     system, has the highest percentage of students in poverty: \n     about 40 percent of the 139,000 undergraduates at its four-\n     year colleges come from households with incomes of less than \n     420,000. More than half of all undergraduates--85,000--\n     qualify for Pell grants, and 72,000 get tuition assistance \n     from New York State.\n       Still, more than half of the students also work: 27 percent \n     hold full-time jobs and 32 percent work part time--many to \n     support their own families, because 29 percent have children.\n\n[[Page S742]]\n\n       Even with multiple sources of support, many City University \n     students encounter financial problems, which are reflected in \n     their frequent moves in and out of school and the longer time \n     they take to graduate.\n       Abdul Khan, a 36-year-old immigrant from Pakistan and an \n     engineering major at City College, has been forced to skip \n     semesters because his full-time job at a newsstand--which \n     pays $13,000 a year--leaves little extra money after living \n     expenses. If costs rise further, he said, ``maybe I can take \n     one semester every year.''\n       Mr. Mortenson, the analyst of higher education, said that \n     if financial aid is not increased, one answer for students \n     like Mr. Khan may be to take out more loans--an often \n     unpalatable option for those unsure they will be able to \n     finish college.\n       David Torres, a 35-year-old psychology major at Brooklyn \n     College who lives in Ozone Park, Queens, said he had weighed \n     taking out a loan, now that he has exhausted his state \n     tuition assistance.\n       ``But loans terrify me,'' he said. ``What if I don't finish \n     and can't pay if off? It's scary.''\n       Mr. Mortenson has an answer for students like Mr. Torres.\n       ``What I tell kids,'' he said, ``is that as scary as paying \n     for college is, you have to go. The only thing more expensive \n     than going to college is not going to college.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 213. A bill to amend section 223 of the Communications Act of 1934 \nto repeal amendments on obscene and harassing use of telecommunications \nfacilities made by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 and to \nrestore the provisions of such section on such use in effect before the \nenactment of the Communications Decency Act of 1996; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n    legislation to repeal the internet censorship provisions of the \n                       communications decency act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to repeal the \nInternet censorship law that the 104th Congress hastily passed as part \nof the new Telecommunications Act. I vigorously opposed the so-called \nCommunications Decency Act, along with Senator Feingold, as \nunnecessary, unworkable and--most significantly--unconstitutional.\n  So far, every court to consider this law has agreed with us that the \nCommunications Decency Act flunks the constitutionality test. Two \nseparate panels of Federal judges in Pennsylvania and New York have \ndetermined that the Internet censorship law serves as an \nunconstitutional ban on constitutionally protected indecent speech \nbetween and among adults communicating on-line. The first amendment to \nour Constitution will not tolerate this level of governmental intrusion \ninto what people say to each other over computer networks. The matter \nis now before the Supreme Court, which will hear argument on this case \nin March.\n  We will be ready to pass this bill and repeal the Internet censorship \nlaw as soon as the Supreme Court acts--as I am confident they will--to \nstrike down the law as unconstitutional. I exhort the Supreme Court to \nmake clear that we do not forfeit our first amendment rights when we go \non-line. Only such guidance will stop wrong-headed efforts in Congress \nand in State legislatures to censor the Internet.\n  The first amendment to our Constitution expressly states that \n``Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.'' The CDA \nflouts that prohibition for the sake of political posturing and in the \nname of protecting our children. Giving full-force to the first \namendment on-line would not be a victory for obscenity or child \npornography. This would be a victory for the first amendment and for \nAmerican technology.\n  Let us be emphatically clear that the people at risk of committing a \nfelony under the CDA are not child pornographers, purveyors of obscene \nmaterials or child sex molesters. These people can already be \nprosecuted and should be prosecuted under longstanding Federal criminal \nlaws that prevent the distribution over computer networks of obscene \nand other pornographic materials harmful to minors, under 18 U.S.C. \nsections 1465, 2252, and 2423(a); that prohibit the illegal \nsolicitation of a minor by way of a computer network, under 18 U.S.C \nsection 2252; and that bar the illegal luring of a minor into sexual \nactivity through computer conversations, under 18 U.S.C section \n2423(b). In fact, we recently passed unanimously a new law that sharply \nincreases penalties for people who commit these crimes.\n  There is absolutely no disagreement in the Senate about wanting to \nprotect children from harm. All 100 Senators, no matter where they are \nfrom, would agree that obscenity and child pornography should be kept \nout of the hands of children and that those who sexually exploit \nchildren or abuse children should be vigorously prosecuted. As a former \nprosecutor, I have prosecuted people for abusing children. This is \nsomething where there are no political or ideological differences among \nus.\n  But that is not the issue before us. In the heated debate over \ncensoring the Internet, I fear that many Members, who have never used a \ncomputer let alone surfed the Internet, may have been under the \nmisapprehension that the Internet is full of sexually explicit \nmaterial. While such material may be accessible on the Internet, one \ncourt estimated that ``the percentage of Internet addresses providing \nsexually explicit content would be well less than one-tenth of 1 \npercent of such addresses'' and that ``as much as 30 percent of the \nsexually explicit material currently available on the Internet \noriginates in foreign countries.'' Shea versus Reno, 930 F. Supp. 916, \n931, S.D.N.Y. 1996. Banning indecent material from the Internet is like \nusing a meat cleaver to deal with the problems better addressed with a \nscalpel.\n  We all want to protect our children from offensive or indecent online \nmaterials. But we must be careful that the means we use to protect our \nchildren does not do more harm than good. We can already control the \naccess our children have to indecent material with blocking \ntechnologies available for free from some online service providers and \nfor a relatively low cost from software manufacturers. At some point we \nought to stop saying the Government is going to make a determination of \nwhat we read and see, the Government will determine what our children \nhave or do not have. Let us encourage the technology that empowers \nparents--not the government--to make choices for about what is best for \ntheir children.\n  The CDA is a terribly misguided effort to protect children that \ninstead tramples on the free speech rights of all Americans who want to \nenjoy this medium. The Internet censorship law takes a blunderbuss \napproach that puts all Internet users at risk of committing a crime. It \npenalizes with 2-year jail terms and large fines anyone who transmits \nindecent material to a minor, or displays or posts indecent material in \nareas where a minor can see it. By criminalizing what is vaguely \nreferred to as ``indecent'' speech, this law imposes far-reaching new \nFederal crimes on Americans for exercising their free speech rights on-\nline and on the Internet.\n  What strikes some people as indecent or patently offensive may look \nvery different to other people in another part of the country. Given \nthese differences, a vague ban on patently offensive and indecent \ncommunications may make us feel good but threatens to drive off the \nInternet and computer networks an unimaginable amount of valuable \npolitical, artistic, scientific, health and other speech. Let me give a \ncouple of examples of what is at risk.\n\n  A university professor would risk prosecution by making available on-\nline to a freshman literature class excerpts from certain classics, \nsuch as Catcher in the Rye or Of Mice and Men, all of which have been \nchallenged in a number of communities as indecent for minors.\n  Forwarding to a child an on-line version of Seventeen magazine, which \nis a frequently challenged school library material, might violate this \nlaw, even though children are free to buy the magazine at newsstands.\n  An e-mail message from one teenager to another with certain four-\nletter swear words would violate this law.\n  Museums with Web sites will think twice before posting images of \nclassic nude paintings or sculptures showing sexual organs, that are \nsuspect under the new censorship law.\n  On-line discussions about AIDS and other sexually transmitted \ndiseases may be illegal under this new law. No one knows.\n  Advertisements that would be perfectly legal in print could subject \nthe advertiser to criminal liability if circulated on-line.\n  In short, the Internet censorship law leaves in the hands of the most \naggressive prosecutor in the least tolerant\n\n[[Page S743]]\n\ncommunity the power to set standards for what every other Internet user \nmay say on-line.\n  In bookstores and on library shelves, the protections of the first \namendment are clear. The courts are unwavering in the protection of \nindecent speech. Altering the protections of the first amendment for \nonline communications could cripple this new mode of communication.\n  The Internet is an American technology that has swept around the \nworld. As its popularity has grown, so have efforts to censor it in \nGermany, in China, in Singapore, and other countries. We should be \nleading the efforts to keep the Internet uncensored, and taking the \nhigh ground to champion first amendment freedoms. Instead, however, the \nCommunications Decency Act tramples on the principles of free speech \nand free flow of information that has fueled the growth of this medium.\n  Let us get this new unconstitutional law off the books as soon as \npossible. This bill would repeal the provisions of Communications \nDecency Act that result in a ban of constitutionally protected on-line \nspeech, and simply restores the provisions of section 223 of the \nCommunications Act of 1934 in effect before passage of the CDA.\n  Mr. President, in the last Congress this body and the other body \npassed a piece of legislation called the Communications Decency Act. It \nwas done I believe because many felt a concern about what might be seen \nby children on the Internet. Unfortunately--and I said this at the time \non the floor--the bill is overly broad. It stepped into the first \namendment in a way that would not have been done with anything else.\n  We would not have gone down the road of trampling on the first \namendment and say that we would have to close down all magazine stores \nbecause they might sell a magazine, which while acceptable to adults \nmight be objectionable to children. We would never say that we would \nclose every library in the country, including the Library of Congress, \nbecause it may have books there that while acceptable to all adults \nmight not be acceptable to children. And we would never pass a law to \nclose down a publishing house because it published books that might be \nacceptable to adults but unacceptable to children.\n  But basically that is what we said we would do with the Internet. We \nsaid that even though the Internet may be providing something that is \nacceptable to adults, we would basically close down large segments of \nit with criminal penalties because it might have something unacceptable \nto children.\n  The first amendment to our Constitution says that Congress shall make \nno law abridging the freedom of speech. And what the CDA, or the \nCommunications Decency Act, did was to go way beyond what we believe \nthe first amendment stands for. I do not in any way hold any brief for \nchild pornographers or child abusers. I am one of the few people in \nthis body who have sent child abusers to prison. Whenever I had \nsomebody who was involved in child molestation or abusing when I was \nthe prosecutor, I prosecuted this as a top priority in my office and \nsought the strongest penalties possible. Everyone, whether parents or \ngrandparents, would do everything possible to stop anybody from abusing \nour children. As parents, we would take the responsibility to make sure \nthat our children are protected from offensive or indecent material, \nwhether it is online, or the Internet, or elsewhere.\n  But, unfortunately, no matter what every single one of us feel, \nRepublicans or Democrats, or no matter where we are from, the CDA is a \nterribly misguided effort to protect children that instead tramples on \nthe free speech of all Americans who want to use the Internet. It takes \na blunderbuss approach. It puts all Internet users at risk of \ncommitting a crime. It penalizes by a 2-year jail term and large fines \nanyone who transmits indecent material to a minor, or places or posts \nindecent material in areas where a minor might see it--not whether they \ndo or not but they might.\n  What this means is a university professor risks prosecution by making \navailable online to a freshman literature class excerpts from Catcher \nin the Rye, or Of Mice and Men--all of which have been challenged in \ncommunities as indecent for minors. Or forwarding to a child online a \nversion of Seventeen magazine might violate the law, even though any \nchild could buy that magazine freely at a newsstand. E-mail messages \nfrom one teenager to another using some four-letter words violates the \nlaw. Museums for web sites are going to think twice before posting \nimages of something like Michelangelo's David because showing sexual \norgans would be specifically excluded under this law. Online \ndiscussions about sexually transmitted diseases could be illegal. \nAdvertisements that would be illegal in print could be illegal here.\n  So it is because of that, because it went so far, that the courts \nhave looked at this and have unanimously struck it down. They have said \nthat it is unconstitutional. Multijudge panels in Philadelphia and New \nYork City came unanimously to that view, and it is now before the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  Experts from the right to the left that I have spoken with \non constitutional law predict that the Supreme Court will uphold the \nunanimous decision of the lower Federal court and find it \nunconstitutional.\n\n  So I am going to introduce a bill to repeal the Internet censorship \nparts of the Communications Decency Act, and I will do this along with \nSenator Feingold because the law is unnecessary, unworkable, and, most \nsignificantly, unconstitutional. There are better ways of doing this. \nLet us work with computer software producers on programs that can \nscreen out material which parents find offensive and allow a parent to \nknow where a child has gone on the Internet and allow parents to make \nthis decision--just as when my children were growing up before the \nInternet, I would say, ``I know you can go to such and such a bookstore \nand buy this or that magazine but your mother and I prefer you do not. \nAnd let us instead give you some ideas of better things to read,'' and \nwork with them.\n  Technology will allow parents to do that. It will allow them to block \nout offensive material. But perhaps more importantly when their \nchildren become computer literate--something that those of our age may \nnot be able to do--allow parents to work with their children and find \nout how the Internet works and find out about the tremendous things \navailable from the Smithsonian, the Library of Congress, the Vatican \nmuseum, the sports pages, computer games, information from major \nmagazines and writers--and things that are sometimes junkie and \nfrivolous but harmless nonetheless.\n  That is what we should do and not be in the position of putting the \nheavy hand of Government censorship on something that is so \nquintessentially American as the Internet, which has shown the genius \nof what we are able to do in this country and how we are able now to \nbring it to all other countries around the world. This happened \nbecause--and very specifically because--the Government stepped out of \nthe picture and allowed the genius of individuals to do it. That means, \njust like the publishing of newspapers, magazines and everything else, \nthat you get a certain amount of junk that gets in there. Most of us \ncan pretty well decide what is junk and what is not. We discard that, \nand we go on to the best. We can do this.\n  So I summit, Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Mr. Feingold, and \nMr. Jeffords, legislation as I said, to repeal the Internet censorship \nprovisions of the Communications Decency Act, and simply restore the \nlaw in effect before we banned constitutionally protected on-line \nspeech. I ask unanimous consent that it be appropriately referred.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 213\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF PROVISIONS ON OBSCENE AND HARASSING USE \n                   OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES ENACTED BY \n                   COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT OF 1996.\n\n       Section 223 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     223) is amended by striking subsections (a) and (d) through \n     (h).\n\n[[Page S744]]\n\n     SEC. 2. RESTORATION OF PROVISIONS ON OBSCENE AND HARASSING \n                   USE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN EFFECT \n                   BEFORE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT OF 1996.\n\n       Section 223 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     223), as amended by section 1 of this Act, is further amended \n     by inserting before subsection (b) the following new \n     subsection (a):\n       ``(a) Whoever--\n       ``(1) in the District of Columbia or in interstate or \n     foreign communications by means of telephone--\n       ``(A) makes any comment, request, suggestion or proposal \n     which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent;\n       ``(B) makes a telephone call, whether or not conversation \n     ensues, without disclosing his identity and with intent to \n     annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person at the called \n     number;\n       ``(C) makes or causes the telephone of another repeatedly \n     or continuously to ring, with intent to harass any person at \n     the called number; or\n       ``(D) makes repeated telephone calls, during which \n     conversation ensues, solely to harass any person at the \n     called number; or\n       ``(2) knowingly permits any telephone facility under his \n     control to be used for any purpose prohibited by this \n     section,\n\n     shall be fined not more than $50,000 or imprisoned not more \n     than six months, or both.''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from \nVermont [Mr. Leahy] in introducing this legislation to repeal the \nCommunications Decency Act [CDA]. I believe Congress made a grave \nmistake in enacting the CDA and it is time to correct it.\n  Congress passed the CDA without taking the time to fully examine its \nability to protest children and its effect on the free speech rights of \nAmericans. As a result, the CDA has been the subject of a court \nchallenge since the day it was signed into law. Last June, a three-\njudge Federal panel granted a preliminary injunction against the \nFederal enforcement of key provisions of the CDA finding them \nunconstitutional. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the \nfirst amendment challenge to the CDA on March 19, 1997.\n  The Communications Decency Act, enacted as part of the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996, subjected anyone who transmitted \nindecent material to minors over the Internet to criminal sanctions. \nThe commonly accepted definition of ``indecency'' includes mild \nprofanity.\n  I strongly opposed the CDA not only because I believe it violates our \nconstitutionally guaranteed right to free speech, but also because I \nfeel strongly that it fails to truly protect children from those who \nmight seek to harm them.\n  The fundamental error of CDA proponents was their attempt to apply \ndecades-old broadcasting standards to an emerging technology that \ndefies categorization--the Internet. While the Supreme Court has \nallowed speech restrictions for broadcast media, it has made clear that \nsuch restrictions do not violate the first amendment only if there is a \ncompelling Government interest in restricting speech and the \nrestriction is applied in the least restrictive means. It is \npredominantly the nature of the medium which determines whether or not \na criminal prohibition on speech is the least restrictive means of \nmeeting a compelling Government interest. in the case of a radio or \ntelevision, the fact that a child might simply turn on a station and \nhear offensive material provides a basis for allowing an arguably \ntighter restriction on indecent speech. Restraints upon newspapers and \nother print media, which are inherently noninvasive, have been very \nlimited.\n  While the Net bears some similarities to both media, it is a unique \nand ever-changing communications medium. One can be a speaker, a \npublisher and a listener using the Internet. Currently, anyone with the \nknow-how and the proper hardware and software can set up a Web page, \nbecome a de facto publisher, making information available to others at \nlittle cost to oneself or the consumer of that information. One can \nalso post a message to an Internet newsgroup, an informal and often \nunmoderated information sharing forum, which can then be ready by \nanyone accessing that newsgroup.\n  The promise of the Internet is its free flow of information across \nvast physical distances and boundaries to anyone with access to a \ncomputer and an Internet connection. The threat of the Communications \nDecency Act is its undeniable ability to stifle this free-flowing \nspeech on the Net. Mr. President, that threat exists because Congress \nfailed to recognize the danger of applying an overly broad indecency \nstandard to a technology with the characteristics of the Internet.\n\n  Out of fear of prosecution, the vagueness of the indecency standard, \nand an inability to control the age of those who might ultimately see \nthe information, speakers on the Net will become silent. Those offering \ncommercial access to the Internet will be required to restrict access \nto speech in order to protect themselves from criminal prosecution.\n  Last year, a panel of three Federal judges came to the same \nconclusion: this statute cannot be enforced without violating the \nConstitution. The Court stated:\n\n       . . . the Internet may fairly be regarded as a never-ending \n     worldwide conversation. The Government may not, through the \n     CDA, interrupt that conversation. As the most participatory \n     form of mass speech yet developed, the Internet deserves the \n     highest protection from government intrusion.\n\n  I believe the Federal Court came to this conclusion because the \njudges took the time to study and understand the characteristics of the \nNet before rushing to judgement--something Congress failed to do.\n  It is time to undo that mistake by repealing the Communications \nDecency Act. Not only does the CDA infringe on free speech rights of \nadults, it does not protect children from those who seek to harm them \nusing the Internet, and it may actually impede the development of more \nsophisticated screening software in the marketplace. When Congress \npassed the CDA, there already existed filtering software which gave \nparents the ability to filter out objectionable content such as \nindecency, violence, adult topics etc. The passage of the CDA \nnecessarily will reduce demand for such software products, which are \neffective in preventing children's access to such content. The CDA \nmerely provides parents with a false sense of security that the Federal \nGovernment will somehow protect their children, so they no longer have \nto worry about the Internet themselves.\n  And that is the irony, Mr. President. The CDA is simply not capable \nof protecting children on the Internet. Much Internet content \noriginates on foreign soil, making effective enforcement of the CDA \nimpossible. Furthermore, the dissemination of materials which we all \nagree are most harmful to children--obscenity and child pornography--is \nalready illegal on the Internet and subject to hefty criminal \nsanctions. We should put our law enforcement resources into \naggressively prosecuting these criminal violations and recognize that \nthe Internet is merely another tool used by those seeking to harm our \nchildren. We must prosecute the crime, not demonize the medium used by \nthe criminal.\n  Mr. President, it is time to repeal the Communications Decency Act--\nan unconstitutional statute that fails to protect children. We owe that \nto all Americans and most important, we owe it to this country's \nchildren.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Inouye and Mr. Glenn):\n\n  S. 214. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to combat fraud and price-gouging committed in \nconnection with the provision of consumer goods and services for the \ncleanup, repair, and recovery from the effects of a major disaster \ndeclared by the President, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n           The Disaster Victims Crime Prevention Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Disaster Victims \nCrime Prevention Act of 1997, on behalf of myself, Senator Inouye, and \nSenator Glenn to combat fraud against victims of Federal disasters. \nLike similar legislation I introduced in the 103d and 104th Congresses, \nthis measure would make it a Federal crime to defraud persons through \nthe sale of materials or services for cleanup, repair, and recovery \nfollowing a federally declared disaster.\n  We are all aware of the tremendous costs incurred during a natural \ndisaster. California is recovering from the devastating floods that \nhave caused nearly $1.6 billion in damage and has made 42 of the \nState's 58 counties eligible for disaster assistance. Just before\n\n[[Page S745]]\n\nthe dams and levees in California overflowed, the Pacific Northwest was \nhit with violent storms, and recently Minnesota, North Dakota and South \nDakota have been declared Federal disaster areas, as have 13 counties \nin Idaho and four in Nevada.\n  During the 1990's, a number of deadly natural disasters have occurred \nthroughout the United States and its territories including hurricanes, \nfloods, earthquakes, tornadoes, wild fires, mudslides, and blizzards. \nMany were declared Federal natural disasters like Hurricane Iniki, \nwhich in 1993 leveled the island of Kauai in Hawaii causing $1.6 \nbillion in damage and Hurricane Andrew which devastated southern \nFlorida.\n  Through instant, onscreen media coverage, the Nation has had ringside \nseats to the destruction caused by these catastrophic events. We \nsympathetically watch television as families sift through the debris of \ntheir lives and as men and women assess the loss of their businesses. \nWe witness the concern of others, such as Red Cross volunteers passing \nout blankets and food and citizens traveling hundreds of miles to help \nrebuild strangers' homes.\n  Despite the outpouring of public support that follows these \ncatastrophes, there are unscrupulous individuals who prey on trusting \nand unsuspecting victims, whose immediate concerns are applying for \ndisaster assistance, seeking temporary shelter, and dealing with the \nrebuilding of their lives.\n  The Disaster Victims Crime Prevention Act of 1997 would criminalize \nsome of the activities undertaken by these unprincipled people whose \nsole intent is to defraud hard-working men and women. This legislation \nwill make it a Federal crime to defraud persons through the sale of \nmaterials or services for cleanup, repair, and recovery following a \nfederally declared disaster.\n  Every disaster has examples of individuals who are victimized twice--\nfirst by the disaster and later by unconscionable price hikes and \nfraudulent contractors. In the wake of the 1993 Midwest flooding, Iowa \nofficials found that some vendors raised the price of portable toilets \nfrom $60 a month to $60 a day. In other flood-hit areas, carpet \ncleaners hiked their prices to $350 per hour, while telemarketers set \nup telephone banks to solicit funds for phony flood-related charities.\n  Nor will television viewers forget the scenes of beleaguered south \nFloridians buying generators, plastic sheeting, and bottled water at \noutrageous prices in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew.\n  After Hurricane Iniki devastated the island of Kauai, a contractor \npromising quick home repair took disaster benefits from numerous \nhomeowners and fled the area without completing promised construction. \nThese fraud victims have yet to find relief.\n  While the Stafford Natural Disaster Act currently provides for civil \nand criminal penalties for the misuse of disaster funds, it fails to \naddress contractor fraud. To fill this gap, our legislation would make \nit a Federal crime to take money fraudulently from a disaster victim \nand fail to provide the agreed-upon material or service for the \ncleanup, repair, and recovery.\n\n  The Stafford Act also fails to address price gouging. Although it is \nthe responsibility of the States to impose restrictions on price \nincreases prior to a Federal disaster declaration, Federal penalties \nfor price gouging should be imposed once a Federal disaster has been \ndeclared. I am pleased to incorporate in this measure an initiative \nSenator Glenn began following Hurricane Andrew to combat price gouging \nand excessive pricing of goods and services. Fortunately, citizens in \nHawaii were spared spiraling cost increases after Hurricane Iniki \nbecause the State government acted swiftly to counteract attempts at \nprice gouging by instituting price and rent freezes.\n  There already is tremendous cooperation among the various State and \nlocal offices that deal with fraud and consumer protection issues, and \nit is quite common for these fine men and women to lend their expertise \nto their colleagues from out-of-State during a natural disaster. This \nexchange of experiences and practical solutions has created a strong \nsupport network.\n  However, a Federal remedy is needed to assist States when a disaster \noccurs. There should be a broader enforcement system to help \noverburdened State and local governments during a time of disaster. The \nFederal Government is in a position to ensure that residents within a \nfederally declared disaster area do not fall victim to fraud. Federal \nagencies should assist localities to provide such a support system.\n  In addition to making disaster-related fraud a Federal crime, this \nbill would also require the Director of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency to develop public information materials to advise \ndisaster victims about ways to detect and avoid fraud. I have seen a \nnumber of antifraud materials prepared by State consumer protection \noffices and believe this section would assist States to disseminate \nantifraud-related material following the declaration of a disaster by \nthe President.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass legislation that \nsends a clear message to anyone thinking of defrauding a disaster \nvictim or raising prices unnecessarily on everyday commodities during a \nnatural disaster.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 215. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require a \nrefund value for certain beverage containers, to provide resources for \nState pollution prevention and recycling programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,\n\n\n    THE NATIONAL BEVERAGE CONTAINER REUSE AND RECYCLING ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I introduce the National Beverage \nContainer Reuse and Recycling Act of 1997. This bill is identical to \nlegislation that Senator Hatfield and I have introduced in past \nCongresses. I introduce this bill again today because I firmly believe \nthat deposit laws are a common sense, proven method to increase \nrecycling, save energy, create jobs, and decrease the generation of \nwaste and proliferation of overflowing landfills.\n  The experience of 10 States, including Vermont, attest to the success \nof a deposit law or bottle bill as it is commonly called. Recycling \nrates of well over 70 percent have been achieved for beverage \ncontainers in bottle bill States. The rate is over 90 percent in \nVermont. To put this in perspective, consider this: 30 percent of \nAmericans who live in bottle bill States account for over 80 percent of \nbeverage container recycling in this country.\n  The concept of a national bottle bill is simple: To provide the \nconsumer with an incentive to return the container for reuse or \nrecycling. Consumers pay a nominal cost per bottle when purchasing a \nbeverage and are refunded their money when they bring the bottle back \neither to a retailer or redemption center. Retailers are paid a fee for \ntheir participation in the program, and any unclaimed deposits are used \nto finance State environmental programs.\n  Under my proposal, a 10-cent deposit on beer, water, and soft-drink \ncontainers would take effect in States which have beverage container \nrecovery rates of less than 70 percent, the minimum recovery rate \nachieved by existing bottle bill States. Labels showing the deposit \nvalue would be affixed to containers, and retailers would receive a 2-\ncent fee per container for their participation in the program.\n  We are constantly reminded of the growing problem of excess waste as \nwe hear news reports of waste washing up on our Nation's beaches, \npitched battles over the siting of landfills and communities lacking \nadequate waste disposal facilities. Our country's solid waste problems \nare very real, and they will continue to haunt us until we take action. \nThe throw-away ethic that has emerged in this country is not \ninsurmountable, and recycling is part of the solution.\n  Finally, a national bottle bill serves a much greater purpose than \nmerely cleaning up littered highways. Recycling creates jobs, saves \nenergy, and preserves our Nation's precious natural resources. In fact, \nthe demand for recycled glass and aluminum has grown to such a point \nthat the Chicago Board of Trade now sells futures in these materials. \nRecycling makes good business sense.\n  The legislation I introduce today is consistent with our Nation's \nsolid waste management objectives. A national bottle bill would reduce \nsolid waste and litter, save natural resources and energy, and create a \nmuch needed partnership between consumers, industry, and local \ngovernments. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S746]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Frist, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 216. A bill to amend the Individuals With Disabilities Education \nAct to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1998 through 2002, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n   THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, with my colleague, Senator Frist, I am \nintroducing the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act Amendments \nof 1997. This legislation is identical to S. 1578, which was reported \nout of the Labor and Human Resources Committee in the last Congress. \nSenator Frist did a tremendous job in assisting, getting that prepared \nand passed out of committee. Unfortunately, the bill did not pass in \nthe last legislative session.\n\n  We are introducing this legislation today so everyone will have a \ncommon frame of reference. However, I want to make it very clear to my \ncolleagues in the Senate and to my colleagues and friends within the \neducation and disability community across the Nation that this \nlegislation is not perfect and it can and will be improved. This is the \nbeginning of the process, not the end.\n  I am well aware that there are still issues to be resolved and I \nintend to work with my colleagues to examine these issues and to move \nforward with revisions to this important law that are commonsense \nsolutions to issues which are very real at the local school level.\n  We are aided in this effort by the majority leader, who is committed \nto helping us achieve the broadest based consensus on a final project, \none that has the support of families of children with disabilities and \neducators, but also of all Members of Congress and the President. We \nhave set an ambitious schedule for completing our work on IDEA, and by \nintroducing the IDEA Amendments of 1997 today, we are taking a very \nimportant first step.\n  IDEA was originally enacted in 1975. I was a Member of the House at \nthe time, and participated in the development of this landmark law. It \nwas a response to court decisions that created a patchwork of legal \nstandings, which in turn generated considerable uncertainty about \nrights and responsibilities. IDEA guaranteed each child with a \ndisability access to a free, appropriate public education, and we all \nsupport that goal. In that sense, the legislation has clearly stood the \ntest of time. But it has not in terms of the level of funding support \nthat we promised to the States to assist them in meeting their \nobligation to educate children with disabilities.\n  In IDEA, Congress promised to contribute 40 percent of the cost of \neducating children with disabilities. Our colleague, Senator Gregg, has \nkept our feet to the fire, reminding us that we should keep our \npromise. In last year's appropriations measure we were able to garner \nlarge increases for this program. We must continue our effort to reach \nour full Federal commitment.\n  After 22 years, I think it is appropriate to thoroughly review the \nadministrative and fiscal demands that are associated with providing a \nfree appropriate education to children with disabilities. The \npopulation of students demanding assistance has changed significantly, \nbut the law has not provided enough flexibility to States to meet those \nchanging demands.\n  The writing is on the wall. If we do not make needed changes to IDEA \nnow, based on common sense, school districts and parents will \nincreasingly turn to the courts to get the answers. School districts \nwill do so in hope of getting relief from or clarification of their \nresponsibilities. The parents will do so in hope of procuring the \nservices that they believe their child needs. Since the genesis of IDEA \nlay in avoiding litigation, true to its intent to do so today, we have \nan opportunity, through the reauthorization of IDEA, to ensure the \nemphasis will shift once again and remain on educating children, well \ninto the next century.\n  If we work together, we have the power to ease the pressure on local \ncommunities and States. Through the reauthorization of IDEA, we have \nthe power to give educators incentives and opportunities to educate \nchildren with disabilities, including those at risk of failing, with \nless bureaucracy and meaningful accountability. Let us do it now.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, commonly known as IDEA, is a civil rights law that ensures that \nchildren with disabilities have access to a free appropriate public \neducation. This 22-year-old law has been a great success.\n  During the 104th Congress, I served as Chairman of the Subcommittee \non Disability Policy. In that capacity, I worked extensively on a \nbipartisan, common sense approach to reauthorizing this vital law, but \ntime ran out before the full Senate could vote on this comprehensive \nbill.\n  Today, Senator Jeffords and I are picking up where we left off by \nintroducing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments \nof 1997. The IDEA Amendments of 1997, which will serve as the starting \npoint, is the very bill that I introduced last year and that was passed \nunanimously by the Labor and Human Resources Committee on March 21, \n1996.\n  We are introducing the IDEA Amendments of 1997 not because the law is \nfailing, but because it is succeeding.\n  These amendments reflect the recognition that our Nation's schools \nare moving past the initial challenge of how to educate children with \ndisabilities to today's challenge of how to educate children with \ndisabilities so that they may become productive, independent citizens. \nThe IDEA Amendments of 1997 will help the Nation's schools succeed in \nthat.\n  Twenty-two years ago, before IDEA, a newborn with a disability had \nlittle hope of receiving help during the critical early years of \ndevelopment; children with disabilities who went to school were \nsegregated in buildings away from their siblings and peers; and many \nyoung people with disabilities were destined to spend their lives in \ninstitutions.\n  Young people with less-obvious disabilities, like learning \ndisabilities and attention deficit disorder, were denied access to \npublic education because they were considered too disruptive or unruly. \nThese children tended to grow up on the streets and at home with no \nconsistent access to an appropriate education.\n  Today, infants and toddlers with disabilities receive early \nintervention services; many children with disabilities attend school \ntogether with children without disabilities; and many young people with \ndisabilities learn study skills, life skills and work skills that will \nallow them to be more independent and productive adults.\n  Children without disabilities are learning first hand that disability \nis a natural part of the human experience, and they are benefiting from \nindividualized education techniques and strategies developed by the \nNation's special educators.\n  Children with disabilities are now much more likely to be valued \nmembers of school communities, and the Nation can look forward to a day \nwhen the children with disabilities currently in school will be \nproductive members of our community.\n  As a nation, we have come to see our citizens with disabilities as \ncontributing members of society, not as victims to be pitied.\n  As a nation, we have begun to see that those of us who happen to have \ndisabilities also have gifts to share, and are active participants in \nAmerican society who must have opportunities to learn.\n  While there is no doubt that the Nation is accomplishing its goals to \nprovide a free, appropriate public education to children with \ndisabilities, many challenges remain, and we have made an effort to \ndeal with them in the IDEA Amendments of 1997.\n  IDEA was originally enacted by the 94th Congress as a set of \nconsistent rules to help States provide equal access to a free \nappropriate public education to children with disabilities. But over \nthe years, that initial need to provide consistent guidelines to the \nStates has sometimes been misinterpreted as a license to write \nburdensome compliance requirements.\n  The IDEA Amendments of 1997 address these problems. These amendments \ngive educators the flexibility and the tools they need to achieve \nresults and ease the paperwork burden that has kept teachers from \nspending the maximum time teaching.\n  By shifting the emphasis of IDEA to helping schools help children \nwith disabilities achieve educational results,\n\n[[Page S747]]\n\nwe are able to reduce many of the most burdensome administrative \nrequirements currently imposed on States and local school districts.\n  The IDEA Amendments of 1997 streamline planning and implementation \nrequirements for local school districts and States. In assessment and \nclassification, these amendments would allow schools to shift emphasis \nfrom generating data dictated by bureaucratic needs to gathering \nrelevant information that is needed to teach a child.\n  These amendments also give schools and school boards more control \nover how they use special purpose funds to provide training, research \nand information dissemination. We want to encourage every school in \nAmerica to create programs that best serve the needs of all of their \nstudents, with and without disabilities.\n  The IDEA Amendments of 1997 clarify that the general education \ncurriculum and standards associated with that curriculum should be used \nto teach children with disabilities and to assess their educational \nprogress.\n  Educators at both the local and State levels will use indicators of \nstudent progress that allow them to track the progress of children with \ndisabilities in meaningful ways along with the progress of other \nchildren.\n  In an effort to reduce confrontation and costly litigation, the IDEA \nAmendments of 1997 require States to offer mediation to parents who \nhave a dispute over their child's education. The amendments also \naddress the serious issue of disciplining children with disabilities \nwho break school rules that apply to all children.\n  By providing fair and balanced guidelines to help schools discipline \nstudents with disabilities, the amendments ensure that all children in \nour public schools are given the opportunity to learn in a safe \nenvironment.\n  By preserving the right of children with disabilities to a free \nappropriate public education, by providing school districts with new \ndegrees of procedural, fiscal, and administrative flexibility, and by \npromoting the consideration of children with disabilities in actions to \nreform schools and make them accountable for student progress, IDEA \nwill remain a viable, useful law that will provide guidance well into \nthe next century.\n  The introduction of the Individual with Disabilities Education \nAmendments of 1997 today represents my continued commitment to the \nreauthorization of IDEA. I am pleased that the substantial work done on \nthe reauthorization of IDEA during the last Congress will serve as a \nfoundation for our efforts during this Congress. I recognize that there \nis still much debate to come, and much hard work to be done before we \nsuccessfully strengthen and extend this vital law into the 21st \ncentury. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle and the disability and education communities during \nthe upcoming reauthorization effort.\n  Together we have the opportunity to bring common sense improvements \nto IDEA, improving the law and opportunities for children with \ndisabilities.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nall the work he has done. He deserves, and should get, accolades and \nhelpful attention to this bill, because we do need help in making sure \nit gets into law. But the work he did last year has been incredibly \nhelpful. It moves us a long way toward that goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 217. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \nthe payment to States of plot allowances for certain veterans eligible \nfor burial in a national cemetery who are buried in cemeteries of such \nStates; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                the veterans plot allowance act of 1997\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, for the third consecutive Congress, \nI am introducing legislation to expand the Federal Government's $150 \npayment to States when they bury veterans in State-owned veterans \ncemeteries.\n  For those who are not familiar with my proposal, it is quite simple. \nMy bill says that if a State buries a veteran free of charge in a \nState-owned cemetery--and that veteran is eligible for burial in a \nnational veterans cemetery--the Federal Government will pay the State \n$150 for the cost of the plot.\n  In other words, Mr. President, rather than the multiple and \nrestricted criteria of plot allowance payments to States under current \nlaw, there would instead be only one standard in judging whether a \nState receives assistance from the Federal Government. And, that \nstandard is: Is the veteran eligible for burial in a national cemetery? \nPeriod.\n  Not only is it simple, it is the only thing that makes sense and the \nonly thing that is fair. When the plot allowance for States was first \nestablished a decade ago, Congress did it in part to relieve the \npressure on the national cemetery system. Our national cemeteries were \nfilling up rapidly. That trend continues today. More than half of all \nnational cemeteries are closed to additional burials, and there is no \nwhere near enough space for all of America's World War II veterans, let \nalone the veterans from later conflicts. So, rather than undertake the \nexpensive process of building more national cemeteries, we entered into \na partnership with the States for the creation of State-owned veterans \ncemeteries.\n  That partnership has worked well, especially in States like Delaware \nthat do not have a national cemetery to begin with. But, after entering \ninto this partnership, the Federal Government then limited for whom it \nwould reimburse States for the cost of the plot. We said that States \nwould receive the $150 payment only if the veteran was receiving \ndisability compensation or a pension; died in a veterans hospital; was \nindigent and the body was unclaimed; or was discharged from the \nmilitary due to a disability.\n  In other words, we ask States to bury all veterans eligible for \nburial in a national cemetery--but then we do not financially help them \nwhen they do.\n  And, States are not even being reimbursed for all wartime veterans \nthat they bury. Let me repeat that. States are not being reimbursed for \nall wartime veterans that are buried in State-owned veterans \ncemeteries. I mention that, Mr. President, because some people have \ncharacterized this bill as an attempt to provide the plot allowance to \nStates for the burial of nonwartime veterans, and an attempt to give a \nbenefit intended for those who fought in wartime to those who did not. \nThat is simply not the case.\n  There are thousands of wartime veterans who do not meet the current \nlaw's criteria. In fact, each year, about 5,000 veterans--many of them \nwartime veterans--are eligible for burial in a national cemetery and \nare buried without charge in State-owned veterans cemeteries, but do \nnot meet the criteria set forth in current law for the States to \nreceive the plot allowance. That is not fair to the States, and it is \nnot right for America's veterans.\n  Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that \nthis proposal would cost $1 million per year. While we all want to \nbalance the budget--and this proposal will be paid for--$1 million per \nyear is a relatively small sum in order to fulfill our commitment to \nAmerica's veterans.\n  In 1995, the Senate recognized this in unanimously approving this \nproposal as an amendment to the budget bill. Whether this bill is voted \non separately or as part of another measure, it does not matter. What \nmatters is that we work to ensure that America's veterans are \nguaranteed a decent and dignified burial.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 218. A bill to invest in the future American work force and to \nensure that all Americans have access to higher education by providing \ntax relief for investment in a college education and by encouraging \nsavings for college costs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                           the get ahead act\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a \ncomprehensive bill I first introduced last summer to make college more \naffordable for middle-class families. Formally titled the ``Growing the \nEconomy for Tomorrow: Assuring Higher Education is Affordable and \nDependable'' Act, it is known as the Get Ahead Act for short.\n  This legislation contains numerous provisions--some of which have \nbeen or will be introduced by others as separate bills; other \nprovisions are novel to this bill--but they all have one thing in\n\n[[Page S748]]\n\ncommon. They all are an attempt to renew our commitment to see that the \nAmerican Dream of a college education remains within reach of all \nAmericans.\n  Because, the plain truth is, that dream is slipping out of reach for \nmany middle-class families. When I was in college 30 some years ago, my \nparents could send me to a State university for less than 5 percent of \ntheir income. And, it stayed about that much--college costs went up \neach year by about the same amount that the average family's income \nwent up--until 1980. And, then, college costs exploded. Since 1980, the \ncost of public college tuition and fees has increased nearly three \ntimes faster than the average family's income.\n  We can debate endlessly the reasons why and who or what is to blame. \nBut, all that middle-class families know is that the costs have \nskyrocketed, and they must constantly worry about how they will ever be \nable to afford to send their children to college.\n  For a long time now, Members on both sides of the aisle have believed \nthat the Federal Government has a role and responsibility in helping \nAmericans get to college. Not to guarantee that everyone in America \ngoes to college, but to guarantee that no one who qualifies for college \nis turned away just because they cannot afford it. It is important for \nindividual Americans--and it is important for the future of America as \na whole.\n  But, I think it is legitimate to question that commitment today when \ncosts are rising out of control; when we spend more on loans that have \nto be repaid and less on grants that do not; and when the tax law \nrewards investment in machines but not investment in people.\n  It is time, Mr. President, to renew and reaffirm our commitment to \nhigher education. And, so, I offer the Get Ahead Act, and I invite my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort.\n  Let me take just a few minutes to review what this bill would do. \nAnd, I ask that a much more detailed summary of the bill be included in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  First, the Get Ahead Act provides direct tax relief for the costs of \nhigher education. This is accomplished by creating a $10,000 tax \ndeduction for college tuition and fees as well as the interest on \nstudent loans. We currently give tax breaks to businesses for \ninvestment in the future--in research and development and in the \npurchase of new plant and equipment. I support that. But, at the same \ntime, we do not provide tax relief to middle-class families who invest \nin their own children's future through higher education. We should.\n\n  In addition, under the Get Ahead Act, all scholarships, including \nthat used for room and board, would be excluded from taxable income, as \nwas the case prior to the 1986 Tax Reform Act.\n  And, the tax exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance \nwould be extended and made permanent. As my colleagues know, when an \nemployer pays part or all of the costs of an employee's education, that \ndoes not have to be counted as income to the employee for tax purposes. \nLast year, we extended that provision through May 31, 1997. What my \nbill does is make it a permanent part of the Tax Code--so we do not \nhave to keep coming back and extending it every year or so--and my bill \nensures that the tax exclusion applies to both undergraduate and \ngraduate education. Last year, unfortunately in my view, in extending \nthe tax exclusion, we applied it only to undergraduate education.\n  Second, Mr. President, the Get Ahead Act encourages people to save \nfor the costs of higher education. Specifically, it would allow \nindividuals to withdraw funds from their Individual Retirement Accounts \nfor education expenses--without incurring a 10-percent penalty tax. \nAlso, more Americans would be able to take advantage of Series EE \nSavings Bonds. These are the bonds where you do not have to pay tax on \nthe interest if the money from the bonds is used to pay for college \ntuition.\n  And, my bill would create Education Savings Accounts--accounts \nsimilar to IRA's. Each year, families could put tax free up to $2,000 \nper child into an ESA for their children. That money would accumulate \ntax free--and you would never have to pay taxes on it if the money was \nused to pay for college.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the Get Ahead Act would award merit \nscholarships to all students who graduate in the top 5 percent of their \nclass. While the $1,000 scholarship would cover about two-thirds of the \ncost of a community college, I realize this is not a large sum of money \nfor someone attending a 4-year institution, especially if it is a \nprivate college. But, it could make a difference for many students, and \nI believe that, regardless, it is important that we start to reward \nstudents who meet high academic standards.\n  There is one provision not in the bill that was in last year's bill. \nLast year, I included a section clarifying the Federal tax treatment of \nState prepaid tuition plans. Similar provisions were enacted last year \nas part of the minimum wage bill, and therefore I did not need to \ninclude them in this year's bill.\n  Mr. President, the Get Ahead Act is aimed at seeing that individual \nAmericans have the opportunity to get ahead. In today's economy, in \ntoday's world, you need a college education to do it. And, for those \nwho would criticize this proposal as a handout to the middle class, let \nthem ponder what the future of America will be like if the vast masses \nof the middle class are denied a college education.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           The Get Ahead Act\n\n\n title i--tax incentives for higher education; subtitle a--tax relief \nfor higher education costs; section 101--deduction for higher education \n                                expenses\n\n       An above-the-line tax deduction (available even to those \n     who do not itemize deductions) would be allowed for the costs \n     of college tuition and fees as well as interest on college \n     loans.\n       In the case of tuition costs, beginning in tax year 2000, \n     the maximum annual deduction would be $10,000 per year; a \n     maximum deduction of $5,000 would be available in tax years \n     1997, 1998, and 1999. The full deduction would be available \n     to single taxpayers with incomes under $70,000 and married \n     couples with incomes under $100,000; a reduced (phased-out) \n     deduction would be available to those with incomes up to \n     $90,000 (singles) and $120,000 (couples). The income \n     thresholds would be indexed annually for inflation.\n       Interest on student loans would be deductible beginning \n     with interest payments made in tax year 1997. Interest \n     payments could be deducted on top of the $10,000 deduction \n     for payment of college tuition and fees. There would be no \n     annual maximum and no income limits with regard to the \n     deductibility of interest on student loans.\n       Language is included to coordinate this tax deduction with \n     other education provisions of the tax code--to ensure that \n     individuals do not receive a double benefit for the same \n     payments. Specifically, qualified higher education expenses \n     that could be tax deductible would be reduced by any payments \n     made from Series EE savings bonds (and excluded from taxable \n     income), any veterans educational assistance provided by the \n     federal government, and any other payments from tax-exempt \n     sources (e.g. employer-provided educational assistance). \n     Also, tax-free scholarships and tax-excluded funds from \n     Education Savings Accounts (see section 112) would first be \n     attributed to room and board costs; the remainder, if any, \n     would count against tuition and fees and would reduce the \n     amount that would be tax deductible. However, if tuition and \n     fees still exceeded $10,000 even after the reductions, the \n     full tax deduction would be available.\n\n\n        section 102--exclusion for scholarships and fellowships\n\n       College scholarships and fellowship grants would not be \n     considered income for the purposes of federal income taxes. \n     This returns the tax treatment of scholarships and \n     fellowships to their treatment prior to the 1986 Tax Reform \n     Act (which limited the exclusion of scholarships and \n     fellowships to that used for tuition and fees).\n       Scholarships and fellowship grants would be fully \n     excludable for degree candidates. In the case of non-degree \n     candidates, individuals would be eligible for a lifetime \n     exclusion of $10,800--$300 per month for a maximum 36 months.\n       Language is included to clarify that federal grants for \n     higher education that are conditioned on future service (such \n     as National Health Service Corps grants for medical students) \n     would still be eligible for tax exclusion.\n       This section would be effective beginning with scholarships \n     and fellowship grants used in tax year 1997.\n\n\n      section 103--permanent exclusion for educational assistance\n\n       As part of the minimum wage/small business tax relief bill \n     enacted in 1996, the tax exclusion for employer-provided \n     educational assistance was reinstated retroactively and \n     extended through May 31, 1997. But, as of July 1, 1996, the \n     tax exclusion only applies to educational assistance for \n     undergraduate education.\n\n[[Page S749]]\n\n       This section would extend the employer-provided educational \n     assistance tax exclusion by making it a permanent part of the \n     tax code. In addition, it would retroactively reinstate the \n     tax exclusion for graduate education.\n\n\n  subtitle b--encouraging savings for higher education costs; section \n   111--ira distributions used without penalty for higher education \n                                expenses\n\n       Funds could be withdrawn from Individual Retirement \n     Accounts (IRAs) before age 59\\1/2\\ without being subject to \n     the 10 percent penalty tax if the funds were used for higher \n     education tuition and fees. (However, withdrawn funds, if \n     deductible when contributed to the IRA, would be considered \n     gross income for the purposes of federal income taxes.)\n       This section would be effective upon enactment.\n\n\n                section 112--education savings accounts\n\n       This section would create IRA-like accounts--known as \n     Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)--for the purpose of \n     encouraging savings for a college education.\n       Each year, a family could invest up to $2000 per child \n     under the age of 19 in an ESA. For single taxpayers with \n     incomes under $70,000 (phased out up to $90,000) and married \n     couples with incomes under $100,000 (phased out up to \n     $120,000), the contributions would be tax deductible. (These \n     income thresholds would be indexed annually for inflation.) \n     For all taxpayers, the interest in an ESA would accumulate \n     tax free; the contributions would not be subject to the \n     federal gift tax; and, the balance in an ESA would not be \n     treated as an asset or income for the purposes of determining \n     eligibility for federal means-tested programs.\n       ESA funds could be withdrawn to meet the higher education \n     expenses--tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, and room \n     and board--of the beneficiary. Funds withdrawn for other \n     purposes would be subject to a 10 percent penalty tax and \n     would be considered income for the purposes of federal income \n     taxes (to the extent that the funds were tax deductible when \n     contributed). The penalty tax would not apply in cases of \n     death or disability of the beneficiary of the ESA and in \n     cases of unemployment of the contributors.\n       In addition, when the beneficiary of the account turns age \n     30 and is not enrolled in college at least half time, any \n     funds remaining in the ESA would be (1) transferred to \n     another ESA; (2) donated to an educational institution; or \n     (3) refunded to the contributors. In the first two cases, \n     there would be no penalty tax and the money would not be \n     considered taxable income. In the third case, the penalty tax \n     would not apply, but the funds would be counted as income to \n     the extent that the funds were tax deductible when \n     contributed.\n       Finally, parent could roll over funds from one child's ESA \n     to another child's ESA without regard to any taxes, without \n     regard to the $2000 annual maximum contribution to an ESA, \n     and without regard to the age 30 requirement note above. \n     Funds rolled over would also not be subject to the federal \n     gift tax.\n       Language is also included to allow individuals to designate \n     contributions to an ESA as nondeductible even if such \n     contributions could be tax deductible. This gives families \n     the option to build up the principal in an ESA while at a \n     lower tax rate, rather than having to pay taxes on unspent \n     ESA funds when the contributors are older and likely in a \n     higher tax bracket.\n       Tax deductible contributions to ESAs would be allowed \n     beginning in tax year 1997.\n\n\n   section 113--increase in income limits for savings bond exclusion\n\n       For taxpayers with incomes below certain thresholds, the \n     interest earned on Series EE U.S. Savings Bonds are not \n     considered taxable income if the withdrawn funds are used to \n     pay for higher education tuition and fees. This section \n     increases the income thresholds to allow more Americans to \n     use the Series EE Savings Bonds for education expenses.\n       Effective with tax year 1997, the income thresholds would \n     be the same as the income thresholds for the higher education \n     tax deduction (see section 101): $70,000 for single taxpayers \n     (phased out up to $90,000), and $100,000 for couples (phased \n     out up to $120,000). As with the higher education tax \n     deduction, these income thresholds would be indexed annually \n     for inflation.\n\n\n            title ii--scholarships for academic achievement\n\n       Beginning with the high school graduating class of 1998, \n     the top 5 percent of graduating seniors at each high school \n     in the United States would be eligible for a $1000 merit \n     scholarship. If an individual receiving such a scholarship \n     achieved a 3.0 (``B'') average during his or her first year \n     of college, a second $1000 scholarship would be awarded.\n       However, the merit scholarships would be available only to \n     those students in families with income under $70,000 (single) \n     and $100,000 (couples). These income thresholds would be \n     increased annually for inflation.\n       Funds are authorized (and subject to annual appropriations) \n     for five years. The first year authorization (fiscal year \n     1998) is $130 million. In each of the next four years (FY \n     1999-FY 2002), because the scholarships could be renewed for \n     a second year, the authorization is $260 million per year. \n     Total five-year authorization: $1.17 billion.\n\n\n                     title iii--deficit neutrality\n\n       To ensure that the ``GET AHEAD'' Act does not increase the \n     deficit, this title declares it the sense of the Senate that \n     the costs of the bill should be paid by closing corporate tax \n     loopholes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n\n  S. 219. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to establish procedures \nfor identifying countries that deny market access for value-added \nagricultural products of the United States; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n      Value-added Agricultural Products Market Access Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today with my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Grassley, two important pieces of \ninternational trade legislation. These bills are designed with one very \nsimple, clear goal in mind: to secure fair trade opportunities for \nAmerica's highly competitive producers of agricultural products.\n  There is no more important sector of the U.S. economy than \nagriculture as far as international trade is concerned. Last year, the \ntrade surplus in agricultural products reached $28.5 billion, the \nlargest of any industry, including aircraft. This surplus offset to an \nimportant degree the Nation's large and persistent deficit in \nmanufactured goods.\n  Trade is vitally important to farmers. Production from more than one-\nthird of harvested acreage is exported. Agricultural exports are \nimportant to the rest of the economy as well. According to the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, each dollar generated by agricultural \nexports stimulates another $1.39 in supporting economic activity to \nproduce those exports. Nearly every State exports farm products.\n  Despite the obvious success American producers are enjoying in world \nmarkets, a closer look reveals that we could be doing far better. \nJudging from the annual surveys compiled by the Office of the U.S. \nTrade Representative, roughly half of all foreign trade barriers facing \nU.S. products are in the agricultural sector. This suggests that our \noverall merchandise trade deficit, which is estimated to total nearly \n$170 billion for 1996, could be considerably lower if we succeeded in \nremoving more of these barriers.\n  The recent Uruguay round took only the first, tentative steps toward \ndevising effective and fair rules governing international agricultural \ntrade. As our able negotiators would be the first to acknowledge, we \nhave a long way to go. Although we made significant progress in \nsubjecting export subsidies to international rules, the Uruguay round \nsecured only modest commitments by governments to open their markets \nand administer food health and safety standards fairly. In the long \nrun, the fairness of world trade in agricultural products will depend \non how aggressively and systematically the U.S. Government insists on \ncompliance by foreign governments with their existing commitments and \npresses them for new ones.\n  The two bills we introduce today will improve our ability to meet \nthis challenge both institutionally and with respect to one specific, \nimmediate problem regarding the European Union. Passage of this \nlegislation will help to assure farmers and their communities that \ntrade liberalization remains in their interest as much in practice as \nin theory.\n\n\n         the Value-Added Agricultural Market Access Act of 1997\n\n  The first bill, the Value-Added Agricultural Market Access Act of \n1997, would improve our institutional capacity to set priorities among \nthe vast array of foreign agricultural trade barriers we face and give \nthose priorities the high-level attention they deserve within the \nexecutive branch. In so doing, it would provide our negotiators with an \nimportant new tool with which to increase their leverage in \nconsultations with foreign governments.\n  The bill would create a ``Special 301'' procedure for value-added \nagricultural products virtually identical to that which currently \nexists for intellectual property products. It would require the U.S. \nTrade Representative [USTR] each year to designate as ``priority \ncountries'' those trading partners having the most onerous or egregious \nacts, policies, or practices resulting in the greatest adverse impact--\nactual or potential--on U.S. value-added agricultural products.\n\n[[Page S750]]\n\n  The USTR would be required to initiate a section 301 investigation \nwithin 30 days after the identification of a priority foreign country \nwith respect to any act, policy, or practice that was the basis of the \nidentification, unless the USTR determines initiation of the \ninvestigation would be detrimental to U.S. economic interests and \nreports the reasons in detail to Congress. The procedural and other \nrequirements of section 301 authority would generally apply to these \ncases with the important exception that investigations, and \nnegotiations must be concluded and determinations made on whether the \nmeasures are actionable within 6 months, as opposed to 12 or 18 months \nfor conventional section 301 cases. This 6-month deadline may be \nextended to 9 months if certain criteria are met. USTR may choose not \nto designate a country as a priority foreign country if it is entering \ninto good faith negotiations or making significant progress in \nbilateral or multilateral negotiations to provide fair and equitable \naccess to its markets.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, agriculture as a \nwhole is the largest positive contributor to the U.S. trade balance, \nand exports of value-added products--intermediate products such as \nwheat flour, feedstuffs, and vegetable oils or consumer-ready products \nsuch as meats--have recently become the largest component of our \nagricultural trade. In fiscal year 1996, these higher value exports \naccounted for $32 billion, or 54 percent by value, of all such exports.\n  It is no wonder that U.S. value-added agriculture is making such \ngains. Our farmers have worked hard to increase their value-added \nproduction, and they should be proud of what they have accomplished. \nUnfortunately, they are being denied the full fruits of their labors by \na varied and complex array of market restrictions in many foreign \ncountries. Notwithstanding the progress made in the Uruguay round, many \nforeign governments maintain considerably stricter limits on U.S. \nproducts than we do on theirs. In addition, even as formal barriers \nfall or become more transparent as a result of the Uruguay round, new \nand informal trade barriers often take their place. These may take the \nform of arbitrary sanitary and phytosanitary measures that ignore sound \nprinciples of science and globally accepted food safety and inspection \nstandards.\n  In the past few years alone, United States sausages have been denied \nentry to Korea because the Korean Government imposed arbitrary and \nunscientific shelf-life standards on imported sausages; the European \nUnion has banned U.S. beef treated with natural hormones even though \nscientists from Europe and around the world have declared natural-\nhormone-treated beef to be safe; and, high-value U.S. pork products \ncannot be exported to Europe because European meat inspectors require \nU.S. slaughter and packing plants to meet standards that even their own \nproducers cannot meet.\n  These are but a few examples of the barriers to entry facing U.S. \nproducers of value-added farm products. The unfortunate result is that \nour farmers are being prevented from realizing their full export \npotential. The Foreign Agricultural Service estimates that U.S. \nagricultural exports are reduced by $4.7 billion annually due to \nunjustifiable sanitary and phytosanitary measures alone. Imagine the \nimpact on farm income, rural communities, and the U.S. economy if these \nbarriers were removed.\n  The Value-Added Agricultural Market Access Act of 1997 will bring \nadded focus to this set of issues within the trade policymaking \nmachinery of the U.S. Government. We have a strong inter-agency team of \ntrade negotiators and analysts; over the years, through Democratic and \nRepublican administrations alike, it has been one of the most efficient \noperations anywhere in the Federal Government. However, the USTR and \nits support agencies confront an almost overwhelming variety of demands \nand challenges. They currently are deeply involved in several very \nambitious multilateral trade negotiations or preparations for them, \nincluding free trade arrangements in the Western Hemisphere and the \nPacific rim, NAFTA expansion, and WTO agreements on high-technology \nproducts and telecommunications equipment and services.\n  The sheer number and complexity of the issues confronting the USTR \nmake priority-setting one of USTR's most important responsibilities. \nWith so much attention now on visionary multilateral initiatives, we \nmust take care not to lose sight of two other practical aspects of \ntrade policy: our bilateral efforts to improve market access and our \nresponsibility to ensure that governments comply with the agreements \nthey have already signed with us, be they multilateral or bilateral. \nThese two aspects of U.S. trade policy are particularly important to \nthe agricultural community, which, as I have emphasized, is second to \nnone in terms of our international commercial prospects.\n  As my colleague, Senator Grassley, the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Subcommittee on International Trade, knows well, Congress holds \na major share of the responsibility, indeed prerogative, for setting \nU.S. trade policy. It is explicitly assigned that power under article \nI, section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. Our bill would exercise this \nauthority to institutionalize an appropriate degree of attention on \nagriculture in U.S. trade policy.\n  U.S. agriculture traditionally has been one of the strongest of any \nsegment of the economy in its support for multilateral trade \nliberalization, including the negotiation of free trade agreements. \nYet, in talking to individual farmers in my State as well as their \nnational representatives, I have the impression that the strength of \nAmerican agriculture's future support for such initiatives will hinge \non how well our Government performs in these areas of our bilateral \ntrade relations. Indeed, I believe that adroit use by the USTR of the \nprocedures established by this bill would enhance our chance of \nachieving new multilateral rules for agriculture in the next \nnegotiating round of the World Trade Organization in the same way that \ncreation of ``Special 301'' by Congress in 1988 created leverage and \nmomentum for our negotiators in the run-up to the adoption of \nintellectual property rules in the Uruguay round.\n\n\n            Fair Trade in Meat and Meat Products Act of 1997\n\n  The second bill we are introducing today addresses one specific, \negregious barrier to U.S. value-added agricultural exports: the \nEuropean Union's [EU] continuing refusal to implement a commitment it \nmade in 1992 to treat our food safety and inspection standards as \nroughly equivalent in effectiveness to their own. This procedural form \nof protectionism has shut American exports of pork and beef out of the \nEuropean market. The loss of this lucrative market has contributed to \nthe severe drop in cattle prices in this country and deprived American \npork producers of an estimated $60 million in sales last year. By any \nobjective standard, U.S. meat products are among the most competitive \nin the world and represent one of the most promising areas of growth \nfor American trade.\n  On November 1, 1990, the European Union prohibited imports of U.S. \npork and beef on the grounds that our products did not comply with the \nsafety and inspection requirements of the EU's Third Country Meat \nDirective [TCD]. The prohibition was imposed despite the fact that the \nrequirements of the TCD are largely similar to those already mandated \nby the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As a result, American pork and \nbeef exports to the European Union virtually ceased.\n  Following this action, the industry filed and the Bush administration \naccepted a petition under section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. After USTR \nconcluded preliminarily that the EU's administration of the TCD imposed \na burden and restriction on U.S. commerce, the EU agreed to resolve the \ndispute in an exchange of letters that came to be known as the 1992 \nMeat Agreement. At the time, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills \nnoted that the practices of the European Union would have been \nactionable under section 301 absent the 1992 agreement and would become \nso again if the European Union violated its terms. Overwhelming \nevidence now indicates that the European Union has done just that.\n  The 1992 Meat Agreement outlined a specific series of steps that \nAmerican producers could take to become eligible for export to the \nEuropean Union,\n\n[[Page S751]]\n\nand concluded that the inspection systems of the United States and \nEuropean Union provided ``equivalent safeguards against public health \nrisks.'' The GATT Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures \ncorroborated this finding and required the European Union to treat USDA \ninspection requirements as equivalent to its own.\n  Five years later, after millions of dollars in investment by American \nproducers to meet the terms of the 1992 Meat Agreement, only a handful \nof American plants have been recertified for export to the European \nUnion. Plants managers report that inspections for certification have \nnot been conducted in an objective or transparent manner, and the \nEuropean Union has failed to acknowledge changes enacted specifically \nat its request. The cost of this unjustified action has been millions \nof dollars in lost sales to American pork and beef producers.\n  The administration has been more than patient with the European \nUnion, consulting with its diplomats for many months. In my view, the \ntime for waiting has ended. The European Union must tear down its walls \nand give our farmers and ranchers the level playing field they were \npromised. Indeed, in just the last few weeks, the European Union has \nbeen considering yet another change in animal product approval \nprocedures that would block an additional $1 billion in agricultural \nexports to the European Union. This action was taken despite the fact \nthat the United States has been working in good faith for over 2 years \non a veterinary equivalence agreement that would accommodate European \nUnion concerns. Simply put, it is time to send the European Union a \nclear message that we will not stand by while they ignore their \nobligations.\n\n  For this reason, Senator Grassley and I are introducing legislation \nto require the USTR to determine formally whether the European Union \nhas violated its international obligations, seek prompt initiation of \nthe relevant international dispute settlement proceedings, and review \nour certification of their meat exporting facilities. This is a \nstraightforward response to a blatant breach of faith on the part of \nthe European Union. The bill sends a clear message that trade is a two-\nway street, and procedural protectionism is every bit as unacceptable \nas traditional market barriers like discriminatory quotas and tariffs.\n  Mr. President, we have consulted with the USTR and Department of \nAgriculture as we have drafted the legislation, and I am pleased to \ninform my colleagues that the administration is fast coming to an \nappreciation of the need for the type of action prescribed by the bill. \nLast week, it notified the European Union via telex that, absent a \nresolution of this issue, as of April 1, 1997, all European Union meat \nand meat product exports will have to ``specifically adhere to and meet \nU.S. regulatory standards.'' Moreover, ``Any plant in the member states \nof the European Unionropean Union which desires to ship meat, meat \nproducts, poultry, or poultry products to the United States will have \nto be inspected by officials of the Food Safety and Inspection Service \nof the U.S. Department of Agriculture and be certified before it is \neligible to ship to market.''\n  I am pleased that the administration is headed in the direction \nprescribed by our bill. I call on my colleagues to support this \nlegislation as well as the value-added agricultural products market \naccess bill as a way to reinforce our Government's emerging stance on \nthis immediate problem and ensure that similar problems in the future \nreceive the serious and timely attention they deserve.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 219\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Value-added Agricultural \n     Products Market Access Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The export of value-added agricultural products is of \n     vital importance to the economy of the United States.\n       (2) In 1995, agriculture was the largest positive \n     contributor to the United States merchandise trade balance \n     with a trade surplus of $25,800,000,000.\n       (3) The growth of United States value-added agricultural \n     exports should continue to be an important factor in \n     improving the United States merchandise trade balance.\n       (4) Increasing the volume of value-added agricultural \n     exports will increase farm income in the United States, \n     thereby protecting family farms and contributing to the \n     economic well-being of rural communities in the United \n     States.\n       (5) Although the United States efficiently produces high-\n     quality value-added agricultural products, United States \n     producers cannot realize their full export potential because \n     many foreign countries deny fair and equitable market access \n     to United States agricultural products.\n       (6) The Foreign Agricultural Service estimates that United \n     States agricultural exports are reduced by $4,700,000,000 \n     annually due to unjustifiable imposition of sanitary and \n     phytosanitary measures that deny or limit market access to \n     United States products.\n       (7) The denial of fair and equitable market access for \n     United States value-added agricultural products impedes the \n     ability of United States farmers to export their products, \n     thereby harming the economic interests of the United States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to reduce or eliminate foreign unfair trade practices \n     and to remove constraints on fair and open trade in value-\n     added agricultural products;\n       (2) to ensure fair and equitable market access for exports \n     of United States value-added agricultural products; and\n       (3) to promote free and fair trade in value-added \n     agricultural products.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require the U.S. Trade Representative to determine \nwhether the European Union has failed to implement satisfactorily its \nobligations under certain trade agreements relating to U.S. meat and \npork exporting facilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n            fair trade in meat and pork products act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I join the minority leader today in \nintroducing two important bills regarding agricultural trade. The first \nis a bill that requires the U.S. Trade Representative to determine \nwhether the European Union has violated its trade agreements with the \nUnited States by failing to certify U.S. beef and pork processing \nplants for export to the European Union. The failure to certify our \nplants has cost the pork industry alone as much as $60 million \nannually.\n  The problem arises under the E.U.'s so-called Third Country Meat \nDirective. This directive, which has been in place since 1985, calls \nfor E.U. inspection and certification of U.S. meat plants as a \ncondition for accepting exports from those plants. Simply put, if a \nplant has not been certified, it cannot export to the E.U. member \nnations. Since the mid-1980's the E.U. has used this directive to \nprohibit over 400 U.S. facilities from exporting beef and pork to the \nE.U.\n  Many bilateral discussions have taken place between the E.U. and the \nUnited States on this issue since 1985. But no satisfactory resolution \nhas ever been reached. In early 1991, the then-U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, Carla Hills, initiated an action under section 301 of \nthe 1974 Trade Act. After a year of consultations and the certification \nof some U.S. plants, we entered into a settlement agreement, known as \nthe 1992 meat agreement. In exchange for the settlement agreement, the \nUnited States agreed to withdraw its 301 action.\n  Under the 1992 meat agreement, the E.U. agreed that U.S. plants would \nbe certified if their inspection systems are equivalent to the E.U.'s. \nIn spite of this agreement, and its commitments made under the WTO \nAgreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, the E.U. has not made \nany significant progress in certifying U.S. plants. Europe effectively \nremains a closed market for United States beef and pork.\n  What this bill does is require the USTR to determine under section \n306 whether the E.U. has violated its trade agreements. This is \nimportant because once a determination has been made, the USTR is \nrequired to take action. The action could take the form of unilateral \nretaliation, for example. Furthermore, the bill requires the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to reconsider our certification of European \nplants if this problem continues.\n  Mr. President, the impact of the E.U.'s blatant disregard of our \ntrade agreements is substantial for the U.S. meat industry. Our cattle \nand hog farmers have been effectively shut out of the entire European \nmarket. This comes at a time when American agriculture is becoming more \ndependent on foreign markets. In fact, USDA calculates that American \nfarmers will soon derive up to 30 percent of their net income from \nforeign trade. So global market access is critical to the viability of \nthe family farmer.\n  This bill sends a strong signal to the E.U. that we are no longer \nwilling to tolerate this egregious behavior. Bilateral negotiations \nhave failed. It is time to take swift and strong action to eliminate \nthis barrier to our value-added agricultural products.\n  We must also send a signal to our other foreign trading partners. \nTrade agreements must be followed. Commitments must be kept. The United \nStates will no longer sit idly by as the rest of the world thumbs it \nnose at their responsibilities as a trading partner. The stakes are \nsimply too high in terms of American jobs and standard of living.\n  This leads me to the second bill that I have cosponsored today with \nthe minority leader. This bill requires the USTR to identify, on an \nannual basis, those countries that deny market access to our value-\nadded agricultural products. It also requires identifying countries who \nare violating the sanitary and phytosanitary provisions of the GATT. \nThis procedure is similar to the special 301 procedure for intellectual \nproperty rights.\n  It is necessary to identify and understand the trade barriers faced \nby American agriculture so we can work to eliminate them. Not only is \nforeign trade vital to American farmers, it is vital to the U.S. \nbalance of payments. Agriculture trade is the shining star in an \notherwise increasing trade deficit. But we cannot rest on the success \nof the past. In existing markets we could be doing much better in terms \nof market share. And many markets remain closed to U.S. ag products.\n  This bill will help pinpoint our successes and our failures so we can \nmove forward on bilateral negotiations and, eventually, a new round of \nagricultural negotiations in the World Trade Organization, beginning in \n1999. This annual report will serve as a blueprint to achieving \nworldwide access for the commodities produced on America's family \nfarms.\n  I appreciate the minority leader's hard work on these two pieces of \nlegislation. And I look forward to working\n\n[[Page S753]]\n\nwith him during this Congress to get these bill enacted into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 220\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Trade in Meat and Pork \n     Products Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The European Union's Third Country Meat Directive has \n     been used to decertify more than 400 United States facilities \n     exporting beef and pork products to the European Union even \n     though United States health inspection procedures are \n     equivalent to those provided for in the Third Country Meat \n     Directive.\n       (2) An effect of the decertifications is to prohibit the \n     importation of United States beef and pork products into the \n     European Union.\n       (3) As a result of the decertifications, the highly \n     competitive United States pork industry loses as much as \n     $60,000,000 each year from trade with European Union \n     countries.\n       (4) In July 1987 and November 1990, at the request of \n     affected United States industries, the United States \n     initiated investigations under section 301 of the Trade Act \n     of 1974 into the European Union's administration of the Third \n     Country Meat Directive and sought resolution of the meat and \n     pork trade problems through the dispute settlement process \n     established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n       (5) The United States Trade Representative preliminarily \n     concluded on October 10, 1992, that the European Union's \n     administration of the Third Country Meat Directive created a \n     burden on and restricted United States commerce.\n       (6) Bilateral talks, initiated as a result of that finding, \n     resulted in an Exchange of Letters in which the United States \n     and the European Union concluded that the meat inspection \n     systems of the United States and the European Union provided \n     ``equivalent safeguards against public health risks'' and \n     agreed to take steps to resolve remaining differences \n     regarding meat inspection.\n       (7) Even though the United States terminated the section \n     301 investigation as a result of the Exchange of Letters, the \n     United States determined that the practices under \n     investigation would have been actionable if an acceptable \n     agreement had not been reached.\n       (8) United States meat and pork producers have displayed \n     consistent interest in exporting products to the European \n     Union and have undertaken substantial investment to take the \n     steps specified by the Exchange of Letters.\n       (9) The European Union has failed to acknowledge changes in \n     plant safety and inspection procedures undertaken in the \n     United States specifically at the European Union's request \n     and has not fulfilled its obligation to inspect and relist \n     United States producers who have taken the steps specified by \n     the Exchange of Letters.\n       (10) The actions of the European Union in conducting United \n     States plant inspections places the European Union in \n     violation of commitments made in the Exchange of Letters.\n       (11) The European Union, in addition to being a party to \n     the Exchange of Letters, is a signatory to GATT 1994 and to \n     the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and \n     Phytosanitary Measures, which requires that meat and pork \n     inspection procedures under Department of Agriculture \n     regulations be treated as equivalent to inspection procedures \n     required by the European Union under the Third Country Meat \n     Directive if the regulations achieve the European level of \n     sanitary protection.\n       (12) Whenever a foreign country is not satisfactorily \n     implementing an international trade measure or agreement, the \n     United States Trade Representative is required under section \n     306(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2416(b)(1)) to \n     determine the actions to be taken under section 301(a) of \n     such Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) Exchange of letters.--The term ``Exchange of Letters'' \n     means the exchange of letters concerning the application of \n     the Community Third Country Directive, signed in May 1991 and \n     November 1992, which constitute the agreement between the \n     United States and the European Economic Community regarding \n     the Third Country Meat Directive.\n       (2) GATT 1994.--The term ``GATT 1994'' means the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade annexed to the WTO Agreement.\n       (3) Third country meat directive; community third country \n     directive.--The terms ``Third Country Meat Directive'' and \n     ``Community Third Country Directive'' mean the European \n     Union's Council Directive 72/462/EEC relating to inspection \n     and certification of slaughter and processing plants that \n     export meat and pork products to the European Union.\n       (4) WTO agreement.--The term ``WTO Agreement'' means the \n     Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization entered \n     into on April 15, 1994.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to require the \nCommissioner of Social Security to submit specific legislative \nrecommendations to ensure the solvency of the Social Security trust \nfunds; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     social security act amendments\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation which I now \nsend to the desk.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that my colleagues are familiar with the \nreport recently released by the Social Security Advisory Council. That \ngroup, appointed by HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, was charged with \nmaking recommendations as to how to place our largest and most popular \nprogram--Social Security--on a stable and secure path for the 21st \ncentury. Their recommendations have accelerated an already vigorous \ndebate concerning the eventual course of Social Security reform.\n  As someone who is greatly concerned about the future of Social \nSecurity, let me offer my view that we cannot afford the kind of \ngridlock and partisanship in rescuing that program that we have seen in \nthe Medicare debate. It is vitally important that all of us come \ntogether to address problems of retirement security in a bipartisan \nway--one that involves all of the important players in this debate--\nboth in Congress and within the administration.\n  My legislation, Mr. President, would simply establish an additional \nsafeguard for the solvency of the Social Security system on which so \nmany American senior citizens depend. Specifically, it will require the \nCommissioner of Social Security--at the same time each year that the \nSocial Security trustees report to Congress on the solvency of the \nSocial Security system--to recommend those legislative actions which \nthe Commissioner deems necessary to place the Social Security system in \nlong-term actuarial balance.\n  Mr. President, I believe that there is broad bipartisan consensus \nabout certain aspects of Social Security. Certainly there is wide \nbipartisan support for the view that protecting the stability and \nsolvency of the system should be among our highest national priorities. \nAnd, most of us recognize the stark fiscal realities facing the Social \nSecurity system. I refer to the fact that according to the Social \nSecurity trustees, beginning in the year 2012, the Social Security \nsystem will face annual operating deficits, meaning that there will \nthen be inadequate revenues coming into the system to support current \nbenefits. From that year onward--indeed for most of the 75-year period \nduring which actuarial solvency is measured--there is an ever widening\n\n[[Page S754]]\n\ngap between the promises of Social Security and the means available to \npay for them, unless we act to change the law.\n  It is beyond those points of agreement, however, that our bipartisan \nconsensus breaks down. Even though we all know that it will take \nbipartisan action to safeguard this system, the Social Security system \ncould well become a sharpening focus of partisan political activity. \nApparently the temptations here are simply too great for politicians to \nresist. It is the easier--though less responsible--course to ignore the \nproblems within the system, and to take political advantage of those \nwho seek to repair them.\n  We thus find ourselves in a peculiar situation. Each year, the Social \nSecurity trustees send information to Congress about Social Security's \ntroubled future, and call upon Congress to act to restore the system to \nlong-term solvency. Yet, at the same time, the custodians of that \nsystem--indeed, the soon-departing Social Security Commissioner \nherself--remain utterly silent as to how this is to be done. It is \nastounding to me that an individual will again be placed in charge of \nthis most enormous and vital Government program, and yet not be \nrequired under the law to forward proposals to keep it stable and \nsecure.\n  Toward the end of last year, the staff of the Budget Committee were \nbriefed by representatives of the Social Security Administration as to \nhow they were meeting their established performance goals under the \nGovernment Performance and Results Act. One of the goals established by \nthe Social Security Administration was to improve public confidence in \nSocial Security. Meanwhile, no recommendations are coming from the \nCommissioner of Social Security as to how to justify that confidence in \nthe long term. It is long past time to repair this discontinuity.\n  I believe that this legislation should not be controversial. It \nstands to elementary reason that it should be part and parcel of the \nduties inherent in the position of Social Security Commissioner, to \nmake such recommendations as are necessary to protect the future of the \nSocial Security system. I hope that Congress will act quickly, and will \npass this legislation early in this session.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 222. A bill to establish an advisory commission to provide advice \nand recommendations on the creation of an integrated, coordinated \nFederal policy designed to prepare for and respond to serious drought \nemergencies; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n             the national drought policy study act of 1997\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that I \nbelieve will finally start us down the long neglected road of \ndeveloping a coherent, integrated, and coordinated national drought \npolicy. I offer this legislation, Mr. President, in the wake of one of \nthe most devastating droughts the southwestern United States has seen \nin a century, a drought for which there was simply no preparation at \neither Federal, State, or local levels.\n  Mr. President, some people do not consider a drought to be a \ndisaster, but if live in a drought, and live through a drought, it is \njust as much a disaster as a tornado or an earthquake. It causes just \nas much devastation.\n  The problem is it kind of creeps up. And in the flow of its \ndestructive force are many ruined lives, many lost businesses, many \npeople who cannot make the mortgages on their farms and homes. It is \ntime we have some coordinated effort to address these disasters. This \nlegislation seeks to get that done.\n  Before I talk about the particulars of my bill, however, I would like \nto spend a few minutes describing to my colleagues just how devastating \na serious drought disaster can be. Unfortunately, my State of New \nMexico can be used as a prime example of this devastation.\n  Mr. President, water is everything in New Mexico. Ours is an arid \nState, and the rain and snowfall we receive in the spring and winter is \nliterally a matter of life and death to our cities, towns, businesses, \nand environment. In 1995-96, however, precipitation levels were the \nlowest the had been in the 100 years that the State has been keeping \nsuch records. The results were nothing less than disastrous.\n  For example, the drought decimated the State's agricultural \ncommunity. Every single county in the State received disaster \ndeclarations from the USDA. Farmers in the southern part of the State \nwere forced to go to water wells, depleting an already-taxed aquifer. \nAnd, in northeastern New Mexico, winter wheat crops failed for the \nfirst time in anyone's memory.\n  The drought also destroyed forage for livestock producers, causing an \nindustry already hit hard by high feed prices to hurt even more. In \nall, it was estimated that ranchers lost up to 85 percent of their \ncapital.\n  The drought had a catastrophic impact on New Mexico's forests. The \nDome, Hondo, and Chino Wells fires were all sparked by the incredibly \ndry conditions brought on by the drought, and were exacerbated by the \nlack of water needed to extinguished them. In all, there were over \n1,200 fires in New Mexico last year burning over 140,000 acres of land \nand wiping out dozens of homes and businesses.\n  The drought also caused municipal water systems to be taxed to the \nhilt, forcing many cities and towns to consider drastically raised \nwater rates for their citizens. And the drought meant that critical \nstretches of the Rio Grande River were almost completely dry, which in \nturn meant vastly reduced amounts of water for wildlife such as the \nendangered silvery minnow.\n  And New Mexico's problems were those of just one State: the 1995-96 \ndrought devastated the entire southwestern region. Arizona, California, \nColorado, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Kansas were all severely \nimpacted by the drought. Small businessmen, farmers, and ranchers all \nacross the area were wiped out. Oklahoma experienced almost $500 \nmillion in agricultural losses alone. Texas's agricultural losses \nexceeded $2 billion, while its overall statewide losses were over $5 \nbillion. And in the southwest as a whole, almost 3 million acres of \nland were engulfed by fire, an amount almost three times the 5-year \nacreage.\n  In short, Mr. President, this drought was a killer. We in the \nSouthwest were fortunate that this year is proving to be a much better \nyear for precipitation than the last. But we do not know what the next \nyear will bring. There could be yet another drought, again sending \ntowns scrambling to drill new water wells, sweeping fire across bone-\ndry forests, and forcing farmers and ranchers to watch their way of \nlife being wiped out.\n  But I do not want to give the impression that severe droughts are \nsolely the curse of the Southwest. Every region in the United States \ncan be hit by these catastrophes. In 1976-77, a short but intense \ndrought struck the Pacific Northwest, requiring the construction of \nnumerous dams and reservoirs to secure millions of additional acre feet \nof needed water. The 1988 Midwest drought caused over $5 billion in \nlosses. And the infamous 7-year drought of 1986-93 experienced by \nCalifornia, the Pacific Northwest, and the Great Basin States caused \nextensive damage to water systems, water quality, fish and wildlife, \nand recreational activities.\n  And yet, even though they are so pervasive, and even though they so \nseriously impact the economic and environmental well-being of the \nentire Nation, we in New Mexico have learned from hard experience that \nthe United States is poorly prepared to deal with serious drought \nemergencies. As a result of the hardships being suffered in every part \nof my state last year, I convened a special Multi-State Drought Task \nForce of Federal, State, local, and tribal emergency management \nagencies to coordinate efforts to respond to the drought. The task \nforce was ably headed up by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nand included every Federal agency that has programs designed to deal \nwith drought.\n  Unfortunately, what the task force found was that although the \nFederal Government has numerous drought related programs on the books, \nthere simply is no integrated, coordinated system of implementing those \nprograms. For example, while most of the Federal drought programs \nrequire a person to apply proactively for relief under them, there was \nalmost a total lack of knowledge about those programs on the part of \nthe victims they were designed to help. Worse yet, the programs that \nare in place are fragmented and ad hoc, and stop well short\n\n[[Page S755]]\n\nof comprehensively helping people prepare for or respond to drought. \nConsequently, at first drought victims in this Nation do not know who \nto turn to for help, and then find that the help that is available is \ntoo late and totally inadequate.\n  These fundamental problems were specifically identified by the Multi-\nState Drought Task Force in its final report on the drought of 1995-96. \nThe task force stated that ``[t]he States are left are left to navigate \nthe ocean of applicable assistance programs as best they can.'' The \ntask force went on to observe:\n\n       The Federal government does not have a national drought \n     policy, national climatic monitoring system, nor an \n     institutionalized organizational structure to address \n     drought. Therefore, every time a drought occurs the Federal \n     government is behind the power curve playing catch up in an \n     ad hoc fashion to meet the needs of the impacted states and \n     their citizens.\n\n  The Western Governors' Association recognized the exact same problems \nin its 1996 Drought Response Action Plan. The WGA stated that ``[t[he \nabsence of a lead agency to handle drought--in addition to the lack of \nFederal interagency coordination--has significantly reduced the Federal \nGovernment's ability to provide adequate support over the long term.''\n  Indeed, the Multi-State Drought Task Force recommended that \n``Congress in coordination with the administration develop and adopt a \nNational Drought Policy to include a national drought monitory system \nand an institutionalized organizational structure with a designated \nlead Federal agency to direct and coordinate the efforts of the Federal \nGovernment in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from \ndrought, as well as mitigating the impacts of drought.''\n  Similarly, the Western Governors' Association recommends \n``[d]evelop[ing] a national drought policy or framework that integrates \nactions and responsibilities among all levels of government (Federal, \nState, regional, and local). This policy should plainly spell out \npreparedness, response, and mitigation measures to be provided by each \nentity.'' And it is my understanding that the National Governors' \nAssociation is considering adopting a similar recommendation sponsored \nby Governor Johnson of New Mexico.\n  All of this, Mr. President, has led me to introduce today's \nlegislation. I believe that my bill will be the first step toward \nfinally establishing a coherent, effective national drought policy. My \nbill creates a commission comprised of representatives of those \nFederal, State, local, and tribal agencies and organizations which are \nmost involved with drought issues. On the Federal side, the Commission \nwill include representatives from USDA, Interior, the Army, FEMA, SBA, \nand Commerce--agencies which all currently have drought-related \nprograms on the books. Equally important will be the nonfederal \nmembers, including representatives from the National Governors' \nAssociation, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and four persons \nrepresentative of those groups that are always hardest hit by drought \nemergencies.\n  The Commission will be charged with determining what needs exists on \nthe Federal, State, local, and tribal levels with regard to drought; \nwith reviewing existing Federal, State, local, and tribal drought \nprograms; and with determining what gaps exist between the needs of \ndrought victims and those programs currently designed to deal with \ndrought.\n  More importantly, the Commission will then be charged with making \nrecommendations on how Federal drought laws and programs can be better \nintegrated into a comprehensive national policy to mitigate the impacts \nof, and respond to, serious drought emergencies. Should Federal drought \nprograms be consolidated under one single existing agency? How can the \nNation be better prepared for these disasters? Should emergency loan \nprograms that stand the risk of sinking drought victims deeper into \ndebt be reevaluated? These are just some of the questions that we in \nCongress need guidance on if we are to move to the next level in \ndeveloping a national drought strategy.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, my legislation is just the first step \nin addressing the major national problem of drought disasters, but it \nis a step that must be taken quickly. Drought can strike any State, at \nany time, for any duration. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND (for himself, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Helms, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Shelby, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 223. A bill to prohibit the expenditure of Federal funds on \nactivities by Federal agencies to encourage labor union membership, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                   LABOR UNION MEMBERSHIP LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a very \nimportant piece of legislation that would affect every American \ntaxpayer. This measure would prohibit Federal funds from being used to \nencourage labor union membership.\n\n  Mr. President, I was shocked to learn that the Department of Labor \nhas published and distributed brochures which state, If you don't have \na union, you may want to consider joining an existing union or working \nwith others to start one. These brochures are designed to help American \nworkers know their rights when it comes to various forms of \ndiscrimination. I recognize the importance of these brochures, but I \nfirmly believe that it is not the responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment to encourage or discourage labor union membership in any \nform. Organized labor has the resources and the manpower to do their \nown recruiting. They certainly should not be receiving free \nsolicitation at the expense of the American taxpayer.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today specifically prohibits \nany Federal agency from using Federal funds for programs, seminars, \nstaff positions, or publications which would compel, instruct, \nencourage, urge, or persuade individuals to join labor unions. As I \nstated before, it simply is not the responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment to encourage union membership. The American taxpayer should \nnot bear the burden of promoting labor unions.\n  My distinguished colleagues, Senators Faircloth, Helms, Hutchinson, \nKempthorne, Shelby, and Sessions, join me as original cosponsors of \nthis measure that I send to the desk. I invite our other colleagues to \njoin us in support of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 224. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit \ncovered beneficiaries under the military health care system who are \nalso entitled to Medicare to enroll in the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n\n\n             military retirees health benefits legislation\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will return a sense of fairness to the military health care \nsystem by providing Medicare-eligible military retirees the same health \ncare plan that is currently available to every other retired Federal \nemployee. Under this legislation, all Medicare-eligible military \nretirees and their family members will be given the option to \nparticipate in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan [FEHBP].\n  Under the current system military retirees lose their guaranteed \naccess to military medical care at age 65 and are forced to rely \nexclusively on Medicare. It is worth noting that our military retirees \nare the only group of Federal employees whose health plan is taken away \nat age 65. I am sure that my colleagues would agree that this situation \nis not only inherently unfair, but that it also breaks a long standing \nhealth care commitment to our military retirees. When these men and \nwomen joined the Armed Forces, they were promised health care for both \nthem and their families, for the rest of their lives. This was a \ncommitment. This was in writing. Now, at age 65, they find out that \nthis commitment is being withdrawn.\n  Mr. President, the commonly held belief that the health care provided \nfor military retirees is second to none is a myth. The truth is that \nwhen you compare it to what is provided by other large employers \nincluding General Motors, IBM, Exxon, and the rest of the Federal \nGovernment, the health care that is provided to our Medicare-eligible \nmilitary retirees and their family members has become second to almost \nall others.\n\n[[Page S756]]\n\n  This bill that I am introducing today is the same legislation that I \nintroduced in the 104th Congress. Although my legislation was not \nadopted, the fiscal year 1997 Senate-passed version of the National \nDefense Authorization Act Conference Report directed the Department of \nDefense to conduct a study of the cost and feasibility of extending the \noption of enrollment in FEHBP to our Medicare-eligible military \nretirees. This report is due to Congress on March 1, 1997. I am hopeful \nthat this study will thoroughly examine this issue and provide \nmeaningful recommendations that we can use to strengthen the military \nhealth care system during the Armed Services Committee's consideration \nof the bill I am introducing today.\n  Mr. President, this legislation represents a major step forward in \nthe application of equitable standards of health care for all Federal \nemployees and honors our commitment to those veterans who served our \nNation faithfully through many years of arduous military service. I \ninvite my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 225. A bill to amend chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, \nrelating to protective orders, sealing of cases, disclosures of \ndiscovery information in civil actions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     the sunshine in litigation act\n\n  Mr. KOHL.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Sunshine in Litigation Act, \na measure that addresses the growing abuse of secrecy orders issued by \nour Federal courts. All too often our Federal courts allow vital \ninformation that is discovered in litigation--and which directly bears \non public health and safety--to be covered up, to be shielded from \npeople whose lives are potentially at stake, and from the public \nofficials we have asked to protect our health and safety.\n  All this happens because of the use of so-called protective orders--\nreally gag orders issued by courts--that are designed to keep \ninformation discovered in the course of litigation secret and \nundisclosed. Typically, injured victims agree to a defendant's request \nto keep lawsuit information secret. They agree because defendants \nthreaten that, without secrecy, they will refuse to pay a settlement. \nVictims cannot afford to take such chances. And while courts in these \nsituations actually have the legal authority to deny requests for \nsecrecy, typically they do not--because both sides have agreed, and \njudges have other matters they prefer to attend to. So judges are \nregularly and frequently entering these protective orders, using the \npower of the Federal Government to keep people in the dark about the \ndangers they face.\n  The measure that I am introducing today will bring crucial \ninformation out of the darkness and into the light. The measure amends \nrule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to require that judges \nweigh the impact on public health and safety before approving these \nsecrecy orders. It is simple, effective, and straightforward. The \nJudiciary Committee reported out identical legislation last Congress by \na bipartisan 11 to 7 majority.\n  Our bill essentially codifies what is already the practice of the \nbest judges. In cases that do not affect public health safety, existing \npractice would continue, and courts could still issue protective orders \nas they do today. But in cases affecting public health and safety \ncourts would apply a balancing test: they could permit secrecy only if \nthe need for privacy outweighs the public's need to know about \npotential health or safety hazards. Moreover, courts could not, under \nthis measure, issue protective orders that would prevent disclosures to \nregulatory agencies.\n  Although the law may result in some small additional burden on \njudges, a little extra work from judges seems a tiny price to pay for \nprotecting blameless people from dangers. Every day, in the course of \nlitigation, judges make tough calls about how to construe the public \ninterest and interpret other laws that Congress passes. I am confident \nthat the courts will administer this law fairly and sensibly. If this \nrequires extra work, then the work is well worth it. After all no one \nargues that spoiled meat should be let out on the market because \nstricter regulations mean more work for FDA meat inspectors.\n\n  The problem of excessive secrecy orders in cases involving public \nhealth and safety has been apparent for many years. The Judiciary \nCommittee first held hearings on this issue in 1990. ``Court Secrecy,'' \nHearings before the Subcommittee. On Courts and Administrative \nPractice, Committee on the Judiciary, May 17, 1990, 101st Congress, 2d \nSession. The committee held hearings again in 1994.\n  In 1990, Arthur Bryant, the executive director of Trial Lawyers for \nPublic Justice, told us: ``The one thing we learned * * * is that this \nproblem is far more egregious than we ever imagined. It goes the length \nand depth of this country, and the frank truth is that much of civil \nlitigation in this country is taking place in secret.'' Four years \nlater, the attorney Gerry Spence told us about 19 cases he had been \ninvolved in in which his clients had to sign secrecy agreements. They \nincluded cases involving defects in a hormonal pregnancy test that \ncaused severe birth defect, a defective braking system of a steam \nroller, and an improperly manufactured tire rim.\n  Individual examples of this problem abound. For over a decade, \nMiracle Recreation, a U.S. playground equipment company, marketed a \nmerry-go-round that caused serious injuries to scores of small \nchildren--including severed fingers and feet. Lawsuits brought against \nthe manufacturer were confidentially settled, preventing the public and \nthe Consumer Products Safety Commission from learning about the hazard. \nIt took more than a decade for regulators to discover the hazard and \nfor the company to recall the merry-go-round.\n  There are yet more cases like these. In 1973, GM began marketing \nvehicles with dangerously-placed fuel tanks that tended to rupture, \nburn, and explode on impact more frequently than regular tanks. Soon \nafter these vehicles hit the American road, tragic accidents began \noccurring, and lawsuits were filed. More than 150 lawsuits were settled \nconfidentially by GM. For years, this secrecy prevented the public from \nlearning of the dangers of these vehicles--6 million of which are still \non the road. It wasn't until a trial in 1993 that the public began \nlearning of the dangers of GM sidesaddle gas tanks and the GM crash \ntest data which demonstrated these dangers.\n  Another case involves Fred Barbee, a Wisconsin resident whose wife, \nCarol, died because of a defective heart valve. Mr. Barbee told us that \nmonths and years before his wife died, the valve manufacturer had \nquietly, without public knowledge, settled dozens of lawsuits in which \nthe valve's defects were demonstrated. So when Mrs. Barbee's valve \nmalfunctioned, she rushed to a health clinic in Spooner, WI, thinking, \nas did her doctors, that she was suffering from a heart attack. \nIgnorant of the evidence that her valve was defective, Mrs. Barbee was \nmisdiagnosed. Mrs. Barbee was treated incorrectly and died. To this \nday, Mr. Barbee believes that but for the secret settlement of heart \nvalve lawsuits, he and his wife would have been aware of the valve \ndefect, and his wife would be alive today.\n\n  At the 1994 Judiciary Committee hearing, we heard from a family which \nI must call the Does because they are under a secrecy order and were \nafraid to use their own names when talking to us and to our committee. \nThe Does were the victims of tragic medical malpractice that resulted \nin serious brain damage to their child. A friend of the Does is using \nthe same doctor, but Mrs. Doe is terrified of saying anything to her \nfriend for fear of violating the secrecy order that governed her \nlawsuit settlement. Mrs. Doe is afraid that if she talks, the defendant \nin her case will suspend the ongoing settlement payments that allow her \nto care for her injured child.\n  What sort of court system prohibits a woman from telling her friend \nthat her child might be in danger? And the more disturbing question is \nthis: What other secrets are currently held under lock and key which \ncould be saving lives if they were made public?\n  Mr. President, having said all this, I must in fairness recognize \nthat there is another side to this problem. Privacy is a cherished \npossession, and business information is an important commodity. For \nthis reason, the courts must,\n\n[[Page S757]]\n\nin some cases, keep trade secrets and other business information \nconfidential. The goal of this measure I have introduced is to ensure \nthat courts do not carelessly and automatically sanction secrecy when \nthe health and safety of the American public is at stake. At the same \ntime, it will still allow defendants to obtain secrecy orders when the \nneed for privacy is significant and substantial.\n  To attack the problem of excessive court secrecy is not to attack the \nbusiness community. Most of the time, businesses seek protective orders \nfor legitimate reasons. And although a few opponents of product \nliability reform may dispute that businesses care about public health \nand safety, we know that they do. Business people want to know about \ndangerous and defective products, and they want regulatory agencies to \nhave the information necessary to protect the public.\n  The Sunshine in Litigation Act is a simple effort to protect the \nsafety of the American people. Its benefits far outweigh any of the \nworst imaginable disadvantages.

A bill to establish felony violations for the failure to pay \nlegal child support obligations, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the deadbeat parents punishment act of 1997\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I introduce the Deadbeat Parents \nPunishment Act of 1997. Along with Senator Shelby and Congressmen Hyde \nand Schumer, I introduced the original Child Support Recovery Act in \n1992, and today Senator DeWine and I are pleased to introduce a measure \nthat will toughen the original law to ensure that more serious crimes \nreceive more serious punishment. In so doing, we can send a clear \nmessage to deadbeat dads and moms: ignore the law, ignore your \nresponsibilities, and you will pay a high price. In other words, pay up \nor go to jail.\n  Current law already makes it a Federal offense to willfully fail to \npay child support obligations to a child in another State if the \nobligation has remained unpaid for longer than a year or is greater \nthan $5,000. However, current law provides for a maximum of just 6 \nmonths in prison for a first offense, and a maximum of 2 years for a \nsecond offense. A first offense, however--no matter how egregious--is \nnot a felony under current law.\n  Police officers and prosecutors have used the current law \neffectively, but they have found that current misdemeanor penalties do \nnot adequately deal with more serious cases--those cases in which \nparents move from State to State to intentionally evade child support \npenalties, or fail to pay child support obligations for more than 2 \nyears--serious cases that deserve serious, felony punishment. In \nresponse to these concerns, President Clinton has drafted legislation \nthat would address this problem, and we are pleased to introduce it \ntoday.\n  This new effort builds on past successes achieved through bipartisan \nwork. In the 4 years since the original deadbeat parents legislation \nwas signed into law by President Bush, collections have increased by \nnearly 50 percent, from $8 to $11.8 billion, and we should be proud of \nthat increase. Moreover, a new national database has helped identify \n60,000 delinquent fathers, over half of whom owed money to women on \nwelfare.\n  Nevertheless, there is much more we can do. It has been estimated \nthat if delinquent parents fully paid up their child support, \napproximately 800,000 women and children could be taken off the welfare \nrolls. So our new legislation cracks down on the worst violators, and \nmakes clear that intentional or long-term evasion of child support \nresponsibilities will not receive a slap on the wrist. In so doing, it \nwill help us continue the fight to ensure that every child receives the \nparental support they deserve.\n  Mr. President, with this bill we have a chance to make a difference \nin the lives of families across the country. So I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to give police and prosecutors the tools \nthey need to effectively pursue individuals who seek to avoid their \nfamily obligations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 226\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ESTABLISHMENT OF FELONY VIOLATIONS.\n\n       Section 228 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 228. Failure to pay legal child support obligations\n\n       ``(a) Offense.--Any person who--\n       ``(1) willfully fails to pay a support obligation with \n     respect to a child who resides in another State, if such \n     obligation has remained unpaid for a period longer than one \n     year, or is greater than $5,000;\n       ``(2) travels in interstate or foreign commerce with the \n     intent to evade a support obligation, if such obligation has \n     remained unpaid for a period longer than one year, or is \n     greater than $5,000; or\n       ``(3) willfully fails to pay a support obligation with \n     respect to a child who resides in another State, if such \n     obligation has remained unpaid for a period longer than two \n     years, or is greater than $10,000;\n\n     shall be punished as provided in subsection (c).\n       ``(b) Presumption.--The existence of a support obligation \n     that was in effect for the time period charged in the \n     indictment or information creates a rebuttable presumption \n     that the obligor has the ability to pay the support \n     obligation for that time period.\n       ``(c) Punishment.--The punishment for an offense under this \n     section is--\n       ``(1) in the case of a first offense under subsection \n     (a)(1), a fine under this title, imprisonment for not more \n     than 6 months, or both; and\n\n[[Page S758]]\n\n       ``(2) in the case of an offense under subsection (a)(2) or \n     (a)(3), or a second or subsequent offense under subsection \n     (a)(1), a fine under this title, imprisonment for not more \n     than 2 years, or both.\n       ``(d) Mandatory Restitution.--Upon a conviction under this \n     section, the court shall order restitution under section \n     3663A in an amount equal to the total unpaid support \n     obligation as it exists at the time of sentencing:\n       ``(e) Definitions.--As used in this section--\n       ``(1) the term `support obligation' means any amount \n     determined under a court order or an order of an \n     administrative process pursuant to the law of a State to be \n     due from a person for the support and maintenance of a child \n     or of a child and the parent with whom the child is living; \n     and\n       ``(2) the term `State' includes any State of the United \n     States, the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, \n     territory, or possession of the United States.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       The Child Support Recovery Amendments Act of 1996 amends \n     the current criminal statute regarding the failure to pay \n     legal child support obligations, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 228, to \n     create felony violations for egregious offenses. Current law \n     makes it a federal offense willfully to fail to pay a child \n     support obligation with respect to a child who lives in \n     another State if the obligation has remained unpaid for \n     longer than a year or is greater than $5,000. A first offense \n     is subject to a maximum of six months of imprisonment, and a \n     second or subsequent offense to a maximum of two years.\n       The bill addresses the law enforcement and prosecutorial \n     concern that the current statute does not adequately address \n     more serious instances of nonpayment of support obligations. \n     A maximum term of imprisonment of just six months does not \n     meet the sentencing goals of punishment and deterrence. \n     Egregious offenses, such as those involving parents who move \n     from State-to-State to evade child support payments, require \n     more severe penalties.\n       Section 2 of the bill creates two new categories of felony \n     offenses, subject to a two-year maximum prison term. These \n     are: (1) traveling in interstate or foreign commerce with the \n     intent to evade a support obligation if the obligation has \n     remained unpaid for a period longer than one year or is \n     greater than $5,000; and (2) willfully failing to pay a \n     support obligation regarding a child residing in another \n     State, if the obligation has remained unpaid for a period \n     longer than two years or is greater than $10,000. These \n     offenses, proposed 18 U.S.C. Sec. 228(a) (2) and (3), \n     indicate a level of culpability greater than that reflected \n     by the current six-month maximum prison term for a first \n     offense. The level of culpability demonstrated by offenders \n     who commit the offenses described in these provisions is akin \n     to that demonstrated by repeat offenders under current law, \n     who are subject to a maximum two-year prison term.\n       Proposed section 228(b) of title 18, United States Code, \n     states that the existence of a support obligation in effect \n     for the time period charged in the indictment or information \n     creates a rebuttable presumption that the obligor has the \n     ability to pay the support obligation for that period. \n     Although ``ability to pay'' is not an element of the offense, \n     a demonstration of the obligor's ability to pay contributes \n     to a showing of willful failure to pay the known obligation. \n     The presumption in favor of ability to pay is needed because \n     proof that the obligor is earning or acquiring income or \n     assets is difficult. Child support offenders are notorious \n     for hiding assets and failing to document earnings. A \n     presumption of ability to pay, based on the existence of a \n     support obligation determined under State law, is useful in a \n     jury's determination of whether the nonpayment was willful. \n     An offender who lacks the ability to pay a support obligation \n     due to legitimate, changed circumstances occurring after the \n     issuance of a support order has civil means available to \n     reduce the support obligation and thereby avoid violation \n     of the federal criminal statute in the first instance. In \n     addition, the presumption of ability to pay set forth in \n     the bill is rebuttable; a defendant can put forth evidence \n     of his or her inability to pay.\n       The reference to mandatory restitution in proposed section \n     228(d) of title 18, United States Code, amends the current \n     restitution requirement in section 228(c). The amendment \n     conforms the restitution citation to the new mandatory \n     restitution provision of federal law, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3663A, \n     enacted as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death \n     Penalty Act of 1996, P.L. 104-132, section 204. This change \n     simply clarifies the applicability of that statute to the \n     offense of failure to pay legal child support obligations.\n       For all of the violations set forth in proposed subsection \n     (a) of section 228, the requirement of the existence of a \n     State determination regarding the support obligation is the \n     same as under current law. Under proposed subsection (e)(1), \n     as under current subsection (d)(1)(A), the government must \n     show that the support obligation is an amount determined \n     under a court order or an order of an administrative process \n     pursuant to the law of a State to be due from a person for \n     the support and maintenance of a child or of a child and the \n     parent with whom the child is living.\n       Proposed subsection (e)(2) of section 228 amends the \n     definition of ``State,'' currently in subsection (d)(2), to \n     clarify the prosecutions may be brought under this statute in \n     a commonwealth, such as Puerto Rico. The current definition \n     of ``State'' in section 228, which includes possessions and \n     territories of the United States, does not include \n     commonwealths.\n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Reid, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Ford, Mr. Hollings and Mr. WYDEN):\n\n  S.J. Res. 12. A joint resolution proposing a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment; to the Committee on the Judiciary\n\n\n                Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment\n\n  Mr. DROGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a constitutional \namendment for myself, Senator Daschle, Senator Reid, Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Hollings, Senator Ford, and Senator Wyden.\n  The constitutional amendment will be familiar to most Senators \nbecause it is about something that we are discussing a lot these days: \nbalancing the Federal budget. It is a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the Federal budget.\n  A number of us have taken the position that we would support a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget if the constitutional \namendment is the right kind of amendment. I want to talk a little about \nthe constitutional amendment being proposed and the one was proposed 2 \nyears ago here in the U.S. Senate.\n  I think fiscal discipline is necessary in this country, because our \nfiscal policy is out of whack. I think we have borrowed from our \nchildren and grandchildren. I think we ought to balance the Federal \nbudget. I do not object to--in fact, I have supported and will \nsupport--the right kind of balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  I will not, however, support a proposal to amend the U.S. \nConstitution that would enshrine in the Constitution the practice of \nusing the Social Security trust funds to balance the Federal budget. \nThat is precisely what the balanced budget amendment that the Judiciary \nCommittee will mark up later this week would do. That is why Senator \nHollings and I and so many others are introducing a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, but one that will not use the Social \nSecurity trust funds to do so.\n  Let me explain why that is important. If you were in the private \nsector and you had a business and in that business you put away some \nmoney for your employees in a pension fund, and then at the end of the \nyear you discovered that you had run a big loss, you might say, ``Well, \nI will just take my employees' pension funds and bring them over into \nthe operating side of the business, and I will tell everybody that I \ndidn't have a loss. I am using the employee pension fund to cover my \noperating loss.''\n  If you did that, you would be on your way to doing 2 years hard \ntennis in some minimum security prison because it is against the law. \nYou can't do that. And we ought not be able to do it in the public \nsector either.\n  We are going to collect $78 billion more this year in Social Security \nrevenues than we will expend in the Social Security system. We will, \njust this year alone, accrue a $78 billion surplus in Social Security. \nWhy? Because we need the money after the turn of the century when the \nbaby boomers retire. We have the biggest baby crop in the history of \nour country. When that baby crop retires after the turn of the century, \nwe are going to have the largest strain on the Social Security system. \nTherefore, we are collecting more now than we need in the Social \nSecurity system and that savings is going to be used at the turn of the \ncentury to help fund the system when we need it.\n  But what is happening? What is happening is that extra revenue is \nused as just ordinary operating money and is used to say, ``Well, now \nwe have reached a balanced budget in the year 2002,'' when, in fact, \nthe budget is not in balance at all. It appears in balance only because \nyou use the Social Security revenue or trust funds to show a balanced \nbudget.\n  I want to demonstrate this with a chart. This chart is important \nbecause I was at a hearing the other day and they had the debt clock at \nthe hearing--this clock that keeps running at $4,000 a second, or it \nis. The debt clock keeps running and running. I said to the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Hatch, the debt clock actually\n\n[[Page S759]]\n\nmakes the point I wanted to make at this hearing, because when you \nbalance the budget, presumably you have stopped the debt clock from \nincreasing. If you balance the Federal budget, the Federal Government \nought not be taking on more debt. You have stopped the increase in \ndebt. But guess what happens? In the very year in which the majority \nparty says it will have balanced the budget, the Federal debt will \nincrease by $130 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  This is the debt. These are the numbers: $5.4 trillion in 2002, and \nit is still increasing on that year, by $130 billion. Why will the debt \nincrease by $130 billion in the year in which you claim you have \nbalanced the budget? Answer: The budget isn't in balance because you \nhave collected the Social Security moneys that are an obligation \nbecause you need to use them later. But then you have brought them over \nhere to use them to say you have balanced the budget.\n  We have not balanced the budget until and unless we stop the Federal \ndebt increases. And the proposal to balance the budget before the \nJudiciary Committee does not do that. The congressional majority \nclaimed that its budget plan would reach balance, but then the \nCongressional Budget Office says the deficit for that year is $104 \nbillion, and the debt increases by $130 billion. This is a giant ruse. \nIt, unfortunately, dishonestly uses the Social Security trust funds for \na purpose that Congress never intended.\n  I know a little something about this because in 1983 I was on the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee when the Social Security reform bill was \nenacted. When it was enacted, it was determined there would be savings \nfor the future when the Social Security trust funds would be needed. I \noffered an amendment that day 14 years ago in the committee saying, \n``If you do not put these savings aside and out of the reach of people \nwho want to use them for other purposes, they will not in fact be \nsaved.'' Now these have grown to significant surpluses, and they are \nnot out of reach. They are supposed to be out of reach because of what \nthe Senator from South Carolina did when he wrote section 13301 of the \nBudget Enforcement Act, but they are not out of reach. They are used to \nshow a balanced budget when the budget is not in balance.\n  So what we have done is very simply say, go ahead and pass a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. Let's do it the right \nand honest way. Let us make sure that the massive surpluses that we are \ngoing to accrue in the Social Security system are set aside, not \ncounted as ordinary revenue, and that we balance the budget and save \nthe Social Security trust fund revenues that are being taken out of \nworkers' paychecks for that very purpose.\n  Last evening I was on the phone with Congressman Mark Neumann from \nWisconsin of the House of Representatives. Incidentally, he is a \nRepublican Congressman from Wisconsin. He feels exactly the same way \nand says there are a couple dozen Members of the House who feel exactly \nthe same way. They want to balance the budget. They believe it is \nappropriate to put a provision in the U.S. Constitution to do so, but \nthey also believe it is inappropriate to use the Social Security trust \nfunds which are saved for another purpose to show a balanced budget \nwhen, in fact, you are still increasing the Federal debt and you still \nhave increases each year in the Federal deficit.\n  I have said before that I come from a town of 300 people and \ngraduated in a high school class of nine. I probably didn't take the \nfanciest math in the whole world, but back in my hometown cafe, if they \nsit around and start talking about what ``balances'' are and what \n``deficits and debts'' are, and if someone said, ``Do you think it \nwould be appropriate to claim you have balanced the budget when the \ndebt and deficit is still going to increase,'' it wouldn't take a lot \nof strong coffee to persuade people that that is not the right way to \napproach it and that is not an honest budget.\n  So we are introducing today a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget that says when the budget is balanced, you will not have an \nincrease in the Federal debt. You will have turned that debt clock into \na stopwatch: no more increases in Federal debt and no more Federal \ndeficits. There is a right way to do things and a wrong way to do \nthings.\n  We propose that if we change the U.S. Constitution, we do it the \nright way. We propose that no one enshrine in the Constitution an \nopportunity to misuse up to $3 trillion of Social Security revenues \nthat are taken from workers' paychecks with a solemn promise: this tax \ntaken from your paycheck goes into a trust fund to be used for only one \npurpose, and that is to fund the Social Security system.\n  Some in this Congress, believing double-entry bookkeeping means you \nuse the same money twice, have said we can promise that to the workers \nand then we can also use their money as an accounting entry over here \nto claim we have in fact reached a balanced budget.\n  That is wrong. It is certainly the wrong way to amend the U.S. \nConstitution. And we propose that when this Congress acts on a \nconstitutional amendment, it act on an amendment that does the right \nthing--the right thing for workers, the right thing for retired folks \nin this country, but especially the right thing to balance this \ncountry's books and prevent us from continually seeing an increase in \ndebt and deficits year after year.\n  Mr. President, we intend to talk about this later today, but I am \ndelighted to see that my colleague from Kentucky, Senator Ford, is \nhere, and my colleague, Senator Hollings from South Carolina. Both \nSenators are cosponsoring this constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

I thank the distinguished Chair. Let me thank my \ndistinguished colleague from North Dakota. Senator Dorgan has been \nforthright and persistent on this particular score. He has given us the \nnecessary leadership to bring truth in budgeting.\n  I will never forget when we started out in this budget process back \nin 1973 and 1974--and I am the only remaining Member in either body, \nHouse and Senate, that still serves on that Budget Committee--the \nlitany was all for a 10-year period and, particularly up through Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings, about truth in budgeting. No more smoke and mirrors, \nno more rosy scenarios and those kinds of things--certainly no use of \ntrust funds to obscure the actual size of the deficit.\n  It is very easy to determine what a deficit is. All you need to do is \nfind out what the debt is this year and then what the debt is the \nensuing year, and a simple subtraction will determine for you, if you \nplease, that the debt this past fiscal year, for 1996, was $261 \nbillion--not $107 billion. Not $107 billion, $261 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, if you please, \na chart which shows that the U.S. budget ``busts'' the trust funds. It \nshows the trust fund surpluses, the real deficit, the gross Federal \ndebt, and the gross interest costs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               U.S. budget

the U.S. Government FY 1996; Beginning in 1962 CBO's 1995 Economic and\n  Budget Outlook.\n\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You see, by subtracting last year's debt from this \nyear's debt, the increase of the debt over the last fiscal year gives \nus a deficit of $261 billion. Immediately the question is: How do we \nall run around claiming that we have a $107 billion deficit? The truth \nof the matter is that we go and borrow from other trust funds.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this particular point to have printed in \nthe Record a list of those particular borrowings in trust funds.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nGross debt 1996...................................................5,181\nGross debt 1995...................................................4,920\n                                                               ________\n                                                               \n    Difference......................................................261\n\n                                                                   1996\nDeficit.............................................................107\nTrust Funds:\n  Social Security....................................................66\n  Medicare HI........................................................-4\n  Medicare SMI.......................................................14\n  Military, civilian, other..........................................42\n                                                               ________\n                                                               \n    Total...........................................................118\n\nAdditional borrowing:\n  Banking............................................................16\n  Treasury loans.....................................................20\nReal deficit........................................................261\nGross interest......................................................344\n\nNote.--The HI part of Medicare is projected to go broke by 2001. Based \non numbers reported by the Treasury Department.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You will see that we had in 1995 a debt of $4.920 \ntrillion and a gross debt in 1996 of $5.181 trillion. So the difference \nwas $261 billion. And the reason that we listed the $107 billion is \nbecause we borrowed $66 billion from Social Security, a net of some $10 \nbillion from Medicare, some $42 billion from the military and civilian \nretirement funds, banking and Treasury loans amounted to some $36 \nbillion, for a total of $154 billion.\n  Trying to put Government on a pay-as-you-go basis has been my intent \nsince I arrived here 30 years ago. I balanced the budget in South \nCarolina, and as Governor I received the first AAA credit rating of any \nSouthern State, ahead of Texas on up through Maryland. I am proud of \nrunning Government on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n  I worked with George Mahon back in 1968-69, and we balanced the \nbudget under President Lyndon Johnson. Incidentally, we did not use \nSocial Security trust funds. Even though he\n\n[[Page S761]]\n\nchanged it to the unified budget, at this particular time the use of \nthe funds was not necessary to balance the budget. So we have to credit \nPresident Johnson with the last balanced budget we have had in that 30-\nyear period.\n  By the early 1980's, we realized that Social Security was going \nbroke, and we came in here in a very formal fashion after a wonderful \nstudy by Alan Greenspan, the present Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard. We passed the Greenspan Commission program of tax increases in \norder to make Social Security solvent.\n  Let me go right now to the Greenspan Commission report, and you will \nfind therein that ``a majority of the members of the national \ncommission recommends that the operations of the OASI, DI, HI, SMI, \ntrust funds,'' which is Social Security trust funds, ``should be \nremoved from the unified budget. The national commission believes that \nchanges in Social Security programs should be made only for \nprogrammatic reasons,'' and not--not--Mr. President, for balancing the \nbudget.\n  When we debated this, we increased the taxes so that we would keep \nSocial Security solvent until the distinguished occupant of the Chair \nwas ready to receive his amount. This particular Senator is already \nreceiving it. I am paying into Social Security. Senator Thurmond and I \nare also receiving Social Security. But, Mr. President, you are not \ngoing to receive it under the Domenici balanced budget to the \nConstitution. They absolutely prohibit it in the wording of this \nparticular amendment.\n  Let me show you exactly what I am saying. You come right now to the \nresolution, S.J. Res. 1, just put in a couple days ago, and you will \nfind:\n\n       Total receipts shall include all receipts of the U.S. \n     Government except those derived from borrowing. Total outlays \n     shall include all outlays of the U.S. Government except for \n     those for repayment of debt.\n\n  That repeals section 13-301. And if there were any doubt about it, \nlet us read section 1.\n\n       Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for that fiscal year.\n\n  I repeat very calmly, very clearly: ``Total outlays for any fiscal \nyear shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year--unless \nthree-fifths of the whole Congress votes it.''\n  So that means that the very intent of the Greenspan Commission, \nnamely that surpluses be built up to protect the baby boomers into the \nnext generation--that money, even if it were saved, even if the surplus \nwere built up and not being expended, as is the case--that money under \nthis particular constitutional amendment could not be expended. You \nwould have to cut right straight across the board. And let me be \nspecific on just exactly what the Greenspan Commission stated at that \nparticular time. If you refer to statement 5 on page 2, they talk about \nfor the ``75-year valuation period, ending with 2056.'' You can move on \nfurther. They refer to 75 years several times in the report. On page 5, \nstatement 5, 75 years. They were trying to provide solvency to the year \n2056. In the 75 years ending in 2056, we were going to have a solvent \nsurplus, a redeemable Social Security trust fund. And they recommended \nit be put off budget, not included in the unified budget, and not \nexpended for other matters.\n\n  Now, let us get to that particular point about the taxes Congress \nvoted for in 1983, because when you continue doing what we are doing \nnow, you violate the trust. Back in 1983 we did not vote an increase in \nthe payroll taxes for defense or for housing or for welfare or for \nforeign aid or for the expenses of the President or the Congress. It \nwas a trust fund. You would have never gotten a majority vote in this \nnational Government, in this Congress of the United States; you would \nhave never gotten an affirmative vote, as we did in a bipartisan \nfashion, to increase the payroll taxes for the other instances of \nGovernment. We all pledged that that money was going into Social \nSecurity, and to make sure that the trust was maintained we voted it \nformally in July 1990.\n  I refer, as a past chairman of the Budget Committee, to the \nconference report of the Committee on the Budget on the Social Security \nPreservation Act, dated July 10, 1990. If you see, at that particular \npoint on page 20, there was a Hollings motion to report the Social \nSecurity Preservation Act. It passed by a vote of 20 to 1--only the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, voted against it. All of \nthe other present Senators voted it out at that particular time.\n  Then, of course, later on the floor of the U.S. Senate we had a vote \nof 98 to 2. It was on October 18, 1990. A bipartisan vote of 98 \nSenators here said, Take Social Security and put it out as a trust \nfund, not a unified budget.\n  It is very interesting to read in this particular Social Security \nPreservation Act, the language--and I want all the Members' attention \nto this, because this is the present chairman of the Budget Committee--\nI ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I refer, on page 29, to the additional views, by Mr. \nDomenici, the present chairman of our Budget Committee. I quote:\n\n       I voted for Senator Hollings' proposal because I support \n     the concept of taking Social Security out of the budget \n     deficit calculation. But I cast this vote with reservations.\n\n  And what was his reservation? It was that my provision was not strong \nenough. He wanted to build a firewall. He goes on to say:\n\n       We need a firewall around those trust funds to make sure \n     the reserves are there to pay Social Security benefits in the \n     next century. Without a firewall or the discipline of budget \n     constraints, the trust funds would be unprotected and could \n     be spent on any number of costly programs.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that these additional views of the \ndistinguished chairman, the Senator from New Mexico, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Additional Views of Mr. Domenici\n\n       It is somewhat ironic that the first legislative mark-up in \n     the 16 year history of the Senate Budget Committee produced a \n     bill that does not do what its authors suggest and, more \n     importantly, weakens the fiscal discipline inherent in the \n     Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law.\n       I voted for Senator Hollings' proposal because I support \n     the concept of taking Social Security out of the budget \n     deficit calculation. But I cast this vote with reservations.\n       The best way to protect Social Security is to reduce the \n     Federal budget deficit. We need to balance our non-Social \n     Security budget so that the Social Security trust fund \n     surpluses can be invested (by lowering our national debt) \n     instead of used to pay for other Federal operating costs. We \n     could move toward this goal without changing the unified \n     budget, a concept which has served us well for over twenty \n     years now.\n       Changes in our accounting rules without real deficit \n     reduction will not make Social Security more sound. In fact, \n     we could make matters worse by opening up the trust funds to \n     unrestrained spending. Under current law, the trust funds are \n     protected by the budget process. Congress cannot spend the \n     trust fund reserves without new spending cuts or revenue \n     increases in the rest of the budget to meet Gramm-Rudman-\n     Hollings deficit reduction requirements. If we take Social \n     Security out of GRH without any new protection for the trust \n     funds, Congress could spend the reserves without facing new \n     spending cuts or revenue increases in other programs. And if \n     we spend the trust fund reserves today, we will threaten the \n     solvency of the Social Security program, putting at risk the \n     benefits we have promised to today's workers.\n       Of course, I also understand that we might be able to \n     restore some public trust by taking Social Security out of \n     the deficit calculation. Trust that we in Congress are not \n     ``masking the budget deficit'' with Social Security. That is \n     why I believe we should take Social Security out of the \n     deficit, but only if we provide strong protection against \n     spending the trust fund reserves. We need a ``firewell'' \n     around those trust funds to make sure the reserves are there \n     to pay Social Security benefits in the next century. Without \n     a ``firewall'' or the discipline of budget constraints, the \n     trust funds would be unprotected and could be spent on any \n     number of costly programs.\n       Unfortunately, the Hollings bill does not protect Social \n     Security, which is why Senator Nickles and I offered our \n     ``firewall'' amendment, defeated by a vote of 8 to 13. The \n     amendment, drafted over the last six months by myself and \n     Senators Heinz, Rudman, Gramm, and DeConcini, included: a 60 \n     vote point of order against legislation which would reduce \n     the 75 year actuarial balance of the Social Security trust \n     funds; additional Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction \n     requirements in all years in which legislation lowered the \n     Social Security surpluses; and notification to Social \n     Security taxpayer on the Personal Earnings and Benefit \n     Estimate Statements (PEBES) each time Congress lowered the \n     reserves available to pay benefits to future retirees.\n       With just one exception, the other side of the aisle voted \n     against this protection for Social Security beneficiaries.\n       Furthermore, the Hollings bill says nothing about how or \n     when we will achieve balance in the non-Social Security \n     budget. The\n\n[[Page S762]]\n\n     bill simply takes Social Security out of the deficit \n     calculation. If enacted, the Hollings bill would require $173 \n     billion in deficit reduction in 1991 to meet the statutory \n     GRH target (see attached table). Obviously, that is not going \n     to happen.\n       I believe we need to extend Gramm-Rudman-Hollings to ensure \n     we have the discipline to achieve balance in the non-Social \n     Security portion of the budget. The Budget Summit negotiators \n     are discussing a goal of $450 to $500 billion in deficit \n     reduction over the next five years. Once we reach an \n     agreement, that plan should be the framework for extending \n     the GRH law.\n       I offered a Sense of the Congress amendment during the \n     mark-up expressing this view. I offered this to put the \n     Hollings bill in some context.\n       But the Democratic members of the Committee refused to \n     consider even an amendment acknowledging the facts about our \n     budget situation, rejecting my proposal by another 8 to 13 \n     vote. In fact, the Chairman indicated that there was some \n     concern on his side of the aisle about extending the Gramm-\n     Rudman-Hollings discipline. One might infer that, for some, \n     this mark-up was really an effort to kill Gramm-Rudman-\n     Hollings.\n       I am not sure what we accomplished in reporting out a bill \n     with no protection for Social Security and with no suggestion \n     of what we think should happen regarding the deficit targets. \n     I, for one, do not want to do anything which could endanger \n     Social Security or Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget discipline. \n     At a minimum, I will offer the ``firewall'' amendment to \n     protect Social Security should the reported bill be \n     considered by the full Senate.\n                                                 Pete V.

So at that particular time, and when 98 percent of this \nU.S. Senate voted for it, we had, if you please, the distinguished \nchairman who was very much concerned that it was not enough protection.\n  Now, here is what he writes today--you will see the difference here--\non January 13, 1997 to Republican colleagues, the statement of Senator \nDomenici to his Republican colleagues here earlier this month.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 13, 1997.\n       Dear Republican Colleagues: We are likely to debate early \n     in the 105th Congress the Constitutional amendment to require \n     a balanced federal budget. When that debate begins, some \n     Senators will push to remove Social Security from the \n     balanced budget requirement.\n       I have always believed this effort to exempt Social \n     Security from the Constitutional amendment was more of a \n     diversion than anything else. It is raised to confuse the \n     debate and provide a rationale for some to oppose the effort.\n       Nontheless, in preparation for debate in the Senate, I \n     thought it was important to review with you the consequences \n     of such a proposal so that we can all effectively debate it \n     using facts.\n       One of the arguments made by those who push for excluding \n     Social Security from the balanced budget amendment is that \n     excluding Social Security will force us to ``save'' the \n     Social Security surpluses and therefore enhance fiscal \n     responsibility.\n       This is only a very small part of the story.\n       It is true that Social Security is currently running \n     surpluses, and these surpluses offset deficit spending in the \n     rest of the budget. If the balanced budget requirement \n     excludes Social Security, we would be required by the \n     Constitution to achieve balance in the ``on-budget'' portion \n     of the federal government--which is everything except Social \n     Security. The total, or unified, budget--which is the sum of \n     the ``on-budget'' programs and Social Security--would \n     therefore be in surplus in amounts equal to the Social \n     Security surpluses. Between 2002 and 2018, these surpluses \n     would total $1.2 trillion in 1996 dollars.\n       It should go without saying that, when we are amending the \n     Constitution--now into its third century--we should take the \n     long view. And in the long run, these near term Social \n     Security surpluses will be overwhelmed by massive, long-term \n     Social Security deficits.\n       These deficits are projected to total $9.3 trillion in 1996 \n     dollars between 2019 and 2050, with a deficit of about $630 \n     billion in 2050 alone, again in constant 1996 dollars.\n       If it is true that excluding Social Security from the \n     balanced budget amendment would force us to ``save'' the \n     short-term surpluses, it is equally true that excluding \n     Social Security would allow us to run massive deficits equal \n     to the deficits that are projected to occur in the Social \n     Security trust funds beginning in 2019.\n       These deficits would be real deficits--just like the \n     deficits we are experiencing today. And they would have the \n     same negative economic consequences: lower national savings, \n     higher interest rates, lower investment and productivity, and \n     sluggish growth. The only difference is that these deficits \n     would be much larger than anything we have ever experienced, \n     and therefore the consequences would be much worse.\n       Ironically, these massive and unprecedented deficits would \n     be specifically sanctioned by an amendment to the \n     Constitution calling for ``balanced budgets'' excluding \n     Social Security. Congress could continue to pass so-called \n     ``balanced budgets'' while running up massive new debt which \n     would tremendously burden our economy.\n       The attached chart shows graphically what I have just \n     described. ``On-budget'' would show a zero deficit throughout \n     the time period, as required by the Constitution. The total \n     budget, which includes Social Security, would show surpluses \n     for two decades or so followed by massive and unprecedented \n     deficits.\n       It should be obvious from this analysis that, contrary to \n     assertions by some who want to exclude Social Security, such \n     a move will weaken fiscal responsibility, not strengthen it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Pete V. Domenici.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, he said:\n\n       It is true that Social Security is currently running \n     surpluses, and these surpluses offset deficit spending in the \n     rest of the budget.\n\n  Well, heavens above, that is what we are trying to stop. We are not \ntrying to pass a constitutional amendment as a subterfuge to the \nAmerican people. He comes now and says we, who want to protect Social \nSecurity--as he voted to do in the Budget Committee, and provided in \nhis formal views in the Budget Committee report, and thereupon, as he \ndid on the floor of the U.S. Senate--are using the surpluses to \n``offset deficit spending in the rest of the budget.'' That is a \ngimmick. That is a subterfuge. He expresses concern because we might \nbuild up deficits for Social Security in the next century. How about \nour deficit to Social Security this minute? Spending $66 billion, this \npast year over $70-some billion, we owe Social Security this minute \n$570 billion and by the year 2002 we will owe it $1 trillion.\n  Who is going to raise taxes $1 trillion to make Social Security \nsolvent?\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, with this \nlimited time, the Report of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n           The Balanced Budget Amendment and Social Security\n\n       In recent years, Congress has considered two versions of \n     the balanced budget amendment. The version supported by the \n     Republican Congressional leadership (herein termed the \n     ``Leadership version'') requires the ``unified budget'' to be \n     balanced each year, including Social Security. The other \n     version, which Senators Wyden, Feinstein, Dorgan and others \n     introduced in the last Congress, requires the budget \n     exclusive of Social Security to be in balance.\n       The version that includes Social Security in the unified \n     budget poses serious dangers for the Social Security system. \n     It also is inequitable to younger generations, as it would \n     likely cause those who are children today to be saddled with \n     too heavy a tax load when they reach their peak earnings \n     years. The Wyden/Feinstein version does not pose these \n     problems.\n\n                               background\n\n       In coming decades, Social Security faces a demographic \n     bulge. The baby boomers are so numerous that when they \n     retire, the ratio of workers to retirees will fall to a low \n     level.\n       This poses a problem because Social Security has \n     traditionally operated on a ``pay-as-you-go'' basis. The \n     payroll taxes contributed by today's workers finance the \n     benefits of today's retirees. Because there will be so many \n     retirees when the baby boomers grow old, however, it will be \n     difficult for the workers of that period to carry the load \n     without large increases in payroll taxes.\n       The acclaimed 1983 bipartisan Social Security commission \n     headed by Alan Greenspan recognized this problem. It moved \n     Social Security from a pure ``pay-as-you-go'' system to one \n     under which the baby boomers would contribute more toward \n     their own retirement. As a result, the Social Security system \n     is now building up surpluses. By 2019, these surpluses will \n     equal $3 trillion. After that, as the bulk of the baby boom \n     generation moves into retirement, the system will\n\n[[Page S763]]\n\n     draw down the surpluses. This is akin to what families do in \n     saving for retirement during their working years and drawing \n     down their savings when they retire.\n       This approach has important merits. It promotes \n     generational equity by keeping the burden on younger \n     generations from becoming too high. In addition, if the \n     Social Security surpluses were to be used in the next two \n     decades to increase national saving rather than to offset the \n     deficit in the rest of the budget, that would likely result \n     in stronger economic growth, which in turn would better \n     enable the country to afford to support the baby boomers when \n     they reach their twilight years.\n       To pursue this approach, the tasks ahead are to reduce \n     significantly or eliminate the deficit in the non-Social \n     Security budget so that the surpluses in the Social Security \n     trust funds contribute in whole or large part to national \n     saving, and to institute further reforms in Social Security \n     to restore long-term actuarial balance to the Social Security \n     system. Restoring long-term balance will almost certainly \n     entail a combination of building the surpluses to somewhat \n     higher levels and reducing somewhat the benefits paid out \n     when the boomers retire.\n\n\n                 The Leadership BBA and Social Security\n\n       Unfortunately, the balanced budget amendment pushed by the \n     Leadership would undermine this approach to protecting Social \n     Security and promoting generational equity. Under this \n     version of the BBA, total government expenditures in any \n     year--including expenditures for Social Security benefits--\n     could not exceed total revenues collected in the same year. \n     The implications of this requirement for Social Security are \n     profound. It would mean that the Social Security surpluses \n     could not be used to cover the benefit costs of the baby boom \n     generation when it retires. The benefits for the baby boom \n     generation would instead have to be financed in full by the \n     taxes of those working in those years. The Leadership version \n     thus would eviscerate the central achievement of the \n     Greenspan commission.\n       The reason the Leadership version would have this effect is \n     that even though the Social Security trust funds would have \n     been accumulating large balances, drawing down those balances \n     when the baby boomers retire would mean that the trust funds \n     were spending more in benefits in those years than they were \n     taking in, in taxes. Under the Leadership version, that would \n     result in impermissible deficit spending.\n       By precluding use of the Social Security surpluses in the \n     manner that the 1983 legislation intended, the Leadership \n     version would be virtually certain to precipitate a massive \n     crisis in Social Security about 20 years from now, even if \n     legislation had been passed in the meantime putting Social \n     Security in long-term actuarial balance. Since the $3 \n     trillion surplus could not be used to help pay the benefits \n     of the baby boom generation, the nation would face an \n     excruciating choice between much deeper cuts in Social \n     Security benefits that were needed to make Social Security \n     solvent and much larger increases in payroll taxes than would \n     otherwise be required. The third and only other allowable \n     alternative would be to finance Social Security deficits in \n     those years not by drawing down the Social Security surplus \n     but instead by slashing the rest of government so severely \n     that it failed to provide adequately for basic services, \n     potentially including the national defense.\n       Given the numbers of baby boomers who will be retired or on \n     the verge of retirement in those years, deep cuts in Social \n     Security benefits are not likely at that time. Thus, under \n     the leadership BBA, it is almost inevitable that younger \n     generations will face a combination of sharp payroll tax \n     increases and deep reductions in basic government services.\n       For these reasons, the Leadership BBA is highly inequitable \n     to younger generations. Aggravating this problem, the \n     Leadership version would undermine efforts to pass Social \n     Security reforms in the near future. Why should Congress and \n     the President bother to make hard choices now in Social \n     Security that would build the surpluses to more ample \n     levels if these surpluses can't be used when the boomers \n     retire? Under the leadership BBA, there is no longer any \n     reason to act now rather than to let Social Security's \n     financing problems fester.\n\n      leadership bba also poses other problems for social security\n\n       Under the Leadership version, reductions in Social Security \n     could be used to help Congress and the President balance the \n     budget when they faced a budget crunch. This could lead to \n     too little being done to reduce or eliminate deficits in the \n     non-Social Security part of the budget and unnecessary \n     benefit cutbacks in Social Security.\n       At first blush, that may sound implausible politically. But \n     the balanced budget amendment is likely to lead to periodic \n     mid-year crises, when budgets thought to be balanced at the \n     start of a fiscal year fall out of balance during the year, \n     as a result of factors such as slower-than-expected economic \n     growth. When sizable deficits emerge with only part of the \n     year remaining, they will often be very difficult to address. \n     Congress and the President may be unable to agree on a \n     package of budget cuts of the magnitude needed to restore \n     balance in the remaining months of the year. Congress also \n     may be unable to amass three-fifths majorities in both \n     chambers to raise the debt limit and allow a deficit.\n       In such circumstances, the President or possibly the courts \n     may feel compelled to act to uphold the Constitutional \n     requirement for budget balance. In documents circulated in \n     November 1996 explaining how the amendment would work, the \n     House co-authors of the amendment--Reps. Dan Schaefer and \n     Charles Stenholm--write that in such circumstances, ``The \n     President would be bound, at the point at which the \n     `Government runs out of money' to stop issuing checks.'' This \n     would place Social Security benefits at risk.\n\n                      the wyden/feinstein approach\n\n       The Wyden/Feinstein approach resolves the problems the \n     Leadership version creates in the Social Security area. It \n     reinforces the 1983 Social Security legislation rather than \n     undermining that legislation. It does so both by requiring \n     that the surpluses in the Social Security system contribute \n     to national saving rather than be used to finance deficits in \n     the rest of the budget and by enabling the surpluses to be \n     drawn down when the baby boomers retire.\n       The Wyden/Feinstein amendment thus improves \n     intergenerational equity rather than undermining it. It \n     ensures the surpluses will be intact when they are needed, \n     rather than lent to the government for other purposes in the \n     interim.\n       The amendment also ensures that Social Security benefits \n     will not be cut--and Social Security checks not placed in \n     jeopardy--if the balanced budget amendment leads to future \n     budget crises and showdowns. However those crises would be \n     resolved, Social Security would not be involved, because cuts \n     in Social Security would not count toward achieving budget \n     balance.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will read just one paragraph from this report and \nthen my statement will be complete.\n  Unfortunately, the balanced budget amendment pushed by the leadership \nwould undermine the approach to protect Social Security in promoting \ngenerational equity. Under this version of the balanced budget \namendment, total Government expenditures in any year, including \nexpenditures for Social Security benefits, could not exceed total \nrevenues collected in the same year. The implications of this \nrequirement for Social Security are profound. It would mean that Social \nSecurity surpluses could not be used to cover the benefit costs of the \nbaby boom generation when it retires. The benefits for the baby boom \ngeneration would, instead, have to be financed in full by the taxes of \nthose working in those years. The leadership version thus would \neviscerate the central achievement of the Greenspan Commission.\n  Mr. President, we have some 33 cosponsors to Senate Joint Resolution \n1, who now want to eviscerate the Social Security protections they \nvoted for earlier. I have counted them. The majority of these \ncosponsors were here in 1990 when we voted to take it off budget--the \nothers were not here in 1990 when this vote was taken, but 33 of these \ncosponsors were here.\n  We wrote a letter just a few years ago to Senator Dole, some five \nMembers on this side. It was a letter dated March 1, 1995.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 1, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert J. Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: We have received from Senator Domenici's \n     office a proposal to address our concerns about using the \n     Social Security trust funds to balance the Federal budget. We \n     have reviewed this proposal, and after consultations with \n     legal counsel, believe that this statutory approach does not \n     adequately protect Social Security. Specifically, \n     Constitutional experts from the Congressional Research \n     Service advise us that the Constitutional language of the \n     amendment will supersede any statutory constraint.\n       We want you to know that all of us have voted for, and are \n     prepared to vote for again, a balanced budget amendment. In \n     that spirit, we have attached a version of the balanced \n     budget amendment that we believe can resolve the impasse over \n     the Social Security issue.\n       To us, the fundamental question is whether the Federal \n     Government will be able to raid the Social Security trust \n     funds. Our proposal modifies those put forth by Senators Reid \n     and Feinstein to address objections raised by some Members of \n     the Majority. Specifically, our proposal prevents the Social \n     Security trust funds from being used for deficit reduction, \n     while still allowing Congress to make any warranted changes \n     to protect the solvency of the funds. The prior language of \n     the Reid and Feinstein amendments was not explicit that \n     adjustments could be made to ensure the soundness of the \n     trust funds.\n       If the Majority Party can support this solution, then we \n     are confident that the Senate\n\n[[Page S764]]\n\n     can pass the balanced budget amendment with more than 70 \n     votes. If not, then we see no reason to delay further the \n     vote on final passage of the amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Byron L. Dorgan.\n     Ernest F. Hollings.\n     Wendell H. Ford.\n     Harry M. Reid.\n     Dianne Feinstein.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Look, I have cosponsored a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution. I voted for a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. But I am not going to, by gosh, play tricks with the \nSocial Security trust fund and repeal the law that I worked so \ndiligently to have enacted and signed, on November 5, 1990, by George \nWalker Herbert Bush into law. So we said: Not one vote of Senator \nHatfield from Oregon, here, Mr. Leader Dole, you can pick up five \nvotes.\n  I cannot speak for the other four this morning. I have not checked \nwith them. But he can get the vote of this particular Senator from \nSouth Carolina, if they write the constitutional amendment so as not to \nviolate the trust that we so formally voted into law.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, if there ever was a statement that the \nAmerican people should listen to, that was just given by my \ndistinguished colleague from South Carolina. He is here with \ninstitutional memory about what transpired and why--the intent. Now we \nfind ourselves where this couple of words, balance the budget, \nsupersedes all the work that has been done, cuts it off at its knees, \nso to speak, the Social Security trust fund. I think the people of this \ncountry, once they understand what the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. \nHollings, has just said, they will not be so interested in passing this \nparticular balance the budget amendment.\n  I am one of those the other side criticized last time, I am one of \nthe six. I changed my vote from balance the budget to against it. Why \nwouldn't I? Listen to Senator Hollings, that is the reason I changed my \nvote. I have a responsibility to the seniors. We promised them we would \nnot cut it or increase it to balance the budget, and we voted 83 to 16 \nlast year saying that. That was just last year. Was that a political \ngimmick? Was that a campaign slogan? Or did we really mean it? I hope \n83 of us really meant it. But we voted 83 to 16, saying we shall not \nraise or cut the Social Security in order to balance the budget.\n  I do not know where we are coming from. You may fool all of the \npeople some of the time; you can even fool some of the people all the \ntime; but you can't fool all of the people all the time. So what we are \ntrying to do here now is fool the American people, saying to balance \nthe budget it is going to give tax cuts, it is going to give interest \nrates cuts, it is going to do all these fabulous things. But we turn \nright around and break our word to the American people.\n  During the last debate on a balanced budget amendment, the other side \nof the aisle proposed not touching the Social Security trust fund until \nthe year 2008. Don't touch it until 2008. That was a tacit admission \nthat the Republicans planned to utilize the trust funds--and I make \nthat plural--to balance the budget.\n  As my distinguished friend from South Carolina said, the money in the \nSocial Security surplus, $71 billion in this year alone and \naccumulating to nearly $3 trillion by the year 2019, will be too \ntempting, Mr. President, for a Congress bound by the Constitution to \nbalance the budget.\n  Once the Constitution is amended to require that, and I quote--and \nyou heard it from the Senator from South Carolina--``total outlays for \nany fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.''\n  Social Security, I say to my friends, is placed in imminent danger, \nand it is likely that any attempt to exclude Social Security trust \nfunds by implementing legislation--statutory language, that is--would \nbe deemed then unconstitutional.\n  So, protecting the Social Security trust fund is not just a seniors \nissue. We promised not to reduce benefits--voted here for current \nSocial Security beneficiaries--in order to balance the budget. We are \njust not going to do it.\n  But what about future retirees? Using the trust fund to offset other \nspending undermines generational equity, because under this scenario, \ntotal Government expenditures in any year, including expenditures for \nSocial Security benefits, could not exceed total revenues collected in \nthe same year. That would mean that Social Security surpluses could not \nbe used to cover the benefit costs of the baby-boom generation when it \nretires.\n  We raised the taxes in 1983. We made a difference, so we would be \nable to cover. So now we say we can't expend more than we take in, and \nthe trust fund is there so we can do it. So, therefore, we break our \nword to generations yet to come, as the Senator from South Carolina \nsaid to the occupant of the chair. The benefits, instead, would have to \nbe financed in full by the taxes of those working in those years.\n  Using the Social Security surplus to pay for other spending programs \nwould not only bankrupt Social Security, but would leave a system that \nneeds long-term reform in order to meet the growth of future retirees \nvirtually worthless. We need to reform and protect the Social Security \ntrust fund in order to fulfill our contract of retirement security to \nworking Americans.\n  You make a dollar and they take out your Social Security trust fund \npayments--all of it. Excluding the Social Security trust fund from a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget is an important first \nstep in fulfilling our contract with our working Americans and with \nthose who want us to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, there are those in public service who \nfeel that since posterity can do nothing for them, they see no reason \nto do anything for posterity. They look to the next election rather \nthan the next generation, and this is the contrary for that.\n  We are not vying for the AARP or really the senior citizens. You \ndon't get any letters on what we are talking about this morning from \nthe AARP or any of those other seniors because they got their money. \nThey know that surpluses are there right now. They are worried about \nMedicare, but they are not worried about this one.\n  The youngsters, the baby boomers that we are trying to look out for, \nthe unborn that we are looking out for now have been told they are \nnever going to get it, so they are all running around with IRAs and all \nthese other kinds of things totally distorting a social insurance \nprogram.\n  Right to the point, and then I will sit down. We are doing this for \nthe trust of the baby boomers, for the yet unborn in the next \ngeneration, not for the senior citizens right now. This is not a \npolitical thing for senior citizens or gimmick or tactic, as they call \nit in this morning's Washington Post. This is truth in budgeting and \nmaintaining the trust that we all voted for 98 to 2.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to all those within the sound of my \nvoice that the two men whom you have just heard are people with an \ninstitutional memory, as Senator Ford has spoken. That is true. But \nalso, these two Senators are gentlemen who have balanced budgets in \ntheir own States. They are Governors from two of the outstanding States \nin the Union, South Carolina and Kentucky. They know what they are \ntalking about in truth in budgeting.\n  I am very happy to have been able to sit on the floor and listen to \nthese two statements made by these two gentlemen who understand what we \nare talking about when we talk about balanced budgets. Of course, the \nthree of us--the Senator from Kentucky, the Senator from South \nCarolina, the Senator from Nevada--support a balanced budget. We \nsupport a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, but we want \nto make sure it is a truth-in-budgeting balanced budget amendment, one \nthat protects senior citizens and, most importantly, protects the real \ncontract with America. That is the one that was developed some 50 years \nago during the Great Depression when Social Security was first enacted.\n  We have an obligation to make sure that the moneys paid into that \ntrust fund by the employers and employees is not used as a gimmick to \nbalance the budget. Of course, it is easy to balance the budget if you \nuse the hundreds of billions of dollars in the Social Security trust \nfund. But let's do it the hard way. Let's do it the right way. And\n\n[[Page S765]]\n\nthat is why, Mr. President, I was so elated, felt so good about the \nfact that in the other body, there are Members of the House of \nRepresentatives in both parties who are talking about maybe those few \nstraggling voices in the Senate who last year were able to talk about \nthe importance of the Social Security trust fund had something. Maybe \nwe should look at what has gone on in the House when they pell-mell \nvoted for a constitutional amendment and, in the process, said that we \nare going to destroy Social Security.\n\n  I think it is good that the other body is talking about having a vote \non a constitutional amendment that will protect Social Security. That \nis all that we are asking. That seems fair. It seems, if we are going \nto balance the budget, we should do it the right way.\n  Finally, let me say this. Our position has been strengthened during \nthe past year. It has been strengthened because the bipartisan \ncommission to study Social Security has reported back, and they have \nsaid a number of things, but for purposes of this statement, I think \nthe most important they have said is that all 13 members believe that \nall or part of the Social Security trust fund moneys should be invested \nin the private sector in some way. I say, Mr. President, how can those \nmoneys be invested if there are not any? It is impossible.\n  So, if the 13 members believe some of the Social Security trust fund \nmoneys should be invested in the private sector, then our \nconstitutional amendment, which we are going to introduce today, which \nsays we want a balanced budget but we want to do it excluding Social \nSecurity, then I think we have the support of those 13 members of the \nbipartisan commission.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have, in the last few minutes, secured \nwhat I observed last evening on television by a statement by the most \ndistinguished of distinguished Senators--there is none more \nresponsible--the distinguished Senator from Utah, Senator Orrin Hatch.\n  I now have his news release, Judiciary Committee, dated January 21, \n1997.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement be printed in its entirety \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Balanced Budget Amendment Legislative Priority for Hatch\n\n       Washington, D.C. Balancing the budget topped Sen. Orrin \n     Hatch's legislative agenda for the 105th Congress as 61 \n     senators joined him today in introducing a constitutional \n     amendment requiring the President and Congress to balance the \n     federal budget and put an end to the growing addiction to \n     deficit spending.\n       ``The Balanced Budget Amendment will again be S.J. Res. 1 \n     and that is appropriate because it is the single most \n     important piece of legislation that will be voted on this \n     Congress,'' Hatch said. ``The idea of a Balanced Budget \n     Amendment is not new--unfortunately, neither is the problem \n     it is designed to solve,'' Hatch said. ``Since the balanced \n     budget in 1969, Congress has promised balanced budgets and \n     failed to deliver them. With our national debt at nearly $5.3 \n     trillion, we still have people telling us we do not need the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment. The truth is the only way to \n     change Washington's addiction to spending other people's \n     money is to use the pressure of a constitutional amendment \n     requiring a balanced budget.''\n       ``Last Congress, when the Amendment fell a mere one vote \n     short of passage in the Senate, I vowed that we would be back \n     to try and pass this amendment and put America back on the \n     course of fiscal responsibility,'' the senator added. ``Every \n     one of the 55 Republicans in the Senate are original \n     cosponsors and we are joined by seven strong Democrats giving \n     us 62 original cosponsors. If only five other senators join \n     us we will have the votes necessary. If everyone keeps their \n     promises to their constituents and votes as they said they \n     would before the November elections, we will pass the \n     balanced budget amendment.''\n       Hatch noted that opponents to a constitutional amendment \n     have tried and will continue to try to divert attention from \n     the pressing issue of controlling our nation's debt. ``The \n     fact is, contrary to opponent's scare tactics, the balanced \n     budget amendment would ensure the long term stability of \n     social security and other retirement investments of every \n     American, as well as long term growth of the U.S. economy.''\n       The amendment introduced in the Senate today is the same as \n     the one introduced in the last Congress. It requires a \n     balanced federal budget by the year 2002. Any amendment to \n     the Constitution needs a two-thirds approval in both houses \n     of Congress as well as ratification by three-fourths of the \n     states.\n       Hatch held hearings on the amendment Friday in the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee and will convene a second hearing on the \n     amendment Wednesday, January 22, 1997 at 10:00 a.m.\n\n\n        Cosponsors of S.J. Res. 1--The Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n       Mr. Hatch (for himself and Mr. Lott, Thurmond, Craig, \n     Nickles, Domenici, Stevens, Roth, Bryan, Kohl, Grassley, \n     Graham, Specter, Baucus, Thompson, Breaux, Kyl, Moseley-\n     Braun, DeWine, Robb, Abraham, Ashcroft, Sessions, D'Amato, \n     Helms, Lugar, Chafee, McCain, Jeffords, Warner, Coverdell, \n     Cochran, Hutchison, Mack, Gramm, Snowe, Allard, Brownback, \n     Collins, Enzi, Hagel, Hutchinson, Roberts, Smith (OR), \n     Bennett, Bond, Burns, Campbell, Coats, Faircloth, Frist, \n     Gorton, Grams, Gregg, Inhofe, Kempthorne, McConnell, \n     Murkowski, Santorum, Shelby, Smith (NH), and Thomas.\n\n\n                 Text of the Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n       ``Section 1. Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not \n     exceed total receipts for that year, unless three-fifths of \n     the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by \n     law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a \n     rollcall vote.\n       ``Section 2. The limit on the debt of the United States \n     held by the public shall not be increased, unless three-\n     fifths of the whole number of each House shall provide by law \n     for such an increase by rollcall vote.\n       ``Section 3. Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall \n     transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the United \n     States Government for that fiscal year in which total outlays \n     do not exceed total receipts.\n       ``Section 4. No bill to increase revenue shall become law \n     unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each \n     House by a rollcall vote.\n       ``Section 5. The Congress may waive the provisions of this \n     article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is \n     in effect. The provisions of this article may be waived for \n     any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in \n     military conflict which causes an imminent and serious \n     military threat to national security and is so declared by a \n     joint resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number \n     of each House, which becomes law.\n       ``Section 6. The Congress shall enforce and implement this \n     article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on \n     estimates of outlays and receipts.\n       ``Section 7. Total receipts shall include all receipts of \n     the United States except those derived from borrowing. Total \n     outlays shall include all outlays of the United States \n     Government except for those for repayment of debt principal.\n       ``Section 8. This article shall take effect beginning with \n     fiscal year 2002 or with the second fiscal year beginning \n     after its ratification, whichever is later.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I quote from this release.\n\n       Hatch noted that opponents to a constitutional amendment \n     have tried and will continue to try to divert attention from \n     the pressing issue of controlling our Nation's debt. The fact \n     is, contrary to the opponents' scare tactics, the balanced \n     budget amendment would ensure the long-term stability of \n     Social Security and other retirement investments of every \n     American as well as long-term growth of the United States \n     economy.\n\n  Absolutely the contrary is the case. Absolutely the contrary is the \ncase. You are not going to ``ensure the long-term stability of Social \nSecurity'' with this particular amendment.\n  This is the Senator that put it into the Budget Committee back in \nJuly 1990 where we voted 20 to 1 to protect Social Security. Thereupon, \non the floor of this Senate, 98 Senators--the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer was not present at that particular time--but 98 Senators voted \nin the affirmative, section 13-301 of the Budget Act signed into law by \nPresident Bush. That is what section 1 and section 7 of Senate Joint \nResolution 1 does--vitiate, or to use the language that I included from \nthe particular quote, ``eviscerate the intent of the Greenspan \nCommission.'' All this, after I worked to put into the law a provision \nsaying ``Thou shalt not use Social Security trust funds to obscure the \nsize of the deficit.''\n  When you use that $107 billion deficit for last year's figure, that \nis exactly what you are doing. So this is not a scare tactic.\n  Unfortunately, the media has picked up on the diversion because, as \nyou can see this morning's paper here, our friend Eric Pearman here \nsays, ``President Clinton intends to raise concerns about the potential \nimpact of the amendment on the Social Security trust fund, a tactic \nDemocrats used last time to defeat the amendment.''\n  This is no tactic. I have not talked to President Clinton about it. \nIn a way, I do not welcome his joining in because it tries to make it a \npartisan issue. It was bipartisan, 98 votes of 100 in this Senate when \nwe put into law section 13-301. It was a Republican President\n\n[[Page S766]]\n\nthat signed that into law. So it was not any Democratic tactic. It is \ntruth in budgeting. And that is what we have a difficult time with.\n  You can see again in here--and I use the quote from our distinguished \ncolleague from Utah:\n\n       Last Congress when the amendment failed by a mere one vote \n     of passage in the Senate, I vowed that we would be back to \n     try and pass this amendment and put America back on the \n     course of fiscal responsibility,\n\nthe Senator added.\n\n       Every one of the 55 Republicans in the Senate are original \n     cosponsors, and we are joined by 7 strong Democrats, giving \n     us 62 original cosponsors. If only five other Senators join \n     us, we will have the votes necessary. If everyone keeps their \n     promises to their constituents and votes as they said they \n     would before the November elections, we will pass a balanced \n     budget amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, it wasn't one vote, it was five votes. And we had the \nfive votes. We included it. I have that letter, Mr. President, for the \nCongressional Record. Here it is, dated March 1, 1995. We said at that \nparticular time to Leader Dole, five Democratic Senators. It didn't \nfail by one vote, as they keep on saying. They had every opportunity to \npass it, and they have every opportunity, I think, right at this moment \nto pass it. They say ``If everyone keeps their promises to their \nconstituents,'' but they want to eviscerate the commitment we have made \nto Social Security. When they voted in 1990, that was a promise to \ntheir constituents in law. It is formalized in law, section 13301 of \nthe Budget Act. That is what we are trying to do, keep our promises to \nour constituents. That is what we are doing, trying to keep our promise \nto the Greenspan Commission. When we raised the taxes, we didn't raise \nthe taxes for foreign aid and welfare and food stamps. We raised the \ntaxes for the Social Security trust fund--not for the seniors today, \nbut as the Greenspan Commission report says, for the baby boomers in \nthe next century. That is what we are trying to do. That is why we are \nhaving such a difficult time.\n  The media is looking only at today's politics, and the seniors could \nnot be less interested in today's politics. They are concentrating on \nMedicare and their health costs. They know there is a big surplus that \nis already built up. So they are going to get their Social Security \nchecks. But it's the baby boomers who are now misled into IRA's and \ninvestments in the stock market and everything else, because they \nalmost believe, to a man or woman, that they are never going to get \nthat money. And we continue to make sure they don't get that money by \npassing Senate Joint Resolution 1.\n  Now, I have talked to the leadership and said, ``Turn it around and \nmake certain that we can carry out the trust that we instituted into \nlaw back in 1990.'' We voted for this again last year in another vote \non the floor of the U.S. Senate by an overwhelming 86 votes. If we can \ncarry out that promise to our constituents, you've got the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  I believe in a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I have \ncosponsored it. I have introduced it. I have voted for it. But not with \nthis situation here, where having passed it into law, I am supposed to \nvote to repeal my own trust and repeal my own law that I worked so hard \non the Budget Committee to get.\n  We had a conscience in those days. We had a conscience. Now, it's all \ngimmickry, it's all pollster politics, unfortunately, on the floor of \nthe National Government. Anything that is momentary, we fall. And right \nto the point, we are not really taking care of the needs of America.\n  I was on a panel--since we have a few moments--recently of 18 \ndistinguished Senators and myself, and the question was, how could \nPresident Clinton make his mark now in history during the next 4 years? \nAnd the conventional wisdom right across the board with this particular \npanel, Mr. President, was that, look, there is not going to be any \nhoneymoon. The Democrats are after Gingrich, and Gingrich was after \nGingrich. So any honeymoon would be short-lived. Very little would \nhappen on the domestic front here in the next 4 years, just a little \nincremental adjustment perhaps on Medicare, a little bit on welfare. \nBut the President's opportunity to make his mark in history was in \nforeign policy. They recommended--and it was a bipartisan group--what \nwe ought to do is get computers to the third world, get technology to \nthe emerging nations. That would make his mark in history.\n  When you drive home today, go down by Foggy Bottom, as I do, by the \nWatergate, and you will see the homeless lying on the streets of \nAmerica. You will find this city in crime. You will find the children \non drugs. You will find that schools are down, illiteracy is up. You \nwill find the infrastructure, roads and bridges, haven't been repaired \nin 20 years. And those who are lucky enough to have a job are making \nless than what they were making some 20 years ago. As we work on that \nNIH budget, the medical brains of America come with these research \ngrants, but 80 percent of the grants which are approved go unfunded. \nMedical and other research is languishing in this land. And here during \nthis 4 years, we don't have a war, inflation is down, and the deficit \nis coming down, to President Clinton's credit.\n\n  The economy, generally speaking--the stock market--is strong. So this \nis a beautiful opportunity. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, where we \nhad to sacrifice our economy heretofore during that 50-year period, we \ncan now rebuild that economy. We can come in now and flesh out the \nmeaningful programs that save us money in the long run. There is no \nquestion that only 50 percent of those on Women, Infants, and Children, \nHead Start, and title I for the disadvantaged are funded here at the \nFederal level. Rather than Goals, let's flesh out monetarily those \nprograms; let's get revenue sharing back rather than Goals 2000; give \nthe communities the revenue sharing to rebuild our educational system, \nthe roadbeds of our railroads, and the infrastructure of our highways \nand airports. Instead, the $50 billion is going to be frittered away \nwith pollster politics: a little here on capital gains, a little bit \nhere for families, a little bit over here for some higher education. We \ncan do way more on Pell grants than tax cuts for higher education. We \nhaven't fleshed that out for those eligible.\n  We have a wonderful opportunity, but instead I am afraid we are on \ntrack now to get ourselves reelected. We are using the Government to \nget ourselves reelected. We are not responding to the needs, and the \nkick-off of this particular measure is totally political--Senate Joint \nResolution 1, the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I will \ncut the spending with you. We will withhold on programs with you. We \nwill increase taxes, if you can get some votes around here. My plan \nwould not only reduce the deficit, it would reduce the trade deficit.\n  We are not willing to pay for what we are getting. That is the truth \nhere in America.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Dorgan and \nothers in introducing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. \nThe amendment we are offering is identical to the one scheduled for \nmarkup in Judiciary Committee with one essential difference: Our \namendment would protect Social Security by prohibiting the counting of \nSocial Security trust funds toward balancing the budget.\n  The amendment to be considered in Judiciary Committee is likely to be \nthe same as the one offered last year. It simply requires a balanced \nbudget by a date certain without any consideration of the effect that \nit would have on Social Security.\n  We offered the amendment we are introducing today as an alternative \nin the last Congress. If the proponents of the Republican leadership \namendment had accepted this single change, the amendment would have \nbeen sent to the States 2 years ago with resounding bipartisan support. \nInstead, they insisted on an amendment that in the year it claims to \nbalance the budget will actually have a $104 billion deficit, masked by \nSocial Security trust funds.\n  We believe to enshrine the practice of using Social Security funds as \na part of the calculation for a balanced budget is just wrong. So our \namendment would simply delete the Social Security trust funds from the \ncalculations in determining whether the budget is balanced. It would \nensure that, for all perpetuity, Social Security will not be abused \nagain to balance the budget. Therefore, again this year, we will offer \na balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that maintains a \nfirewall between Social Security and rest of budget.\n  Why must Congress exclude Social Security? Looking back on the \nhistory\n\n[[Page S767]]\n\nof the program, it becomes clear that to do otherwise would perpetuate \na massive fraud on the American taxpayer. In 1977, and again in 1983, \nCongress took bold steps to shore up Social Security with major \nlegislation to restore solvency to the program. The intention was to \nforward fund the anticipated retirement needs of future generations, \nespecially the large cohort of so-called baby boomers.\n  The result was successful in terms of generating large surpluses. \nThis year alone, the Government collects $72 billion more than it pays \nin benefits. Since 1983, the trust funds have developed reserves of \nover $550 billion.\n  This experiment has been far less successful than intended in terms \nof setting those surpluses aside. Instead of being saved to meet the \nretirement needs of future generations, the surplus revenues are being \nspent as soon as they are collected to finance the deficits being run \nup in the rest of the budget. In other words, Social Security payroll \ntaxes of hard-working Americans are being used to pay for programs \nhaving absolutely nothing to do with Social Security.\n\n  Mr. President, this practice must end. Congress should balance the \nbudget without counting Social Security so that those reserves will be \nthere when they are needed. Consider the magnitude of this problem. \nOver the next 6 years, by 2002, surpluses will total $525 billion. In \n2002, when the budget supposedly balances, Congress will rely on $104 \nbillion in Social Security revenues.\n  Raiding the trust funds borrows from the future and places the burden \non our children and grandchildren. Congress must not enshrine this \npractice in the Constitution.\n  If we adopt a balanced budget amendment without excluding Social \nSecurity, it would have the effect of reversing an earlier decision by \nCongress to take the program off-budget. In 1990, the Senate voted 98 \nto 2 for an amendment by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina \n[Mr. Hollings] to take Social Security off-budget. The amendment \nproposed in the Judiciary Committee this year breaks that promise: \nSocial Security could be used to pay for any other spending Congress \nchooses.\n  If we do not properly craft a balanced budget amendment, the \nretirement security of today's workers and future retirees will be at \nrisk. By 2020, the trust fund reserves will total about $3 trillion. At \nthat time, however, when those reserves are needed, two circumstances \nwill make them unavailable. First, unless we balance the budget not \ncounting Social Security and actually build real reserves, no funds \nwill be available in the future to draw down. Second, and equally \nimportantly, if Social Security outlays are counted under a balanced \nbudget amendment, any funds that are paid out from a reserve will have \nto be offset in the same year with other tax increases or spending \ncuts.\n  Mr. President, this second point deserves emphasis. Unless Social \nSecurity is exempted from a balanced budget amendment, the reserves now \naccumulating through the tax contributions of America's work force will \nnot be available as promised for retirees. The balanced budget \namendment would make a mockery of the supposed reason for the high \npayroll taxes currently endured by today's workers. Even if those funds \nwere saved as they should be, they could not be used to pay for Social \nSecurity benefits in the future.\n  Thus, the balanced budget amendment proposed in the Judiciary \nCommittee condones the continued reliance on payroll taxes to finance \ngeneral government expenditures. Keep in mind that Social Security is \nfunded by a 12.4-percent payroll tax. It is collected only on the first \n$62,700 of income. This arrangement forces low- and moderate-income \ntaxpayers to pay a larger share of their income than higher-income \ntaxpayers. These taxes are justified by the progressive nature of \nSocial Security benefits. However, this rationale would be eviscerated \nby enactment of the proposed balanced budget amendment. It would \nabsolutely prevent these surplus payroll tax collections from being \nused for their intended purpose.\n  Mr. President, 58 percent of taxpayers pay more Social Security than \nincome taxes. These workers, and indeed all American taxpayers, reject \nthe systematic abuse of dedicated payroll taxes for purposes other than \nSocial Security.\n  We should stop playing with fire regarding the future of the Social \nSecurity system. Congress should not approve an amendment to the \nConstitution that threatens Social Security's future and makes a \nmockery of the financing system it has put in place.\n  If Congress votes on our version of the balanced budget amendment, it \nwill be approved with overwhelming bipartisan support. That would be \nthe appropriate note with which to begin the 105th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S.J. Res. 13. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States which requires--except during time of \nwar and subject to suspension by the Congress--that the total amount of \nmoney expended by the United States during any fiscal year not exceed \nthe amount of certain revenue received by the United States during such \nfiscal year and not exceed 20 per centum of the gross national product \nof the United States during the previous calendar year; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             balanced budget amendment to the constitution\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. This is the same amendment which I have \nintroduced in every Congress since the 97th Congress. Over the past 20 \nyears, I have devoted much time and attention to promoting this idea \nbecause I believe that the single most important thing the Federal \nGovernment could do to enhance the lives of all Americans and future \ngenerations is to balance the Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, Alexander Hamilton once wrote that ``* * * there is a \ngeneral propensity in those who govern, founded in the constitution of \nman, to shift off the burden from the present to a future day.* * *''\n  History has proven Hamilton correct. We have seen over the past 27 \nyears, that deficit spending has become a permanent way of life in \nWashington. During the past three decades, we have witnessed countless \n``budget summits'' and ``bipartisan budget deals,'' and we have heard, \ntime and again, the promises of ``deficit reduction.'' But despite all \nof these charades, the Federal budget has never been balanced, and it \nremains severely out of balance today. The truth is, Mr. President, it \nwill never be balanced as long as the President and the Congress are \nallowed to shortchange the welfare of future generations to pay for \ncurrent consumption.\n  A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is the only way \npossible to break the cycle of deficit spending and ensure that the \nGovernment does not continue to saddle our children and grandchildren \nwith this generation's debts.\n  Mr. President, everyone in America would benefit from a balanced \nFederal budget. The Congressional Budget Office has stated that a \nbalanced Federal budget would lower interest rates by up to 2 full \npercentage points. That would save the average American family with a \n$75,000 mortgage on their home, about $2,400 per year. It would save \nthe average student with an $11,000 student loan about $1,900. That is \nreal money put in the pockets of hard-working Americans, simply by the \nGovernment balancing its books.\n  Moreover, if the Government demand for capital was reduced, that \nwould increase the private sector's access to capital, which in turn, \nwould generate substantial economic growth and create thousands of new \njobs.\n  On the other hand, without a balanced budget amendment, the \nGovernment will continue to waste the taxpayers' money on unnecessary \ninterest payments. In fiscal year 1996, the Federal Government spent \nabout $241 billion just to pay the interest on the national debt. That \nis more than double the amount spent on all education, job training, \ncrime, and transportation programs combined.\n  Mr. President, we might as well be taking these hard-earned tax \ndollars and pouring them down a rat hole. We could be putting this \nmoney toward improving education, developing new medical technologies, \nfinding a cure for cancer, or even returning it to the people who \nearned it in the first place. But\n\n[[Page S768]]\n\ninstead, about 15 percent of the Federal budget is being wasted on \ninterest payments because advocates of big government continue to block \nall efforts to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, a balanced budget amendment will change all of that. \nIt will put us on the path to begin paying off our national debt, which \nis currently more than $5 trillion. This amendment will help ensure \nthat taxpayers' money will not continue to be wasted on interest \npayments.\n  Opponents of a balanced budget amendment act like it is something \nextraordinary. Mr. President, a balanced budget amendment will only \nrequire the Government to do what every American already has to do: \nbalance their checkbook. It is simply a promise to the American people \nthat the Government will act responsibly.\n  Mr. President, we do not need any more budget deals. We do not need \nany more ``bipartisan'' summits resulting in huge tax increases. What \nwe need is a hammer to force the Congress and the President to agree on \na balanced budget, not just for this year, but forever. Mr. President, \na constitutional amendment to balance the budget is the only such \nmechanism available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Lindsey, member of the Board of Governors of \nthe Federal Reserve System, from that body. Mr. Lindsey's departure is \na great loss for the Federal Reserve, and the nation. His tenure on the \nBoard of Governors has been invaluable. His service as chairman of the \nBoard's Consumer and Community Affairs Committee and as chairman of the \nNeighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, as well as his participation in \nthe general business of the Board, have played a vital role in \nsustaining economic growth and price stability in this country. He will \nbe missed.\n  One can hardly blame Mr. Lindsey, however, for seizing the exciting \nand well-deserved opportunities that have come his way. As the Arthur \nF. Burns Chair in Economics at the American Enterprise Institute and as \nmanaging director of economic strategies, an economic advisory service \nbased in New York City, Mr. Lindsey will be in a position to \nparticipate in both the intellectual and practical sides of global \neconomic life during an exciting time.

Robert also served Lincoln Park as mayor, councilman and \ntreasurer.\n  Robert DeMars was a proud veteran who served during World War II in \nthe U.S. Navy's Submarine Service. Protecting and improving the status \nof veterans was a cause that was very close to Robert's heart. As a \nState Representative, he introduced legislation to provide special \nlicense plates for veterans of WW I, WW II, the Korean and Vietnam wars \nto honor their service to the Nation. He was the chairman of the House \nVeterans' Affairs Committee from 1982 to 1994.\n\n[[Page S772]]\n\n  Despite Robert's numerous professional accomplishments during his \nlifetime, he never lost touch with his constituents. His down-to-earth \nstyle was a large part of his political success. Robert was a member of \nseveral charitable organizations as well as a sponsor of Little League \nbaseball teams. His passing is a dramatic loss to many different \nsegments of the community. Robert is survived by his wife Deanie and \ntheir daughter Maeann.\n  On February 8, 1997, a Robert DeMars Memorial Charity Ball will be \nheld to honor Robert's legacy and to raise money for the Make-A-Wish \nFoundation. This is a fitting tribute to Robert DeMars's life of public \nservice and one I believe he would wholeheartedly approve of. I know my \nSenate colleagues join me in honoring the life of Robert A. \nDeMars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S771-4", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION BAN\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor Senate \nbill 6. In doing so I add my voice to the chorus calling for an end to \npartial birth abortion. The bill we are considering is designed to \noutlaw medical procedures ``in which the person performing the abortion \npartially delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and \ncompleting the delivery.'' It is a narrowly drafted bill which \nspecifically and effectively targets a rare but grisly and unnecessary \npractice.\n  I understand, Mr. President, that the American people are divided on \nmany issues within the abortion debate. I am firmly pro-life. But in my \nview one need not resort to broad, ideological arguments in this case. \nPartial birth abortions occur in the second or third trimester of \npregnancy. They are never required to save the life, health or child-\nbearing ability of the mother. They are unnecessary and regrettable.\n  We in this Chamber failed to override the President's veto of this \nlegislation during the last Congress. But I remain convinced that all \nof us can agree that this nation can do without this particular grisly \nprocedure. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S772-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PROCTOR JONES\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Proctor \nJones for his outstanding service and dedication to the U.S. Senate \nsince 1960. While his Senate employment was interrupted for 2 years for \nservice in the U.S. Marine Corps, I don't believe any staffer has \nserved in the Senate longer than Proctor. Certainly, no one has served \nthis institution more honorably or with greater dedication.\n  During my tenure in the Senate, I have had the pleasure of working \nwith Proctor on numerous occasions in his capacity as the staff \ndirector for the Democrats on the Energy and Water Subcommittee of \nAppropriations. Unfortunately, my State of North Dakota seems to be \nplagued with too little water or too much. Proctor was fully conversant \nwith and sensitive to the unique needs of North Dakota and was always \nready to assist us with our water problems. He was especially helpful \nto me over the past 3 years in finding additional funding to help the \ncitizens of Devils Lake, N.D., who have been devastated by flooding for \n4 consecutive years.\n  Proctor represents the finest there is in public service. He was \ndedicated to the institution he so honorably served under a succession \nof outstanding chairmen of the Appropriations Committee. He was ever \nthe student of the budget and appropriation processes. He was the \nmaster of the art of politics--forging compromises. He was the \nprotector of the purse--evaluating Federal programs under a microscope \nto ensure that they were necessary, effective, responsible, and \nresponsive. He was the ultimate professional. And he was a true \ngentleman.\n  During his more than 35 years in the Senate, Proctor earned the \nrespect of Members and colleagues alike. His expertise, sound judgment, \npolitical skills and professional talents will be sorely missed in the \nSenate. But I want to join my colleagues in wishing Proctor good health \nand every success as he joins his former boss, Senator Bennett Johnston \nof Louisiana, in pursuing new challenges and opportunities in the \nprivate sector. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S772-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S772-S773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               BURT BARR\n\n Mr. McCain. Mr. President, when a good man dies, heaven \nprofits at humanity's expense. My friend, Burt Barr, was a good man \nwhose loss we can scarce afford lest our society further succumbs to \nthe cynicism and distrust that cheapens our times. He was a man whose \nvirtues were so exemplary and so apparent that he won the admiration \nand affection of all he encountered. He was the kind of man whom \nfathers hope their sons will become.\n  He grew to manhood in a time when Americans believed to sacrifice for \nyour country was an ennobling experience. He took up arms in his \ncountry's defense, risked death and grave harm, endured enormous \ndeprivation for a cause he knew was greater than his own life. He \nmarched across Europe to liberate the peoples of that continent from \ntyranny; to protect America's freedoms, and to keep alive in this world \nthe prospect that our freedoms and prosperity might someday flourish in \nall societies.\n  Burt's service in the Second World War, as it was for most of his \ngeneration, was the defining event of his life. The experience of \nshared hardship, of complete faith in and devotion to the men who \nfought beside you engendered in him an enduring love and respect for \nthe men and women who have worn the uniform of the United States. But \nhis experiences in war affected more than his regard for the military. \nThey inspired in him an abiding love for and desire to remain of \nservice to his country, and to distinguish his public service with an \nunflagging belief that we are all part of a cause more noble than self-\ninterest, and that, as such, we deserve each other's respect and \nadmiration.\n  No one who worked with Burt Barr ever suspected his purposes or \ndoubted his decency. Republican and Democrat alike knew that in Burt \nthe State of Arizona had found a model public servant whose sole public \nambition was to work with any willing partner to help Arizona grow and \nprosper.\n  As is obvious by the presence here of so many Arizonans of different \npolitical affiliations, Burt was a man who kept his priorities \nstraight. He never set the price of partisan advantage so high that it \ncheapened his regard for personal friendships. He knew by instinct, by \ninstruction and by experience that political success is such an \ninconsequential thing when weighed against the love and trust of your \nneighbors and friends. When our days begin to run out there will be \nlittle solace found in the prideful recollection that we advanced our \nprofessional ambitions at the expense of others. That solace abides \nonly in our family's love, God's grace, and the satisfaction of a life \nwell-lived in the service of others, and not to the detriment of \nanyone.\n  As Bruce Babbitt and Art Hamilton can attest, as anyone who worked \nwith Burt in the service of our beautiful State can attest, Burt won \nhis share of political contests, but never at the cost of a friend. He \npresided as majority leader in the Arizona House for many years, and \nworked with many Governors. He did not exult in the perquisites of \npower, but only in the opportunity to be of use to his community. Under \nhis patient, inclusive leadership, the legislature never functioned \nmore smoothly or productively. He considered Bruce and Art and everyone \nwho labored with him on behalf of Arizona to be comrades-in-arms, not \nenemies. War had taught him that such relationships were to be \ncherished as indispensable to a good life.\n  Burt's good life, his decency to others was of inestimable value to \nArizona. Together with former Governor Babbitt, with Art, with all his \nRepublican and Democratic colleagues, Burt helped to make this State \nthe wonderful place to live it remains today. Arizona's extraordinary \ngrowth was not just coincident with, but was, in large part, a \nconsequence of his public service, and the comity and trust that \ndistinguished his relationships with his colleagues.\n  Burt was the first person whose advice I sought when I first \nconsidered a political career. I placed a high value on his counsel \nthen and in all the following years of our friendship. That I continue \nmy public career in a time of growing incivility and cynicism, in a \ntime when partisan opponents seek to criminalize our political \ndifferences is a source of deep disappointment to me,\n\n[[Page S773]]\n\nas I'm sure it was to Burt, although he was always too kind to say so.\n  I am part of a system that has grown too coarse and venal, and I bear \nmy share of responsibility for that decline. The memory of Burt Barr \nshames me, as it should shame all of us when we reduce public service \nto anything other than a noble calling to make our times a moment of \nhope and opportunity, of decency and unity. All the blessings of his \nfriendship, all the wisdom of his counsel--though I cherish them \ngreatly--will not make of me as good a man as Burt Barr. Only the shame \nthat his memory will visit on me when I stray from his example gives me \nhope that when my days are near an end, I might know--as Burt knew--the \ngreat solace of a life well-lived in the service of something greater \nthan self-interest.\n  Life will be less pleasant absent the company of this good man. His \ncheerful nature, his enormous generosity to me, his patience and \nkindness as he tried to help me become the kind of public servant that \nnot just he, but that I could be proud of, make his loss indescribably \nprofound. But he goes to a reward he so surely deserves, and we cannot \nbegrudge him that.\n  He will rest now in the field where America buries her heroes. He \nwell-earned his place there, and the place in God's presence we are all \npromised should we love our fellow man as well as Burt Barr loved us.\n  Louise, Stephanie, Michael, and Suzanne, there are no words to dull \nthe pain of a loss felt so keenly as you feel that loss of Burt. But I \nknow he wanted for you all the happiness that life affords. He would \nwant you now to live happy and fulfilling lives until the time when by \nthe grace of a loving God you will see him again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S772-3", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE RETIREMENT OF PROCTOR JONES\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to salute Proctor \nJones on his retirement from the Senate Appropriations Committee and to \nthank him for his many years of service to the Senate and the Nation. \nWhen Proctor retires at the end of this month after an amazing 35 years \nof public service, the Senate will lose one of its most distinguished \nstaff members. Proctor will be remembered for his professionalism, \ndedication, and good judgment while working for the Appropriations \nCommittee, and for his work as staff director for the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Subcommittee for the past 23 years.\n  Mr. President, I have greatly appreciated all the help Proctor has \ngiven my office since I came to the Senate in 1987. North Dakota has \nmany water development needs, and the work Proctor has done on the \nEnergy and Water Development Subcommittee has been critical to helping \nmeet those needs. The Garrison Diversion Project was first authorized \nin 1965 and was reformulated in 1986 to ensure my State an adequate \nsupply of quality water for municipal, rural, and industrial uses. \nWater development in North Dakota is also essential for economic \ndevelopment, agriculture, recreation, and tourism. The Federal \nGovernment promised the Garrison project to North Dakota to compensate \nmy State for the permanent flood of over 550,000 acres due to the \nconstruction of the Garrison and Oahe Dams. Proctor has played an \ninstrumental role in funding this essential project to meet North \nDakota's unmet water development needs and fulfill the Federal \nGovernment's promise to my State.\n  Mr. President, Proctor will be greatly missed by all who worked with \nhim. I know we in the Senate will get our work done without Proctor's \ntalent and ability, but filling his shoes will be a tremendous \nchallenge for those who follow him. I am pleased to know that Proctor \nwill remain in Washington, working with my good friend Senator Bennett \nJohnston.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to wish Proctor all the best upon his \ndeparture from the Senate. I thank the Chair and yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S773-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING DR. GORDON GUYER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a great \nman and a great teacher: Dr. Gordon Guyer. Those who have followed Dr. \nGuyer's career see a man who has accepted challenge after challenge and \nbuilt a reputation for success.\n  Dr. Guyer began attending college as a fisheries and wildlife major \nat Michigan State University in 1947. Dr. Guyer established the \nfoundation for his lifelong work when he shifted his studies to \nentomology and earned three degrees. In 1954, he became an instructor \nof entomology at M.S.U., and only 10 years later was named professor \nand chairman of the Department of Entomology and director of M.S.U.'s \nPesticide Research Center.\n  Dr. Guyer's achievements at Michigan State University have been \nremarkable. He has served as administrator and director of M.S.U.'s \nCooperative Extension Service for 11 years, associate dean of the \nCollege of Agriculture and Natural Resources, associate dean of the \nCollege of Natural Science, director of the W.K. Kellogg Biological \nStation, and special assistant to the senior consultant to the \npresident of M.S.U.\n  After retiring from Michigan State in 1986, Dr. Guyer was quickly \nnamed director of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. \nHowever, he was destined to return to the University he loved after \nonly two years as professor emeritus and vice president for \ngovernmental affairs.\n  In September of 1992 he became president of Michigan State University \nand served in that capacity for over a year. Shortly after leaving the \nuniversity, he was appointed director of the Michigan Department of \nAgriculture, from which position he retired in October 1996.\n  Dr. Guyer's success, while well known in Michigan, has spanned the \nglobe. He is an internationally known entomologist and author of more \nthan 70 scientific papers on aquatic ecology, insect control \ntechnology, integrated pest management, public policy and international \nagriculture.\n  Finally, throughout his extraordinary career, Dr. Guyer has been \nblessed by the companionship of his wife Norma Guyer. She is well known \nfor her many activities in support of M.S.U. and its boosters as well \nas the cooperative extension service.\n  To honor Dr. Guyer and thank him for his decades of service, Michigan \nState University is working to establish the Gordon and Norma Guyer \nEndowed Internship Program. This endowment will provide M.S.U. students \na variety of public policy internship opportunities and impart first-\nhand experience in potential career areas. The Gordon and Norma Guyer \nEndowed Internship Program will serve young individuals who seek to \ncontinue Dr. Guyer's work in agriculture and natural resources. I \ncannot think of a more fitting tribute to two wonderful people.\n  Dr. Guyer's dedication to Michigan, his contributions in the field of \nentomology, his focus and determination, and his integrity are an \ninspiration, and I am proud to call him a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/28/senate-section/article/S773-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S773-S774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE FORUM MAGAZINE'S SEVENTH ANNUAL AFRICAN-AMERICAN PIONEER AWARDS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the recipients \nof the Seventh Annual African-American Pioneer Awards, hosted by the \nForum magazine. In 1991, the Forum magazine began the African-American \nPioneer Awards to ``document, honor, and celebrate the little-known \naccomplishments of African-Americans from the Flint community and other \nparts of Michigan.''\n  I am pleased to congratulate the following recipients of the 1997 \nAfrican-American Pioneer Award:\n  Mr. Darwin Davis, a successful businessman and senior vice president \nof the Equitable. In a 1988 issue of Black Enterprise, Mr. Davis was \nlisted as one of America's 25 most important black executives.\n  The Velvelettes, one of three Motown bands still performing with its \noriginal members.
