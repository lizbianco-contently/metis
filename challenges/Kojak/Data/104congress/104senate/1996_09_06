Time for debate on the bill will be \nlimited to 3 hours to be divided equally in the usual form.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you, Madam President. I yield myself such time as \nI might use.\n  Madam President, this legislation is introduced by myself, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Jeffords, Senator Akaka, Senator Bingaman, Senator \nBoxer, Senator Bradley, Senator Chafee, Senator Dodd, Senator Feingold, \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Glenn, Senator Harkin, Senator Inouye, \nSenator Kerrey, Senator Kerry, Senator Kohl, Senator Lautenberg, \nSenator Leahy, Senator Levin, Senator Mikulski, Senator Moseley-Braun, \nSenator Moynihan, Senator Murray, Senator Pell, Senator Reid, Senator \nRobb, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Simon, Senator Wellstone, and Senator \nWyden.\n\n  Madam President, I am pleased to bring before the U.S. Senate this \nmorning the Employment Nondiscrimination Act. This act will eliminate \njob discrimination against gays and lesbians, and it represents the \nnext major chapter in the American struggle to secure civil rights for \nall of our citizens.\n  Our progress on civil rights and against discrimination has been one \nof the finest chapters in the Nation's modern history. The civil rights \nrevolution that began in the 1950's is an unfinished revolution, and we \nall know the major milestones along the way in Congress: the Civil \nRights Act of 1957; the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Voting Rights Act \nof 1965 and subsequent extensions; the Fair Housing Act of 1968; the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act of 1990; and the Civil Rights Act of \n1991.\n  I might also mention the Immigration Act of 1965 which addressed the \nproblem of national origin quotas and barriers to people coming into \nthe United States from the Pacific basin and the Pacific rim countries.\n  Madam President, we remember as well the battles that have taken \nplace--the painful history that includes slavery, the Jim Crow laws, \nthe Japanese internment camps, the Chinese exclusion laws, the Bracero \nprogram, and shameful policies and attitudes directed against women, \nagainst racial and religious minorities, and against the disabled. Each \nbill is an acknowledgment that America can rise above its prejudice to \nbe a better, more tolerant society.\n  Our country has a respected tradition of enacting antidiscrimination \nlegislation to deal with discrimination against recognized groups of \npeople. Time and again Congress has chosen justice over injustice and \nfairness over bigotry. The time has come to take the next important \nstep in our ongoing battle against prejudice. After decades of \ndiscrimination against gays and lesbians, the Senate can send a strong \nsignal that merit and hard work--not bias and stereotypes--are what \ncounts in job opportunities and the workplace in America in 1996.\n  Faced with irrefutable and compelling evidence of employment \ndiscrimination, the choice is clear. The Employment Nondiscrimination \nAct must become law.\n  Half a century ago the Senate itself was the instigator of such \ndiscrimination. In 1950, the Senate directed the Senate Investigations \nSubcommittee to make an investigation into employment by the Government \nof homosexuals. The subcommittee recommended the dismissal of all \nhomosexuals in Government. In 1953, President Eisenhower issued \nExecutive Order 10450 requiring dismissal of all homosexual Government \nemployees. As a result, during the period of 1947 through mid-1950, \n1,700 individuals were denied employment by the Federal Government \nbecause of their alleged homosexuality. In those times, Government \ndiscrimination was matched by flagrant discrimination by private \nemployers.\n  Government has changed. The private employers often have not. Many \ngays and lesbians still choose to hide their sexual orientation and \nlive in daily fear that their employers will discover their \nhomosexuality, terminate their jobs, and ruin their careers.\n  A 1992 survey of 1,400 gays and lesbians in Philadelphia showed that \n76 percent of the men and 81 percent of the women concealed their \nsexual orientation at work. Openly homosexual people often suffer overt \njob discrimination.\n  A review of 20 surveys conducted across the country between 1980 and \n1991 indicated that many gays and lesbians endured discrimination at \nwork. Whether an employer has a written policy or simply allows \ndiscrimination to occur, it is clear that the underlying motivation is \nbigotry against men and women because of their sexual orientation.\n  Take the case of Cheryl Summerville, who worked as a cook at a \nsuburban Atlanta restaurant for 4 years and received excellent \nperformance evaluations, awards, and promotions. In 1991, the company \nadopted a policy refusing to employ anyone ``whose sexual preferences \nfail to demonstrate normal heterosexual values.'' As a result, she was \nfired. Her official separation notice read: ``This employee is being \nterminated due to violation of company policy. The employee is gay.''\n  Dan Miller worked for a Pennsylvania management consulting company. \nHe was fired, based on a clause in his employment contract that \nspecifically made homosexuality a just cause for dismissal. Dan went to \ncourt, but to no avail. One of the jurors who heard the evidence \nstated, ``It was outrageous to hear intolerance like that in a court of \nlaw, where people come to seek protection from intolerance. But the law \nwas silent.''\n  There are too many more examples of unacceptable job discrimination \nsuffered by gays and lesbians. There are too many other cases of hard-\nworking men and women losing their jobs or unable to get work due to \ntheir sexual orientation. In each case, the law offers no protection or \nrecourse. That is why we need Federal legislation.\n  The Employment Nondiscrimination Act is modeled after title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964. It prohibits employers from using sexual \norientation as a basis for hiring, firing, promotion, or compensation. \nIt's predicated upon the American ideal of equal opportunity. It gives \ngays and lesbians a fair chance in the workplace.\n  It also includes broad exemptions. Despite the fact that over 150 \ncompanies--including Levi Strauss, Micro- soft, and Walt Disney--choose \nto provide health and other benefits to the same-sex partners of their \nemployees, our legislation does not require an employer to provide \ndomestic partnership benefits. That is a battle for another day.\n  Our legislation also does not provide for disparate impact claims--\ncases brought because an apparently neutral practice of an employer \ndisproportionately and adversely effects members of a protected class.\n  Quotas and preferential treatment are also prohibited under our \nproposal. Although employers may choose to reach out to members of the \ngay and lesbian community, they may not give preferential treatment in \nhiring, firing, promotion, or compensation based on sexual orientation.\n  Many opponents of this legislation choose to ignore this plain \nprohibition. They argue that this bill will somehow lead to quotas. \nThat result is not possible. No quotas means no quotas. Neither an \nemployer nor a court can misinterpret Congress' plain meaning.\n  Our legislation also contains a broad exemption for religious \norganizations. In fact, it is broader than the exemption for religious \ninstitutions in title VII of current law. Religious organizations are \nexempted entirely from the prohibition of discrimination based on \nsexual orientation, except for profit-making activities taxed by the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n  Finally, our legislation does not apply to the Armed Services. The \ncurrent ``Don't ask, Don't tell'' policy will remain in effect.\n  The Employment Nondiscrimination Act is simple and straight forward. \nIt is not a Government power grab in the workplace. It is not sweeping \nlegislation advancing the gay agenda. This\n\n[[Page S9987]]\n\nact is about the American agenda. It is a carefully drafted proposal to \nend job discrimination, and nothing else.\n  Of course, clear language will not stop opponents from misleading the \npublic about the bill's intent. Many statements against it defy common \nsense and logic. The Employment Nondiscrimination Act will not \nundermine business decisions as long as employers are not \ndiscriminating. Recourse against sexual harassment will still exist.\n  Opponents also express an unnecessary concern about the definition of \n``sexual orientation.'' As defined in our proposal, ``sexual \norientation'' means homosexuality, bisexuality, or heterosexuality, \nwhether such orientation is real or perceived. This definition serves \nthe same function as the definition in the Americans With Disabilities \nAct--it identifies the group of people covered by the law. As with the \nADA, a person in the protected class cannot engage in bizarre behavior, \nmust be qualified for the job, and must abide by workplace rules.\n  Nothing in this legislation will prevent employers from disciplining \nhomosexuals or heterosexuals whose behavior is illegal or unsafe, or \ncompromises their ability to perform their job. Our proposal simply \nstates that such policies must be applied fairly to all employees.\n  This legislation has broad bipartisan support. Coretta Scott King \nsupports it. Former Republican Senator Barry Goldwater supports this \nlegislation. As Senator Goldwater has said,\n\n       Employment discrimination based on sexual orientation is a \n     real problem in our society. From coast to coast and \n     throughout the heartland, regular hardworking Americans \n     are being denied the right to roll up their sleeves and \n     earn a living. That is just plain wrong.\n\n  Many Americans--84 percent--agree that employers should not \ndiscriminate based upon sexual orientation. In fact, over 600 small and \nlarge private businesses already have antidiscrimination policies that \ninclude sexual orientation.\n  Nine States and one hundred sixty-six cities and counties around the \ncountry have laws that prohibit employment discrimination against \nhomosexuals. In the Senate itself, 66 Senators have joined in pledging \nnot to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in employment in \nSenate offices.\n  These are admirable steps toward eradicating discrimination. They are \nnot enough. American workers deserve more than a patchwork of \nprotections from discrimination. That is why the Employment \nNondiscrimination Act is so clearly needed.\n  I urge the Senate to stand with Coretta Scott King and Barry \nGoldwater in support of this legislation. It is also supported by Gov. \nChristine Todd Whitman and Gov. William Weld.\n  It is supported by numerous religious organizations, including the \nGeneral Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, the Union of American \nHebrew Congregations, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church, \nthe United Methodist Church, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, \nthe United Church of Christ, and the Lutheran Church in America.\n  It is supported by business and civic leaders around the country. And \nit should be supported by the Senate, too. It is time to end job \ndiscrimination wherever it exists.\n  Madam President, I will just mention the statements made by \ndistinguished church leaders. Edmond L. Browning, who is the presiding \nbishop of the Episcopal Church, wrote recently to me:\n\n       On behalf of the Episcopal Church, I am pleased to join \n     with so many distinguished figures in the religious and civil \n     rights communities in enthusiastic support of S. 932, the \n     Employment Nondiscrimination Act of 1996. I offer my thanks \n     to you.\n       Since 1976, the Episcopal Church has been committed \n     publicly to the notion of guaranteeing equal protection for \n     all citizens, including homosexual persons, under the law. In \n     that year, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church, \n     the church's highest policymaking body, expressed its \n     conviction that homosexual persons are entitled to equal \n     protection of the laws with all other citizens and called \n     upon society to ensure that such protection is provided in \n     actuality.\n       My warm embrace of this legislation, of course, reflects \n     more than my standing as Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal \n     Church. It represents my deep, personal belief in the \n     intrinsic dignity of all God's children. That dignity demands \n     that all citizens have a full and equal claim upon the \n     promise of the American ideal, which includes equal civil \n     rights protection against unfair employment discrimination.\n\n  The Reverend Riley, who is representing the Unitarian Universalist \nAssociation of Congregations, says:\n\n       We are happy that the Employment Nondiscrimination Act is \n     being considered. . . . We feel this legislation would at \n     least allow Senators to show that, whatever your personal \n     convictions about the sanctity of marriage, you know that \n     there is no sanctity in discrimination.\n\n  The letter continues on.\n  The Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism:\n\n       On behalf of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and \n     the Central Conference of American Rabbis, representing 1.5 \n     million Reform Jews, 1800 Reform Rabbis and 850 congregations \n     throughout the United States, I am writing to strongly urge \n     you to vote for the Employment Nondiscrimination Act. . . .\n       As a religious organization, the protection of religious \n     liberty for all Americans is of paramount concern for us. \n     ENDA gives proper regard to this concern. ENDA broadly \n     exempts from its scope any religious organization, including \n     religious educational institutions. Thus, ENDA will not \n     require sectarian institutions to violate the religious \n     precepts on which they are founded, whether or not we may \n     agree with these precepts.\n\n  Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.\n\n       The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has committed \n     itself to participate in God's mission by ``advocating \n     dignity and justice for all people'' and ``joining with \n     others to remove the obstacles of discrimination and \n     indifference.''\n       Therefore, the ELCA continues its support of the Employment \n     Nondiscrimination Act and urges your support of this \n     important initiative to extend employment discrimination \n     protection to all people.\n\n  United Church of Christ. Rev. Jay Lintner points out:\n\n       Please support the Employment Nondiscrimination Act. The \n     Employment Nondiscrimination Act, which addresses the daily \n     discrimination against gays and lesbians in employment, has \n     enormous support in our denomination.\n\n  The Presbyterian Church, their letter says:\n\n       The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church . . . \n     policy brings strong support to the passage of the Employment \n     Nondiscrimination Act. Historically, U.S. society has tended \n     to stigmatize and persecute gay men and lesbian and \n     bisexuals. Employment is one of the principal areas where \n     this population faces continuing discrimination. Gay persons \n     have been fired, refused work, demoted, and harassed in the \n     workplace. Persons who have experienced discrimination on the \n     basis of sexual orientation often lack recourse . . . Such \n     discrimination denies equal opportunity in the workplace . . \n     . A yes vote on the Employment Nondiscrimination Act is a \n     vote for fairness and equality.\n\n  Not only do we have these representations of many church leaders, I \nwould say many companies support our position. I will just read a \nsample of those we have listed in our presentation from across this \ncountry that support our position.\n  The Kodak Co. says:\n\n       Kodak's clearly stated pro-ENDA position is based on the \n     very positive results we have experienced with human resource \n     policies and practices, which are completely in alignment \n     with the intent of ENDA.\n       It is our belief that only with a diverse group of highly \n     skilled people, working in a culture that enables them to \n     apply their . . . talents, will we consistently deliver the \n     greatest value to the customer . . .\n       For these reasons . . . Eastman Kodak Company believes that \n     ENDA is good for American business, large and small. The bill \n     is in step with trends in the nation's most successful \n     business, and it is in tune with a fundamental sense of \n     fairness valued by Americans.\n\n  From the Xerox Corp.:\n\n       Discrimination of any form, against any employees, does not \n     belong in our work environment.\n       We view diversity awareness and acceptance as enablers to \n     increase productivity.\n       We are pleased to see your effort to enact federal \n     legislation that will prohibit employment discrimination . . \n     .\n\n  From Microsoft:\n\n       Microsoft seeks to empower individuals to do the best \n     possible job and to make a difference. . . .\n       We commend . . . your efforts and are pleased to endorse \n     your Equal Employment Principles, which reflect our own \n     corporate policies.\n\n  Honeywell:\n\n       Writing in support of your Equal Employment Principles and \n     the Employment Nondiscrimination Act . . .\n\n  AT list goes on. Hill & Knowlton, a letter to Senator D'Amato \nin strong support.\n  What this basically shows is the moral issues which are raised by \nthis\n\n[[Page S9988]]\n\nlegislation, the ethical issues, the issues of fairness and decency are \nembraced by the various representatives of the great religions and also \nmany of America's leading companies that have already adopted this as a \ncompany policy and are in very, very broad support. We have mentioned a \nnumber of the larger companies. We could take the time for smaller \ncompanies as well.\n  In summary, we are saying that the problem of discrimination still \nexists today. We discuss the various studies that support that point--\nan excess of 20 studies that demonstrate that this type of \ndiscrimination is taking place in workplaces across this country. It is \nvery clear what is happening.\n\n       Cheryl Summerville was told ``This employee is being \n     terminated due to violation of company policy. This employee \n     is gay.''\n\n  That states it, and that is taking place in companies all across this \ncountry.\n  Here is the statement of Barry Goldwater. Again:\n\n       It's time America realize that there were no gay exemptions \n     in the right to ``life, liberty, and the pursuit of \n     happiness.''\n\n  That says it all. There are no exemptions to the right to life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness in the Declaration of \nIndependence.\n  Anyone who cares about real moral values understands this is not \nabout granting special rights. We will hear that argument over the \ncourse of this debate, that we are somehow providing special rights. \nThis debate is about bigotry in the workplace and about prejudice in \nthe workplace. This statement by Senator Goldwater captures that whole \nsense: ``It's about protecting basic rights.'' That is what this debate \nis all about.\n  We know the status of similar State laws across country. There are \nnine States now that have passed laws prohibiting employment \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation. They have been working, and \nworking well in those nine States. But, as we say, 9 States have done \nit, 41 States have not. Some States have issued executive orders \nprotecting gays and lesbians in public employment. Executive orders, as \nwe all know, are here today and can be gone tomorrow.\n  We have seen, in reviewing whether there has been a proliferation of \ncases during this period of time--that will be another issue discussed \nby opponents of this bill and we will be glad to debate it--that a fair \nnumber of charges are filed, but few actually go to the courts. My own \nState of Massachusetts, which has had a law for some period of time, \nhas had two reported cases. That is the situation in so many of these \nStates that are now providing this kind of protection. The courts are \nnot over burdened.\n  Madam President, 8 States have executive orders and 166 cities and \ncounties in 37 States have passed laws prohibiting employment \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation. And then we have the list \nof the various employers, large and small, that extend protection to \ntheir employees. By and large, we have not discovered that these laws \nand policies are an undue burden.\n  Once again, to review what this does and does not do, what we are \ntalking about is eliminating the discrimination and bigotry in the \nworkplace, in employment. This provides there will be no quotas or \npreferential treatment. ``A covered entity shall not adopt or implement \na quota on the basis of sexual orientation.'' That is in the bill. ``A \ncovered entity shall not give preferential treatment to an individual \non the basis of sexual orientation.'' That demonstrates that this is \nfree from any affirmative action. So, no quotas, no affirmative action.\n\n       ``No cases based merely on disparate impact claims.'' The \n     fact that employment practices have a disparate impact, as \n     the term ``disparate impact'' is used in section 708(k) of \n     the Civil Rights Act of 1964, on the basis of sexual \n     orientation, does not establish a prima facie violation of \n     this title.\n\n  I will not take a great deal of time, but what that demonstrates is \nthat individuals cannot bring disparate impact claims as they can under \ntitle VII. For example, the Supreme Court has held that there can be \nwomen firefighters as well as men. If 100 male firefighters are \nemployed and a number of women have applied, but none has been hired, \nyou can conclude that there is probably an employment practice that has \na disparate impact on qualified women firefighters.\n  On the other hand, if there exists a construction company and workers \nmust carry 100-pound bags of cement, and you are able to demonstrate \nthe women cannot carry the 100 pounds of cement, the employer is \nprobably not using an employment practice that has a disparate impact \non women with regard to that particular job. But if you are talking \nabout a computer company, women can use computers as well as men--in \nmost instances, probably better. If you do not hire any female \napplicants, an individual may be able to establish a disparate impact \ncharge. Those kinds of claims exist under title VII, but not under this \nbill. There will be some who will say it. We have expressed and \nexplained it. We can spend more time during the course of the debate to \nget into greater detail, but that is the fact.\n  There is no coverage for the armed services:\n\n       For the purposes of this title, the term ``employment or \n     employment opportunities'' does not apply to the relationship \n     between the United States and the members of the Armed \n     Forces.\n\n  There is no coverage for the not-for-profit religious organizations, \nexcept as provided in subsection (b), which is explained here. If they \nare in a for-profit business, as defined by the IRS, there will be \ncoverage.\n  What we are interested in are secular, not the nonsecular, \nbusinesses.\n  Madam President, now, today, we have had 66 Senators and 241 Members \nof the House of Representatives who have agreed with the following \nprinciple: The sexual orientation of an individual is not a \nconsideration in the hiring, promoting, or terminating of an employee \nin my office. Those are signed by Republican and Democratic Members of \nthe Senate.\n\n  Sixty-six--you would think we would be able to say, ``Well, why are \nwe having this debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate since Senators \nthemselves understand that this is a problem and they agree that they \nare dealing with this by freeing their offices from hiring and firing \npractices on the basis of sexual orientation?''\n  You would think if they are prepared to do it and recognize it is a \nproblem in their own offices, then why not lend their support to other \nAmerican workplaces, particularly if we are able to demonstrate that \nthis is a real problem. We have and we will present such evidence. We \nare glad to get into the various examples that demonstrate that this is \na real problem in terms of our country.\n  So, Madam President, this is basically a preliminary presentation on \nthis issue. The fact is, there is discrimination out there in the \nworkplace. We have seen the studies and, most important, we have had \nthe real testimony of men and women from across this country who \ncontinue to bear the bitter fruit of such discrimination.\n  There are not adequate existing laws to protect individuals who \nexperience that kind of a discrimination. This legislation is a very \nmeasured, targeted piece of legislation to deal with bigotry and \ndiscrimination in the workplace, carefully drafted, carefully targeted \nto that issue. We know that there is a need.\n  We believe this is a reasonable response. It represents Republican \nand Democratic efforts to try and deal with it in the workplace of this \ncountry. I am very hopeful that when we have the opportunity to address \nthis on the floor of the Senate with a vote on Tuesday next that we \nwill be able to, once again, follow the very important and proud \ntraditions of this country. Traditions rooted in the civil rights \ndebates of the fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties, and nineties that \nled to laws freeing us from the pains of discrimination on race, on \nreligion, on ethnicity, on national origin, on gender, on disability, \nand now on the issue of sexual orientation for gay men and lesbian \nwomen in our society.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Who yields time? The Senator \nfrom Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Employment \nNondiscrimination Act and would like to take just a few moments to \nexplain my opposition to this and my concerns.\n  Let me say at the outset, I do not think there is a Senator in the \nentire body of the U.S. Senate who condones\n\n[[Page S9989]]\n\ndiscrimination of any kind that is based on unreasonable and unfounded \nprejudice. I think that is a given. How we address that discrimination \nis another matter, and it is one that we have debated many times \nthrough the years on various facets of discrimination.\n  I still recall the compelling testimony that was presented in the \nLabor Committee on this issue in the last Congress when we held a \nhearing. Nonetheless, we may still disagree on the best means of \nachieving our desired goal. Prejudice and discrimination can be fought \nin many different ways. Education and awareness are important means of \neliminating prejudice, and so is the effort of individuals to lead by \nway of example.\n  Many employers, though certainly not all--and the ranking member of \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Kennedy, pointed out a \nnumber of businesses--have led the way by example. I salute those \nbusinesses that have already based their employment decisions not on \nthe employee's personal life or preferences but on the merits and \nabilities of the individual to perform the job.\n  I share this view, but I do not believe, as I have said before, that \nwe will promote greater tolerance in the workplace by relying on more \nlawsuits and litigation as this bill would require.\n  True, this is not sweeping legislation as, again, Senator Kennedy \npointed out. It is a version of the original bill that I think \naddresses some of the concerns that were originally raised. I agree \nthat discrimination does exist. However, our courts are already clogged \nwith cases which many times only lead to more divisiveness and \ndisruption in the workplace. Relying on our legal system to resolve our \ndifferences can be not only counterproductive but fraught with \nunintended consequences as well.\n\n  For this reason, Mr. President, I oppose the legislation before us. I \nknow there are those who will argue that education and outreach efforts \nare not enough. Supporters of this bill will argue that the law must \nhave ``teeth,'' that is, punishment for those who discriminate if it is \never to be effective.\n  I might be more inclined to agree if the remedy or punishment for \nviolating the law were merely reinstatement of one's job or simply back \npay, as the original Civil Rights Act of 1964 provided. But this \nlegislation provides for compensatory and punitive damages as well.\n  I opposed the expansion of remedies under title VII of the Civil \nRights Act for that very reason, and I oppose it in this case as well. \nI believe compensatory and punitive damages will only further encourage \ndivision and protracted lawsuits when the intent, as I see it, is to \nencourage the parties--employers and employees--to get along. I wish \nthat we did not have to address this by these types of remedies. We all \nwish there was an environment in which, as Senator Goldwater said in \nhis statement quoted by Senator Kennedy, everyone could be judged on \ntheir ability to perform their job with equal merit and equal \nrecognition.\n  I do not believe that this bill is the answer, because I feel we have \ninvolved ourselves far too much in a litigious environment in our \nworkplace today, which destroys the very kind of efforts that we are \ntrying to address in nondiscrimination with the legislation that is \nbefore us today.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time as my friend and \ncosponsor desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nEmployment Nondiscrimination Act (ENDA). I introduced a bill this \nCongress with Senator Kennedy. We held a hearing in the previous \nCongress and came to the strong conclusion that the public support on \nthe one hand is almost unanimous. Some 85 percent of the people support \nthe concept, and second, that discrimination does go on and that it \nmust have a remedy.\n  I differ with the feeling of my esteemed chairman that all that is \nneeded is more education and that the remedies are not needed. I point \nout also that the remedies provided for in this act are the same \nremedies that apply to all of the other acts that we have to prevent \ndiscrimination.\n  I would like to first acknowledge the hard work of many Senators who \nhave made it possible for us to debate, and next week vote on, this \nimportant piece of legislation. I commend the majority leader and \nminority leader for working out an arrangement which I think is fair. \nIt does not give us what we had hoped for, to be very candid, that we \ncould attach ENDA to the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and, therefore, \nhave a vehicle that might carry it on through to victory. But just \nhaving an opportunity to raise the issues on the Senate floor is an \nimprovement over history and, thus, we must move on.\n  I am very hopeful we will have a sufficient number of votes to pass \nthe bill. As stated by Senator Kennedy, it also has been shown that 66 \nSenators already agree in their own offices that we should not have \nsuch discrimination.\n  I was involved with crafting this legislation during the past few \nyears and was pleased to join with almost one-third of my colleagues in \nintroducing ENDA in the 104th Congress. I believe this is one of the \nmost important civil rights initiatives before this Congress.\n  This legislation will extend to sexual orientation the same Federal \nemployment discrimination protections established for race, religion, \ngender, national origin, age, and disability.\n  The principles of equality and opportunity must apply to all \nAmericans. Like all other Americans, gays and lesbians deserve to be \njudged at work based on their ability to do the job. People who work \nhard and perform well should not be kept from leading productive and \nresponsible lives, which includes paying taxes, meeting their mortgage \npayments, and otherwise contributing to the economic life of this \nNation because of an irrational, nonwork-related prejudice.\n  Mr. President, many may be wondering if this legislation is \nnecessary. Let me share with my colleagues a few examples that \ndemonstrate the need for this legislation. Earlier this week at a press \nconference, I was joined by Ms. Nan Miguel, a woman who was forced to \nleave her job--not because she was a gay or lesbian--even though her \ndepartment was short-staffed, simply because she defended her decision \nto hire another female employee who was considered by her fellow \nemployees to be a lesbian. No proof. She still does not know.\n  Another example is John Howard, a student from Alabama who was giving \ntours of a regional paper company's large art collection in order to \nearn graduate school tuition. A coworker told his supervisor that he \nsuspected that Mr. Howard was gay. The supervisor called him in, \nacknowledged that his work was ``perfect,'' and asked him whether he \nwas gay or belonged to any gay organizations. After learning that Mr. \nHoward was president of the University of Alabama Gay and Lesbian \nAlliance, the supervisor fired him. These examples and many others show \nthat Congress must pass the Employment Nondiscrimination Act.\n  Mr. President, it is not only needed, it is supported by the American \npeople. And in a recent poll, well over three-quarters of the \nrespondents stated that there should be equal rights for Americans, \nincluding gays and lesbians, on the job. While ENDA will achieve this \ngoal for job opportunity, it does not do so by creating any special \nrights for gays and lesbians.\n  Specifically, this legislation prohibits preferential treatment, \nincluding quotas, based on sexual orientation, and also does not \nrequire an employer to justify a neutral practice that may have a \nstatistically disparate impact. This a very complicated area of the law \nand one which is very difficult for employers to meet. It does not \napply to this. Rather, it simply protects a right which should belong \nto every American, the right to be free from discrimination at work \nbecause of personal characteristics unrelated to successful performance \non the job.\n  Securing this right benefits businesses as well as individuals. As \nChad Gifford, CEO of the Bank of Boston, said recently:\n\n       . . . there are compelling business reasons why we support \n     ENDA and the workforce diversity it will engender. We want to \n     see ENDA approved because we believe that it will help us as \n     we advance a competitive business strategy--a strategy that \n     not only\n\n[[Page S9990]]\n\n     embraces diversity, but also depends on it and takes full \n     advantage of it.\n\n  Many other businesses have joined the Bank of Boston in adopting \nsimilar sexual orientation antidiscrimination policies. In fact, over \nhalf of the Fortune 500 companies have such policies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of employers with nondiscrimination policies that include sexual \norientation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Employers With Non-Discrimination Policies That Include Sexual \n                   Orientation--As of August 16, 1996\n\n\n                                alabama\n\n       Intergraph, SCI Systems, America West Airlines, Arizona \n     State University, and Bashas' Incorporated.\n\n\n                                 alaska\n\n       University of Alaska.\n\n\n                               california\n\n       AST Research, Acuson, Advanced Micro Devices, Agouron \n     Pharmaceuticals, Allergan, Amdahl, American President, Amgen, \n     Antioch University (Southern California), Apple Computer, \n     Atlantic Richfield, Autodesk, Avery Dennison, Bank of \n     California, Bay View Federal Bank, Bergen Brunswig, Borland \n     International, Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison, California \n     Institute of Technology, California State University, Charles \n     Schwab & Company, Chevron, Cisco Systems, Claremont McKenna \n     College, Claris, Clorox, Cypress Semiconductor, Del Monte \n     Foods, Dole Food, First Interstate Bancorp, Fluor Daniel, \n     Foundation Health, Gap, Genentch, Glendale Federal Bank, \n     Golden West Financial, Graham & James, Great Western \n     Financial, H.F.

In today's global economy our Nation must take full \nadvantage of every resource that is at our disposal. We want U.S. \ncompanies to maintain their competitive advantage over their \ninternational competitors. This statement from Mr. Gifford, combined \nwith the fact that a majority of the Fortune 500 companies have \nincorporated many of ENDA's policies, clearly indicates that these \nchanges will not disrupt but improve the workplace. At this time in our \ncountry when we are short of skilled workers, we should not have \nanything that bars those skilled workers from an opportunity to have a \njob to assist us in our society.\n  Mr. President, some concerns have been raised by my colleagues that \npassing ENDA will create a new wave of litigation. I am proud to say \nthat my home State of Vermont is one of several States and localities \nthat have enacted a sexual orientation antidiscrimination law. It is no \nsurprise to me that the sky has not fallen. Since the enactment of \nVermont's law in 1991, 5 years ago, the Vermont attorney general has \ninitiated only 14 investigations of alleged sexual orientation \ndiscrimination. Six are pending at this time. Four have been closed \nwith determinations that unlawful discrimination cannot be proven to \nhave occurred. Three have been closed for miscellaneous administrative \nreasons unrelated to the charge, and one resulted in a settlement.\n  There has been no huge litigation involved in Vermont. It has little \nor no burden when you figure how many that is per year, about three a \nyear in the State. In addition, I am not aware of a single complaint \nfrom Vermont employers about the enforcement of the State law. However, \nI do know that thousands of Vermonters no longer need to live and work \nin the shadows. Vermont's experience is not unique. Other States and \nthe District of Columbia have implemented policies similar to the one \nof my home State of Vermont with similar results.\n  As I have stated before, success at work should be related to one's \nability to do the job and nothing else. The passage of ENDA would be \none step toward ensuring the ability of all people, be they gay, \nlesbian or heterosexual, to be fairly judged on the work product, not \non unrelated personal characteristics. Passage of ENDA could be perhaps \none of the most important things this Senate could do this year.\n  Let me go back and summarize again and to straighten out some of the \nmisconceptions regarding ENDA. First of all, this legislation does not \ncreate any special rights. Specifically, this legislation prohibits \npreferential treatment, including quotas based on sexual orientation. \nIt simply protects a right that should belong to every American, the \nright to be free from discrimination at work because of personal \ncharacteristics unrelated to successful performance in the job.\n  I also would like to point out that we have gone and looked at those \nareas which do create difficulties for business, areas which might lead \nto litigation. And for the reasons of those that hold a fear of that \nlitigation, we have not provided all of the protections to sexual \norientation that race, religion, gender and others have. ENDA, for \ninstance, does provide for the same remedies--injunctive relief and \ndamages--permitted under title VII and the Americans With Disabilities \nAct and also does apply to Congress with the same remedies as provided \nby the Congressional Accountability Act.\n  This last application is very important to me because I believe it is \nvery important that Congress not only live with the laws we pass, but I \nfeel it is very important that an example should be set by Congress \nthat gays and lesbians should not only be allowed to contribute to the \neconomic life of the Nation but the political one as well. I once again \npoint out that we have 66 offices that have already accomplished this.\n  More importantly, for the specific areas that have created problems \nfor employers, ENDA does not require an employer to justify a neutral \npractice that may have a substantial disparate impact based on sexual \norientation. That means you do not have to prove by figures that you \nhave hired enough gays and lesbians to show that you have complied with \nthe law. Let me state again that ENDA does not require that. That \nrequirement would be very difficult to meet. ENDA exempts small \nbusinesses, as do existing civil rights statutes. Thus, it does not \napply to employers with fewer than 15 employees.\n  Finally, ENDA does not require an employer to provide benefits for \nthe same-sex partner of an employee. This is a requirement which would \nbe problematical for many.\n  So we have done everything we believe we can do to reduce the amount \nof litigation, to reduce the amount of concern of employers, and \ncertainly small businesses, and as we do in other areas, to prevent any \nreal burden on close working situations.\n  As I have stated before, a successful workplace should be directly \nrelated only to one's ability to do the job, period. The passage of \nENDA would be one step toward ensuring the ability of gays, lesbians, \nand heterosexuals to be fairly judged on their work product, not on an \nunrelated personal characteristic. Passing ENDA could perhaps be one of \nthe most important things this Congress could do.\n  Once again, I am pleased that we have this opportunity, and I want to\n\n[[Page S9992]]\n\nthank, again, the majority and minority leaders for the system that has \nbeen set up to allow us to get a straight vote on this issue, and I \nlook toward the day we succeed in getting ENDA enacted into law. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield as much time as the Senator \nfrom Utah would like to have.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I oppose this legislation. The bill before \nthe Senate has vast ramifications. This bill represents a massive \nincrease in Federal power. For example, Federal bureaucrats, Federal \ncourts, and plaintiffs' lawyers will be given enormous new sway over \nour Nation's private employers, as well as State and local governments. \nThis bill will be, if it passes and becomes law, a litigation bonanza.\n  I think I have a reputation around here as supporting civil rights \nlegislation. I do not want to see any discrimination against anybody in \nour society. As the coauthor of the AIDS bill, as the coauthor of the \nHate Crimes Statistics Act, and other bills, I think my reputation is \nthat of someone who decries discrimination in any form in our society. \nHowever, this bill, in my opinion, is the wrong way to go.\n  Moreover, notwithstanding ineffective language in the bill, Federal \nbureaucrats at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, lawyers at \nthe Department of Justice, along with plaintiffs' lawyers in Federal \ncourts, will open up an entirely new category of preferences and \nreverse discrimination. This new category, make no mistake about it, \nwill be based on sexual orientation. The moral and religious \nsensibilities of millions of Americans will be overridden if this \nlegislation comes to pass and is enacted into law.\n  Let me turn to each point, starting with the vast increase in Federal \nGovernment power created by this bill. Mr. President, I respectfully \nsubmit that a vote for this bill is a vote to give the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission the power to require employers to provide the \nGovernment with data on the sexual orientation of their employees. \nToday, under title VII, the EEOC asks numerous employers to provide \nstatistics on the racial, ethnic, and gender composition of their work \nforces and new hires.\n  Let me stress, so that no one is misled by the bill's section on \ndisparate impact, that statistics on the composition of a work force \nare not used just in disparate impact cases. These statistics are \nfrequently used to prove cases of intentional discrimination on the \nbasis of race, ethnicity, and gender, including pattern and practice \ncases.\n  Section 11 of the bill grants to the EEOC ``with respect to the \nadministration and enforcement of this act'' the same power the EEOC \nhas to administer and enforce title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. \nThe EEOC, the Department of Justice, and plaintiffs' lawyers, will be \nable to use such statistics on the sexual orientation of employees at a \nparticular workplace in proving cases of intentional sexual orientation \ndiscrimination under this bill. As I mentioned earlier, these would \ninclude pattern and practice cases that the Federal Government is now \nable to bring against employers under title VII.\n  Here is what is authorized by this bill: someone alleges that he or \nshe was denied a job because of the complainant's homosexuality. The \nFederal Government investigates. Perhaps there is evidence that a \nsupervisor in the personnel office made statements expressing \ndisapproval of homosexuality. Perhaps the Department of Justice or the \nEEOC received similar complaints from one or two other job applicants. \nThe appropriate Federal agency could then turn to the statistical \nprofile of that employer's work force and recent hires. If there are no \nhomosexuals in that work force, or virtually none, if all or almost all \nrecent homosexual job applicants were denied a job, those statistics \ncan be used by the Government, or in a private lawsuit, as evidence of \nintentional discrimination.\n  I hope that no Senator is under the misimpression that the use of \nstatistical evidence in so-called underrepresentation cases is \nforbidden by this bill. This bill authorizes, indeed invites, the use \nof statistics based on sexual orientation by its grant to the EEOC of \nauthority that it now has under title VII. Now some might ask, would \nthe EEOC really seek such statistics? My answer is that EEOC is part of \nthe very same bureaucracy which presently makes heavy use of statistics \nunder title VII, and which played so crucial a role in the creation of \npreferences and reverse discrimination under that statute.\n\n  Let me give one more example of the vast power this bill gives to the \nFederal bureaucracy and the Federal courts. Under title VII, harassment \nin the workplace on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, and religion \nis forbidden, and properly so. If this bill becomes law, what is going \nto happen if a supervisor, based on religious or moral beliefs, \nexpresses disapproval of homosexuality and there are homosexual \nemployees in that workplace? What is going to happen if one or more \nemployees express such views and supervisors are aware of those \ninvestigations and do nothing about them? The answer is there will \nlikely be a lawsuit claiming a hostile work environment exists which \nadversely affects homosexual employees. However that lawsuit is \nresolved, think of the new costs imposed on our Nation's employers in \ndealing with these new lawsuits. It is bad enough under the current \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, it is also certain that reverse discrimination and \npreferences will result from this bill. Some will ask, how can that be? \nThe bill says ``a covered entity shall not give preferential treatment \nto an individual on the basis of sexual orientation.'' That is in \nsection 7. But the bill says something more. The bill gives Federal \ncourts ``The same jurisdiction and powers as such courts have to \nenforce title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.'' That is in section \n11(a)5. Further, ``The procedures and remedies available for a title \nVII violation'' are available under this bill, and that is section \n11(b)1.\n  Now, let us take a look at section 706(g) of title VII. That \nprovision of title VII says that if the court finds that an employer \nintentionally discriminated, the court may enjoin such discrimination \n``and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate or any other \nequitable relief as the court deems appropriate.'' Now, Mr. President, \nif you only read this bill, you will miss the powers this bill grants \nto the Federal Judiciary, including those pertaining to affirmative \naction are not evidence.\n  We all know, Mr. President, regrettably, that the Supreme Court has \nconstrued section 706(g) of title VII to permit Federal courts in \nlimited circumstances of persistent egregious, intentional \ndiscrimination to impose preferences as remedies in title VII cases. I \nhave said the preferences are never appropriate as a remedy. But the \nsame remedies under title VII will be available under this bill. \nPreferences on the basis of sexual orientation will be imposed when \nFederal courts think that an employer has intentionally discriminated \nin a persistent and egregious way, and whether we agree with this view \nor not, many employers have very strong religiously based/morally based \nobjections to homosexuality which they may reflect in their employment \npractices that could well give rise to remedial orders of a \npreferential way in a number exceeding that which we have seen under \ntitle VII.\n  Further, the Supreme Court has told us that a consent decree pursuant \nto a statute is part contract and part enforcement of the statute \nitself. The Federal agencies which bring the lawsuits under this bill \nhave enormous leverage. These cases are very costly to defend, make no \nmistake. These agencies, as well as plaintiffs' lawyers in private \ncases, will also be able to extract consent decrees containing \npreferential relief from employers because the employers paid then \nbecause it is too expensive to fight them.\n  Section 7 of this bill does not order the analysis. It does not limit \na court's remedial power. Title VII has a similar provision, yet the \nSupreme Court told us the remedial authority of the courts are governed \nby section 706(g).\n  The proponents of this bill can make the very same statement that our \nrevered late colleague and dear friend of mine, Senator Hubert \nHumphrey, made during debate on the 1964 Civil Rights Act in response \nto concerns expressed about preferences and quotas. He said\n\n[[Page S9993]]\n\nhe would eat the pages of the Congressional Record, one after the \nother, if someone could show him where these preferences are in title \nVII. Within 5 years after the enactment of that act, Federal agencies \nand courts had misused title VII to create preferences, something the \nprime sponsor of that bill said could not occur. The very same agencies \nwill enforce this bill on sexual orientation, under virtually identical \nprovisions. So if the proponents of this bill want to tell the Senate \nthe same thing our dear colleague Senator Humphrey told the Senate in \n1964, I have no doubt that someday I will be sending them a copy of \ntoday's Congressional Record, together with a knife and fork and \nsomething to wash down the pages.\n  I might add this, that a plaintiff's ability to use statistics to \nprove intentional discrimination is going to be a powerful silent \nincentive to employers to hire by the numbers on the basis of sexual \norientation, in order to avoid these lawsuits.\n  Mr. President, let me make one more point on affirmative action under \nthis bill. There are forms of remedial affirmative action under title \nVII that I do support. For example, I believe it is appropriate for \nemployers to be required to recruit and advertise to increase the \napplicant pool for members of such groups.\n  This is a fairly routine remedy. Under this bill, an employer who \ndiscriminates on the basis of sexual orientation against homosexuals \nwill likely be required to undertake such recruitment, such as by \nadvertising among homosexual groups and media outlets. Should we be \nimposing this requirement on employers in the matter of sexual \norientation? I do not think so.\n  Let me note, Mr. President, that many employers have honest moral, \nreligious-based objections to hiring homosexuals. These are views that \nshould not be dismissed. I will mention one example. The July 19, 1996, \nWashington Post reported that a Loudoun County teacher and coach had \nstarred in gay pornographic videos. This person had a job teaching \nhealth and physical education at Farmwell Station Middle School in \nAshburn, VA. He was also an assistant coach for boys football, \nbaseball, and wrestling at a high school.\n  Loudoun School Superintendent Edgar B. Hatrick III said if the \nallegations were true, he would seek to fire the teacher. He noted, \n``We believe that teachers, as people who are chosen to be instructors \nas well as leaders of our young people, should be exemplary in their \nprofessional as well as personal lives. What we have here is an \nallegation of a lifestyle that is not in keeping with that. If the \nallegations are true, that is not conduct befiting a teacher.''\n  I suspect that the principal would have taken the same attitude if it \nhad been a pornographic movie starring a heterosexual teacher, and \nrightfully so.\n  One parent of a daughter who attended a school where this person \ntaught said she believed that what people do in their private lives is \ntheir business--unless they are teachers. ``I want our teachers to have \nthe highest moral fiber. I'm not comfortable with him doing both.'' A \nschool board member said, ``Here we have a teacher in a middle school \nworking with children who are at that age where they are struggling \nwith their * * * identity. This is obviously a person who has made bad \nchoices. To give someone like this access to children at that stage of \ndevelopment would be irresponsible of us.''\n  Mr. President, those views are overridden by this bill. And even if \none disagrees with these school officials and parents, as the \nproponents of this bill may do, is it appropriate for this Senate to \nrun roughshod over their concerns? I know the supporters of this bill, \nincluding President Clinton who has strongly endorsed it, are sincere.\n  In particular, I have worked very closely in the past with my friend, \nSenator Kennedy, on these matters. I have tried to be with him where I \nbelieve he is correct, and he has tried to be with me where he believes \nI have been correct.\n  But the people in Loudoun County and millions of other Americans who \nagree with them are also sincere.\n  Mr. President, in the version of this bill introduced last night, \nsection 10 states that a covered employer can enforce rules ``regarding \nnonprivate sexual conduct, if such rules of conduct are designed for, \nand uniformly applied to, all individuals regardless of sexual \norientation.'' This provision provides little help to the people of \nLoudoun County and across this country who have similar concerns. Its \nfundamental flaw is that in order to enforce rules under this section, \nhomosexuality and heterosexuality must be treated entirely alike.\n  Suppose a male teacher kisses his female spouse goodbye in front of \nthe schoolchildren in the morning as she drops him off at school. Some \nmight find such warmth and affection between husband and wife a good \nthing for the children to see. But Loudoun County would have to fire \nthat male teacher before this bill would permit the county to fire a \nmale teacher for kissing his male partner in front of the children at \nschool. Or, suppose a single male teacher, during nonschool hours and \nin public, holds hands, walks arm in arm with his girlfriend, and \nengages in some kissing. I can well understand if the school \nauthorities do not find that public behavior a matter for discipline. \nUnder this bill, however, these same school authorities could not take \naction against a male teacher who engages in the very same public \nactions I just mentioned, with another male. I think that forcing \nLoudoun County to treat both situations the same, in terms of role \nmodels for schoolchildren and the other concerns parents and educators \nmight have, is wrong.\n  Mr. President, let me note some of the other flaws in the bill. The \nbill says it does not apply to the Armed Forces, defined as the Army, \nNavy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. But the bill would \napply to other elements of our military structure, such as the National \nGuard. Moreover, if the proponents of the bill think the military \nshould be exempt, why didn't they exempt State and local police \ndepartments, and other law enforcement agencies at the local, State, \nand Federal levels? These are paramilitary organizations. They deal \nwith domestic threats to the peace and our security. If some of the \nforces that deal with foreign threats to the peace and our security are \nexempted from the bill, why shouldn't the domestic law enforcement \nagencies be treated the same way? I might add that in many States \nhomosexual conduct is illegal, by statute or common law, yet this bill \nwould compel the law enforcement agencies in those States to hire \nindividuals who are acknowledged to engage in such conduct.\n  Let me also say that my support for the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, \nwhich Senator Simon and I have gotten through the Senate and enacted \ninto law twice, is fully consistent with my position on this bill. My \nview that absolutely no one should be subjected to violence or \nvandalism because of who they are is, of course, widely shared. But it \ndoes not follow from the fact that while everyone, including \nhomosexuals, should be free of violence, society must confer \naffirmative civil protections on the basis of sexual orientation not \navailable, I might add, to everyone else.\n  I would urge President Clinton to reconsider his support of this \nbill. I don't think we would be taking it up today if he wasn't such a \nstrong backer of the bill. I don't think it would have a chance of \npassage if he opposed the bill, a bill which has so many noticeable \nflaws.\n  Mr. President, those are just some of my feelings with regard to this \nbill. I have watched these EEOC applications of title VII and the court \napplications of title VII for many years. I believe that I have spoken \nthe truth here about what really is happening, what has happened, and \nwhat will happen if this bill is passed. It would lead to a bonanza of \nlitigation that would be second to none in the history of this country, \nand I think, frankly, that it is not in the best interest of the \ncountry, and would be used to trample right over the rights of many \npeople who have sincerely held religious views about the matter.\n  Mr. President, I may have some more to say about this bill later.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I know others want to speak, but I want to address \nbriefly the issue of remedies that has been referred to by my \ncolleagues who have\n\n[[Page S9994]]\n\nstated their opposition to this legislation--both their concern about \nthe additional burden on the courts and also on the issues of remedies.\n  I think we can look at the nine States that currently have virtually \nthe same kind of law that we are proposing. Most of them have some form \nof an equal employment commission in their various States.\n  I will include this in the Record.\n  To talk about the number of cases that have been brought in the State \ncourt system, in Wisconsin they passed a law similar to this in 1982. \nThey have had one reported case between 1982 and 1993. In California, \nsince 1992, they have had five reported cases. In my own State of \nMassachusetts, we have had two reported cases since 1989; Minnesota, \nsince 1991, three reported cases; New Jersey, since 1991, zero reported \ncases; Vermont, since 1991, one reported case; Connecticut, since 1991, \nthey have had four reported cases; Hawaii, since 1991, zero reported \ncases; Rhode Island, since 1991, zero reported cases.\n  What we have seen since this law was passed is not the kind of \nproliferation of cases. What we are seeing is compliance.\n  Finally, let me just say with regard to remedies, I remind our \ncolleagues that in the remedies section, as has been pointed out by \nSenator Jeffords, we are basically tracking title VII of the Civil \nRights Act, and we are talking about the 1991 Civil Rights Act. \nTherefore, the damages are capped. They do not cap them on the basis of \nrace. They do not cap them in terms of religious discrimination or \nnational origin. They cap them solely on gender--women--the disabled, \nand now on gay and lesbians. We put a cap on them.\n  I would like to believe, if we are talking about discrimination that \nis taking place against American citizens, we would apply remedies \nfairly to all victims of discrimination. But nonetheless, currently, \nwomen and the disabled and, when this legislation becomes law, gays and \nlesbians, are held to a second-class standard in terms of remedies. \nWith all due respect to those who are complaining about remedies, we \nalready included a cap to gain support. We are not altering or changing \nthat.\n  Third, I advise my good friend from Utah to review the legislation. \nThere is no requirement in this legislation that any company has to \nkeep statistics--his admonition that we have to be concerned because of \ndisparate impact claims is without merit. Disparate impact claims are \nspecifically excluded. Statistics are not necessary. So I have \ndifficulty in following the logic of his comment.\n  Basically, what we are talking about is this, Mr. President:\n\n       People like Cheryl Summerville who received a notice that \n     said, ``This employee is being terminated due to violation of \n     company policy. This employee is gay.''\n\n  That is what we are talking about. We are talking about blatant, \nflagrant discrimination and bigotry that exists in our country that \nsome States have identified. That is what is at issue. That is what we \nare addressing. We obviously welcome the opportunity to take various \nrecommendations or suggestions about how to make it better.\n  The final point I make, Mr. President, is that I heard my colleague \nsay that a lot of people have strong religious beliefs not to associate \nwith homosexuals. We went through a period not long ago when a lot of \npeople had moral beliefs, ethical beliefs not to associate with blacks, \nLatinos or Asian-Americans, and basically what civil rights laws have \nstood for is that individuals cannot use those beliefs in order to \ndiscriminate against fellow Americans. That is the basis of the civil \nrights laws that exist to address the issues of discrimination on race, \non religion, on ethnicity, on national origin, on gender and \ndisability. All we are attempting to do is to extend it.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, and the others mentioned earlier, I \nhope we can move forward with the legislation.\n  I see my friend, the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, could I just answer the Senator?\n  If the distinguished chairman will yield 2 minutes to me, I would \nappreciate it.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Keep in mind the Senator just got through equating \nhomosexuality with race, which is exactly what is going to happen \nshould this legislation pass.\n  Mr. President, I might add that the experience under State law that \nhe refers to is largely irrelevant. Experience under State law cited by \nmy friend from Massachusetts, in my opinion, is irrelevant. I cited the \nremedial provision of title VII, section 706(g), which gives Federal \ncourts the power to award affirmative action relief. That is extremely \ndifferent from the State statutes with regard to this.\n  The Supreme Court has said in some cases preferential relief can be \ngranted. The Court said that consent decrees with preferential relief \nmay be entered. Since the bill does incorporate section 706(g), the \nsame thing is going to happen here. It opens up a massive Federal role \nin employment matters with regard to gay and lesbian people.\n  I have to say I am uncomfortable with both sides on the issue because \nI think the bill is not written well. I think it does not solve these \nproblems. It will lead to tremendous Federal Government control over \nthe employer workplace throughout the country, and I think it will lead \nto the same sort of sets of preferences that we see today under title \nVII that were said could never happen.\n  These are some of the things that bother me. On the other hand, I do \nnot want to see gay and lesbian people discriminated against. But I \njust heard my colleague from Massachusetts equate homosexuality with \nrace by saying the churches have had to comply with the Civil Rights \nAct. That is true. On the other hand, he excludes churches in here but \nnot the profitmaking aspects of the church, of the particular churches \ninvolved, which may include publication, it may include running \nfacilities for the benefit of their members, it may include any number \nof other situations that may be considered profitmaking. Yet the \nparticular religious belief may be such that it condemns homosexual \nconduct and sincerely does so and does so as a right of that religious \ninstitution, longstanding religious institutions in some cases, highly \nrecognized, mainstream churches that have doctrines and principles that \ncondemn homosexual conduct, and yet it would require them to have to \ncomply with this law as it is written, and I believe in ways that will \nbe very similar, no question about it, in ways that will be exactly \nlike the requisites of title VII today.\n  As Gen. Colin Powell so eloquently stated in a May 1992 letter to \nRepresentative Pat Schroeder defending restrictions on homosexuals in \nthe military, he said:\n\n       Skin color is a benign nonbehavioral characteristic. Sexual \n     orientation is perhaps the most profound of human behavioral \n     characteristics. Comparison of the two is a convenient but \n     invalid argument.\n\n  I think he makes a good point. I do not think there is any question \nabout it.\n  This bill gives the EEOC the same power to administer and enforce \nthis bill as the EEOC has under title VII. Under title VII, the EEOC \ncollects statistics. It is in the regulations in 29 CFR, subpart A, B, \nand C. So to compare this with the States and the fact that there may \nbe a dearth of suits under State law belies the fact that under Federal \nlaw there will be a proliferation of suits and I think testing of this \nmatter all over the country, and I do not know that you will have any \nchoice other than to apply the law as the Supreme Court has interpreted \nsection 7 in bygone days and bygone ages. If that is the case, you are \ngoing to have, I think, an awful lot of difficulty in our society and \nespecially among religious institutions and others that take highly \nmoral views of these matters that I think will be very disruptive to \nour country.\n  Having said that, I would like to continue to explore a way, some way \nof encouraging people in our country to be fair to gays and lesbians in \nour society. I do not think anybody should be discriminated against. On \nthe other hand, these Federal statutes have sometimes resulted in \ndiscrimination against people who have sincerely held beliefs, \nreligious or otherwise, that I think are valid.\n\n[[Page S9995]]\n\n  So having said that, I do not see the analogy, but I will accept the \nstatements of the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts as said with \nregard to the dearth of cases in some of these States under State law. \nUnder Federal law there will be a proliferation. I guarantee it. I do \nnot think anybody doubts it. I think we have seen it and we will see it \nin the future if this bill passes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take the time. My colleagues are \nnot here to respond in detail. But, with all respect to my friend, he \nhas misstated the law and then differed with the misstatement. I will \ncome back to that at a different time.\n  How much time does the Senator care for?\n  Mr. KERREY. Perhaps 5 minutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. INHOFE). The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, it seems to me, for Members who are trying \nto decide on this piece of legislation, the Employment \nNondiscrimination Act, there are really three questions that need to be \nasked and answered. The first is: Should the Federal Government \nintervene and preempt State laws? That really leads to the question: Do \nyou support the underlying bill, the Defense of Marriage Act? I do not \nsupport the underlying bill, the Defense of Marriage Act, for a number \nof reasons including the fact it is the first time the Federal \nGovernment will be intervening, preempting State laws on family \nmatters. Divorce, child support, all sorts of other things will now be \nopened up and legitimate objects of concern for new Federal \nlegislation.\n  But for those who have answered that first question yes, then this \namendment is, it seems to me, an appropriate remedy to 41 States that \ncurrently continue to permit discrimination on the basis of sexual \norientation. So that is question No. 1: Do you think the Federal \nGovernment should intervene? If you support DOMA you already support \nintervention. You already support an act of intervention, which DOMA \nis. DOMA preempts State laws. So does ENDA.\n  The second question is a very difficult one. I think--I am not sure \nof this--I think the origin of some of the differing views between the \nSenator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Utah--I am not certain \nof it--is: Do you believe sexual orientation is a trait, a \ncharacteristic, or do you think it is behavior? Do you think you are \nborn with a particular sexual orientation or do you think you choose \nit, that you decide you want to be gay? Apparently, I guess from the \nletter written by Colin Powell, he believes race is benign but sexual \norientation is not benign. That is the implication one gets from the \nletter from Colin Powell. I disagree with that. I would say sexual \norientation is also benign. I do not believe that because I am \nheterosexual I am not benign. I do not think my orientation is an \nindication of what I intend to do, at least in regard to what Colin \nPowell is suggesting. But it is a very important question.\n  There are some who believe that sexual orientation is chosen, it is a \nbehavior. If you believe that, then you say it is the same thing as \nsmoking or the same thing as drinking or other things and you do not \nthink you are discriminating. You think it is legitimate. But the \noverwhelming number of people who have looked at this say sexual \norientation is a trait. You do not choose it. You do not wake up one \nmorning and say, ``I think I will be homosexual''--or heterosexual, for \nthat matter. It is a very important question. Because, it seems to me, \nif you believe it is a characteristic, that it is a trait, if you do \nbelieve that, as I do, if that is your conclusion--and Members need to \nask themselves that--if you believe it is a characteristic, if you \nbelieve it is a trait, if you believe that is the way you are born, \nthen you do have to treat it, at least in some ways, the same as race. \nIt is a benign thing. You do not go out and decide this is what you are \ngoing to do with your life. So that is question No. 2. I answer the \nquestion that it is a trait, it is a characteristic, you are born this \nway and you orient that way as a consequence.\n  Question No. 3 is: Is this the right solution to discrimination? If \nyou want the Federal Government to intervene --as I said, I think it is \na mistake to be intervening, at least in the fashion we are doing with \nDOMA. If you want the Federal Government to intervene, if you believe \nit is a characteristic you are born with, the next question is: Do you \nthink this is the right solution? I must say, I think the sponsors of \nthis legislation, the drafters of this legislation, have done a very \ngood job of trying to draft it in a narrow way so it does solve the \nproblem, because it is a relatively small problem, I will say, Mr. \nPresident. I do think that there is discrimination against gays and \nlesbians in America today. But I do believe employers are increasingly \nsaying it is not a threat at all, it is not a problem, it is a trait, \nand that gay and lesbian employees are not a threat to their business, \nthey are not a threat to the morale of that company and so forth.\n  But, nonetheless, discrimination is occurring. So the drafters of \nthis legislation have gone through and said ENDA does not require an \nemployer to recruit or advertise job offers. ENDA expressly states no \ndisparate impact cases may be made, meaning that discrimination cases \ncannot be made based on statistics alone. ENDA specifically prohibits \nquotas that would compel employers to meet percentages of hiring and \nprovides exemptions for nonprofit religious organizations and the \nmilitary, and ENDA does not require that companies pay benefits for \ndomestic partners.\n  I think this legislation, again, if you support DOMA and you have \nalready reached the conclusion that it is OK to intervene in State \nfamily matters; if you believe homosexuality is a trait that one is \nborn with, it orients just like you do if you are heterosexual, if you \nbelieve it is a trait; and if you are looking for some way, as the \nSenator from Utah is, to narrowly draw a law that will prevent this \nkind of discrimination, I think you can vote no other way than yes on \nwhat I consider to be a very carefully drawn piece of legislation, a \nvery targeted piece of legislation, one that should not provoke a great \nnumber of lawsuits, that does, it seems to me, treat homosexuality \ndifferent from race.\n  It does not provide disparate impact cases be filed. I think it is a \nreasonable piece of legislation. Especially for those who support the \nunderlying bill, it seems to me an easy thing to support, an easy thing \nto vote ``aye'' on. I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, first let me acknowledge the leadership of \nSenator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy has really been, in all these areas of \nhuman rights, a distinguished leader. I really appreciate that \nleadership.\n  I attended a meeting of the Illinois Society last night, people from \nIllinois who live in the Washington, DC, area. We started that meeting \nby saying the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.\n  One of the things that has interested me is how rarely we do \nsomething like that anymore.\n  As part of that Pledge of Allegiance, we said, ``one Nation, under \nGod, indivisible * * *'' Some people want to make it ``one Nation, \nunder God, indivisible,'' except for African-Americans.\n  Some want to make it ``one Nation, under God, indivisible,'' except \nfor Hispanic-Americans.\n  Some people want to make it ``one Nation, under God, indivisible,'' \nexcept for Asian-Americans.\n  Some people want to make it ``one Nation, under God, indivisible,'' \nexcept for people with disabilities.\n  And some people want to make it ``one Nation, under God, \nindivisible,'' except for gays.\n  I think there are a great many people who feel uncomfortable in this \narea. It is a word that Senator Hatch used.\n  Let me comment first on the Defense of Marriage Act and then on the \nlegislation that Senator Kennedy has introduced, of which I am pleased \nto be a cosponsor.\n  The hate crimes bill that I introduced a few years ago, that is now \nlaw, has the FBI keeping track of hate crimes. The greatest number of \nhate crimes are against African-Americans, but if you look at the \nnumbers of people proportionately, the greatest number of hate crimes \nare against gays in our society.\n\n[[Page S9996]]\n\n  The last thing we need to do is to divide America more, and the \nDefense of Marriage Act does that.\n  A great many people do feel uncomfortable, and it is a hidden \nproblem. I grew up in a family where my parents were active in what we \nthen called race relations. I was not aware of this problem at all \nuntil I went into the Army.\n  When I went into the Army, I was assigned to the counterintelligence \ncorps. One of our jobs was to screen people for classified material.\n  Let me add for those who argue about this today, people who were gay \nwere drafted into the Army just as much as anybody who was not gay. For \nthose who do not want to accept gays into the military, if you have a \ndraft and you can be exempt if you are gay, I think we are going to \nhave a lot of gays in our country, people who are going to list that.\n  But I became aware that people could be blackmailed very easily who \nwere homosexual. I gradually became more aware of the problem.\n  I can remember in the House--the Presiding Officer may not have been \nhere at that point--we had a House Member who used to introduce gay-\nbashing legislation, amendments, by the name of Bob Bauman, a \nRepublican Member from Maryland. Then it turned out he was homosexual \nhimself, but he felt compelled to do this.\n  The number of crimes not only against gays, but the number of \nsuicides in this country is a very real problem.\n  I had an experience not too many months ago where a college \nclassmate, a friend I had not seen for some years, stopped by, and as \nyou do when you get together with a college classmate, we talked about \nour families. And he said, ``We had a very emotional experience.'' I \nasked him what it was. He said, ``Our daughter told us she was \nlesbian.'' In the course of it, he said, ``My daughter told me, `You \ndon't think I would choose this.' She said, `I was born this way.' ''\n  Senator Kerrey's comments are apropos. We know now from scientific \nevidence that there is a genetic basis, at least among men--and the \nassumption is this is probably true for women, too--for homosexuality.\n  When I grew up, my father did not take me aside and say, ``Paul, you \nhave to be interested in girls.'' He had to give me other warnings. But \nthere are people who by orientation are interested in people in the \nsame sex. Genetically, they are built that way.\n  If, in this Defense of Marriage Act, we start defining marriage, who \nis to stop the Senator from Massachusetts or the Senator from Kansas or \nthe Senator from Washington from introducing Federal legislation on \ndivorce, for adoptions or other areas? We simply should not be getting \ninto this area.\n  Let me comment on Senator Kennedy's legislation. The statement \nSenator Kennedy put up there that was put out--I am going to mention \nthe company's name, Cracker Barrel--I have not been into a Cracker \nBarrel restaurant since that woman testified, and I am not going to go \ninto one until we pass legislation like this. But her separation notice \nread--let me repeat it again--``This employee is being terminated due \nto a violation of company policy. The employee is gay.'' That was a \nwoman who worked as a cook, very low wages. When she testified before \nour committee, she was working part time cutting firewood.\n  What kind of a society are we building? We have to have opportunity \nfor people. I can remember when we first started talking way back when \nI was in the State legislature, the Fair Employment Practices \nCommission, ``Let's not discriminate against African-Americans or \nJewish-Americans and others,'' and people said, ``Oh.'' They thought, \n``My job is going to be taken away.'' And they were worried about a lot \nof things.\n  It turns out we passed that and we lifted the economy of this Nation \nbecause people were not discriminated against anymore. I notice that \namong the statements that were signed in terms of our practice, Bob \nDole, on April 14, 1994, signed a statement: ``The sexual orientation \nof an individual is not a consideration in the hiring, promoting or \nterminating of an employee in my congressional office.'' What is good \nenough for Bob Dole ought to be good enough for the country.\n  The religious organizations--and I ask unanimous consent, Mr. \nPresident, to have printed in the Record the statement of the United \nMethodist Church, the National Council of the Churches of Christ, The \nAmerican Jewish Community, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in \nAmerica.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         General Board of Church and Society of the United \n           Methodist Church,\n                                Washington, DC, September 3, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the General Board of Church and \n     Society, the social justice advocacy agency of the 9.5 \n     million member United Methodist Church, I strongly urge you \n     support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (S. 932) (ENDA) \n     introduced by Sen. John Chaffee (R-RI) and Sen. Ted. Kennedy \n     (D-MA).\n       The Senate may soon vote on ENDA as an amendment to the \n     Defence of Marriage Act (DOMA). Though the United Methodist \n     Church does not presently have an official position on DOMA, \n     The General Board of Church and Society has consistently and \n     very strongly endorsed the passage of the Employment Non-\n     Discrimination Act into law since its introduction in the \n     U.S. Senate.\n       The Social Principles, the official policy doctrine of the \n     United Methodist Church states, ``Homosexual persons, no less \n     than heterosexual persons are individuals of sacred worth . . \n     . Certain basic human rights and civil liberties are due all \n     persons. We are committed to support those rights and \n     liberties for homosexual persons. We see a clear issue of \n     simple justice in protecting their rightful claims where they \n     have shared material resources, pensions, guardian \n     relationships, mutual powers of attorney, and other such \n     lawful claims typically attendant to contractual \n     relationships which involve shared contributions, \n     responsibilities, and liabilities, and equal protection under \n     law.''\n       If there is anything our agency can do to assist you in \n     securing passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act \n     into law, please don't hesitate to call on me personally or \n     Hilary Shelton the Program Director working on this issue at \n     (202) 488-5658.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                          Thom White Wolf Fassett,\n     General Secretary.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  National Council of the Churches\n\n\n                                         of Christ in the USA,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 23, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Council of \n     Churches, I am writing to endorse S. 932, the Employment Non-\n     Discrimination Act of 1996.\n       The National Council of the Churches of Christ in the \n     U.S.A. is the preeminent expression in the United States of \n     the movement for Christian unity. Its 33 Protestant and \n     Orthodox member communions, to which 52 million people \n     belong, work together and with other church bodies, to build \n     a wide sense of Christian community and to deepen the \n     experience of unity. Our position on this matter is based on \n     policy approved by our General Assembly, whose 400 members \n     are selected by our member communions in numbers \n     proportionate to their size.\n       The National Council of Churches has always held that, as a \n     child of God, every person is endowed with worth and dignity \n     that human judgment cannot set aside. Therefore, evey person \n     is entitled to equal treatment under the law. Discrimination \n     based on any criteria such as race, class, sex, creed, place \n     of national origin, or sexual orientation is morally wrong.\n       Accordingly, the Council would urge you to support the \n     prompt passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act as a \n     manner to protect against such discrimination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                 (Rev. Dr.) Albert M. Pennybacker,\n     Associate General Secretary for Public Policy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                The American Jewish Committee,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: While the American Jewish Committee has taken \n     no position on the Defense of Marriage Act, AJC fully \n     supports the Employment Non-Discrimination Act as an \n     important protection of basic civil rights. We urge you to \n     vote for ENDA as an amendment to the Defense of Marriage Act.\n       ENDA is simple justice. It ensures that employment \n     decisions are based on one's performance and abilities and \n     not on perceptions of an employee's sexual orientation. No \n     ``special rights'' are created. ENDA simply extends the same \n     legal protections from employment discrimination provided to \n     other individuals who have historically been denied equal \n     employment opportunities.\n       The protection of religious liberty is of central \n     importance to the American Jewish Committee. ENDA's broad \n     exemption for religious organizations gives proper regard to \n     this concern. No sectarian institution will be required to \n     violate the religious precepts on which it was founded.\n       ENDA is a crucial protection of civil rights. We urge you \n     to support the amendment that would incorporate ENDA into the \n     Defense of Marriage Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard T.

ENDA would extend \n     Federal employment discrimination protections currently \n     provided based on race, religion, gender, national origin, \n     age and disability to sexual orientation.\n       Therefore, the ELCA continues its support of the Employment \n     Non-Discrimination Act and urges your support of this \n     important initiative to extend employment discrimination \n     protection to all people.\n     Sincerely,\n                                                  Kay S. Dowhower,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. We have to make sure that ours is a society that gives \nopportunity to everyone. I want every page here--I do not care what \nyour sexual orientation or race or religion or what your background \nis--I want you to have every opportunity. I have four grandchildren. I \nwant them to have every opportunity. That is what America is all about, \nand that is what this legislation is about.\n  We need an education. I still need an education. I am not as fully \nfamiliar--in the hearing that we had, I used the phrase ``sexual \npreference,'' and I was told by leaders of the community they prefer \nthe phrase ``sexual orientation'' because ``preference'' indicates \nchoice. And so I am learning.\n  People were not made by God all the same. Some of us have brown hair, \nsome of us red hair, some of us black hair, some blonde. Some were made \nwith a different sexual orientation than most of us have, and we should \nnot deny them employment opportunities. What happened to that cook in \nthat Cracker Barrel restaurant should not happen to any American. That \nis what this legislation is all about, and I support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who yields time?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield as much time as the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma would like to use.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Ten minutes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. First, I wish to compliment the Senator from Kansas for \nher statement and also Senator Hatch for his statement as well.\n  Mr. President, No. 1, I did not expect this debate this morning. This \ndebate is the result of the unanimous-consent agreement that was \nentered into last night. I supported that agreement. So we will be \nvoting on this bill and we will be voting on the Defense of Marriage \nAct on Tuesday. So at least we will be able to bring up and dispose of \ntwo pieces of legislation.\n  I believe the legislation that we are debating this morning called \nENDA, Employment Nondiscrimination Act, introduced by Senator Kennedy \nand others, is a very significant piece of legislation. I happen to \ndisagree with it. I happen to think it is a very dangerous piece of \nlegislation. I am pleased it is not going to be offered as an amendment \nto the Defense of Marriage Act. I perceived it as a killer amendment. \nIn all likelihood, if it had been adopted on the Defense of Marriage \nAct, it would have killed it. So I viewed it as an attempt to defeat \nthe Defense of Marriage Act. So I am pleased that we are at least \nreviewing it or considering it separately.\n  Mr. President, this is not an easy subject to talk about, not an easy \nsubject for most of us, because we do not talk about it very often. We \nare talking about amending the Civil Rights Act and adding sexual \norientation to the list of items now under the Civil Rights Act which \nhave protection.\n  We state under the Civil Rights Act there should be no discrimination \non account of gender, on account of race, on account of your ethnic \nbackground, or disabilities or age or religion, and now if this \namendment becomes law, we would add sexual orientation, and ``sexual \norientation'' would be defined as homosexuality and bisexuality and \nheterosexuality. It actually would elevate homosexuality and \nbisexuality as a protected class under the Civil Rights Act.\n  Many, many people across America, because of their backgrounds--and \nmaybe that background is a Jewish background or Christian background or \nMuslim background--have religious beliefs that homosexuality or \nbisexuality or promiscuity is immoral. To elevate that type of conduct \ninto a protected status or class under the Civil Rights Act I think \nwould be offensive. What would be the result?\n  Senator Kassebaum and Senator Hatch mentioned the fact that it would \ncertainly bring about a lot of litigation. There is no question about \nthat. A lot of individuals and a lot of firms would be sued based on \nsexual orientation claims if this bill becomes law.\n  There are exemptions under the bill, and appropriately so. Do we \nreally want to say that people should be sued because they have \nreligious convictions that go back to the Bible, or go back to their \nMuslim tenets or beliefs or their Koran, all of which say that this \nbehavior is wrong? If they believe that in their hearts, and they do \nnot want to have that conduct in their office or in their place of \nemployment, should they be sued? Now, we are talking about real life \nsituations. I do not doubt that there has been some discrimination, \nunwarranted, in many cases. I do not find that right.\n  I heard somebody say nine States, including the State of \nMassachusetts, have laws that prohibit discrimination on account of \nsexual orientation. Fine, I do not care if each and every State does, \nif that is that State's choice. If 9 States have done it that means 41 \nStates have not. Maybe those 41 States will. They have the right to \nenact such laws. I would not step in their way one iota if the State \nwishes to make that decision. They can reverse it if they do not like \nthat decision. That is their right. To elevate discrimination on \naccount of sexual orientation and make it national and to make it a \nprotected class under the Civil Rights Act I think would be a serious, \nserious mistake and one that we should not do.\n  What would be the result? I mentioned the litigation. What would be \nthe practical result? I think if some organizations said they did not \nwant to have openly gay or homosexual people as role models or mentors \nfor young people--Boy Scouts come to mind; maybe other organizations, \nchurches, then they should not have to hire them. I guess there is an \nexemption for churches and religious organizations that are nonprofit. \nWhere do you draw the line at a church? If you leave church on a Sunday \nmorning at noon, does that mean you are no longer affiliated with the \nchurch? A lot of us think of church as a body of believers and we do \nnot believe it is just a building you attend once a week. If you have \nheartfelt convictions and beliefs should you, once you step out of \nchurch, be forced to hire someone whose sexual orientation offends you? \nWhat about somebody that believes they are part of a body of followers \nof Christ, or maybe of Jewish belief, and tenets that they believe in, \n7 days a week 24 hours a day? Do you have to leave those beliefs at \nhome? Do you have to check those beliefs at the door when you leave \nchurch?\n  There is an exemption for churches. What about a Christian bookstore, \nfor example? A Christian bookstore for profit does not fall under the \nexemption. So here you have a business with very strongly felt \nconvictions, but it is a for-profit Christian bookstore, Jewish \nbookstore, or Muslim bookstore they would be liable to be sued if they \ndid not hire somebody who was openly gay. That may be very \nreprehensible to them and their basic beliefs, yet they can be sued.\n  What about the Boy Scouts? They have had a policy not to have \nhomosexual Scoutmasters and they have been sued--they have been sued \neven without having sexual orientation included under the Civil Rights \nAct, and yet they are in court and have been in court, have spent \nhundreds of thousands of dollars trying to maintain their policy. They \ndo not want to have openly gay homosexuals as their\n\n[[Page S9998]]\n\nScoutmasters and leaders and employees in their organization. Now, \nsexual orientation is not even included in the Civil Rights Act and yet \nthey still have been sued. They have spent hundreds of thousands of \ndollars defending their right to maintain their policy. Under at least \nthe original Kennedy legislation that was introduced that policy would \nhave to be changed or they would be sued.\n  Somebody informed me there was an amendment added in the last couple \nof days to try to correct this. I am not sure it would correct this. \nThey were being sued before consideration of this legislation. My guess \nis they will be sued after this legislation, should it become law. I am \nhopeful and optimistic it will not become law.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 10 minutes\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I am happy to yield 10 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. What about a public school? They have contact with kids. \nThey are not exempt under this legislation, as I understand it.\n  Say you have kids, and a homosexual or bisexual grade school teacher, \nmaybe that is fine in some schools in some districts, because it is \nvery acceptable, but in some areas it might not be.\n  Take, for example, a school board in rural Alabama finds out their \nfifth grade teacher is an open homosexual, or it is well-known that \nthis person is a homosexual, he admitted it to the school board. They \ninquired and he said that he has had relations with lots of people. \nMaybe he is bisexual. This bill covers or protects bisexuals. Maybe he \nhad relations not only with his wife but has several boyfriends or \nsomething like that. The school board says that is not really the type \nof leadership mentor that they want to have in a school official, \ncoach, or somebody who is working with kids. So that is not acceptable \nbehavior.\n  Under this bill, as I see it, the school board could be sued. Maybe \njust the threat of the suit would prohibit the school board from taking \nsuch action. Do we really want to do that? Do we want to interfere with \nthe school boards in rural Alabama, West Virginia, Montana, or Iowa? Do \nwe really want to mandate it? If those States want to do it, more power \nto them, let them do it. But do we really want to give the level of \nprotection, special protection, under the Civil Rights Act--I do not \nthink that is wise--and open that school board up to unbelievable \nlitigation or open that Christian bookstore up to litigation and say, \n``Sorry, you did not fall under the exemptions. You are a for-profit \nChristian bookstore.'' Therefore, tough luck if you do not hire this \nperson even though they might be wearing a T-shirt that says ``I am gay \nand proud of it and let's make love,'' you would have to hire them. You \nare subjected to unbelievable litigation, punitive damages--not just \ncompensatory damage, but punitive damages.\n  Then I heard my colleagues say this bill has no quotas. I read that \nsection. It says there is no quotas. Wait a minute. Under the Civil \nRights Act, the EEOC is charged with enforcing it and they are able to \ncollect data. Senator Hatch mentioned this and he is far more \nknowledgeable than I. They have to collect data. If someone files a \nsuit against a company and says, ``You did not hire me because I was \nopenly gay,'' and that company says, ``Well, that was not the real \nreason why we did not, and we have hired gays in the past.'' And they \nsay, ``Well, how do I prove it?'' You have to prove it. How do you \nprove it? You have to survey your employees to make sure you can stand \nup on your argument and say we do not have that policy, we have never \ndiscriminated against gays. The employer has never asked anybody but \nall of a sudden now somebody came in that was openly gay and you did \nnot hire them and they say that is the reason why you did not hire \nthem, so for your defense you have to prove that you have hired gays in \nthe past.\n  Now you have to survey your employees. You never had to do that \nbefore. Now you have to survey every employee. What is your sexual \norientation? None of your business. Employers do not want to ask that \nquestion. I have employed a lot of people. I have never asked that \nquestion, would not dream of asking that question. Yet now for a \ndefense to prove that you were not discriminating if this should become \nlaw, to prove you were not discriminating on account of sexual \norientation, you are going to have to defend yourself. So now you have \nto prove that you have hired some homosexuals or bisexuals even though \nyou did not even know it, it was not your business, you did not care, \nyou do not want to get involved in their private lives. But to protect \nyourself from this litigation you would have to make those decisions.\n  Let me give you a couple of other examples. In my days as an \nemployer, I had a sales force. Sales people spend a lot of time \ntogether. They go on the road together. They travel together. They go \nto conventions together. They spend weeks together. What if an employer \nfound out this person is a good salesman, has a good reputation, but he \nopenly admits that he is bisexual. Now, that may be fine in some sales \norganizations but in some other sales organizations it will not be very \npopular. It will not be very popular. It will not be very popular with \nsome of the spouses, maybe male and female. If an employer says, \n``Well, no, that person really will not fit into our organization. We \ndo not think we should have promiscuous people in our sales team \nbecause of the time spent away from home, the time and travel, so I \nthink that as a policy we will not do that.''\n  You say, wait a minute, this bill does not protect that. Wait a \nminute, this bill protects homosexuals and bisexuals. The very \ndefinition of bisexual means you are promiscuous. You are having sex \nwith males and females. Bisexuals are protected under this bill. That \nemployer, if you decided not to hire that person because they were \nbisexual, you are on very thin ice. You are going to be sued, and not \nonly sued and required to give the person their job back, but sued for \npunitive damages as well--unbelievable litigation expenses. You could \ngo on. I have a daughter that is a cheerleader. She attends \ncheerleading camp. Now, I thought, wait a minute, that is not school \nand it is for profit, they make money off of it. I actually have a \ndaughter that worked for such a camp, the National Cheerleaders \nAssociation, this summer. A bunch of youngsters worked with a bunch of \nhigh school kids. These kids and their teachers and coaches are \nmentors. Now, maybe the person who owns this company is a Christian, \nmaybe they are not, or maybe they are Jewish. Maybe they have religious \nbeliefs that they would rather not hire openly gay, lesbian, or \nbisexual people as coaches or leaders. Fine. If they have that policy, \nthat personal conviction from their religious background or their \nbeliefs, and they don't want to hire somebody who is openly gay or \nbisexual, or lesbian, so they don't hire them, then somebody might say, \n``Wait a minute, you didn't hire me because I was bisexual; therefore, \nI am going to sue you.''\n  What about the individuals sending those kids to that camp? I think \nthey would have a very legitimate complaint. That employer should not \nbe forced to hire somebody that is bisexual if they feel like they \ndon't want to, and if it would interfere with the role model or image \nthey are trying to portray in their company.\n  What about a day care center? What about that? If somebody says, \nwell--I guess if it is a nonprofit religious-affiliated day care \ncenter, like the First Baptist Day Care Center in South Dakota, they \nwill be exempt. But what if you have one that makes money and they are \nfor profit, but maybe they have a religious affiliation and want to \nhave a real positive family image, and they really don't want to have \nactivist gay, lesbian, or bisexual teachers or employees teaching the \nkids? I am afraid, under this legislation, they could be sued. As a \nmatter of fact, they could be sued. People need to know that.\n  I know a lot of people, when they think of gays and lesbians, they \nthink of individuals they know that are monogamous, and they are great \nemployees, super people to work with, very productive. I know that. But \nthere are also a lot of very active people, who work to pursue an \nactivist agenda, and they would like to use the courts, as they have in \nmany ways, to pursue their agenda. That is the reason why they are \nsuing the Boy Scouts. That is the reason why they have sued in the \nState of Hawaii. We will talk about\n\n[[Page S9999]]\n\nthat on Tuesday, to try to define marriage, and about allowing same-sex \npartners.\n  So there are many people who are very active who use the courts and, \nin some cases, abuse the courts, to pursue a very radical agenda.\n  I am afraid this legislation, if we add sexual orientation to the \nCivil Rights Act, will help them a lot. We have elevated what many, \nmany people believe, because of their religious convictions in their \nheart, to be immoral acts--we will have elevated that to a protected \nspecial status under the Civil Rights Act if we add sexual orientation \ndefined as homosexual, heterosexual, and bisexual. If we add that to \nthe Civil Rights Act, Mr. President, I think we are making a serious \nmistake. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment on Tuesday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time could I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 27 minutes \n17 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Would it be possible to have about 10 minutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this legislation. It might \nbe useful for this body to know a little bit of my background with this \nkind of legislation.\n  Twenty-five years ago, I was a new president of the San Francisco \nBoard of Supervisors, and I drafted legislation to amend the human \nrights ordinance of that city and county to prohibit discrimination in \nboth housing and employment on the basis of sexual orientation. To my \nknowledge, it was the first such legislation ever introduced in a major \ncity and county anywhere in the United States.\n\n  Well, I served as supervisor for 9 years, and then as mayor for 9 \nyears. During that period of time, I never, ever had a single complaint \nabout that legislation--not one. It was the first in the Nation, and it \nwas difficult to pass; people did not understand it. Some said, ``Is \nthis special treatment?'' Answer: No. ``Does this convey some \nadditional right that no one else has?'' Answer: No. It's pure and \nsimple, as this legislation is pure and simple.\n  What this legislation says is that you cannot be denied employment \nbecause you may be gay or straight. It does not say you are protected \nagainst inappropriate conduct in any way, shape, or form. I think this \nis a key point. Is it inappropriate conduct for anybody to be kissing \non their job as a waiter or waitress? The answer is, yes, it is \ninappropriate conduct, regardless of whether they are gay or straight. \nThe same thing goes for clothing. If it is inappropriate to wear \ncertain things in the workplace, this is true whether you are gay or \nwhether you are straight.\n  So a lot of the hobgoblins that are expressed by the other side that \nthis will open the world to all kinds of inappropriate activity, in my \nview, based on 25 years of watching a piece of legislation that I \nauthored, which was passed, which I presided over as mayor of the city, \nis simply not correct.\n  There was not one complaint from any major corporation or minor \ncorporation, major business or minor business, major employer or minor \nemployer in the city and county of San Francisco, to my knowledge, in \nthe last 25 years. These are major corporations like Bechtel, major \ncorporations like McKesson, major corporations like Wells Fargo Bank, \nmajor corporations like the Bank of America, who have operated with \nthis legislation intact in the city and county of San Francisco for the \npast 25 years, without a problem.\n  I believe that will be true for the rest of the Nation. This bestows \nno quota, no special privilege, no exemption from any law or rule or \ncode of conduct anywhere. It simply says, based on the fact that you \nmay be gay or lesbian, you cannot be denied employment.\n  But act inappropriately and it all changes. Do something that is \nimproper conduct, and it all changes. But just because of who you may \nbe, you simply cannot be denied employment. It seems to me that that is \na pretty basic right that everybody has, regardless of their race, \ntheir religion, their creed, their color. Just because I am black, \ndon't deny me employment. Just because I am Hispanic, don't deny me \nemployment. But if I act inappropriately for the job, if I dress \ninappropriately for the job, or if I, in any way, create problems, then \nit is a different story. But not just because of who I am, because I \ncan't help who I am. That is the message of this legislation.\n  Let me give you two cases, two specific cases. William Ballou began \nworking as a waiter in a Fremont, CA, restaurant in September 1991. \nWithin 6 months, he had received both a promotion to assistant manager \nand a glowing letter of recommendation by the franchise owners of the \nrestaurant.\n  But other waiters, some bartenders, and the restaurant manager \nfrequently made antigay remarks, even urging servers to rush gay \npatrons, because, they were told, ``this is a family restaurant.'' \nAfter one particularly hurtful confrontation with the manager, Ballou \ntold the franchise owners about this harassment. He was then fired due \nto ``personality conflicts.'' We see this pattern of harassment \nfollowed by firing all too often.\n  Sometimes the discriminatory firing is even more blatant. One woman, \nTracie Cleverly, worked for many months at a Salt Lake City franchise \nof a well-known restaurant chain. Her coworkers and manager were aware \nthat she was a lesbian, but this didn't affect her prospects or her \nwork environment. She received good work reviews, and her manager soon \nstarted her in training to be a supervisor.\n  Unfortunately, her understanding manager resigned, and a new person \ncame to work his first day with a list of people to be fired, including \nall of the gay and lesbian workers in the restaurant. And he simply \nsaid, ``I don't want these kinds of people working here.''\n  We are not asking for special rights in this legislation. All we are \nsaying is that simply because someone may be gay or straight, no more \nthan someone may be black or Catholic or Jewish or Spanish or American \nIndian, or anything else, just because of who they are they should not \nbe discriminated against.\n  I have listened to some of the comments on this floor about \ninappropriate action and special privilege, and none of this is \nencompassed in this legislation. It is clean, it is pure, and it is \nsimple. And it is just directed at persons themselves. Once that person \nbegins to do certain things, it may be a different story. Inappropriate \nconduct, once again, is inappropriate conduct, whether you be gay or \nstraight. I think that is a very important point to get across.\n  So I would like to commend the Senator from Massachusetts. It is my \nbelief that this freestanding bill provides the same remedies permitted \nunder title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Americans With \nDisabilities Act.\n  This is a big country. It is a democratic country. I think every \nMember of this body believes that no one should be prevented from \nobtaining a job because of their race, creed, color, sex, and I hope \nsexual orientation will be added to that.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to yield 15 minutes to \nthe Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, very much, Mr. President, and I thank the \nSenator from Kansas for the opportunity to speak on this important \nissue. It is an important issue, and I think her remarks earlier about \nthe legal difficulties that are encountered whenever you have the kind \nof potential for punitive damages and have the kind of framework that \nwould allow legal challenges on decisions made by business people--\nthose were very important points on this matter. I commend her for \nmaking those points.\n  I also want to commend Senator Hatch for his important discussion of \nthese issues, and Senator Nickles who raised components of \nconsideration here which I think have yet to be raised and ought to be \nraised.\n  I would like to make a few observations about what it is we do when \nwe seek to enact legislation like this and the kind of signals we send \nand what the public interest is in terms of this kind of legislation.\n  First of all, I have to say that I have no intention nor desire to \ninflict any\n\n[[Page S10000]]\n\nkind of burden or difficulty upon individuals in our culture who are \nhomosexuals. I have worked with homosexuals in various \nresponsibilities. When I served as Governor of the State of Missouri I \nlearned that several of the individuals in the administration were \nhomosexuals and had done outstanding work. Unfortunately, several of \nthose individuals with whom I worked and whom I respected met a very \nearly death, in part as a result of the practice, I believe, of their \nlifestyle, and it is a tragedy. My sympathy has always been for them \nand to their families. In one case we had to transfer a worker to be \nmore proximate to medical attention and care because of the challenges \nthat he faced.\n\n  So it is not a matter in terms of my own situation of wanting to \nincrease the burden or otherwise make difficult the lives of \nindividuals who have a homosexual lifestyle. As a matter of fact, that \nis already a real challenge.\n  I want to point out that in everything we do in government we teach. \nWe send signals. We say what is good and what is bad. We encourage some \nthings. We discourage others. President Clinton has decided to send a \nsignal about cigarette smoking. He has basically said that, because \nsmoking cigarettes can curtail your life expectancy anywhere between \n2.1 and 12.2 years, that he is going to be aggressive in communicating \nto this culture that you should not start smoking. It is bad for you. \nIt will hurt you. It will shorten your lifespan. There are some of us \nin this Chamber who would disagree with the way in which the President \nis trying to send that signal. Some of us would question whether or not \nwe ought to assign to the FDA--the Food and Drug Administration, an \nagency which is already overburdened and which is struggling to do \nminimally acceptably its current task--the substantial new task of \nregulating tobacco. But I think all of us agree that the right signal \nis that smoking is bad for you and that it is injurious to your health. \nSmoking is obviously a choice. But we are trying to send a signal about \nwhat we believe and that this Government does not want to encourage you \nto smoke.\n  I believe when we consider enacting legislation that gives special \nstanding to a particular category of conduct, that sends a signal that \nsays that that conduct is to be elevated, it is to be approved, it is \nsomehow to have special privilege, then we have to be careful about \nwhat we are doing.\n  There is a debate about whether or not people who are homosexuals are \nborn that way or are genetically programmed that way or that it perhaps \nis a conduct which they acquire or which they develop. Frankly, I \ncannot say for sure from a personal perspective that there is no way \nthat there could be individuals who are genetically predisposed. I \ncan't make that determination. I do know that there are thousands of \nformer homosexuals, individuals who once were engaged in a homosexual \nlifestyle, who have changed that lifestyle and have repudiated it and \nfind themselves to be engaged in heterosexual lifestyles.\n  So it is clear to me that, while there may be a genetic base for the \nactivity in some respects, it is clear that it is an activity of choice \nin other respects and that it is a choice which can be made and unmade.\n  I think when we as a government are signaling an approval, or an \nelevation, of a lifestyle, we have to ask ourselves to what extent are \nwe suggesting to individuals in the culture that they ought to adopt \nit.\n  I am worried about youngsters in our society. I think there are times \nwhen young men are unsure about themselves when they are in transition, \nwhen they have identified perhaps more with their mothers than with \ntheir fathers, and they move from boyhood to manhood. Those are \ncritical times when role models are very important. I think Senator \nNickles was on target when he said that we have to be careful of who we \nhave in the Boy Scouts. I commend the sponsors of this legislation for \nexempting the Boy Scouts. The sponsors also exempt the military, \nbecause I think they recognize the fact that there are sensitive \npositions where we understand that we wouldn't be confident in having \nthis elevated standing for homosexuals in regard to positions in the \nmilitary. Colin Powell made it clear when he stood by the gay ban in \nthe military. He said, ``Skin color is a benign, nonbehavioral \ncharacteristic.'' He said that to distinguish it from homosexual \nactivity. ``Sexual orientation is perhaps the most profound of human \nbehavioral characteristics.'' It is a matter of conduct. Sex is not a \nmatter of conduct. It is a matter of configuration. It is the way in \nwhich we are made. Sexual orientation, according to Colin Powell, is a \nmatter of conduct.\n  I think we ought to be careful of what we are supporting as a \ngovernment. We should be wary of telling young people that you will \nhave a higher standing, you will have a greater durability on the job, \nit will be more difficult to fire you, you are likely to have a cause \nof action if someone fails to hire you, you can sue someone for failing \nto hire you if you can allege that you are a homosexual--you will not \nbe able to do that, if you have ordinary sexual orientation.\n  Senator Nickles, in talking about young people, stated something \nwhich I believe; that is, in hiring schoolteachers, or camp counselors, \nor those who deal with young people, you never just hire a teacher.\n  You are always hiring more than a teacher. You are hiring a role \nmodel. I cannot think of a single teacher in my past who was simply a \nteacher to me. Whether he or she liked it or not, that teacher was a \nrole model. And I think those who operate organizations that have \nsituations like that are appropriately exempted in this legislation. \nBut this exemption should be much broader in this bill. As a matter of \nfact, to deprive employers of the ability to make those kinds of \njudgments--as this bill does--in my view, is unwise. I think this bill \nsends a signal that this is an elevated status. I do not think that is \nthe right signal to send to the next generation.\n  We all know that in practice, dismissal of individuals who are on the \nprotected class lists in the civil rights laws is very, very difficult.\n  I believe we ought to have a civil rights law to protect against \ndiscrimination based upon race and sex. But I remember a situation when \nI was Governor of Missouri in which one man operating a laundry fired a \nblack woman from the laundry. She was one of seven black women working \nin the laundry. She was replaced by a black woman. But she sued \nalleging that she was fired because she was discriminated against on \nthe basis of both race and sex. I remember that the operator of that \nparticular laundry spent a substantial amount of money defending \nagainst that kind of suit.\n  The truth of the matter is that the establishment of protected \nclasses makes much more difficult the ability of anyone to even use \ngood judgment in hiring and firing because there is always this threat \nof litigation. The threat of litigation here is not inconsequential. It \nis not minimal. It is not small. When you get to the place of offering \nthe potential for punitive damages for violation of these kinds of \nitems, you get into astronomical figures.\n  Shell Oil Co. had a company policy that said it would only use on-\nthe-job activities as the basis for hiring and firing. That is kind of \nwhat this law really sets up, saying, we will not allow sexual \norientation to be used as the basis for that. Shell found that one of \nits employees was using the company copier to produce and copy a flier \nadvertising a safe sex party for homosexual men. It said that is not \nwhat we want our company to be standing for, that is not what we want \nto be doing. It fired the individual. A California court fined Shell \nOil $5.3 million for dismissing the executive. It provided that kind of \na penalty.\n  This is the kind of intimidation that occurs, especially when you are \nin the universe of the macro damages that we frequently see in \nlitigation these days.\n  This is not the kind of thing we want to invite into our businesses. \nSenator Nickles has said very clearly it is not the kind of thing we \nwant to invite into camps for children, into the schools. This law \nprovides a distinction, saying that if schools are religious schools or \nnonprofit schools, they do not have to abide by it. I think that is \nright. They understand that there are many legitimate objectives of \nschools that would be impaired substantially by this. But is the \nobjective of a profitmaking school different than\n\n[[Page S10001]]\n\na nonprofit school? Are the children who go to the school that makes a \nprofit providing the services any less to be protected than the \nchildren who go to a school that is nonprofit?\n  Are the role model considerations any different if the organization \nmakes a profit than if the organization does not make a profit?\n  If it is my child, do I somehow feel differently because the \nexecutive director of the school is a nonprofit guy earning $100,000 a \nyear driving a nonprofit-provided vehicle, BMW, or a fledgling profit-\nseeking institution where the guy is barely eking out a living for his \nfamily and he is driving a Chevy?\n  The big distinction in the legislation is one of a profitmaking \ninstitution and one a nonprofit institution. For Heaven's sake, I do \nnot care whether they are making a profit. What I care about is what is \nhappening in the outcome. If it is a school that is dealing with young \npeople, if there is a legitimate reason to say that the Boy Scouts \nshould not have to abide by this and the nonprofits should not have to \nabide by this, why do we impose it on the rest of the world?\n\n  If there is a legitimate reason why the U.S. military in the national \ninterest is exempted from this, why is it that it needs to be imposed \non the rest of the world?\n  If it is a legitimate reason to protect the individuals who have the \nright resources and can send their kids to a nonprofit private school \nfrom this proposed law, why is it that the public schools cannot have \nthese same kinds of opportunities to say that we want to send the right \nsignals; we want to hire more than a teacher; we want to hire a role \nmodel, recognizing that there may be some who at a tender age would be \ndirected by the role modeling that takes place by teachers and by \nleaders in scouts and informal organizations and activities. Maybe we \nwould just like to say that even people in the public sector ought to \nbe able to have that right, the school district ought to be able to \nhave that right. It is not as if these things do not happen. And there \nare things that you wonder about.\n  Recently, here in the northern Virginia area, there was the young \nboys' gym teacher who had been making the gay pornographic videos and \nwas discovered to be leading a dual life. On the west coast he was the \ngay porno video star; on the east coast he was the gym teacher. That is \nnot activity that is perhaps relevant or particularly associated with \nhis school duties, but if my children were in the school I would want \nto think we would have the opportunity to look carefully at that and \nperhaps make a judgment that this was not the right kind of role model.\n  In all that we do in Government, we teach. I believe when we say that \nsomething is to be preferred----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 15 minutes of the Senator from Missouri \nhave expired.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would be happy to yield 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I do not think I need but about 2 minutes to close.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Whatever time.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I just believe there are areas in this bill that \nrecognize there are legitimate concerns and they throw out a bone here \nand a bone there--a bone to the Boy Scouts if the Boy Scouts are \ncovered. I am not sure they are. A bone to the religious schools or to \nthe not-for-profit schools but not to the other schools, a bone to the \nArmed Forces because I guess we do not want to impair the defense of \nthe country but maybe we are willing to put into jeopardy the future of \nthe country. In my view, it is clear that the signal we send in this \nbill is the wrong signal. It contains seeds of real instability and \ninappropriate activity, seeds of litigation which could grow way out of \nhand and send the wrong signals to young people and provide a special \nstanding and class--not based upon existence and construction but upon \nconduct. Not based upon sex but upon sexual activity.\n  I thank the Senator from Kansas for the time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2056, the \nEmployment Nondiscrimination Act. It has been noted on the floor that \nwe are in an honorable succession here, from legislation that has very \nmuch defined this period in American national life. We begin with the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, in which the prohibition against \ndiscrimination based on color was extended to include discrimination \nbased on sex. That was part of the calculation of opponents of the \nlegislation. In the end, both prevailed, with large consequences to our \nsociety.\n  I should think each of us, or almost all of us in the Senate, have \nbeen to one or the other of the national conventions of our parties, \nand have seen an extraordinary range of persons, men and women, black \nand white, Hispanic and thus-and-so. I do not know how many would \nrecall how strikingly different this would have been, say 40 years ago, \nwhen I had the opportunity to be part of the Democratic Convention in \nthe city of Chicago. Seeing photographs and films of it today, you see \na different world. It has been changed, and for the better, and \nagreeably, by legislation enacted on this Senate floor.\n  The time to extend the prohibition against discrimination based on \nsexual preference, as the usage is, is surely at hand. For my part, I \nintroduced legislation that would address this matter in terms of \nemployment in 1979. Then, in 1985, this legislation was first \nintroduced. I was a cosponsor. It could scarcely have been said to come \nabout precipitously. It is 11 years, if you like; 17 years, if you \nprefer, that we have been discussing it.\n  The simple proposition before us is that no person should be denied \ncivil rights because of his or her affectional or sexual orientation. \nFederal guarantees against discriminatory practices in employment, \nhousing, public accommodations, and federally funded programs should \nextend to all citizens. At least, that is how I read the due process \nclauses of the 5th and 14th amendments, the equal protection clause of \nthe 14th amendment, and the right to privacy implied in the 4th and 5th \namendments.\n  The legislation does not condone any particular course of conduct. It \nsimply affords all American citizens equal protection under the law. It \nis narrowly drafted to prevent an explosion of litigation. The bill \nwould not apply to the U.S. Armed Forces or to religious organizations. \nThe bill would not affect marriage, adoption, or child custody laws, \nall of which are determined individually by the States. And the \nlegislation makes clear that preferential treatment and quotas are \nprohibited, and that no claims will be permitted based upon \nunderrepresentation in a particular work force.\n  That randomness is to be expected in our society and encouraged, in \nthe sense that people seek what they feel to be the best outlet for \ntheir opportunities. It is discrimination that we oppose, which we have \nlegislated against for a generation now. And, as we look about us, we \nlook at the consequences: a degree of acceptance such that you would \nnever know the resistance of a generation ago. You would never know how \nfierce the opposition was to that which we could not imagine doing \nwithout today.\n  I think this will be the case with the legislation before us. I am \nproud to cosponsor it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes and 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and I thank my friend from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. President, If I might begin with what may seem like an elevated, \nbut I think is an accurate, vision of what our work here is as \nlawmakers, I was trained to believe the law is the expression of our \nvalues. It is the way we take our values as a society and put them into \na code. It is, in some sense, an expression of our aspirations, our \nhopes for ourselves and our society. Because we are imperfect beings \nand we are an imperfect society, we do not always live up to our best \naspirations as expressed in the law for ourselves.\n  In that same sense, the fundamental principles of our country, of our \ndemocracy, expressed in the Constitution, were a series of values that \nover\n\n[[Page S10002]]\n\nour history we have realized. We were far from perfect from the \nbeginning, we are far from perfect today, we will be far from perfect \neven if we pass the nondiscrimination act, which I rise to support, but \nin each case we have tried to make real, according to current \ncircumstances, the values expressed in our Constitution.\n  Here, today, I think we are taking--if we can bring together the \nsupport for this measure--a next logical step in extending the \nguarantee of nondiscrimination in employment to people, based on their \nsexual orientation.\n  I go back to the source of all our rights as expressed in the \nDeclaration of Independence. We did not base these rights on any \npolitical philosopher's thinking. We did not base them on the report of \nsome committee constituted for the formulation of basic rights. We did \nnot base them, certainly, on any piece of legislation. It says right \nthere at the outset that all of us are given these rights--are endowed \nwith these rights by our Creator: The rights to life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness. Over the 220 years of our history we have come to \nextend that further and further, appropriately, to groups that were not \nincluded at the outset: People of color, women, et cetera, et cetera.\n  What I want to suggest today is that those who are homosexual are \nalso God's children. I say to my colleagues who may have strong \npersonal feelings about this, one does not have to accept \nhomosexuality, one does not even have to accept its morality, if I can \nspeak in very direct terms, to support this legislation. Going back to \nthe source of all our rights in this country, one simply has to \nacknowledge that those who are homosexual are also God's children and \ndeserve to be protected from unfairness in our society, particularly \nfrom unfairness and discrimination based on sexual orientation in the \nworkplace.\n  Because what is the driving impulse of this country, that brought my \ngrandparents here, brought so many here? Yes, it was religious freedom, \nbut it was the basic promise that, in America, if you play by the rules \nand work hard, there is no limit to what you can achieve. That is what \ntitle VII is all about. That is what the antidiscrimination in \nemployment laws are all about.\n  What this measure says is very simple but very profound, and in my \nopinion goes to the heart of what America is about. If you are \nhomosexual and you work hard and play by the rules, you cannot be \ndiscriminated against in hiring, in the status of your employment, in \nthe level of your compensation, in promotion. To me, that seems like a \nstatement of a basic American mainstream value of fairness.\n\n  This is now a separate measure before us, a freestanding bill. \nOriginally, though I cosponsored it as a freestanding bill, we were \ngoing to introduce it as an amendment to the Defense of Marriage Act. I \nintend to support the Defense of Marriage Act because I think that \naffirms another basic American mainstream value, which is marriage as \nan institution. The traditional, time-tested vision, occasionally \nbattered but now being restored, hopefully, of marriage as an \ninstitution between a man and a woman, the best institution to raise \nchildren in our society. But I worry, even though I view the Defense of \nMarriage Act as an affirmative statement, that we may send the wrong \nmessage in adopting it, that it is motivated by antihomosexual bigotry. \nI think that perception is wrong, certainly among the great majority of \nmy colleagues that I have talked to who are supporting DOMA.\n  The best way to make that clear is with another affirmative \nstatement, and that is to adopt the Employment Nondiscrimination Act \nand say: Let us be fair. Let us say to everybody in our country that if \nyou play by the rules, if you work hard, if you contribute to this \nsociety, you cannot be punished because of a private decision you have \nmade about your sexual orientation.\n  I think this is a moment that is historic. Not just in that we are \ndebating this measure on the floor. It is historic in that it embraces \nthe best values that are part of American history.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a fresh look at this, to look at how \nlimited it is, how much it excludes quotas, disparate impact, religious \norganizations. And in the fullness of their heart and in the fullness \nof their belief in the American dream, vote for the Employment \nNondiscrimination Act.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for the \nlegislation offered by my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts. I am an original cosponsor of the Employment \nNondiscrimination Act.\n  Mr. President, this Nation is in debt to the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts for his consistent and unwavering stance on expanding \ncivil rights for all Americans. For decades, he has fought resolutely \nagainst all forms of discrimination and, for that, the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts and this country are richer places. I share his \nconviction that, as public servants, we must do all we can to secure, \nensure and uphold civil rights for all sectors of American society.\n  As any resident of Massachusetts knows, the entire Kennedy family has \nshaped the latter half of the 20th century with progressive public and \nsocial policy. This legacy is so profound in our State that we have all \nbeen touched by the generosity and vision of the Kennedy family.\n  Mr. President, when I was first sworn in as a U.S. Senator in 1985, I \nauthored the gay and lesbian civil rights bill. At that time, only five \nother Senators would join me as cosponsors of that legislation. In the \nlast session of Congress, I testified before the Armed Services \nCommittee to lift the ban on gay men and lesbians serving in the \nmilitary.\n  I agree with Senator Kennedy that ENDA is a solution to a serious \nproblem. I have heard stories from many Americans who have suffered \ndiscrimination in the workplace because of their sexual orientation. It \nis time for these Americans to have recourse against blatant \ndiscrimination, just as Americans who are fired on the basis of their \nreligion, national origin, or gender. Massachusetts is one of the \nStates which has recognized the problems of anti-gay and lesbian \ndiscrimination in the workplace and already has an ENDA-like law.\n  Mr. President, last year, I joined 65 of our colleagues in signing a \npledge that I would not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation \nin hiring, promotion and firing. Like the majority of our colleagues, \nsigning this pledge came easy to me. I have always had openly gay and \nlesbian staff and they have served the people of Massachusetts with \neffective and committed distinction.\n  I urge our colleagues to live up to the pledge they signed and \nsupport this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe I have 6 minutes left. I yield \nmyself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I want to address, albeit briefly, some of the points \nthat have been raised over the course of the morning.\n  First of all, why ENDA should be a national law. The National \nGovernment has a duty to set national standards of fairness and \nequality. Not all matters are appropriate for Federal legislation, but \nover the past 35 years, we have recognized that the protection of civil \nrights is a basic Federal duty.\n  Americans are increasingly mobile. They move from State to State. \nThey work for employers with offices in different States and frequently \ntransfer from office to office, and they should be free from unjust \ndiscrimination as they travel across the country.\n  The Federal Government has a duty to protect interstate commerce, and \nthis deals with employment. It does not tell anyone who to be friendly \nwith, but it does say that with respect to employment, which is the \nheart of this legislation, gay Americans will be protected from overt, \ndirect, and outrageous discrimination. That is it.\n  Mr. President, we have heard the discussions about the Boy Scouts and \nabout religious organizations. Regarding the case dealing with the Boy \nScouts, we are dealing with an individual Boy Scout who refused to \npledge allegiance to God, and he was an atheist. That issue was brought \nto the courts and was decided by the courts that the Boy Scouts are a \nprivate organization. That young person lost the case.\n  This legislation follows what has been declared by the courts in \nterms of private organizations.\n\n[[Page S10003]]\n\n  Another question arose regarding religious organizations, profit and \nnonprofit, and whether this legislation should differentiate. We \nclearly draw the distinction between profit and nonprofit, because we \ndraw the distinction as we have in other civil rights laws in \nprotecting religious liberty and religious rights.\n  The nonprofit business is generally considered to be one which is \nmore directly associated with religious teachings and with religious \ndoctrines. The for profit are more secular in nature. That has been the \ndefinition which has been defined by the IRS. It is the same with \nregard to this particular issue as well. This does not bring up a whole \nnew set of questions.\n  But beyond all this, Mr. President, I want to conclude with the \nunderlying issues that were brought up by those who have spoken out \nagainst this legislation this morning.\n  Basically, we heard what is going to be the message to the young \npeople of this country. Our message is that you should not \ndiscriminate; you should not be part of bigotry in this Nation. That is \nthe underlying theme of this legislation. We are talking about \ndiscrimination and bigotry.\n  This Nation has fought its way through on discrimination on bigotry, \non race and gender, and disabilities, and we are saying we ought to be \nable to go to the next step with regard to gays and lesbians. That is \nthe issue, not providing additional special privilege to a lifestyle. \nWe are talking about discrimination on the basis of bigotry in our \nsociety.\n  Mr. President, I was around here not that long ago when we were \nmaking progress on eliminating discrimination. A number of years ago, \nwhen we were talking about knocking down the walls of discrimination on \nrace, some said, ``Well, blacks don't work hard.'' ``Blacks are lazy.'' \n``Blacks aren't competent.'' ``They're different.'' ``Why do we need to \nprovide any kind of protection for them?''\n  Well, we did. We do not even hear a dispute about that particular \nissue at this time.\n  Then we had the issue about protecting women. ``Women are weak.'' \n``Women belong in the home.'' ``Women are not smart enough.'' ``Why \nshould women be involved in athletics?''\n\n  We passed title IX, and we all celebrated when they got gold medals \nin basketball and softball. And so the success of our magnificent women \nOlympians, our gymnasts and others in these last Olympic Games makes us \nproud. No one is making those arguments anymore.\n  We have seen the discrimination on the basis of mental illness. Last \nnight, we took an important step that we had been unwilling to take \nuntil now in saying, at least in part, that mental illness is not a \nstigma and, in many cases, it is as serious as cancer and heart \ndisease.\n  It ought to be considered that way. We took a partial step last \nnight. We freed ourselves from the old cliches that there is something \nstrange about people who have mental illness. We have done the same \nwith people who have disabilities. We took steps to do it. We do not \nhear it today on the floor of the United States that those are now all \nmistakes. Now everybody agrees with those.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 more minute remaining, and \nthe Senator from Kansas has 17\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for 5 minutes more.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I have no problem extending the time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, now we have the stereotyping of gays and \nlesbians as child molesters; everyone who is gay can't wait to get \ntheir hands on a young child. And we are stereotyping it for one more \ntime.\n  I thought we knew better than that. Some Members start out with the \nspeeches, ``Well, I know gays and lesbians, and they are wonderful \npeople, but do we really want them around our children?''\n  We know we have laws out there with regard to molestation and about \nviolating children, whether they are homosexual or heterosexual. We \nknow, quite frankly, that in any State school system, they provide the \nsame kind of dress codes for heterosexuals, gays or lesbians. Those \nwill be enforced. We know if a gay man or lesbian appears in a \npornographic movie, they will be fired, and so should a heterosexual.\n  Nonetheless, we hear those voices out here saying, ``Well, there is \nsomething really off on all these individuals,'' again playing to the \nstereotype.\n  Mr. President, when we play to that, we are perpetuating bigotry. It \nis mean-spirited, it is a cheap shot--cheap shot.\n  But we are going to hear more of it during the continuing debate on \nanything to do with gays and lesbians or anyone with HIV. You are going \nto hear cheap shots, and those are in the spirit of intolerance, which \ndivides America and creates an atmosphere that I believe encourages \ndiscrimination in this country. We are trying to free ourselves from \ndiscrimination and prejudice and bigotry and free ourselves from that \nkind of stereotyping which just adds to it.\n  That is basically what this is about. It is not about penalties. It \nis not about proliferation of court cases. It is not about statistics. \nWe have addressed those issues, and we will provide additional \ninformation on Monday afternoon.\n  There is a more fundamental and basic question. It is whether we are \ngoing to be a nation that is going to be mean-spirited and stereotype \nour fellow citizens, or whether we are going to say that we are going \nto free ourselves on the issue of discrimination in the workplace. That \nan individual who wants to work and can do the job is going to be able \nto hold that job and not be fired because they are gay. We must end the \ntradition of viciousness and discrimination directed toward gays and \nlesbians.\n  I hope we will pass this legislation. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, while the proponents of this bill have \ntried to minimize the potential impact of the bill, the fact is that, \nif it passes, the public and private employers of America subject to \ntitle VII will face the juggernaut of the Federal enforcement \nmachinery. Anyone who contends that this bill will not result in a \nlitigation boom is not paying attention to the caseloads at the EEOC \nand Department of Justice.\n  Let me say, once again, that equating opposition to this bill with \nopposition to civil rights measures for racial and ethnic minorities \nand women is totally unfair and serves only to divert attention away \nfrom the ramifications of the bill before us, which I described in my \nopening remarks. Moreover, it equates conduct with immutable \ncharacteristics. I think General Powell's comments, which I also cited \nearlier, on this equation are well worth considering.\n  Some proponents of this bill bundle off concern by parents and \neducators about role models in the schools as nothing more than \nbigotry. But no answer was voiced to the examples I mentioned earlier \nabout a heterosexual male teacher publicly displaying physical \naffection for a spouse or girlfriend, and a homosexual teacher publicly \ndisplaying physical affection for a male partner. Should Congress force \na school district to treat both teachers the same? The proponents of \nthe bill say yes. I say no.\n  The supporters of the bill can offer bland assurances about whether \nthe bill authorizes the EEOC to collect data on the sexual orientation \nof an employer's employees. They can claim the bill does not talk about \nstatistics, but that is very misleading because the bill cross \nreferences title VII in so many ways. Section 11(a)(1) of the bill \ngives the EEOC ``the same powers as [it] has to administer and enforce \ntitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. * * *'' Under title VII, the \nEEOC requires a number of employers to provide data on the race, \nethnicity, and gender of employees. Therefore, this bill empowers the \nEEOC to require employers to provide data on the sexual orientation of \nemployees, plain and simple. And, these statistics and evidence of so-\ncalled underrepresentation can be used in cases of intentional \ndiscrimination.\n  With respect to this bill's incorporation by reference of title VII's \nremedial scheme, including section 706(g) of title VII, see section \n11(a)(5), I say again that the Supreme Court has allowed courts to \nimpose preferences as remedies in some cases until title VII. The\n\n[[Page S10004]]\n\ncourts will have the same power under this bill. The Attorney General's \nability to enter into consent decrees which encompass preferences, \nalong with the ability of private parties to do so, under title VII has \nbeen set forth in Supreme Court precedent, however much some of us may \ndisagree with those decisions. This bill provides for the same results. \n[Sections 11(a)(4) and 11(b)].\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I yield the Senator from Georgia 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the proposal \nbefore the Senate that is offered by the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts. I think he could find it in himself to concur that a \nperson that might be opposed to this does not necessarily constitute \nmean-spiritedness. I think that my record as an employer and as a \ndirector of a Federal agency would suggest otherwise. And I do not \nthink the discourse over the matter should bring itself to people \nbeing, for or against it, mean-spirited or vicious or whatever.\n  I believe this act sets the stage for an enormous expansion of \nFederal power over employers. The bill virtually guarantees an \navalanche of costly litigation which could hurt small businesses most \nof all. The bill forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual \norientation, which it defines to mean homosexuality, bisexuality, or \nheterosexuality, whether such orientation is real or perceived.\n  No one knows what this language means. This definition is brand new \nin the law. Lawyers are going to litigate over what constitutes \nhomosexuality, or heterosexuality, bisexuality. The bill does not make \nthese terms clear. And until they are clear, employers are in danger of \nbeing sued and face enormous claims for damages and Government \ninterference in running their businesses.\n  The bill gives the EEOC, the Attorney General, and the Federal courts \npower to impose fines and issue decrees having to do with sexual \norientation. Supporters say this bill will not lead to quotas for \nhomosexuals. But we have heard this before. And we are in a national \ndebate about affirmative action and quotas and the like.\n  The Supreme Court is having to struggle with these very issues at \nthis moment. This bill is based on and tied to the provisions and \nremedies of title VII of the Civil Rights Act. It gives the courts the \nsame powers in regard to discrimination on the basis of sexuality that \nthey have in the area of race. Even laying aside the question of \nwhether you can equate homosexuality with race or should, look at the \nresults.\n\n  In the area of race discrimination, we have seen the imposition by \ncourts and bureaucrats of racial quotas. We will see the same thing if \nthis bill passes, creating a special, protected class of citizens in \nAmerica with quotas and even reverse discrimination based on sexuality. \nThis bill makes sexuality an issue where it has never been an issue \nbefore.\n  Currently, most employers, gratefully, do not know about their \nemployees' sexual orientation and do not care, and should not. This \nbill will put an end to that, disrupting the privacy of employees and \nemployer-employee relations. At a time when we are, as a society, \nquestioning the value and effects of affirmative action programs, we \nshould not be creating a new special category of citizens, a special \nclass of citizens that will be a new basis for a new round of quotas \nand litigation.\n  Mr. President, I want to refer to a specific case in particular. In \nSeattle, a CPA referral specialist, Bryan Griggs, laid off all of his \nsmall staff except his wife in 1994. One employee later charged Mr. \nGriggs with discrimination and sexual harassment under Seattle's gay \nrights law even though Mr. Griggs did not know the man involved was a \nhomosexual. But before he cleared his name, Mr. Griggs spent thousands \nof dollars defending himself. I just repeat, Mr. President, this is the \nkind of activity for which this legislation sets the stage and for \nwhich I would encourage all Members of the Senate to thoughtfully \nconsider.\n  In light of our current experience with affirmative action, national \nquotas, et cetera, I think, on balance, Senators should join with \nmyself, Senator Nickles, and others in opposition to the bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield back whatever time of the 5 minutes I have to \nthe manager of the bill, and thank her for granting me this time.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to thank our colleague from \nGeorgia for his statement. He mentioned the fact that he was an \nemployer and he did not ask questions in the past concerning people's \nsexual orientation. I have been an employer. I never asked that \nquestion. I do not want to ask that question. I am afraid if this bill \nbecame law, you would have to ask that question.\n  Looking at the statutes under title VII, it talks about the power of \nthe EEOC to conduct investigations under section 2000e-8. It basically \nsays: ``Every employer, employment agency * * * subject to this \nsubchapter shall''--not ``may''--``shall (1) make and keep such records \nrelevant to the determinations of whether unlawful employment practices \nhave been or are being committed, (2) preserve such records for such \nperiods, and (3) make such reports therefrom as the Commission shall \nprescribe by regulation or orders thereunder.'' And so on.\n  In other words, the EEOC is going to say keep records. They now have \nto keep records. Employers have to keep records on their employment \npractices, on people they hire, on their race, on their sex, on their \ngender, and now we would include sexual orientation.\n  What does that mean? It means employers are going to have to ask \ntheir employees, ``What is your sexual orientation? Are you a \nheterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual?'' I can envision some of the \npeople I used to work with in a particular machine shop, and you might \nbe punched out for asking that question. I mean, that is really none of \nyour business. And yet, now the Government would be asking, I believe \nin compliance with this EEOC, to keep those records.\n  Sponsors of this bill will say, well, we do not have quotas, but \nfrankly the records, I think, are going to be asked for. I think that \nis very intrusive. Then are you going to ask somebody, wait a minute; \nwe found out here you have 100 employees and nobody said that they were \nhomosexual because maybe that would not be well received in the \nparticular place of employment. Maybe that is not true. Are you going \nto go back to people and say, wait a minute; we want you to tell the \ntruth because we are afraid we might be sued, and we have to prove we \nhave people that are homosexual or bisexual, in other words, to prove \nwe were not discriminating.\n  So you are going to ask people again, wait a minute; we heard you are \n* * * This is very intrusive, big Government coming in, meddling in \nareas that it has no business asking questions about, it should not be \nasking about. I hope our colleagues are aware of it.\n  I want to touch on the Boy Scouts. Sponsors of this bill have said, \nthat they are excluding the Boy Scouts. Boy Scouts have been sued \nwithout this bill becoming the law, without sexual orientation being \nadded to the civil rights statutes or protections. They have been sued \nbecause of their policies, because they did not want to have open \nhomosexuals as Scoutmasters. That is present law, a present suit. They \nspent hundreds of thousands of dollars. You have a lot of organizations \nthat maybe are not the Boy Scouts but also work with young people that \nwould like to maintain a similar type of policy of having role models \nthat are not avowed or open homosexuals or bisexuals and yet they would \nbe sued.\n\n  One comment, on exempting Christian organizations. This bill does not \nexempt Christian for-profit organizations. If you have a Christian \nbookstore and you are trying to sell something in Scottsdale, AZ, sell \nbooks in your Christian bookstore, and you have somebody come in that \nis openly gay, maybe it is written on their T-shirt or somehow it is \nvery much communicated and you do not want to hire them, you are \nsubject to suit. You can be sued not only for compensatory damages but \nfor punitive damages. The\n\n[[Page S10005]]\n\nbig hand of the Federal Government will come in and say, ``Mr. Employer \nof XYZ Christian bookstore or Jewish bookstore, you must employ this \nperson even though their sexual orientation is very contradictory to \nyour personal and religious convictions. You must employ them or you \ncan be sued.'' I find that very offensive. I hope we will not go so far \nas to do that. I am afraid that is exactly what we would do if we pass \nthis bill.\n  I understand some of the motivation that some of the people have. I \nthink this debate has been conducted very well. I just want to say that \npeople who oppose this legislation I do not believe are bigoted. I \nthink they are trying to protect an individual's right to protect their \nreligious convictions and organizations--organizations like the Boy \nScouts, organizations like a cheerleading camp or a children's camp or \na day care center, or Christian bookstore. We want to at least protect \ntheir right that if they want to make sure they have role models who \nare not bisexual or openly homosexual amongst kids and so on, they \nwould have the right to have that and maintain their policies, without \nthe big hand of the Federal Government coming in and saying, ``No, you \nare subjected to not only compensatory damages but punitive damages and \nall the legal fees that would come with that.''\n  I urge my colleagues when we vote on Tuesday to please vote ``no'' on \nthis legislation. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am pleased to return to the floor to add a note to \nthe discussion which has continued since I left the floor. There has \nbeen further debate about how the bill exempts organizations like the \nU.S. military, and exempts, properly so, I think, private schools, and \nit attempts to exempt the Boy Scouts.\n  Since I pointed that out and said basically I thought those were good \nexemptions, I thought the same reasons for exempting them should exempt \nthe rest of the culture. Why impose something that would threaten the \nBoy Scouts or threaten the U.S. military, or threaten private nonprofit \nschools? Why impose those kinds of things on the rest of the culture?\n  After I left the floor the allegation was made that the arguments \nagainst this bill flowed from bigotry and could be characterized as \ncheap shots because we would exempt the entire culture. I guess I just \nhave one question to ask: If it is bigotry to exempt the entire \nculture, is it small-time bigotry to exempt the Boy Scouts? Is it \nsmall-time bigotry to exempt limited portions of the culture? In my \njudgment, it is not. I think it is a mistake to suggest it is bigotry \nto oppose this bill.\n  I think that there are real problems with the underlying principle of \nthis bill, and that those problems are understood, and as a result we \nattempt to exempt organizations like the Boy Scouts. We exempt the U.S. \nmilitary because we do not want to subject it to some of the problems \nthat would attend its application. I think those of us who oppose this \nbill are not bigots or taking cheap shots or cheaper shots. If it is a \ncheap shot to exempt the entire culture, it must be something of a \ncheap shot to exempt part of it. We are not really saying we want to \ntake a cheap shot. We are saying this is not the way for us to move \nforward.\n  I believe the framers of the legislation were right in their attempt \nto avoid the imposition of onerous, counterproductive regulation on a \ngood bit of our culture--private schools, nonprofit, Boy Scouts, the \nU.S. military. We can ill afford to do things that impair their mission \nor their capacity. I think they were right in doing so. For those of us \nwho would have a broader exemption, who believe it would be \ncounterproductive overall, I think we are arguing from good faith and \nin the best national interest. That is a point which I think deserves \nto be made. It can be contradicted but I do not think it will be \nrefuted.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken earlier about concerns I had with this \nlegislation. I agree with the Senator from Missouri. I think one can \noppose this legislation and not be thought of as being bigoted or, I \nsuggest, creating stereotypes, because I think there are some very \ntroubling aspects of this bill. The subject of this bill is, in many \nways, not easy to define.\n  Let me suggest that there are several points that have been raised \nhere today in the course of the debate. One, I do believe it will lead \nto prolonged litigation where there are punitive and compensatory \ndamages involved that could further divide the workplace. I do not \nbelieve it furthers what we would most like to occur--a tolerant and \nunderstanding workplace. Second, there is a question about how this law \nwould impact affirmative action requirements. And third, how it will \nimpact on the strongly held views of employers or employees?\n  I guess what we are really trying to decide here is how far we can go \nby legislating what employers should or should not do when it comes to \nfiring and hiring. I do not think we can answer that easily by \nlegislation. I frankly believe, as I said before, that I think every \nsingle one of us deplores discrimination. We should not stereotype \nanyone. I do not think that we are.\n  However, I do believe that there are legitimate concerns about the \nconsequences of this bill that lead me to oppose the legislation before \nthe Senate. I think there are better ways to promote tolerance. I \nsuggest, also, Mr. President, that I think it is very important for us \nto respect differing viewpoints in the process and to continue to hold \nrespect for all individuals. I believe we can hold these views. I \nbelieve we can be respectful of differences and still oppose this \nlegislation.\n  As we consider the aspects of the debate that we have heard here this \nmorning, when we vote on Tuesday, I urge those who are uncertain about \nhow to vote, even though there have been arguments that have been made \non the other side that have shown where States have had this \nlegislation in place, very few cases have been brought. As the Senator \nfrom New York, Senator Moynihan pointed out, and Senator Kennedy as \nwell, to have legislation imposing requirements in order to open \ndoors--indeed, this is a different type of situation and we need to \nthink carefully about what it may lead to in the future.\n  I would suggest there may be some different and better paths as we \nlook at the consequences of litigation on firing and hiring practices.\n  For these reasons and the concerns I believe that exist, I urge all \nSenators who have some doubts about this to oppose this legislation.\n  I yield back any time remaining, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that, for the \nnext hour, time designated is under my control and/or my designee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/06/senate-section/article/S9986-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10005-S10011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as we have heard, there is a great \nnational debate in the making with regard to the anxiety in the \nAmerican workplace, anxiety particularly among middle-class working \nAmericans. I have often talked about a snapshot of an average family in \nGeorgia that makes about $40,000 to $45,000 a year. Several months ago, \nwhen I took the snapshot of that family--a family of four, with both \nparents now working, with two children--we added up the Government \nobligations that that family had to pay, the total cost of Government. \nAt the end of the day, they had 48.2 percent of their gross wages left.\n  I can think of no institution, including Hollywood, that has had a \nmore profound effect on the behavior of middle-class America than their \nown Government. This morning, I have just been given data that show \nthat now they only have 47 percent. Just in the last 12 months, they \ncontinue to lose the power of the wages and the independence of what \nthose wages mean to that family.\n\n[[Page S10006]]\n\n  Maybe the First Lady and Senator Dole have defined our disagreement. \nIn Chicago, she said, very defiantly, that it does take a village to \nraise a child. Of course, ``village'' is the Government. Senator Dole \nsaid that it takes a family. All year, we have been debating the \nsubject about whether the resources should go to the village--the \nGovernment--or whether the resources should be left with the family.\n  I believe the empirical evidence is unshakable that those resources, \nthose wages, should be left in the family checking account, so that \nthat family can undertake the responsibilities that America has always \nasked of them--to get the country up in the morning, get it to school, \nget it educated, get it housed and fed, clothed, transported and, yes, \nin good health and spirits, and to ultimately accept the leadership of \nthe country. For us to be here this morning debating the fact that an \naverage family in America is now forfeiting over half of its wages to \nthe Government at some level, being denied those earnings and the \nindependence it gives the families to do the things it is supposed to \ndo--if Thomas Jefferson were here today--and I have said it before--he \nwould be stunned that we had ever come to a point in America that we \nhad confiscated that sum of the earning power of the wage earner and \nsent it off to some government to remake the village. Maybe those two \nsentences have, more clearly than anything else we have heard in a long \ntime, defined our two views of the country.\n  I see we have been joined by the Senator from Utah. I yield up to 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Utah to speak on this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as I contemplate the issue of taxes and \ntheir impact on the average family, my mind goes back to an experience \nthat, for me, was very typical--that is, for my generation--but it is \nbecoming increasingly less typical for Americans. I would like to \nrecall it as a model for this discussion. When I was in my twenties, I \nwas in the Armed Forces. At that time, everyone who was male and in his \ntwenties was in the Armed Forces. The law required that. It was a new \nexperience, a cultural shock, as they took me to Fort Ord, CA, and cut \noff all my hair. I will stipulate that at that time in my life I had \nsome hair to be cut off, unlike my present circumstance. They put me in \na uniform, put me in a barracks, and changed my life.\n  I was an employee of the U.S. Army and, as such, I received the \nmonthly salary of $90. People could say to me, ``Well, you can't live \non $90 a month.'' But the Army would have pointed out to me, if I had \nraised the issue, that the Army took care of all of my food, all of my \nclothing, the Army took care of my housing, and the Army took care of \nmy transportation. If the Army did not take me someplace, I did not \nneed to go there. The Army would tell me that would be the case, and \nthat the $90 a month I had as my salary was spending money. I could use \nit to pay for the haircut that the Army required me to have. I could \nuse it to buy some candy bars, or whatever movies I might want to go \nto. But my life was OK, because the combination of cash and Government-\nprovided benefits together provided me with a standard of living that \nthe Army decided was adequate for me.\n  Why do I cite that in this discussion about taxes? It is because that \nis the philosophy that I think we are seeing here, where people say to \nus, yes, there is so much coming to the Government in the way of taxes, \nbut look at what the Government is doing for you in return for those \ntaxes, so that you would want to continue paying the taxes because your \ncountry needs that money in order to provide you with all of those \nwonderful benefits that you are getting.\n  In the debate when Senator Dole raised the issue of possibly cutting \nthe tax rate, the first thing we heard was, ``We can't do that because \nwe can't afford it,'' to which I echo the question: Who is ``we''? ``We \ncan't afford to give up the revenue that is coming from the tax \nrolls.'' Who is ``we''? ``We'' in this case means the average American \nfamily. The average American family currently spends more for those \nGovernment benefits, like the food, the uniforms, the barracks, and so \non that I described when I was in the Army. The current American family \nspends more for Government than it spends for food, housing, and \nshelter combined. Yet, we need more money to run the Government than \nthe family needs to feed itself, clothe itself, and house itself. The \nquestion arises, not where will the money go but who will control it?\n  Let me give you an example. One of the things we buy with Government \nmoney is retraining programs for people who are out of work. In the \nState of Utah, we have a training program that is called ATC--Advanced \nTechnology Centers. It is one of the, I think, most effective \neducational programs that has ever been run. I could go on at great \nlength and describe how it works. The State pays for it. People who \nneed it enroll in it, and they keep the cash for themselves to make the \ndecisions with respect to their lives. They enroll in this training \nprogram not because the Federal Government is running it and the \nFederal Government has decided that it must be offered. They decide in \nterms of their own lives what kind of training they need. They come to \nthe program, and they choose which part of the program they will take. \nAnd when they feel they have gotten what they need, they leave on their \nown. In other words, the decisions on retraining are made by the \nindividuals--not by the Federal Government, or the State government. \nBut we will take money away from them to fund some 157 Federal \nretraining programs that the Federal Government will then require \npeople to go to in order to get their unemployment benefits.\n  Which is the more efficient--where the individual makes the decision, \nor where the government makes the decision? The answer is very clear. \nThe individual makes more intelligent decisions than the government \ndoes. Why? Because the individual is concerned about the effect of that \ndecision on his or her life, and the government, by necessity, has to \nmake these decisions for a whole range of folks.\n  Let us talk about tax money specifically. Right now in this country \nreal wages are stagnant, and they have been for something like 17 \nyears. Government is not. Government has been growing in that 17-year \nperiod. Once again, we are told, ``We can't cut the amount of tax \nburden on the families because we can't afford it.'' Again who is \n``we''? What would happen if we were to say, ``All right, we are going \nto allow families to keep more of what they earn and forego the \ngovernment programs''? An interesting thing would happen. If you were \nto say to families who have children--which almost by definition means \nthat they have financial problems--if we were to say to families that \nhave children, ``OK, we are going to allow you to keep more of your \nmoney. What are you going to do with it?'' ``Well, we are going to \nspend it perhaps on a new car because with children we have to have a \nslightly bigger car than the one we had when we were courting. We are \ngoing to replace the washing machine. With children we wash a lot more \nclothes than we used to. We are going to buy more clothes for our kids. \nWe are going to choose so on and so forth.''\n  I have had economists say to me, ``Why do you support the $500 per \nchild tax credit, because it is not going to do anything in our \nmacroeconomic models to increase savings? And the reason you have a tax \ncut to stimulate the economy is because you want to increase the \nsavings rate and so on.'' I will not get into all of that macroeconomic \nconversation here. You are right; families will not increase their \nsavings if you say we are going to give them a $500 per child tax \ncredit. What are they going to do? They are going to go out and buy \nthings for their kids. Kids are now consumer kids. There were times \nwhen they were an economic asset. Now kids are a luxury item. We have \nthem nonetheless. But they cost us money.\n  What is going to happen when Detroit has to build additional cars \nbecause people with families want bigger cars, when they have to build \nadditional washing machines, when they have to produce more clothes? \nWhat is going to be the impact of that on the economy and ultimately on \nthe amount of money that will come back to government in the form of \ntaxes? I have seen some macroeconomic studies that say the $500 per \nchild tax credit is going to produce a greater economic\n\n[[Page S10007]]\n\nstimulus than even the cut in the capital gains tax rate. I am not sure \nhow that all works out. Frankly, neither are they. Because the one \nthing we have to recognize is that we are dealing with a $7 trillion \neconomy, and the size of the $500 per child tax credit in terms of the \nimpact on the economy as a whole is less than 1 percent. That is true, \nMr. President. If you take the size of the economy as a whole and add \nit up for the next 6 years--because 2002 is our target date--you are \ntalking about roughly $50 trillion worth of economic activity in that \n6-year period. The size of the $500 per child tax credit is less than \n$500 billion over that same 6-year period, considerably less. So it is \nless than 1 percent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I proceed for an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are talking about a tax credit that is \nless than 1 percent of the entire economy. But look at what it means to \nthe families with children. Look at what it means to those who will \nmake the decisions themselves--that instead of all the benefits like \nthe Army used to give me in uniforms, barracks, and mess hall \nprivileges, I say, ``Thanks. Just give me the cash and let me decide \nwhere I am going to live, what I am going to wear, and what I am going \nto eat.'' I will make wiser decisions, and the impact on the economy \nwill be better.\n  So this is where it ultimately comes down to, Mr. President. Again, \nthe question: Who is ``we'' when we say we can't afford a cut in tax \nrates? The ``we'' is the American people, and I believe the American \npeople left to handle the cash rather than the so-called ``benefits'' \ncan make a wiser use of that money than the Government can.\n  I am glad my experience with the Army is over. It was a good \nexperience. But I prefer the freedom I have to have the money and make \nmy own choices, and I think most Americans feel the same way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I changed my 3 to 5, Mr. President, after listening to \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah. I shared the same experiences in \nthe Army, and I know exactly where he is coming from.\n  Mr. President, when he stated that Jefferson would have been stunned \nif he would have known what we have here today, some who were around \nback then would not have been so stunned. It was de Tocqueville who \nmade the observation after writing the book about the great wealth of \nthis country and what made it so wealthy. He said that once the people \nfind that they can vote money out of the public treasury, the system \nwill fail. And I think we are getting dangerously close to that.\n  As I watched the Chicago convention and all of this emphasis on the \nfamily, I was thinking, ``How in the world could any administration \nwith such a dismal failure in their treatment of family values be \ntalking about the family?'' Maybe that is the whole reason they are \ndoing it.\n  I think if you go back and look, Mr. President, at the tax increase \nthat took place in 1993, it was characterized by then chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee, Senator Moynihan, the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York, as the ``largest single tax increase'' in the history of \npublic finance, or any place in the world. That is exactly what \nhappened.\n  What was the nature of that tax increase? It was a tax increase on \nthe American family. It was a gasoline tax increase. That is not just \nfor fat cats. That is for everyone who drives a car, drives a truck, or \ndrives a tractor. It was a tax increase on small business and on \nindividuals, and even retroactive--going back and saying, ``It is not \nenough that we go ahead and tax you from this point forward, but let us \ngo back to January.'' I think that is the first time in history that \nhas been done. It was a 70-percent tax increase on the Social Security \nrecipients who cared enough to prepare for some of their senior years \nso they would have as much as $22,000 of income. It was an increase in \nestate taxes. And what is interesting about this is we passed a bill, \nseveral provisions that would have been geared just to the family, the \n$500 per child tax credit, the capital gains tax reduction, repealing \nsome of our laws that penalize people who get married, who if you stay \nmarried--actually right now under the law on the books two individuals \nwho are happily married, if they will get a divorce, can increase their \ntake-home pay by reducing taxes. Is that what Government is supposed to \ndo?\n\n  Anyway, I enjoyed the statement by Senator Dole when he talked about \ndoing something about the overtaxation. And if you will analyze what he \nwas suggesting in repealing that Social Security tax increase, the $500 \nper child tax credit, the reduction of taxes by 15 percent, the \nreduction of capital gains taxes and the repealing of the estate tax, \nall he is saying there is let us go back and see what happened in 1993 \nand let us repeal a portion of that tax increase.\n  So I would suggest that anyone today who was not supportive back in \n1993 of the tax increase should be supporting what Senator Dole is \nproposing to do now.\n  The Senator from Utah mentioned we cannot afford it. I would like to \nmake one comment. I heard the distinguished Senator from Arizona quote \nJohn Kennedy several times on the fact that back when he was President, \nhe said we have got to increase revenues and the only way to increase \nrevenues is to reduce the tax rates. He reduced the tax rates and that \ndid increase revenue.\n  So I suggest to the Senator from Utah that we can afford to do this. \nWe can effectively increase our revenues by reducing taxes. The formula \nworks out that for each 1-percent growth in economic activity it \nincreases revenues by $24 billion.\n  However, we do not have the same kind of Democrat in the White House \ntoday that we had when we had John Kennedy. It was Laura Tyson who said \nthere is no relationship between the level of taxes a nation pays and \nits economic performance. And if you have that philosophy, then you can \nsay, yes, we cannot afford it.\n  Indeed, history has shown us in three decades in the last 100 years, \nthe twenties, the sixties, and the eighties, when we had dramatic \nreductions in tax rates, each time we increased our revenues. So I \nthink it is a question now of are we really concerned about the family, \nare we really concerned about doing something about the lessons of \nthose times? I think the time is here, and we have a Congress that is \nwilling to do it.\n  I applaud the Senator from Georgia for bringing up this subject to \ndiscuss today.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the remarks of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma--as always on this subject precise and on \ntarget, and I am glad he was able to be with us this afternoon.\n  The Senator from Arizona is here and would need up to 5 minutes. So I \nextend 5 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, during the last few weeks, as the Presidential \nelection campaign has gotten underway, the American people have heard a \ngreat deal about two very different tax plans for the country.\n  One of the plans proposed by President Clinton involves token relief \nif--and I stress if--people spend their money in ways that the \nGovernment deems most appropriate. The other plan represents the most \nambitious, progrowth economic program since the beginning of the Reagan \nadministration, a program that puts faith in the American people to \nspend their money in ways that are best for themselves and their \nfamilies and their communities.\n\n  Mr. President, the ambitious program that I am talking about is the \none that Bob Dole has made the centerpiece of his campaign. It is a \nplan that would cut income tax rates across the board by 15 percent, a \nplan that would provide families with an additional $500 per child tax \ncredit, and an opportunity to save in new education investment accounts \nfor college education. It would repeal the President's 1993 tax\n\n[[Page S10008]]\n\non Social Security, and it would provide important incentives for job \ncreation through capital gains tax reduction.\n  What does all of this mean for the average American family? For a \nfamily of four earning $35,000 a year, it would mean a savings of over \n$1,400 a year, a 51.8 percent reduction in that family's tax bill. In \nother words, it cuts the tax bill in half. For a family making $75,000 \na year, it means a savings of 26.7 percent. It cuts that family's tax \nliability by a quarter. In other words, it provides real tax relief and \ntargets it to those families who need it the most.\n  Unlike the plan that President Clinton has proposed, the Dole plan \noffers broad-based relief and allows all taxpayers--those who are \nmarried and those who are single, those with children, those without \nchildren--to decide for themselves how they can best use their savings \nto help themselves and their communities. Maybe they could use the \nmoney for new school clothes, as Senator Bennett pointed out, or for \nbooks so children can do some extra reading. Maybe they need the money \nto put a new roof on the house or put savings aside for a downpayment \non a home so they, too, could fulfill their dreams to own a home. Maybe \nsomeone would use the funds to start a new business or to create new \njobs for young people entering the work force.\n  The issue is trust. Do we trust the people enough to decide how to \nuse their own hard-earned income or do we need the Government to decide \nfor us how to spend our money. The Dole plan puts faith in the people \nand so do I.\n  History shows that when we put our faith in people, the country's \neconomy as a whole does much better. The Senator from Oklahoma pointed \nout that I frequently quote John F. Kennedy in this regard, and I do. \nHe proposed a tax cut in the early 1960's to help stimulate economic \ngrowth, and that plan ultimately led to one of the few periods of \nrelatively strong economic growth in our country since World War II.\n  The economic effects of the Reagan tax cuts in the 1980's were just \nas dramatic, leading to the longest peacetime economic expansion in the \nour Nation's history. In fact, by the end of President Reagan's second \nterm in office real gross national product had risen by more than 4 \npercent a year. Nearly 19 million new jobs were created, more than 85 \npercent of which were full-time jobs in occupations with average annual \nsalaries of over $20,000. Real median family income grew every year but \none between 1982 and 1989, rising $4,564 or 12.64 percent. That is real \nmedian income, extra money in people's pockets to help meet their \neveryday needs. That is what the Reagan program accomplished.\n  By contrast, the high tax policies of the 1990's have had exactly the \nopposite effect. Real median family income has declined $2,108 or 5.2 \npercent for the average family. People are caught in the trap of \nstagnating, declining wages and higher taxes, and they are hurting. No \nwonder it takes two adults in the family working to support the family. \nOne supports the family; the other supports the Government.\n\n  I know that some people are asking whether tax cuts are an option \ntoday in an era when voters and public officials alike are seeking to \nbalance our Federal budget. Well, John Kennedy also answered that \nquestion noting, and I am quoting:\n       An economy hampered with high tax rates will never produce \n     enough revenue to balance the budget just as it will never \n     produce enough output and enough jobs.\n\n  The question is not whether we can afford a tax cut. The question is \ncan the American people, many of whom are working two jobs just to make \nends meet, afford a Government that continues to take more of their \nhard-earned income every year? Can the next generation afford the tax \nburden that will be imposed upon it just to pay the debts our \nGovernment is accumulating today? Can we do better for our children \nthan to leave them with a sputtering economy, falling income and rising \ntaxes?\n  The Dole plan is not simply a tax cut but an overall economic plan to \nrevitalize the Nation's economy by putting faith in people to save and \ninvest their hard-earned money in ways they deem best for themselves \nand their communities. President Clinton has promised that the era of \nbig Government is over. Bob Dole's economic plan will help keep that \npromise.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Arizona. I think maybe it \nwill be useful to step back for a moment, to help frame what it is we \nare talking about. In 1993, the Clinton administration imposed the \nlargest tax increase in American history, $491 billion. That resulted \nin the highest tax burden, 19.3 percent of the entire economy, that is \nbeing consumed by Government.\n  So the stage has been set. These are very large numbers, and they \ntend not to get brought down to what the effects are on everyday folks \nout here. What is happening is the median income for America's average \nfamilies is continuing to fall and has been falling for some time. From \n1986 to 1993, it dropped $3,800, and continues to fall. These are the \nreasons. As Government grows, and grows unfettered, the resources have \nto come from somewhere. The families that are most affected are middle-\nincome families. The very wealthy are able to adjust their lives \naccordingly. The very poor are using the safety net. But middle America \nis paying these bills.\n  I am reading from an article that appeared on July 22 in the Atlanta \nConstitution. It says:\n\n       To fend off that decline and maintain a middle-class \n     lifestyle, many women who might prefer to remain at home \n     have, instead, entered the workforce. But even that strategy \n     has begun to pay lower dividends. In families headed by a \n     married couple in which the wife is in the workforce, median \n     income peaked in 1989 and has declined noticeably since.\n\n  Another article on this subject:\n\n       In particular, declining earnings have fueled the rapid \n     increase in labor force participation of women, including \n     women in 2-parent families. Whereas, in 1950, only 20 percent \n     of married women with children, and 12 percent of those with \n     preschool age children, worked, by 1990, 40 years later, two-\n     thirds of married women with children were employed.\n\n  A survey, I believe it was done by Rand, was recently released about \nthe second spouse, or women in the workplace. It said 85 percent of the \nwomen in the workplace would like to alter how they are in the \nworkplace if they could. Of course they cannot because of the economic \nburden that our governments have placed on their families. They are so \nhigh that the option is removed. It is not a decision, to make a choice \nto go into the workplace. The Government is forcing it.\n  Of the 85 percent who said they would alter it, one-third of those \nsaid they do not want to be in the workplace at all, they want to be at \nhome; one-third said they would like to work just part-time so there is \nmore time for the family; and one-third of them said they would only \nvolunteer. They would just work as a volunteer. They do not have that \nchoice. Congress and the administration, over the last several years, \nhave made that choice for them as we have ratcheted up the burden.\n  A moment ago I was talking about the Georgia family and I pointed out \nthey are forfeiting half their income to some government at this point. \nThat is enormous. It is just hard to comprehend. During this \nadministration, that average family's checking account has shrunk by \n$200 a month, anywhere from $2,200 to $2,600 a year. That is the impact \non this average family in my State of the policies of this \nadministration. When they raised the taxes to the record level and \nproduced this highest tax burden ever, the effect on an average family \nin a little town in my State is that their checking account has $2,400 \nless a year. That is just like removing something like 10 to 15 percent \nof their total disposable income.\n  Is it any wonder that these average working families in our country \nare not saving money? Are we surprised they do not save money like they \nshould, to prepare for a rainy day, prepare for retirement, prepare for \ntheir children's education? What is left to save, after the Government \nhas marched through your living room and taken half the assets?\n  Are we surprised that credit card debt is at an all-time high? Are we \nsurprised that the payments on delinquencies on credit cards have \nplummeted? Are we surprised that, if you work from 9 in the morning \nuntil noon every day for the Government, and this\n\n[[Page S10009]]\n\ntax burden has been made so high that you have to have both spouses and \nin some cases their children in the workplace, and in some cases not \nonly do both spouses now work, but, indeed, they have to have two and \nthree jobs each--Are we surprised that the behavior of that family has \nbeen modified? That the children are left without the kind of attention \nthose parents would like to give? That they are not there to be the \nguide and beacon for those kids? They call that latchkey children. Of \ncourse they are latchkey children. The Government policy from \nWashington has increased the burden, increased the burden. We have \npushed both spouses into the workplace. We have now got them to where \nthey have to have two and three jobs. We have created stress. It is no \nwonder there is so much anxiety in middle-class America.\n\n  I am reading from another periodical: ``Work and family \nintegration.''\n\n       It is increasingly common for all adult family members to \n     spend a greater number of hours at work in order to make up \n     for declining median family incomes. Married women with \n     children have entered the labor force in record numbers. \n     They, therefore [it doesn't take a rocket scientist]--they, \n     therefore, have less time for care-giving in the home. Many \n     parents, both mothers and fathers, feel conflicted and torn \n     between spending time with their families and meeting \n     workplace demands. ``It's like you are caught between a rock \n     and a hard place, because if you want to have a family, you \n     want to have a couple of children, and you cannot do that \n     unless you have lots of money to support them.''\n\n  That quoted a woman in her twenties in Salt Lake City.\n  So, Mr. President, Senator Dole has come forward. There is a lot of \ntalk about what each of these proposals means, but the bottom line is \nthis: He is saying that Government, Washington in particular, has put \ntoo much financial pressure on these fragile families. It is creating \nhavoc, and it ought to be a conscious, fundamental, sound policy to \ngive them relief, to allow them to keep more of what they earn so that \nthey can do what they are supposed to do in that home. And, yes, he is \nsaying we think that the best caretaker of those children is their \nparents and the family in the comfort of the home, and, no, a village, \na government is no replacement for that policy.\n  So he has stepped forward and said, ``I intend, with a cooperative \nCongress, to effect lowering the economic burden on the average \nfamily.''\n  Mr. President, I know that you, the Presiding Officer, would like to \nspeak on this subject. So I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum \nso I might assume your duties so that you can speak on this subject and \nthen replace me afterwards.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to continue on the topic that \nwas begun so admirably by yourself, the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Oklahoma on the benefits of significant tax relief for all \nAmericans, for individuals, for their families, for their children, for \nthe next generation.\n  Whenever we seem to debate tax policy in this body, we seem to begin \nwith different premises, and I think we really must focus over the next \nyear on a principle which I feel should govern our decisionmaking. That \nis, that there is no such thing as ``Government money.'' Money today \nthrough taxes comes from individuals, hard-working individuals. It \ncomes from a person, it comes from a family, it comes from a business, \nand it comes to Washington, DC, and not the other way around.\n  For far too long, the Federal Government has treated the income of \nAmerican people as its own money. This practice absolutely must stop.\n  I want to refer, as I develop this principle over the next few \nminutes, to a recent editorial by Washington Post columnist James \nGlassman. The editorial is entitled ``It's Your Money.'' I will alter \nit a little bit and say ``It's the People's Money,'' because that is \nthe underlying principle I think we must come back to as we discuss tax \nand tax policy.\n  In that editorial, Mr. Glassman pointed out that there are two \nschools of thought on tax policy. Under the first one, using the words \nof Mr. Glassman:\n\n       We use an old-fashioned business model to think about \n     taxes. Taxes are revenues, like sales. The objective for the \n     Government is to match up those revenues with its expenses so \n     that it doesn't lose money. Under that model--\n\n  According to Mr. Glassman--\n\n     the Government dispenses tax cuts as a gift from Washington.\n\n  But I do not think the American people view their tax dollars in this \nfashion. They tell you that. All of us travel around our respective \nStates and around the country, and they tell you they don't view their \ntax dollars that way, so we need to stop viewing them that way in \nWashington, DC.\n  Mr. Glassman described it in the editorial in the following way. He \nsaid the average American, and I begin to quote him, ``views taxes not \nmerely as bloodless revenues but as the real, hard-won earnings of \nindividual Americans.''\n  He says:\n\n       Tax dollars begin life as personal dollars. They're yours, \n     not Washington's.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       You do agree through the political process to turn over \n     some of your income, but that deal is transitory and \n     renewable and it depends on Washington providing good value \n     for your money.\n\n  Mr. Glassman's words, ``good value for your money.''\n  I don't think we in this body can express this principle enough. It \nis the taxpayers' money. When we Senators meet with our constituents in \nour home States, we have to remember it is their money. That is where \nit originated. And every time we pass a spending bill on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate, we must be able to go home and look our constituents \nin the eyes and say, ``Here is how we spent your money.''\n  I brought two charts with me, again, to illustrate how taxes have \ntaken a bigger and bigger bite out of the family budget. So many people \nthink so often in the short term and they say, ``Well, taxes are high \nnow, yes, but they have always been that way. There really hasn't been \nmuch change, and there's not much we can do about it.''\n  Our responses have to be the facts. We do not have to look that long \nago when people were paying out of their family budget as much as they \nare paying in taxes today. We have to look back.\n  This is taxes out of a typical family budget. This is not an \naggregate figure of billions of dollars, this is a family budget, \nsomething each of us can touch, feel, experience.\n  The pie on the left shows in 1955 the family budget, this circle \nbeing 100 percent. Total taxes were 27.7 percent in 1955.\n  If we look in 1995, we see that total taxes are 38.2 percent. All \nother parts of the family budget are shrinking as the red part of the \npie has gotten bigger and bigger over time, just over a 40-year period.\n  You can also look at this at how many hours you work during the day. \nIf you say this is an 8-hour day that likely you and your spouse are \nworking, look, 3 hours out of that 8 hours is spent working for \nGovernment today.\n  Going back to Mr. Glassman's words, we need better value for your \nmoney.\n  On the second chart, we see a typical family budget, how that budget \nof that working family with two children breaks down. This is the \noverall family budget, and, once again, in red, we see total taxes. I \njust said that 38.2 percent of that typical family budget goes to \npaying taxes. Where does the rest of it go?\n  Just very quickly. House and households, about 15 percent in yellow. \nIn the blue, medical care about 10 percent. Food, 6 percent. \nTransportation, 6 percent. Clothing, 4 percent. And everything else \nabout 17 percent. This might be education for your children, might be \nsavings, might be investment for your retirement.\n  But look, compare what we pay in taxes to medical care, food, \ntransportation, and clothing, and we can see that what you pay in taxes \nfar surpasses the 27 percent total of medical care, food, \ntransportation, and clothing today.\n  Most Americans do not think of it in that concrete of terms. It is \ntime we take broadly across this country this process of educating \npeople, to look at what you do when you increase that red, which has \nbeen done, as we saw, by\n\n[[Page S10010]]\n\nour distinguished colleague from Georgia. We have seen that this red \nhas been growing and growing over time. What does it squeeze out? It \nmeans that you spend less money on food or transportation or clothing \nor savings or investment in your children's future.\n  You know, in this Congress we have done a number of things, and much \nof it gets lost before it gets out to the people broadly. We passed a \n$500-per-child tax credit for families making under $75,000 a year. We \npassed a marriage penalty relief which increased the standard deduction \nfor couples filing jointly. We passed a student loan interest credit to \nmake college more affordable. We passed an expanded individual \nretirement account that would allow penalty-free withdrawals for first-\ntime home purchases, for medical expenses, for periods of unemployment, \nfor college expenses.\n  Yes, unfortunately, though this body representing the American people \npassed all of that, they were vetoed by the President of the United \nStates. Well, despite this setback of a way, we now must review our \ncommitment to allow individual Americans, individual hard-working men \nand women, not the Federal Government, to keep more of those hard-\nearned earnings.\n  To those who say that tax relief will blow a hole in the deficit, I \nsay, join with us as responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars in our \ncommitment to finding offsetting spending cuts. If we are going to \nallow the American people to keep more of what they earn, we have to \nslow down this incessant, almost unstoppable growth of Government. \nGoing back to Mr. Glassman's comments, who said, ``providing good value \nfor your money.''\n  We can begin this process by passing a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution. That way the American people would have a \nconstitutional assurance that tax cuts would fully be paid for with \nspending cuts.\n  In closing, our challenge is to boil down this large debate of taxes \nand economic policy to something that the typical American can \nunderstand. The data speaks very strongly to the typical American. The \ntax debate will rage on. We need to come back to that underlying \nprinciple: It is the people's money. I do urge my colleagues to \nremember that we--we--we are the trustees of the American Treasury. \nBuilding that trust is one of the most important duties we have as U.S. \nSenators. If we always remember that it is the people's money, I \nbelieve we will be responsible trustees.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time is there remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I really enjoyed your presentation, as \nI told you when you approached the Chair. You raised some questions \nthat I am going to pursue, even beyond this afternoon, by the pie chart \nof the breakdown of the expenditures for the average family. I want to \npoint out again, an average family in Tennessee cannot be a lot \ndifferent than one in Georgia. It is about $40,000, $45,000 that this \naverage family is earning in Georgia. I assume that is about what it is \nhere. When you take 40 percent of that amount, you do not have a lot \nleft. That is not a lot of money.\n  A point I wanted to make is this is a bit deceptive. It shows that \n38.2 percent is paid in total taxes, which, as you pointed out, was \nlarger than what that family is spending for its house and household, \nmedical care, its food, its transportation, and clothing. It is just \nunbelievable that the Government burden can be that large. But the \npoint I want to make is that it is even larger than the 38.2 percent. \nMaybe we can collaborate on this and we can produce another chart. But \nbuilt there is another 12-plus percent that is hidden in the price for \nthe house and household, medical care, and food in the cost of \nGovernment regulation and management.\n\n  We would all agree that there is certainly a role for safety and \nhealth and the like. But that has been growing at an astronomical \nlevel. It costs this family $7,000 a year. That is on top of the 38.2 \npercent.\n  On top of it--and I have dealt with this a couple times--when I tend \nto say they are forfeiting half their earned wages in Government costs \nand burden, well, 38.2 percent is actual tax, but there are more costs \nthan that. As a result, the burden on that family is just phenomenal, \nand it is leaving them in a condition that is very difficult.\n  I have been reading several statistics here. This is one that I find \nmost alarming. Net savings and investment average 10.7 percent of the \ngross domestic product. I will finish.\n  We have been joined by the Senator from Michigan who has been at the \nforefront of tax relief since his arrival in the U.S. Senate. I want to \nacknowledge him.\n  I just want to make this one last point, that savings and investment \nconstituted about 11 percent of the gross domestic product in the \n1960's and today it is 3.75 percent. That is where the capital to run \nthis economic engine comes from. That is where the protective device \nfor all these families is, in their savings. These burdens have pushed \nthose savings down to one-third of the level they were just 30 years \nago. And that is flirting with fire. That is making a family unable and \nthe Nation unable to protect itself.\n  Mr. President, I grant the balance of my time to the Senator from \nMichigan. I suspect that is about 4 minutes or so.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you very much, Mr. President. And I thank the \nSenator from Georgia for his continuing leadership in providing us \nopportunities to address issues of importance.\n  Today I am glad that we are talking about the burdens that face \nAmerican families, because young families confront a lot of challenges \nas we move to the end of this century and into the next one. In my own \nfamily, we have added a new member since the last time I spoke in this \nChamber, just yesterday afternoon. So we, as is the case with all other \nfamilies that are growing in number, are looking at the challenges we \nhave, and they are challenges in a variety of areas. One of them is \nobviously the financial challenges that new families and young families \nconfront.\n  When I am in my State of Michigan, and I suspect the same is true in \nGeorgia, Tennessee, or any other of the 50 States, what I hear from my \nconstituents, from working families, is a very common theme. It is the \ntheme that even though people seem to be working more they find they \nhave less and less to show for it. We have heard it described as a \nsqueeze on the middle class. We have heard it described in a variety of \nother ways, but we have heard it described consistently in my State for \na number of years.\n  I have sat down with the families to try to find out exactly why they \nfeel this way and what it is that has led to this situation. The very \nsimple fact is, Mr. President, a major reason why our working families \nare having a harder time making ends meet is that the tax burdens they \nare confronting, each going up at a pace that is faster than the family \nincome is going up. That, indeed is exactly the case for most people in \nAmerica. Indeed, during the last 3 to 4 years, family incomes have been \nabsolutely stagnant. Meanwhile, Federal taxes have been going up. In \nmany States, State taxes and local taxes have been going up, as well.\n  Indeed, it is interesting to note, Mr. President, that across the \nboard we see families confronting a higher and higher responsibility in \nterms of their paychecks headed to Washington than ever before. Right \nnow, the Federal tax burden is the largest portion of the family \nbudget, 26 percent, which is more than housing, food or education \ncosts. When you add on the burdens of State and local taxes, the \npercentage goes from 26 all the way up to 38 percent. When you think \nabout that, Mr. President, you think about almost 40 percent of the \naverage family's income being sent to government to pay for programs \nand services, you realize the extent to which families do feel the \ncrunch.\n\n[[Page S10011]]\n\n  The crunch has created a very interesting set of changes. It has \nmeant that where in the past one person was working was enough for the \nfamily to stay ahead of the game, today, often it is two people working \nat more than one job. At least in the case of the people of my State of \nMichigan the solution, it seems to me, is quite clear. Unless we are \ngoing to get to the point where families working two jobs and two \nbreadwinners working two jobs is inadequate to allow working families \nto keep up, we have to give them some relief. The one way the Federal \nGovernment can provide that relief is by reducing the tax burden that \nthese families face.\n  Mr. President, I do not have the time today nor do I intend today to \ngo into a variety of ways by which we can ease that burden. But I think \nthe kinds of plans that have been put forth by Bob Dole and Jack Kemp, \ncalling for across-the-board tax relief, combining that with a $500-\nper-child tax credit is a step in the right direction. I think that is \nwhat the families of Michigan, the families of America can benefit \nfrom.\n  I add, Mr. President, in closing, in our State of Michigan we reduced \ntaxes 21 times in the last 5 years. That has produced record levels of \nemployment and it has not caused a budget deficit. We have balanced the \nbudget and created a surplus at the same time. We need to give families \nthat relief. I look forward to working within the Senate to accomplish \nthat. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/06/senate-section/article/S10005-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO THE ABRAHAM FAMILY\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, I strongly support the actions of President \nClinton in responding to the latest round of the politics of aggression \nby the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein. The response by President \nClinton follows in the wise policy footsteps of President Bush by \ntaking strong action, and in acting as a leader of both the West and \nthe Middle East in responding to aggression.\n  To those who would doubt the necessity of the actions by the \nPresident, one should pose the question as to what the consequences \nwould be in the face of American inaction. First, clearly, no other \ncountry would take the lead. The signature of the current era is such \nthat response to aggression will not be taken up by other powers in the \nabsence of American leadership, unfortunately. This was the case in the \ninvasion of Kuwait. It was the case in Bosnia when, after several years \nof Western inaction in the face of ethnic atrocities in Bosnia, only \nthe United States, only the United States, could bring about a \ncredible, effective implementation of peace in that sorry part of \nEurope. While one should have rightfully expected the European nations \nto have led that effort, they did not, and would not, in the absence of \nAmerican leadership. The same is the case today in the Middle East. Our \nfriends and allies in Europe and the Middle East will not act in the \nabsence of American leadership.\n  It is American leadership which is decisive to the peace in these \nregions, and I commend President Clinton for his decisive action. It \nwas necessary to weaken the Iraqi leader's ability to intimidate his \nneighbors, and to make it clear that he will pay a price for his \naggression. As President Clinton stated, our action has changed the \nstrategic situation, with Saddam's military capabilities weakened in \nthe south of Iraq. If further actions are necessary to ensure the \nprotection of our pilots in the no-fly zone, then he will continue to \nhave my unstinting support. The President's actions have ensured that \nthe coalition which has acted to restrain and discipline Iraq since the \ninvasion of Kuwait remains viable and intact.\n  It has been stated on many occasions, during the Gulf war and most \nrecently by Secretary Perry in expressing the vital interests of the \nUnited States in the Middle East, that our policy is driven by the \nenergy security interests of the United States. Oil, oil, is the \nlifeblood of our industrial base, and both Western Europe and the \nUnited States, as well as Japan, are far too dependent on the Middle \nEast for supplies. We need to get serious about alternative sources of \nenergy, clean coal technology, other non-petroleum sources, and the \noverall development of alternative sources of oil.\n  A very important, world-class, alternative source of oil exists and \nawaits development in the Caspian Sea area. Following the break-up of \nthe Soviet Union, large oil resources are now available for commercial \ndevelopment. According to industry sources, some 42 billion barrels of \nproven oil reserves in this region are available for lifting and \ntransport to the west.\n  The oil pot of the region is estimated by American industry sources \nto be comparable to that of the vast Saudi Arabian fields, a potential \nof some 200 billion barrels of oil, and includes, as well, enormous \nnatural gas reserves. Some 2-4 million barrels of oil per day could be \nbrought out of the Caspian region, across Turkey by pipeline, and to \nthe United States market. These new reserves, in the newly independent \nstates of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, can bring \nsubstantial, rapid economic development to those nations, as well as to \nTurkey, on their western border. The riches of these reserves can bring \nnew stability and stable independence to those new nations. For the \nWest, Caspian Sea oil could help to diversify the world oil suppliers, \nstimulate price competition, and bring new security to our supplies.\n  Already, aggressive efforts have been underway by Western oil \ncompanies to develop this resource. In Azerbaijan, a $7.5 billion \ncontract with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company, a \nconsortium of 12 energy companies, including 5 U.S. companies, could \nproduce an estimated three billion barrels of crude oil over the next \ntwenty years. In Kazakhstan, there is a $20 billion joint venture \nbetween an American oil company and the Kazakh government which could \nyield as much as 9 billion barrels of crude oil over the next 40 years.\n  Nevertheless, the oil industry cannot by itself accomplish this \nachievement. The region has been in turmoil as a result of war between \nArmenia and Azerbaijan, with large disrupting movements of refugees, \nand there are constant political and other pressures from Russia and \nthe Islamic world bearing on the Caspian region. The resulting \ninstability requires increased involvement and commitment by the United \nStates Government for large scale projects to go forward. The power and \nthe influence of the United States Government are necessary to \naccomplish the development of an assured supply of petroleum resources \nto the West. I believe this should be a major priority for the next \nadministration. The stakes, both economic and strategic, are enormous.\n   Mr. President, Caspian region oil can be transhipped by pipeline \nacross Turkey, avoiding politically fragile routes through the Middle \nEast or through an unpredictable Russia. Turkey is enthusiastic about \nthis prospect and is ready and able to cooperate with America to make \nthe development of this major new alternative oil source available to \nthe United States. We should not forget, as we so often forget, the \ncontribution of Turkey to the Western anti-Saddam alliance. It was \nTurkey which\n\n[[Page S10012]]\n\nshut down the Iraqi pipeline in 1990, at the request of the United \nNations, after Saddam invaded Kuwait. Turkey has continued to keep this \npipeline shut down, a great economic loss to Turkey and her people. We \nforget that. Thus, the development of Caspian Sea region oil is an \nopportunity to repay Turkey and help her stabilize her economy at the \nsame time that America can develop a new and secure supply of this \nvital resource. Mr. President, I believe the United States must make an \naggressive, fresh commitment to securing new oil supplies, a commitment \nequal to that we have made in responding to military aggression in the \nMiddle East. The two efforts should go hand in hand. They are part of \nthe same geostrategic calculation and interest. We need to move ahead \nnow to reduce our dependency on vulnerable Middle East oil. A major new \ngovernment-industry partnership to develop the promising Caspian region \nis long overdue and has the potential of a great energy payoff for the \nUnited States of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been speaking a number of times \non why Africa matters to the United States. I spoke before the recess \non infectious disease and environmental concerns and how what is \nhappening in Africa can affect the rest of the world, and the United \nStates as well.\n  Today, I would like to address a broader point about environmental \nissues--what happens to the natural world in Africa holds consequences \nfor Americans. Even as we struggle to find reasonable, responsible \nsolutions to domestic environmental problems, we must remember that our \nfuture is closely intertwined with the preservation and sound \nmanagement of the environment around the world--particularly in Africa.\n  Today much of Africa today is caught in a cycle of environmental \ndegradation, poverty and humanitarian crises. Battles over scarce \nresources can lead to political conflict, which in turn results in \nforced migration, and further environmental destruction. As a result, \nthe international community feels the effects of not only global \nenvironmental changes, but also refugee flows, instability, and sagging \ntrade revenues.\n  Mr. President, the evidence of environmental degradation on the \nAfrican continent is overwhelming. From deforestation to land \ndegradation, the shrinking diversity of African plant life to the \nincreasing number of endangered species, the African environment \naffects the United States.\n\n\n                             deforestation\n\n  Let me begin with the most shocking of all the environmental problems \nsweeping the continent--deforestation. Consider the following:\n  In 1900, forests accounted for 40 percent of the highlands in the \nHorn of Africa. By 1990, only 4.4 percent of these forested highlands \nremained.\n  In 1961, as much as 60 percent of the west African nation of Sierra \nLeone was covered by primary rainforest. Today, that figure has dropped \nto 6 percent.\n  These are but two examples of what is an all-too-familiar pattern on \nthe continent. And because Africa's population is projected to increase \nby over 50 percent as early as 2010, the pressures on remaining forest \nlands are likely to grow as people seek new land to live on, new fields \nto cultivate, and new sources of firewood for cooking and heating.\n  The immediate consequences of deforestation are soil erosion and \nflooding. Combined with other forms of land degradation, these trends \nlead to food shortages and massive displaced populations. Some experts \nbelieve that severe desertification will affect more than 100 million \npeople on the continent by 2010. Already, food shortages threaten 22 \nmillion people in sub-Saharan Africa. Trapped in a cycle of poverty and \nneed, these people will continue to destroy their natural environment \nin a desperate effort to survive.\n  Unless we recognize the larger environmental factors that create and \nexacerbate crises, the United States will continue to operate in a \nreactive mode, addressing tragic and costly emergencies and famines \nafter they occur, and watching potentially strong societies and markets \ndescend into disaster.\n  The consequences of ignoring environmental issues in Africa extend \nbeyond humanitarian and economic concerns. Africa's forests, like those \nin South America, act as carbon sinks--absorbing harmful carbon \nemissions. As global population rates grow, rural-to-urban migration \ncontinues, and more and more people drive cars, our capacity to manage \nair pollution here in the United States and around the world may depend \non the survival of these forests.\n\n\n                              biodiversity\n\n  Mr. President, in addition to these disturbing trends in land \nquality, biodiversity depletion in Africa also impacts our future--\nparticularly in the field of medicine. Over and over again, researchers \nhave found highly effective cures in the forests of Africa:\n  Some may smile at this. But this is scientific research that shows, \nas a matter of fact, that the rosy periwinkle that grows in Madagascar \nis highly effective in treating Hodgkin's disease and leukemia.\n  Bark from the African plum tree has proven successful in treating \nenlarged prostate glands. Yet, in the 1980's, environmental \nmismanagement in west Africa brought the region's plum trees \ndangerously close to extinction.\n  We cannot know what other cures may be contained in Africa's rapidly \ndisappearing forest lands--and never will unless more is done to combat \nthe environmental destruction sweeping the continent.\n  Mr. President, just as environmental degradation puts the future of \nmedical research at risk, we cannot begin to guess at what agricultural \nbreakthroughs may never occur as the diversity of African crops is lost \nto environmental crises. For example, we have already learned:\n  Germplasm from African crops may help the rest of the world to adjust \nto climate changes by breeding drought-resistant varieties of grain.\n  Researchers at the National Academy of Sciences have identified pearl \nmillet, which grows mainly in west Africa, as a potential jewel for \ngenetic research, due its natural genetic diversity, robust nature, and \nquick maturation.\n  The African Continent may be home to other, lesser known agricultural \nbreakthroughs that will contribute to global well-being, provided they \ndo not fall victim to the environmental devastation.\n  Mr. President, in recent years, the international community and \nAfricans have become increasingly concerned about threats to animal \nkingdom diversity. Poaching, human encroachment on animals' natural \nhabitats, and ineffective wildlife management continue to endanger \nseveral unique species. While African elephants appear to be making a \ncomeback, black rhinos remain in danger, as do cheetahs, mountain \ngorillas, and other magnificent species of wildlife. A basic respect \nfor life and an appreciation for its diverse forms demands that we \nrecognize and address the problem of endangered species on the African \nContinent.\n  Mr. President, all of these trends, as well as the relationship \nbetween environmental upheaval and emerging diseases that I discussed \nearlier, make the case for a thoughtful and engaged foreign policy \ntoward Africa.\n  Responsible and creative environmental policies in Africa--including \nland management, agroforestry initiatives, pollution reduction, and \nbiodiversity preservation--serve U.S. national interests. With patience \nand engagement, we gain new cures for painful diseases and new crops to \nfeed our children into the 21st century. We preserve the magnificent \ndiversity of animal life for our grandchildren. And we help bring \nstability, development and economic growth to the African Continent.\n  We can't do this all by ourselves. That would not be successful \npolicy in and of itself. But we should be mindful of the fact that it \ndoes influence the United States and other nations and other continents \naround the world. And that is why we should be concerned.\n\n[[Page S10013]]\n\n  Both Africans and Americans have a great deal to lose--and perhaps \neven more to gain--by addressing environmental issues on the African \nContinent. These are not easy issues, but we must proceed as we would \nwith any long-term security concern--with sensitivity, determination, \nand wisdom. If we do so, generations of Africans--and Americans--will \nbenefit from a sustainable, diverse, and thriving natural world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and appreciate the opportunity to \nspeak on this issue at this time.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 20 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

She just finished a discussion on a foreign policy issue, \nbut I did want to say while I am in the Chamber and she is in the \nChamber that this institution is going to miss her service.\n  There is a lot of discussion these days about the bickering between \nRepublicans and Democrats, and the American people do not like to see \nthat; they want to see a Congress that serves the interests of the \nAmerican people. They want to see Democrats and Republicans think \nthrough ideas and work together to find the right course for our \nfuture.\n  Senator Kassebaum is one of those people in Congress, recognized by \neveryone serving here as an extraordinary Senator who cares a great \ndeal about this country and has contributed immensely to this country's \nbetterment. I for one have felt privileged to serve with her in the \nSenate while I have been here, and I will miss her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/06/senate-section/article/S10013-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10013-S10016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A COMPETITION OF IDEAS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I mention the issue of ideas. It is a \nPresidential year. The Constitution of our country, drafted a couple of \nhundred years ago in a little room over in Constitution Hall by the \nFramers of the Constitution, described that every even-numbered year in \nour country the American people would grab the steering wheel and have \nan election and the American people would decide in which direction \nthis country moved. It was not going to be a decision by a bunch of \nelitists, a bunch of big business folks, a bunch of labor people, a \nbunch of investors. It was going to be a decision by the American \npeople to grab the American steering wheel with their vote and decide \nwhich way this country would move. It was quite an extraordinary thing. \nThe late Claude Pepper used to call it the miracle in the Constitution \nevery even-numbered year.\n  What I expect the Framers of this democracy hoped would be is that in \nthese elections we would have a competition of ideas, ideas advanced by \ndifferent candidates from different positions, saying this is what we \nbelieve will advance the interests of our country. This is what we \nbelieve will improve America.\n  Regrettably, American politics and American elections have become \nmuch less a competition of ideas than a competition of slash and burn, \n30-second ads telling the American people or people in a State or \ndistrict how awful someone might be, how terrible someone has been, \ninstead of what are my ideas, what do I think will improve this \ncountry.\n  I hope this election will be different. I guess there is no reason to \nbelieve it will be different until the American people decide to change \nelections in this country by saying to those who wage negative \ncampaigns that we will not vote for you.\n\n  The minute negative campaigns do not work they will not be used. \nPeople use what works. Negative campaigns work, and they are used \nextensively, with great devastating effect in our country these days.\n  There was a debate about 2 years ago in a congressional district that \nI read about that I thought was quite fascinating. The two candidates \nfor Congress came to the debate and were told by the debate organizers, \nby the way, we have a very simple, unusual rule that you will have to \nadhere to. The rule is in this debate between two people aspiring to be \nMembers of Congress, you may not mention your opponent. You may not be \ncritical of the other person in the debate, requiring therefore in this \ndebate for you to spend your time telling the people what it is you \nstand for, what it is you intend to fight for, what you believe in.\n  I understand it was a fascinating discussion because it moved from a \ndebate about which is the worst candidate to a debate about ideas, a \ncompetition of ideas and issues. I would like to see if we cannot get \nour political system back to a description of that kind of politics.\n  Having said all that, I am going to talk a little about the tax cut \nproposal offered by Senator Dole, not because I think Senator Dole is a \nbad candidate. I do not. I disagree with the ideas he is proposing, and \nI am going to describe why. Then I am going to talk about the ideas I \nthink ought to be proposed to make this a better country.\n  I have said many times and will again now that Senator Dole was a \nremarkable Senator and contributed a great deal to this country in his \npublic service. I happen to think Jack Kemp was an excellent public \nservant and has contributed a lot to this country. It is a credible \nteam competing for the Presidency. I happen to disagree with the \ncentral idea on which they are running. I am going to talk a little \nabout it and then talk about what I think we ought to be discussing.\n  The proposal that is advanced first and foremost is an across-the-\nboard tax cut. It is, 2 months from the election, a proposal that says \nvote for us because we propose a 15-percent across-the-board tax cut.\n  That sounds attractive, and if we were not bound by issues like you \nshould not increase the Federal deficit, I would propose a 25- or 50-\npercent tax cut. Why settle for 15? Why not propose a 50-percent tax \ncut or 75-percent tax cut? But we are bound by something else. We are \nbound by a requirement that we have a fiscal policy that is in some \nreasonable balance.\n  We are told that a proposal for a 15-percent across-the-board tax cut \nwill result in a substantial benefit to all Americans and a balanced \nbudget as well--a deficit that is coming down to a balance.\n  I was thinking about that last evening, and I thought I would show my \ncolleagues what some feel is believable in our country.\n  I receive a lot of mail, as do all Americans. You open your postal \nbox these days, and it is full of all kinds of unsolicited mail. Here \nis a letter I got from Dorothy Addeao. I do not know Dorothy Addeao \nfrom a cord of wood, never met her, never heard of her before. But she \nwrote to me to say this: ``It's my pleasure to be the bearer of glad \ntidings. In just 5 weeks, we are scheduled to announce Byron L. \nDorgan''--that is me--``is the winner of the 1995 $10 million super \nprize in Publisher's Clearing House.''\n  Now, it was not that she just wrote to me and said that they were \ngoing to announce that I had won $10 million, the super prize. She also \nsent me a certificate, and it is stamped, has my name right here. It \nsays, ``$10 million.'' My number by the way was 00016780.\n  Then she signed it.\n  That was not all. I mean, that is pretty improbable, I suppose, that \nsomeone would write to me and tell me I won $10 million.\n  But I got another letter. This one was from Sweepstakes Priority. \nThey told me that Byron Dorgan wins a Hawaiian vacation and a new Lexus \nautomobile. They have a number on it, and they said the Lexus \nautomobile is set aside for my use, mine free. I thought that is pretty \nimprobable--you win $10 million and then a trip to Hawaii and a Lexus.\n  Then I got a letter from Time magazine, down in Tampa, FL. It says, \n``The results are in. Byron L. Dorgan''--that is me again--``has won \none of our two latest $1,666,675.00 prizes.'' And then underneath it \nsays, ``Byron L. Dorgan, winner, $1,666,675.00,'' and then it says, \n``payment ready. Elizabeth Matthews.'' I do not know Elizabeth Matthews \nfrom a cord of wood; never met her. But out of the blue she tells me I \nwon $1.6 million.\n\n[[Page S10014]]\n\n  If that was not enough, not knowing Ed McMahon or Dick Clark, having \nnever met either, or never having received mail from either, they wrote \nme and said, ``Byron Dorgan, it's confirmed, you are our new \n$10,000,000 winner.''\n  All of this for me.\n  As you can see, I have not opened these letters. We have certain gift \nrules in the Senate. I think it is a $50 gift rule, and I felt I did \nnot want to compromise anything here, so I have not mailed this thing \nin. But it looks to me like we are talking about $21,600,000, a trip to \nHawaii, and a new Lexus.\n  Improbable? Yes. I think all Americans know what I am talking about. \nI imagine there are 250 million winners of this $21 million and the \nLexus and the trip to Hawaii. But I suppose that if Dorothy--is that \nher name? Yes, Dorothy--and Elizabeth and Time magazine and Ed McMahon \nand Dick Clark believe that I and millions of others will think we have \nwon millions of dollars, I suppose there is a reason to believe, in our \npolitical system, that one can propose we will balance the budget by \nincreasing defense spending and proposing substantial across-the-board \ntax cuts. After all, it has been done before and some believed it \nbefore.\n  It is not much more credible than this. I kind of like Ed McMahon. I \nhave not seen him for a while, but I used to like him on the ``Tonight \nShow.''\n  The proposal of an across-the-board tax cut, which sounds attractive, \nand I think most people would enjoy having, and that with an across-\nthe-board cut in revenue, you will balance the budget, it could just as \nwell be proposed by Ed McMahon telling us there is an easy way to solve \nproblems. If your family has a deficit problem, you are spending more \nincome than you have, what is the solution? Cut your income.\n  Let me, if I might, suggest that I think we need to cut our \nexpenditures, and we have, and the deficit has been reduced 4 years in \na row; the first time in 40 years, 4 years in a row, the deficit has \nbeen reduced. It was cut in half. Was it because those who now propose \na tax cut did something to make that happen? No, we did not get one \nvote to help us do that, not one, not even by accident.\n  Those of us on this side of the aisle, including some who are no \nlonger here, who lost their jobs because of it, voted to cut Federal \nspending and, yes, raise some taxes on the higher income people in this \ncountry. The result is, since that proposal, a very substantial \nreduction in the Federal budget deficit. I voted for that.\n\n  Was it popular? No. Would it have been politically better to vote \nagainst it? Yes, of course. I voted for it, and I am pleased I did \nbecause it was the right thing to do. But the deficit is not erased or \neliminated. The deficit has come down 4 years in a row. It has been cut \nin half, but it is not gone and the job is not done. The remainder of \nthe job is to reduce that budget deficit to zero, to balance the \nbudget, balance what we are bringing in with what we are spending so we \nare not saddling our children and grandchildren with debt as a result \nof our consumption today.\n  That job is not done and that is why these proposals, 60 days before \nthe election, for across-the-board tax cuts sound very attractive but \nare not going to be good for the American people and good for this \ncountry if we really want to balance the Federal budget.\n  Yesterday we held a hearing in the Senate--the Democratic Policy \nCommittee held a hearing. I want to share with my colleagues some of \nthe testimony at this hearing. Benjamin Friedman, he is the William \nJoseph Maier professor of Political Economy at Harvard University, \nBenjamin Friedman says:\n\n       The Dole-Kemp proposal is a reprise of a gamble that \n     failed. Our government tried that idea in the 1980's. The \n     result was record-sized budget deficits, borrowing, and \n     higher real interest rates, reduced investment and \n     disappointing productivity. And it left behind a legacy of \n     swollen government debt, a shrunken capital stock, depressed \n     productivity, and a large net balance that we now owe to \n     foreigners.\n\n  It is 20 years of testimony telling us why this would not be good for \nour country.\n  Dr. Joel Prakken, chairman, macroeconomic adviser, in many pages of \ntestimony, tells us the same thing. This is a proposal that does not \nadd up. This is a proposal that will increase the Federal deficit. It \ndoes not add up, and it is not good for this country.\n  Charles Schultze, the Brookings Institution, testifies with exactly \nthe same kind of testimony. First-rate economist, great economist, \ntelling us this does not add up. Joel Prakken, Richard Cogan, all of \nthem say this does not add up.\n  We are talking about a proposal for a tax cut. I would like to see a \ntax cut in this country, when we finish the job of balancing the \nbudget. Then we ought to talk about our tax system, and the tax cuts \nought to go to working families in this country.\n  I saw in the paper this morning Jack Kemp. I like Jack. He is a \nfriend of mine, a good guy. ``Kemp Records Show Big Jump in Income, \nCandidate Has Earned $2 Million a Year Since Leaving Government.'' No \nwonder he smiles all the time. I wondered why he is always smiling, \nalways so optimistic. With $2 million a year, you understand a little \nbit where people come from who are out there pushing for a flat tax or \ntax cuts. If you are making $2 million a year, I suppose you have a \nsubstantial interest in that.\n  But I think, honestly, we would be better off addressing, perhaps, \nsome targeted areas where we might be of help, in education, tax cuts, \nin some other areas, although I would prefer even to wait on most of \nthose until we have solved the deficit problem completely. Let us not \nleave this job when it is half done. Let us finish the job of \neliminating the budget deficit. This job is half done. Let us finish \nthe job, and then let us talk about the Tax Code, and there is plenty \nto talk about in the Tax Code and plenty of changes we ought to make.\n  Let me just, for a couple of minutes, talk about the things I hope we \nwill hear about in the Presidential campaign, things other than a tax \ncut. I hope that one of the central questions in this campaign, and it \nought to be a central question in the Presidential campaign in this \ncountry, is: What about America's education system?\n  Is there anything that is more important to this country's future \nthan its education system? Does anyone believe America's future is \naffected by anything more than it is affected by our education system?\n  Thomas Jefferson said, anyone who believes a country can be both \nignorant and free believes in something that never was and never can \nbe. This country ought to aspire and our Presidential contest ought to \naspire to have the finest education system in the world and debate \npolicies that will accomplish that.\n  What kind of policies will accomplish us having the best education \nsystem in the world, the feeling that at the end of the day we have \nsent our kids to the best schools anywhere in the world? There is some \nevidence that in some areas we have the best schools in the world. If \nyou want to go to world class universities, most of them are in the \nUnited States, not elsewhere.\n  We don't see people boarding planes to get educated elsewhere. \nAmerica has most of the major world class universities in this country. \nThere is a lot to commend this country's education system, and there is \na lot to criticize.\n  The central question, however, ought to be as we compete with shrewd, \ntough international competitors for economic growth and jobs and \nexpanded economies in the future--and I am including Japan, Germany, \nand others--the central question is how do we do that in our education \nsystem?\n  In Japan and Germany and other countries, kids are going to school \n240 days a year; in our country, 180 days a year. I can go through a \nlitany of things that concern us relative to the question of \ncompetition and whether we are keeping pace in the education system. \nBut I do know this. No one advances this country's education system by \nbelieving that we ought to decide to cut back on Pell grants, cut back \non guaranteed student loans, decide to underfund the opportunity for \nkids to get an education.\n  No one I know does a service by standing in this well of the Senate \nsying, ``By the way, tomorrow is Tax Freedom Day. The burden of paying \ntaxes is now lifted from my shoulders. Hosanna.''\n  I stand up and wonder, why do you consider it a burden to pay taxes \nto have a school your child can attend. Do you really consider it a \nburden to send\n\n[[Page S10015]]\n\nyour kid to school? I happen to consider it an opportunity. Do I like \npaying taxes? No. Do I believe paying taxes to build good schools to \neducate my children represents a good investment for me and my country? \nAbsolutely.\n  I have two kids in school this afternoon, and they are wonderful \nyoung children who I want to have the best education in the world. They \nare in a public school system. It is a good public school system. Both \nhave good teachers, and we do not advance the interests of that \neducation system by tearing down those teachers.\n  The way you fix an education system, the way an education system can \nwork is if you have a parent who cares about their child's education, a \nchild that is willing to learn and a teacher who really knows how to \nteach. Those combinations mean that kids advance in our school system \nand become the very best they can be.\n  Last evening, I, like a lot of parents, put my children to bed by \nreading them a story. We do that every evening, but there are a lot of \nkids in this country, a lot of children in this country who have no one \nto read them a story. They have no books to read. Some have no bed to \nsleep in. Some I described before, like David Bright, age 10, a young \nman who lived in a homeless shelter in New York, told us some can't do \nwell in school because they are hungry. David said, ``No child like me \nshould have to put their head down on their desk in the middle of the \nday at school because it hurts to be hungry.''\n\n  How do you learn in that environment? Those are the issues we ought \nto discuss in the Presidential campaign.\n  What about our education system, not just for kids who are \nprivileged, but for all children? This country does not move ahead by \nleaving some behind. What do we do about our education system to make \nit the best in the world and to guarantee that it is available for all \nAmericans?\n  I think it is interesting that we hear now on the news and read in \nthe newspapers about an athlete who is 7 feet 2 inches tall who can \ndunk a basketball. He is going to be paid $115 million over 7 years to \nplay basketball. Do you know what $115 million will pay for? Nearly \n4,000 elementary schoolteachers, for one 7-foot-2-inch basketball \nplayer. Think of what historians will understand about that 100 years \nfrom now looking back and trying to understand what was our value \nsystem.\n  The point of all this is to say I hope that the Presidential campaign \ncenters not just around an idea about a tax cut that is going to \nincrease the deficit and retard our economic future, but the ideas of \neducation, what do we do about advancing our education system, \ninvesting in education, making our education system the best in the \nworld.\n  How about crime? Let's have a Presidential campaign waged on the \nissue of what really to do about crime. We have done a lot, and \nRepublicans and Democrats have joined together to do a fair amount on \nthe issue of crime. But much remains to be done, and some simple things \ncan be done.\n  We ought to distinguish instantly, right now, in both the Federal \nsystem and in the State and local criminal justice system, that there \nis a difference between those who commit violent acts and those who do \nnot. Those who commit violent acts we send to prison in order to keep \nthem away from others, to provide for the safety of other Americans, as \nwell as to punish them.\n  We ought to decide immediately those who commit violent acts in this \ncountry will go to prison and not get out before the end of their term. \nPeriod. People who commit violent crimes ought not get time off for \ngood behavior, early release, early parole. People who commit violent \ncrimes in the Federal system and the State and local justice system \nought to stay in prison until the end of their term. I can cite chapter \nand verse about dozens of murders.\n  In fact, there are 3,000 murders that have recently been committed by \npeople who should have been in jail but let out early to murder 3,000 \ninnocent Americans. We ought to make a decision on dealing with violent \ncriminals in this country in a manner differently than we deal with \nother criminals.\n  We ought to have instantly in this country a decision by our entire \ncountry that we will put on a computer list the name and the record of \neveryone who has committed a felony in America. If you go downtown and \nbuy a shirt in the department store, they will run your credit card \nthrough a magnetic imager, and they will find out in 20 seconds whether \nyour credit card is good.\n  There is nowhere in America you can type in the name of an individual \nand find out if this individual has committed 6, 8, 10 felonies in 5 \ndifferent States, because we do not have a composite list of criminals \nwho committed felonies in this country. We have a list, the NCIC, at \nthe FBI. It does not contain 80 percent of the records it would have to \ncontain to be an accurate list of an updated computer list of all those \nwho committed felonies in our country. We ought to have that.\n  Crime ought to be part of the Presidential campaign. How we address \ncrime ought to be the competition of ideas in a Presidential campaign.\n  Jobs. That also ought to be part of the Presidential campaign. I \nintend to offer a proposal which I offered before which the Senate has \nrejected. It is a very simple little proposal.\n  We have a tax incentive in this country that is $2.2 billion in tax \nforgiveness for companies who move American jobs overseas. Now, is \nthere any reason, can anyone sober in this country give me one reason \nthat we ought to have any incentive at all for any company to move jobs \nfrom America to a foreign country?\n  Can anyone give me one reason for that? If so, I would like to hear \nit. And if not, we ought to change the Tax Code to stop providing tax \nincentives for those who move jobs out of this country.\n  Why does that proposal fail when it comes to the floor of the Senate? \nBecause the biggest corporations in America lobby furiously to keep \nthat tax break. They lobby furiously to keep it, and they are all over \nthis town now rallying to defeat a proposal like that once again.\n  I hope we will have a discussion about values in the Presidential \ncampaign. In fact, Senator Dole and President Clinton have talked about \ntelevision, the menu of violence and trash on television that is \noffered to our children. Does that advance the interests of our \nchildren? No. Do I believe in censorship? No, I don't, but I believe in \nresponsibility, and there are things we can do in this country as \nparents, as communities and, yes, even as a U.S. Senate and, hopefully, \nas President to deal with this issue of what is television doing in \nthis country to our children.\n  It is one thing to entertain adults. It is another thing to entertain \nadults and hurt our children at the same time. You all know the \nstatistics that persuaded a number of us, including my colleagues, \nSenator Conrad from North Dakota, Senator Simon, and others to push a \nbill providing for a V-chip and to push bills providing for television \nviolence report cards and other issues to deal with this matter. Some \ncry censorship. It has nothing to do with censorship. I am not \ninterested in censoring. I am interested in providing there be \nresponsibility by people who produce this and send it into our living \nroom and to our children.\n  Let me just conclude. I wanted to visit a bit today about the tax \nproposals because a number of Members of the Senate came, in a rather \norchestrated attempt today, to make a case for it. I understand the \ncase, and I just disagree with it. I want to just finish with another \ncomment.\n  I had some town meetings recently during the August break in North \nDakota. In the middle of them, I suggested that while we would likely \nspend a fair amount of time at the town meeting talking about what was \nwrong, what was broken, what needed fixing, what did not work, and why \nAmerica was moving backward, I said, let us do something else, just for \na few minutes, let us train ourselves to think just for a minute, why \ndo some people talk about building a fence to keep people out of \nAmerica because too many people want to come here? Why would that be? \nBecause this country is a remarkable beacon of hope for the rest of the \npeople around the world. They see it as a country full of opportunity, \nand they all want to come here.\n  If that is the case, we must be a country full of things that work \nand we must be a country full of good news as well. So I have told the \ntown meetings at times, let us spend the next 30 minutes talking about \nwhat works, just for\n\n[[Page S10016]]\n\na moment let us think about what works in this country, what is good in \nyour life, in your home, in your family, in your community, your city, \nwhat is good in the Federal Government, what programs work, what makes \nlife better.\n  It is fascinating, once you start thinking in those terms, how you \nget people to start evaluating what is of value. You never think about \nthe kind of road system we have in this country. But drive anywhere \nelse in the world, and then drive in most parts of this country and \ntake a look at the transportation system. Mail a letter in Tegucigalpa \nor Krakow, and then mail a letter in Chicago, and see which postal \nsystem gets it there. I mean, I could go through chapter and verse of \nthe discussions.\n  One woman at a town meeting said to me, ``Well, I'll tell you what \nworks, my son's teacher. She called me and had a long discussion with \nme about the circumstances of my son in her class and really helped us \na great deal. He has a wonderful teacher.'' I said, ``Have you called \nthe teacher and told her how you feel about that? You ought to do \nthat.'' But it is a fascinating thing to discuss, not about what is \nwrong, but about what is right, not what needs fixing--and we spend \nalmost all of our time on that--but what works in this country.\n  I hope in the context also of these political campaigns we can engage \nin a bit of hope and a description of opportunity in a way that \nemphasizes the good things, not just what is wrong.\n  I talked about Jack Kemp. Jack Kemp is an effervescent optimist. We \nneed more effervescent optimists talking about the potential of this \ncountry and the future of this country. If I did not think that we were \ngoing to have a better future and that our best days are still ahead of \nus, I would hardly have the energy to be in public service. But I, \nevery single day, take a look at my 9-year-old son who trudges off to \nschool now in September, and I think, what a remarkable opportunity it \nis for us to be here, for him to go to that school, what a remarkable \nopportunity he is going to have, hopefully in a country that is going \nto continue to lead the way in this world.\n  This week, this President took action in Iraq. I know there is a real \ndisconnection. People say, what on Earth do we have to do with Iraq? \nThis country is a world leader, and it will be a world leader, and it \nmust take responsible action in dealing with international outlaws like \nSaddam Hussein. And we will, it seems to me, under the stewardship of \nDemocrats and Republicans who come together at the right time, \nbelieving through aggressive debate we can find better ways and we can \nfind things that at the end of the day when the dust settles that will \nadvance this country's standard of living, we will continue to maintain \na country that most people see as the beacon of hope all around the \nglobe.\n\n  Mr. President, I have covered a fair amount of ground. And I notice \nmy colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, is here, and other colleagues \nI believe are coming to speak on other issues. I intend to continue to \nvisit about a couple of these issues next Monday. But with that, I \nyield the floor. I thank the President for his attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/06/senate-section/article/S10013-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  (During today's session of the Senate, the following morning business \nwas transacted.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/06/senate-section/article/S10016-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               EXPLANATION OF VOTE--SENATE RESOLUTION 288\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last evening my vote was the only negative \nvote on the resolution relating to the President's military \nintervention earlier this week in Iraq. As there was little if any time \nlast night to explain the reason for that vote, I intend to do it at \nthis time.\n  It is the conventional wisdom, led perhaps by the President of the \nUnited States, that George Bush severely erred in not completing the \nwar in the gulf against Iraq by the total defeat of its armed forces \nand the replacement of the Saddam Hussein government. Because I did not \nmake such a criticism at the time, I do not join in that criticism now \nand regard it as essentially irrelevant to the activities of this week.\n  President Clinton, when he took that office, inherited the situation \nas it existed then, when that was no longer a real possibility. Since \ntaking office, however, President Clinton's policies have caused the \ndeterioration, if not the entire unraveling, of the coalition that was \nput together against Iraq at the time of the war in the gulf. Most \nparticularly, his administration's indifference to the peculiar burdens \nimposed upon our ally, Turkey, and the particular problems and \nchallenges that it faces, have caused us to be in a position in which \nwe have been unable to use our bases in that country for any kind of \nresponse to Iraq. In fact, the coalition has unraveled to such an \nextent that we were not permitted to use the bases of any of our allies \nother than the United Kingdom in that response.\n  Earlier this summer we totally and completely ignored an incursion by \nIranian forces, aimed to support its Kurdish partisans, into Iraq, \nacross an international border. Earlier this summer we completely \nignored Iraq's defiance of a U.N. search for prohibited weapons, both \nchemical and nuclear in nature.\n  Nevertheless, we did respond in a military fashion to a contest \nbetween Iraqi-backed Kurds and Iranian-backed Kurds earlier this week, \nand we responded, Mr. President, in a totally inappropriate fashion.\n  It seems to this Senator that at the time of the recent Iraqi \nincursion in support of its own faction in Kurdistan, we had \nessentially two choices: We could have made the choice that we have no \ndog in that fight, that there was no favorite in a contest between a \ngroup backed by Iran and a group backed by Iraq. On the other hand, we \ncould have responded militarily by showing that aggression does not \npay. Under those circumstances, however, the only appropriate military \nresponse would be one which would exact a price substantially greater \nthan the hoped-for goals of the aggression itself on the part of Iraq.\n  We did neither. We responded to this fight among Kurdish partisans in \na way that could not possibly help the victims of that Iraqi \naggression. In fact, we clearly stated that we were not attempting to \nreverse what Saddam Hussein was doing in the northern part of his own \ncountry.\n  The net result is this: The net result is that Iraq has regained \ncontrol over much of Iraqi Kurdistan. It has slaughtered its rebels, \nmany of whom were under our implicit protection and have been abandoned \nby us. It has shown the United States to be a paper tiger. And what \ncost has it paid, Mr. President? A handful of radar sites.\n  We have been abandoned by all of our allies in the Middle East, none \nof whom was willing to publicly support our military response. We have \nbeen repudiated by France with respect to our new no-flight zone. Our \nPresident has now terminated the military adventure and has proclaimed \nvictory.\n  Mr. President, a few more victories like this and we will be \nannouncing a no-flight zone over Riyadh.\n  The best analogy I can think of is this one: It is as if the Mayor of \nthe District of Columbia was warned of an incipient drug war in some \npart of this city and expressed severe warnings against any violence in \nconnection with that drug war. Faced with great violence and a number \nof murders, the Mayor then imposed $100 fines on each one of the \nmurderers and announced that the drug war was over and that the streets \nof Washington, DC, were safe. That, in effect, has been what our \nresponse was.\n  Mr. President, the United States has been defeated and humiliated. We \nhave added to the instability of the Middle East and have whetted \nSaddam Hussein's appetite for further adventures.\n  No consultation, no advance notification was given to any Member of \nCongress in connection with this adventure. Under the circumstances, \nMr. President, I do not believe that any resolution of support, even \none so cautious, so reluctant, so absent in praise as the one passing \nlast night was warranted.\n  I believe that within a short period of time, a majority of my \ncolleagues will wish that they had voted the way in which I voted last \nnight. It was an inappropriate resolution, an inappropriate response to \nan inappropriate action on the part of the President of the United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/06/senate-section/article/S10016-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S10017]]\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend chapter 3 of title 28, United States Code, \nto provide for 11 circuit judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               united states court of appeals legislation\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which \nwill abolish the 12th seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \ncircuit. This is the right thing to do. I have studied the D.C. circuit \nin depth for over a year now, and I can confidently conclude that the \nD.C. circuit does not need 12 judges.\n  Last year, I chaired a hearing before the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nadministrative oversight and the courts. At the hearing, Judge Lawrence \nSilberman--who sits on that court--testified that 12 judges were just \ntoo many. According to Judge Silberman, when the D.C. circuit has 12 \njudges, there isn't enough work to go around. In fact, the main \ncourtroom in the D.C. courthouse does not fit 12 judges. When there are \n12 judges, special arrangements have to be made when the court sits in \na en banc capacity.\n  Judge Silberman's testimony is supported by the steady decrease in \nnew cases filed in the D.C. circuit. Since 1985, the number of new case \nfilings in the D.C. circuit has declined precipitously. Even those who \nsupport filling the 12th seat admit this. And the D.C. circuit is only \nentitled to a maximum of 10 judges under the judicial conference's \nformula for determining how many judges should be allotted to each \ncourt.\n  So the case against filling the 12th seat is compelling. Now that \nJudge Buckley on the D.C. circuit has taken senior status, we, in \nCongress, have a unique opportunity. Let's abolish the 12th seat.\n  Abolishing the 12th seat is completely nonpartisan. If the 12th seat \nis abolished, no President--Democrat or Republican--could fill it. As \nlong as the 12th seat is open, the temptation to nominate someone to \nfill the seat will be overwhelming--even with the outrageous cost to \nthe American taxpayer.\n  According to the Federal judges themselves, the total cost to the \nAmerican taxpayer for a single article 3 judge is about $18 million. \nThat's not chump change. That's something to look at. That's real money \nwe can save.\n  Here in Congress, we have downsized committees and eliminated \nentirely important support agencies like the Office of Technology \nAssessment. The same is true of the executive branch. Right now, \nCongress is considering the elimination of whole Cabinet posts. It is \nagainst this backdrop that, as chairman of the subcommittee with \njurisdiction over the courts, I have been looking for ways to make sure \nthat precious taxpayer dollars are spent wisely. Eliminating the 12th \nseat is an important step in the right direction.\n  While some may incorrectly question Congress' authority to look into \nthese matters, this legislation is, in fact, on firm constitutional \nground. Article 3 of the Constitution gives Congress broad authority \nover the lower Federal courts. Also, the Constitution gives Congress \nthe power of the purse.\n  Throughout my career, I have taken this responsibility very \nseriously. I, too, am a taxpayer, and I want to make sure that taxpayer \nfunds aren't wasted.\n  Some may say that Congress should let judges decide how many \njudgeships should exist and how they should be allocated. I agree that \nwe should defer to\n\n[[Page S10019]]\n\nthe Judicial Conference to some degree. However, there have been \nnumerous occasions in the past where Congress has added judgeships \nwithout the approval of the Judicial Conference. In 1990, the last time \nwe created judgeships, the Congress created judgeships in Delaware, the \nDistrict of Columbia, and Washington State without the approval of the \nJudicial Conference. In 1984, when the 12th judgeship at issue in this \nhearing was created--Congress created 10 judgeships without the prior \napproval of the Judicial Conference. It is clear that if Congress can \ncreate judgeships without judicial approval, then Congress can leave \nexisting judgeships vacant or abolish judgeships without judicial \napproval. It would be illogical for the Constitution to give Congress \nbroad authority over the lower Federal courts and yet constrain \nCongress from acting unless the lower Federal courts first gave prior \napproval.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this \nlegislation and pass it quickly. I hope that the President will support \nand sign this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/06/senate-section/article/S10018-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 773\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nMontana [Mr. Baucus] was added as a cosponsor of S. 773, a bill to \namend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to provide for \nimprovements in the process of approving and using animal drugs, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1386\n\n  At the request of Mr. Burns, the names of the Senator from Virginia \n[Mr. Warner] and the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Robb] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1386, a bill to provide for soft-metric conversion, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1554\n\n  At the request of Mr. Cochran, the name of the Senator from Idaho \n[Mr. Kempthorne] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1554, a bill to amend \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to clarify the exemption for \nhouseparents from the minimum wage and maximum hours requirements of \nthat Act, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/06/senate-section/article/S10019-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 289--ELECTING THE SERGEANT AT ARMS AND DOORKEEPER OF \n                               THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LOTT submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today Senator Daschle has brought \nbefore us an issue that provokes much emotion and raises more questions \nabout the use of agent orange in Vietnam. Senator Daschle amendment \nwould treat and compensate Vietnam veterans' children with spina \nbifida, a terrible defect of the neural tube, the embryonic structure \nthat extends from the spinal cord to the brain. Compensation would \nentail a monthly monetary allowance, depending on the degree of the \ncondition. About 2,700 children with spina bifida are estimated to be \nentitled to care and compensation under this amendment. The amendment \nhas the support of the Vietnam Veterans of America, the American Legion \nand the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n  Senator Daschle's amendment responds to the administration's \nannouncement in April, following the release of a National Academy of \nSciences report in March, listing spina bifida as having limited/\nsuggestive evidence of an association with herbicidal exposure in \nVietnam. The VA does not currently have the authority to extend health \ncare or compensatory benefits to the children of veterans. This \namendment would provide that authority.\n  I have fought for years for equitable treatment for Vietnam veterans \nafflicted with conditions associated with agent orange exposure. I was \nvery pleased that in 1991 Congress passed the Agent Orange Act. Under \nthis act if there is adequate evidence of a link between military \nservice in Vietnam and a medical conditions, benefits are provided by \nthe Veterans' Administration.\n  Opponents of the Daschle amendment argue that the evidence supporting \nthis amendment is fragile. I have looked at the evidence myself and I \nmust admit, I cannot disagree with them. The estimates of how many \nchildren will be affected by this legislation are not firm because \nthere are no reliable means of determining if a parent of a spina \nbifida child actually served in an area affected by agent orange. The \nevidence may not improve much because of the inadequacies of the \nrecords kept by the Department of Defense [DOD] in tracking veterans \nduring their service in Vietnam as well as the rate of birth defects in \ntheir children. Thankfully, it seems the DOD avoided this for veterans \nof the gulf war and, with the Persian Gulf Registry, for their \nchildren.\n  Another cause for concern in supporting this amendment is the \nprecedent it sets by providing a new entitlement to the children of \nveterans. Some may use this amendment as a tool to obtain Federal \ncompensation to other veterans' children suffering from a medical \nillness and Congress should avoid providing entitlements to more groups \nwithout some evidence.\n  In crafting statutes for presumptive treatment for agent orange \nveterans, I believed treatment is necessary because the Government has \nan obligation to treat ill veterans if reasonable evidence suggests \nthere is a causal relationship between service and a medical condition. \nBy definition, presumption is subject to question. Countless families \nof Vietnam veterans have suffered because of agent orange. The lack of \nirrefutable scientific evidence had long delayed many of the benefits \nto which Vietnam veterans are entitled. This amendment will provide \nassistance to some of these families and, although will not take away \nthe pain caused by spina bifida, it will at least ease the financial \nburden. This is the\n\n[[Page S10020]]\n\nleast we can to for this group of veterans that have suffered so much \nalready.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/06/senate-section/article/S10019-5", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10020-S10021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 OSHA VIOLATIONS BY FEDERAL CONTRACTORS\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this Monday we celebrated the 114th \nannual Labor Day, honoring working Americans for their daily \ncontributions to the most productive economy in the world. Also on \nMonday, we learned from a new General Accounting Office [GAO] report \nthat the U.S. Government has been routinely awarding billions of \ndollars in Federal contracts to companies that have repeatedly and \nflagrantly endangered the health and safety of their workers.\n  According to the report, entitled ``Occupational Safety and Health: \nViolations of Safety and Health Regulations by Federal Contractors,'' \nthe Federal Government in fiscal year 1994 awarded $38 billion in \ncontracts to companies that were found to have committed significant \nOccupational Safety and Health Act [OSHA] violations in that fiscal \nyear. In fiscal year 1994, more than 1 in 5 Federal contract dollars \nwent to 261 companies that were found to have committed significant \nOSHA violations during that fiscal year.\n  The violations cited in the GAO report were not merely technical \nerrors or minor infractions. On the contrary, 35 fatalities occurred at \nworkplaces of the cited companies during the period covered by the \nreport. These fatalities included, just to cite examples from Illinois \nand the greater Chicago region, that of a Danville, IL worker who was \nsucked into a grain mill he was cleaning, and the deaths of two workers \nwho were trapped in a fire at an Inland Steel Co. plant in East \nChicago, Indiana. A supervisor involved in the latter incident \ncommitted suicide a few days after his coworkers had been killed.\n  In preparing this report, the GAO investigators confined themselves \nto cases involving significant initial proposed penalties, defined as \nthose of $15,000 or more. This definition narrowed the study to the \nmost serious 3 percent of OSHA violations discovered during fiscal year \n1994.\n  Eighty-eight percent of the violations covered by the study involved \nat least one serious violation that posed a risk of death or physical \nharm to workers; 69 percent of the violations were deemed to have been \nwillful.\n  This report demonstrates that the Federal Government is not doing as \nmuch as it could to improve the worker health and safety standards of \nFederal contractors. The Federal Government has enormous contracting \npower: 22 percent of the entire U.S. work force is employed by Federal \ncontractors. The Federal Government ought to use this power to \nencourage companies it contracts with to maintain high standards for \nworker safety and health.\n  We already hold Federal contractors to high standards in a number of \ndifferent areas. For example, Federal contractors must comply with \nExecutive Order 11246, which requires them to develop affirmative \naction programs for their workers. Similarly, the Davis-Bacon and \nService Contract Acts require Federal contractors to pay area-\nprevailing wages when performing Federal construction and service \ncontracts. Given these requirements, it is not unreasonable for Federal \ncontractors also to be held to a higher standard in the area of \noccupational safety and health.\n\n  To address this issue, I have introduced legislation that would give \nthe Secretary of Labor the authority to debar firms that show a pattern \nand practice of OSHA violations from receiving Federal contracts for up \nto 3 years. This legislation, the Federal Contractor Safety and Health \nEnforcement Act (S. 781), would provide strong new incentives for firms \nthat contract with the Federal Government to maintain high safety and \nhealth standards.\n  Even without legislation, there are steps the Federal Government can \ntake to facilitate the exchange of information between OSHA and agency \nawarding and debarring officials to help improve contractor OSHA \ncompliance. The GAO report recommends that OSHA develop policies and \nprocedures, in consultation with the General Services Administration \n[GSA] and the Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension, to \nfirst, ensure that agencies share health and safety information on \nFederal contractors; second, determine whether and how it will consider \na company's status as a Federal contractor in setting priorities for \nworkplace inspections; and third, assess the appropriateness of also \nusing this information with respect to companies receiving other forms \nof Federal assistance, such as grants and loans.\n  The GAO noted that the development of such information-sharing \nbetween agencies ``would increase the likelihood that a company's \nhealth and safety record [will be] considered in decisions to award a \ncontract or to debar or suspend an existing contractor.'' The report \nalso noted that, under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards \nAct, OSHA already has authority to debar companies specifically for \nsafety and health violations, but that this authority is seldom invoked \nbecause of the high cost of litigating debarment decisions. As the use \nof contractor debarment for safety and health violations becomes more \ncommon and courts develop a clear set of guidelines for assessing \ndebarment decisions, we can expect that such litigation costs would \ndecline.\n  American taxpayers should not be expected to foot the bill for \nlucrative contracts to companies that flagrantly and willfully \ndisregard the health and safety of their employees. We should put \nsafeguards into place to ensure that Federal contractors are held to \nhigh standards of worker safety and health. Rather than using the power \nof the Federal treasury to reward lawbreakers, we should use that power \nto reward firms that demonstrate a strong commitment to the safety and \nwellbeing of their employees.\n  I have no personal knowledge of the health and safety records of the \nFederal contractors discussed in the GAO report.

KASSAB, AND WILLIAM H. MORGAN--THE MARCH OF \n                     DIMES 1996 FAMILY OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on September 25, 1996, the March \nof Dimes will honor Elias Brothers Restaurants executives Louis Elias, \nGabriel W. Kassab, and William H. Morgan as the recipients of the 1996 \nFamily of the Year Award. Established in 1993, this award is presented \nannually to a family whose outstanding commitment and support of the \nMarch of Dimes deserves recognition. And without question, these three \nmembers of the Elias Brothers family are duly deserving of this honor.\n  Louis Elias, founder and chairman of the board of Elias Brothers \nRestaurants, has a distinguished past as a community servant. After 4 \nyears as a city councilman, Mr. Elias served as mayor of Hazel Park \nfrom 1953 to 1961. He has also received the highest honor of knight \ncommander in the Order of St. Ignatius of Antioch and was also knighted \ninto the most exclusive philanthropic organization in the world, the \nKnights of Malta, in December 1982.\n  Gabriel Kassab, president of Elias Brothers Restaurants, has for \nyears dedicated his time and energies to helping others. He has served \nas a member of the executive board of the Detroit Council of the Boy \nScouts of America, president of St. George Orthodox Church, president \nof the Michigan and National Restaurant Associations, and as a member \nof the advisory board of Southfield's Providence Hospital.\n  William Morgan, senior executive vice president of Elias Brothers \nRestaurants and Big Boy International, also has a distinguished list of \npublic service efforts to his credit. He is past president of the \nGreater Rochester Chamber of Commerce and the Clinton Valley Council of \nthe Boy Scouts of America, and past chairman of the Rochester \nCrittenton Hospital Development Council. Mr. Morgan today sits on the \nexecutive board of the Michigan State University Development Council.\n  All three of these men have remained dedicated over the years to the \ngenerous support of the efforts of the March of Dimes. The Elias \nBrothers family has committed itself to the cause of preventing birth \ndefects, and with the extraordinary contributions of Louis Elias, \nGabriel Kassab, and William Morgan, our country has moved that much \ncloser to the realization of this noble and important goal. On this \nspecial occasion, I offer my congratulations to each of these civic \nleaders and to the March of Dimes. I also offer my thanks, on behalf of \nthe entire State of Michigan, for the countless number of children's \nlives they have touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/06/senate-section/article/S10021-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE DRIVE-THROUGH DELIVERIES AMENDMENT\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to say how \npleased I am that the Senate yesterday passed an amendment offered by \nmy colleague, Senator Bradley, that will ensure that mothers and their \nnewborn babies get appropriate care before being discharged from the \nhospital.\n  Senator Bradley's amendment would curb the alarming trend toward \nrushing new mothers and babies out of the hospital nearly immediately. \nMany health insurers are requiring new mothers and their newborn babies \nto be discharged from the hospital as early as 8 to 24 hours after \ndelivery. This problem is particularly pressing and growing in the \nwestern United States, where 74 percent of the women who gave birth \nwithout complications were sent home within 24 hours of delivery, a \nsharp increase from the 54-percent figure in 1991. This trend toward \nshorter hospital stays is putting the health of babies and their \nmothers at risk.\n  Under Senator Bradley's amendment, insurance companies would be \nrequired to pay for a minimum 48-hour stay for mother and child for a \nvaginal delivery and a minimum 96-hour stay for a caesarean section. \nThis is the amount of time that has long been recommended by medical \nprofession guidelines, and this amendment is supported by the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n  I received a letter last year from a North Dakota grandmother whose \ninfant grandson became seriously ill shortly after being quickly \ndischarged from the hospital. Within hours of being sent home, these \nyoung parents had to rush their child back to the hospital with a 102-\ndegree temperature. Fortunately, that little boy is now OK, but as you \ncan imagine, this was a very frightening, and potentially life-\nthreatening, experience.\n  I thought the questions this grandmother asked really got to the \nheart of this issue, and I want to read a bit of her letter. She wrote, \n``How much longer is the almighty dollar going to be the deciding \nfactor in our children's lives? Since when do insurance company \nexecutives and accountants know more about life and death matters than \nmedical people?''\n  Our country can no longer afford to let money, rather than the health \nneeds of mothers and babies, be our paramount concern. Physicians and \nparents, not insurance bureaucrats, should be the ones deciding when \nmother and child are ready to go home.\n  We do need to control health care costs, but we cannot lose sight of \nthe fact that providing high quality health care should be our top \npriority. And since one recent study has found that infants discharged \nless than 48 hours after delivery face a 70-percent higher chance that \nthey will require an emergency room visit, which is one of the most \nexpensive settings for care. I believe this amendment will actually \nhelp reduce health care costs in the long run.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Bradley for his leadership in bringing \nthis issue to a vote, and I am glad to lend my support as a cosponsor \nto his effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/06/senate-section/article/S10021-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DR.

Mr. President, on September 25, 1996 the March of \nDimes will honor Clintondale Community School District Superintendent \nDr. Raymond M. Contesti as its 1996 Alexander Macomb Citizen of the \nYear. Established in 1984, this award is presented annually to \n``deserving individuals who have demonstrated outstanding contributions \nand commitment to improving the quality of life in his/her community, \nthe county, and the State of Michigan.''\n  It would be difficult, if not impossible, to find a community servant \nmore deserving of this recognition. In addition to his duties as \nsuperintendent, Dr. Contesti is currently president of the board of \ntrustees of the Mount Clemens General Hospital, a member of the board \nof directors of M.C.G. Telesis, and a member of the Macomb/St. Clair \nPrivate Industry Council. In previous years he has held a number of \ncivic posts within Clinton Township, including service on the board of \ntrustees, zoning board of appeals, parks and recreation committee, \nJunior Chamber of Commerce, planning commission, civic center \ncommittee, and much more.\n  Dr. Contesti's dedication to public service has been recognized by \nnumerous local institutions. In 1994, the Clinton Valley Boy Scouts \nnamed him their distinguished citizen of the year. In 1995, the M.C.G. \nFoundation named Dr. Contesti their citizen of the year.\n  Continuing in this trend, in 1996 Dr. Contesti will again be \ncommended as citizen of the year, by an equally worthwhile institution, \nthe March of Dimes. For his selfless commitment to his fellow citizens \nRaymond Contesti is more than deserving of the accolades that come his \nway. I salute him for his public service, and applaud the March of \nDimes for choosing such a deserving figure on whom to bestow this \nhonor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/06/senate-section/article/S10021-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10021-S10022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN HONOR OF KITE SOCIETY OF WISCONSIN WEEK\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nannounce that this year the 18th annual Frank Mots Memorial Kite \nFestival will be held on September 14 in Milwaukee, WI. Kite flying is \none of the most beautiful and relaxing hobbies around. Many of us can \nstill remember when we were children, building our first kite and \nwatching with excitement as it became airborne. Today children of all \nages can experience this thrill again during Kite\n\n[[Page S10022]]\n\nSociety of Wisconsin Week, which will take place the week of September \n9-15, 1996.\n  Frank Mots was a kite flying enthusiast, and it was in his memory \nthat the Kite Society of Milwaukee was created in 1976. The festival \nthat bears his name was founded in 1978 and has drawn people from \naround the country every year. I invite everyone to celebrate this \nevent on September 14 and take some time out to enjoy the simple \npleasures of kite flying.

BUSSE--THE MARCH OF DIMES' 1996 ALEXANDER MACOMB CITIZEN OF \n                                THE YEAR\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on September 25, 1996, the March \nof Dimes will honor community activist Jeanne O. Busse as its 1996 \nAlexander Macomb Citizen of the Year. Established in 1984, this award \nis presented annually to ``deserving individuals who have demonstrated \noutstanding contributions and commitment to improving the quality of \nlife in his/her community, the county, and the State of Michigan.''\n  As a community servant, Jeanne Busse has fulfilled this criteria and \nthen some. The litany of positions Mrs. Busse has held over the years \nis surpassed only by the list of awards that have been showered upon \nher. Her years of commitment to her church, St. Anne Parish in Warren, \nincludes a stint as president of the Council of Catholic Women for the \nArchdiocese of Detroit. Her involvement with the Boy and Girl Scouts of \nAmerica spans more than six decades, and just a small sample of the \nother civic organizations in which she has served include the United \nCommunity Services, Warren Friends of the Public Library, Michigan \nCultural Commission, and the Warren Consolidated Schools Board of \nEducation.\n  Mrs. Busse's exceptional good deeds have garnered her recognition as \nthe Warren Jaycees Woman of the Year and the Macomb County Council for \nthe Arts Volunteer of the Year. Some of her other awards include: the \nCouncil of Catholic Women/Archdiocese of Detroit Beatrice Zilly Award, \nthe Warren Consolidated Schools Honorary Scholastic Letter Award, the \nUnited Community Services Tracey McGregor Volunteer Award, and the \nJames Coughlin Award for Service to Scouting, to name just a few. In \naddition, ``For Service to the Citizens of Warren, Michigan,'' Busse \nPark has been established and named in her honor.\n  For her selfless commitment to her fellow citizens Jeanne Busse is \nmore than deserving of the accolades that come her way. I salute her \nfor her public service, and applaud the March of Dimes for choosing \nsuch a deserving figure on whom to bestow this honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/06/senate-section/article/S10022-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE NEWBORNS AND MOTHERS HEALTH PROTECTION ACT\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, yesterday, by unanimous vote, the \nSenate passed the Newborns and Mothers Health Protection Act as an \namendment to the VA-HUD appropriations bill. There is no more important \nissue before this Congress than the health of mothers and their \nnewborns, and so I applaud the Senate. This amendment is vital. I want \nto express my pride in being a cosponsor, and my thanks to Senator \nBradley and Senator Frist for all of their hard work.\n  This amendment will require health insurers to allow moms and their \nnewborns to stay in the hospital for a minimum of 48 hours after a \nnormal delivery and 96 hours after a cesarean section, unless the \nmother and her attending health care provider decide a shorter stay is \nin the child's best interest.\n  I sent a letter, along with Senator Snowe of Maine, to Senator Dole \nback on May 1 of this year, asking for a vote on this bill. That letter \nwas signed by all the women Senators, from both parties. I am glad we \nhave finally had a debate and approved this language.\n  This amendment has many cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, and \nhas the support of numerous organizations from around the country. \nThese organizations represent the broad range of health care providers \nthat work with mothers, newborns, and the full range of their health \nconcerns. There are experts from every corner of the country who will \nattest to the importance of this amendment, and as Senator Bradley has \nnoted, more than 80,000 Americans have sent in letters asking us to \npass this legislation, because they know it can mean the difference \nbetween life and death for a loved one.\n  Protecting mothers and their infants is the right thing to do, and is \noverdue. Many States already provide these protections, and hospitals \nsuch as Tacoma General in my State are already allowing these decisions \nto be made by the mother and her care provider, which is the way it \nshould be.\n  We know from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that \nhospital stays for new mothers decreased by almost half between 1970 \nand 1992--from 3.9 days to 2.1 days. We know the length of stay has \ncontinued to decrease, and is now about 24 hours after normal delivery. \nWe know there can be serious health complications within the first 48 \nhours even after a normal delivery. Most important, we know these \ndecisions should be in the hands of the mother and her attending health \ncare provider.\n  I am glad the Senate has taken this action, and I think it is a good \nfirst step toward improving the health of infants and other children in \nthis country.\n  We need to give all newborns every advantage possible. In my mind, a \nhealthy start on life is a good start on life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/06/senate-section/article/S10022-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EXPANSION OF THE FARMINGTON FAMILY YMCA\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \ngrand opening on October 12, 1996, of the expanded Farmington Family \nYMCA. On this day, an organization with a record of community service \nspanning more than three decades will open the doors of a new 15,000 \nsquare foot facility to the families of Novi, West Bloomfield, \nFarmington, and Farmington Hills.\n  Chartered in 1965, the Farmington Area YMCA has over 4,200 members \nand more than 30,000 users annually. The completed expansion, for which \nall construction funds were raised privately, includes a second \nswimming pool to service physically challenged individuals. The new \nfacility is also better equipped to aid the rehabilitation efforts of \npatients participating in an existing partnership program with \nProvidence, Botsford General, and Sinai Hospitals.\n  This institution can truly be characterized as a family serving YMCA. \nWhile it currently provides all latchkey programs for students in the \nFarmington and Farmington Hills school districts, the YMCA can now \noffer greater babysitting and child care services in addition to a \nspecial ``Kids Zone.'' Not only will families benefit from the \nexpansion; the State of Michigan recently awarded the city of \nFarmington Hills a special grant to initiate a collaborative program \nwith the YMCA and the Farmington public schools to serve the needs of \nyoung teens to assist in a community wide effort to prevent juvenile \ndelinquency.\n  Finally, while expanding the physical structure provides the space to \nimplement these programs, without the dedication of the exceptional \nvolunteers involved with the YMCA, the completion of this ambitious \nproject would have been impossible. Their efforts truly are \ncommendable, and on this upcoming October 12 I salute these community \nservants and congratulate the families of the Farmington area on the \nmany years of enjoyment they will receive from their expanded \nYMCA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/06/senate-section/article/S10022-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10022-S10023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO THE CHEMICAL MORTAR BATTALION OF THE 3D ARMY\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to pay \ntribute to a group of very special people. During the last weekend in \nthis month of September, the 91st Chemical Mortar Battalion of the 3d \nArmy will be celebrating their 51st reunion in the fine town of \nWheeling in my State of West Virginia. These men gather each year in \ntheir respective States to celebrate their outstanding efforts in the \nSecond World War.\n  While this Nation has many fine heroes from those years, these men \nare very unique because they are part of the Allied Forces who served \nunder\n\n[[Page S10023]]\n\nGen. George S. Patton and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. As we all \nknow, that battle is very important because it was the last German \noffensive on the Western Front during World War II. It gets its \ndistinct name from the bulge or wedge of Germans that drove into Allied \nlines in December 1944 and January 1945. The Battle of the Bulge became \nan unsuccessful attempt to push the Allies back from German home \nterritory. By January 8, 1945, the Germans made an orderly withdrawal \nhaving used all their resources they could afford trying to regain the \nwest. These men kept the force and prevented Hitler from repossessing \nlands that were not his. They even assisted in the liberation of \nHitler's labor camps and saw the faces of those who survived. The \nBattle of the Bulge was one of great magnitude and as a result there \nwere 77,000 Allied and 130,000 German casualties. These heroes should \nbe proud to celebrate and tell their stories.\n  These men caused the height of General Patton's career as they made \nthe dramatic sweep in his 3d Army across northern France in the summer \nof 1944. Under Patton, these men played a strategic role in defending \nBastogne, Belgium in the Battle of the Bulge in December of that year. \nBy January 1945, they had reached the German frontier and the United \nStates counteroffensive began. George Patton was an outstanding \npractitioner of mobile tank warfare in World War II. His strict \ndiscipline, toughness, and sacrifice were well known within his ranks, \nleading to his being referred to by his men as ``Old Blood-and-Guts.''\n  Mr. President, I just wanted to take this time to have us all reflect \nand think about those men who fought for world peace during World War \nII. As the ranking member of the Senate Veteran's Affairs Committee, I \nhold a special place in my heart for every man and woman who serves our \ncountry. While every veteran of war is unique and deserves our Nation's \nhonor, these 80 or so men gathered in Wheeling, WV, this month merit a \nspecial tribute. It is now 1996 and there is no more Hitler, there are \nno more concentration camps, and Patton no longer lives. These men \nfought and lived in a time that has now become history. May they meet, \nshare their stories, and rejoice for who they are and what they have \ndone. Let us all be proud to have these men come to West Virginia and \ncelebrate their 51st reunion as the 91st Chemical Mortar Battalion of \nthe 3d Army.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/06/senate-section/article/S10022-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATIONS TO MICHIGAN'S MEDAL WINNING ATHLETES IN THE 1996 SUMMER \n                             OLYMPIC GAMES\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

These dedicated men and women worked, \ntrained, and sacrificed to make their dream a reality. They practiced \nuntil their God-given talents were honed to their fullest. They were \nrewarded with victory and the knowledge that they had performed, under \nintense pressure, up to their full potential.\n  I offer my congratulations to these fine Michiganians.

I want to thank Senators for cooperation in getting this \nconcluded. Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee, has \nbeen very interested in this. I think this is the right thing to do.\n  I am satisfied he is eminently qualified for the position. And the \nPresident should have his Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget in place. I think this should be completed. The others were \nmilitary nominations that had been reported by the Armed Services \nCommittee.

Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues for voting \nto adopt S. 1972, a bill to amend the Older Americans Act. S. 1972 \nmakes technical corrections to the Act to clarify and improve the \nprovisions relating to older native Americans.\n  Mr. President, many older native Americans have benefited from \nprograms authorized under the Older Americans Act. Indian tribes have \nprovided much needed home-based care, meals and services to elderly \ntribal members living on Indian reservations and in nearby communities. \nIn most cases, older native Americans live in remote and isolated \ncommunities with little or no access to a grocery store, telephone, \nhealth care and other important services. Through the Older Americans \nAct, nutrition and support services can be provided to older Native \nAmericans in their homes and communities on a daily basis.\n  However, many of these services can be strengthened to ensure that \nIndian tribes are able to tailor nutritional and supportive programs to \nthe cultural and geographic characteristics of their communities. \nOften, employment and nutrition programs are difficult to administer in \nIndian country because of the remoteness of the service area and the \nunique character of Indian cultures. The changes in S. 1972 will ensure \nthat Indian tribes and tribal organizations serving native American \nelders will be afforded maximum flexibility in administering employment \nand nutrition programs to ensure that they are appropriate to the \nunique characteristics of the Indian communities.\n  Mr. President, I have proposed a minor technical change to the bill \nas it was reported in the Committee on Indian Affairs. This amendment \nto section 2 of the bill is necessary to clarify that the proposed \nchange to the definition of ``reservation'' will not alter any existing \neligibility for Indians living near an Indian reservation.\n  Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to Senators Inouye \nand Stevens, who joined me in sponsoring this legislation and my \ncolleagues in the Senate who voted to pass S. 1972. This act will bring \nus closer to meeting the goals of the Older Americans Act to ensure \nthat older native Americans will continue to benefit from the services \nprovided by the act.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1972), as amended, was deemed read the third time and \npassed as follows:\n\n                                S. 1972\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I want to begin my statement by \ncongratulating two heroes--heroes of south Florida and heroes of our \nNation--officers Joseph Alu and James O'Hara, former members of the \ncity of Plantation police department.\n  On October 3 of this year, these two men will be honored by the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, when they receive the Top \nCops Award--an honor given to a select group of officers who display \nexceptional courage and bravery in the face of danger.\n  Mr. President, we in Florida are quite proud to have citizens like \nOfficers Alu and O'Hara living among us, not just for the courage they \ndisplayed while in the line of duty, but also for the courage and \nperseverance displayed after the tragic incident which occurred on July \n24, 1995.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly recount the tragic events of July 24, \n1995. While on duty, Officer Joseph Alu and Detective James O'Hara, \nwere called to what turned out to be an emergency hostage situation. \nWhen the officers had arrived at the scene--they found that an \nassailant had cordoned himself off in a bedroom of a house and had \ntaken two teenaged girls hostage.\n  The officers broke down the bedroom door, only to discover that the \nassailant had doused himself, the hostages, and the entire room in \ngasoline. At that moment, the assailant dropped a lighter on the floor, \nsetting the room ablaze, killing himself and the two hostages.\n  Officers Alu and O'Hara were critically wounded--receiving severe \nburns over most of their bodies. Both officers remained in the hospital \nfor the better part of a year fighting for their survival. Officer \nO'Hara was so badly burned that while he struggled for his life in the \nintensive care unit for over 6 months, his wife was told to expect and \nprepare for his imminent death.\n  Miraculously, Officer Alu and Officer O'Hara survived. But, while \nstill in the hospital, the officers were notified that since they \nwouldn't be physically able to return to work they and their families \nwould lose their health insurance benefits.\n  Imagine fighting for your life in a hospital, in excruciating pain, \nknowing that your family is going to be left unprotected. When these \nheroes returned home, that's exactly what they found: no job, \ndisability payments of approximately $1,200 a month, prohibitively \nexpensive COBRA insurance which would run out in 18 months, and no \nprivate health insurance for them and their families.\n  For over 5 months, Officer Alu's wife, Sheila, stayed home to care \nfor her husband during his rehabilitation, herself unable to work to \nbring in badly needed extra income. Further complicating their \nsituation was their 5-year-old daughter, Christina, who was battling \nchronic asthma without health insurance.\n\n[[Page S10026]]\n\n  Detective O'Hara's family was in a similar situation. In fact, his \nwife still must care for his everyday needs almost 14 months after the \nincident.\n  But instead of giving up hope, Officers Alu and O'Hara fought hard. \nThey brought their case to the Florida Legislature. Mr. President, they \nwon.\n  The legislature, with a Republican senate and a Democratic house, \nunanimously passed this legislation at the State level--requiring that \nlocalities continue whatever health insurance benefits the officer had \nprior to the injury after the injury when they are no longer able to \nreturn to work.\n  Mr. President, although they have won personal victories, Officers \nAlu and O'Hara have continued their fight--taking their case to \nCongress--and asking us to make sure that other officers not go through \nthe same pain, uncertainty, and feelings of shame when they were unable \nto provide for their families.\n  Across the Nation, unlike veterans who have risked their lives to \nprotect our national security, those who protect our homes and streets \nhave their insurance canceled by municipalities or States when they can \nno longer return to work.\n  Mr. President, the House of Representatives has already passed the \nAlu-O'Hara amendment--unanimously, I might add--to the Commerce, State, \nJustice appropriations bill which would prevent this injustice from \nhappening to any other officer again.\n  I have introduced identical legislation in the Senate. It is my hope \nthat the Senate Appropriations Committee will simply maintain the \nHouse-passed Alu-O'Hara provision in the Senate bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nremarks, the amendment that it is my hope will be maintained, which has \nbeen adopted by the House of Representatives, be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if this amendment should not be adopted by \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, I announce that it is my intention \nto offer this as an amendment when we consider the Commerce, State, \nJustice bill, hopefully next week.\n  The Alu-O'Hara bill, endorsed by all major police and firefighter \norganizations, would create a safety net for injured officers by \nrequiring municipalities that receive Federal crime dollars to continue \nto maintain the same level of benefits that an officer had prior to \nbeing injured in the line of duty.\n  If a locality chooses not to offer health insurance to these public \nsafety officers, it would only be able to receive 90 percent of its \nfull complement of community-oriented policing services funding.\n  Mr. President, the scope of this bill is extremely narrow. It would \napply only to a handful of public safety officers, estimated at \napproximately 100 nationwide per year. And it is not costly. CBO has \nalready stated that this bill is not an unfunded mandate.\n  In fact, the city of Lauderhill, FL, where Officers Alu and O'Hara \nreside, added expanded insurance coverage to cover all of its municipal \nemployees, not just public safety officers, at no extra cost to the \ncity.\n  Even though the Alu-O'Hara amendment is inexpensive, its message is \nunmistakably clear.\n  We need laws which protect our valiant men and women on the \nfrontlines. When they go down in the line of duty protecting us, we \nhave a corresponding duty to care for them.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would provide only the most basic \npackage of benefits. It does not grant any enhanced or increased \nbenefits over what the officer had at the time of the injury.\n  The bill requires State and local governments to offer only the \nminimum level of health insurance necessary to maintain the health \ncoverage the officer had prior to the disabling injury.\n  For instance, if an officer or firefighter did not have family \ncoverage prior to the injury, he would not be entitled to family \ncoverage after the injury.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of my State of Florida. But it should not \ntake a terrible incident like this to make sure that our public safety \nofficers are protected. We can prevent this situation from ever \nhappening to officers like Alu and O'Hara by making sure that we \nmaintain the Alu-O'Hara provision in the Commerce, State, Justice bill, \nand can do so in a proudly bipartisan fashion.\n  Mr. President, allow me to conclude by commending both Officer Alu \nand Detective O'Hara and their families for their bravery, sacrifice, \nand dedication to public service. Without their perseverance we \nwouldn't be here today discussing this most critical issue. I know that \npolice officers and firefighters across the Nation share my gratitude \nfor their courage and selflessness.\n  Mr. President, in passing this bill, we will honor our commitment to \nall of our public safety officers: to protect and care for them after \nthey have done so much to protect and care for us.\n  Mr. President, thank you.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert after the last section \n     (preceding the short title) the following new section:\n       Sec.   .
