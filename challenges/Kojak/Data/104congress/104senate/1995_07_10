Thank you, Mr. President.\n  We have morning business until 1 o'clock, with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each. At 1 o'clock, we resume consideration \nof S. 343, the regulatory reform bill. Under a previous order, Senator \nAbraham will be recognized to offer an amendment on small business. At \n3 o'clock, the Abraham amendment will be set aside so that Senator Nunn \nmay offer an amendment with Senator Coverdell regarding regulatory \nflexibility.\n  At 5:15, we begin two back-to-back votes--a vote on or in relation to \nthe Abraham amendment, to be immediately followed by a vote on or in \nrelation to the Nunn-Coverdell amendment. So there will be at least two \nrollcall votes today, and there could be further rollcall votes into \nthe evening.\n  Let me indicate to my colleagues, this is Monday morning. This is a \nvery important piece of legislation. It is controversial in some \nquarters. We hope to end up with a strong bipartisan bill. But I will \nalert my colleagues, we will have long days all this week, including \nFriday. So I do not want people expecting that on Friday there will be \nno votes or maybe be one vote at 11 o'clock in the morning. That can \nchange if we complete action on this bill, but I doubt that will \nhappen.\n  In addition, we were not able to complete action on the rescissions \npackage before we left a week ago Friday. That bill will come up when \nthere is an agreement without amendment to go to final passage.\n  I understand there may be some discussion of that later on today. It \nis a bill that saves about $9.2 billion. It was blocked by two of my \ncolleagues before the recess. I hope that their concerns may be \nsatisfied by the administration. I hope the administration can deal \nwith our Democratic colleagues with reference to that bill.\n  It has many important items in the bill, including disaster relief \nfor Oklahoma City, earthquake relief for California, and a number of \nother--in fact, there are some 30 States for which this bill includes \nsome disaster money. So it is an important bill. It is one we should \npass.\n  It also saves $9.2 billion overall. It is very important that we pass \nthat bill at the earliest possible time. I commend the White House for \nat least notifying the agencies not to spend any money that is not \nauthorized in that rescissions bill. So that is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Now, if they can convince a couple of our colleagues to let us pass \nthe bill, we could do that at any time today or tomorrow if an \nagreement is reached.\n  But I again indicate it is going to be a full week. We are already \neating into the August recess. We have some ``must'' legislation we \nhope to complete between now and sometime in August. We will have a \nfinal schedule to all of our colleagues by the end of the week.\n  Mr. President, was leaders' time reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Yes, leaders' time was reserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/10/senate-section/article/S9597-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9597-S9599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DISTORTIONS OF REGULATORY REFORM BILL\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, now that we have begun consideration of \nregulatory reform, the defenders of the status quo have settled on the \nweapon of last resort: fear. Thus, we have reporters and pundits \npronouncing in strident tones ``the rollback of 25 years of \nenvironmental protection,'' the likelihood \n\n[[Page S 9598]]\nof increased outbreaks of E. coli food poisoning, and the horror of \nplacing a pricetag on human life.\n  The sky is falling is undoubtedly next.\n  The only problem with all these arguments is that they are absolutely \nfalse, not just false in some small way, but false in every way. \nApparently, the Chicken Littles who have engaged in these scare tactics \ndid not even bother to read the legislation.\n  Had they done so, they would realize that most of the bill merely \ncodifies Executive orders issued by every President since the Ford \nadministration. Had they done so, they would realize this is a \nbipartisan piece of legislation that balances commonsense reform with \nthe need to protect health, safety, and the environment. So here are a \nfew facts--although I am not certain from some of the reports I read, \nthe Ralph Naders, and the Bob Herberts of the New York Times, and \nothers, even care about facts--but just in case somebody might care \nabout facts, let me state some facts, and I quote directly from the \nlegislation conveniently ignored by these liberal distortions:\n  Our regulatory reform legislation protects existing environmental \nhealth and safety laws.\n  Our legislation makes explicit that regulatory reform measures \nsupplement and [do] not supersede--supplement and do not supersede. We \nare not going to supersede any law, we are going to supplement existing \nenvironmental health and safety requirements. Congress chooses the \ngoals, and all we ask is that among several options achieving those \ngoals that the one imposing the least possible burden be selected.\n  We do not see a problem, if you are going to have all these options, \nand one will accomplish the job with the least burden on the American \ntaxpayer, the American consumer, the American businessman, generally \nsmall business men and women, why should we not choose that option?\n  However, a cost-benefit analysis of proposed regulations is not \nrequired before issuing rules that address an ``emergency or health or \nsafety threat that is likely to result in significant harm to the \npublic or natural resources.'' If nonquantifiable benefits to ``health, \nsafety, or the environment'' call for a more costly regulatory \nalternative, the agency is free to make that choice as well. And rules \nsubject to a proposed congressional 60-day review period may be \nimplemented without delay if ``necessary because of an imminent threat \nto health or safety or other emergency.'' So it seems to me we have \nmade it rather clear.\n  Some rollback.\n  Our regulatory reform legislation protects food safety.\n  Perhaps the most cowardly argument has been the one that suggests \nthat our legislation would, in the words of one overly distraught \ncommentator, mount ``an all-out assault on food safety regulations'' \nand block implementation of the Agriculture Department's proposed meat \ninspection regulations.\n  Does any reasonable person really believe that any politician, \nDemocrat or Republican, is trying to gut food safety laws? Of course \nnot. But for those who have made a career on scare tactics, this \nargument will apparently do. If they make it, surely somebody in the \nmedia will repeat it and repeat it and repeat it. That has been done \nfor the past several days.\n  All of the protections in the bill noted above apply here, too, \nespecially the one exempting a regulation from any delay if there is \n``an emergency or health or safety threat.'' But there are several \nadditional ironies. First, the Agriculture Department already conducted \na cost-benefit analysis of the meat inspection rule, and it passed. \nSecond, in the entire bill the only time health inspections are \nmentioned, it is to exempt them from risk assessment requirements under \nthis bill.\n  Our regulatory reform legislation does not place a price tag on human \nlife.\n  The argument that regulatory reform would place a price tag on human \nlife usually carries with it the notion that some lives will be worth \nmore than others. This is a cynical argument and is completely at odds \nwith what the bill would actually accomplish.\n  First, not only does the bill avoid putting a price tag on life, it \nexplicitly recognizes that some values are not capable of \nquantification. Thus, both costs and benefits are defined in the \nlegislation to include nonquantifiable costs and benefits.\n  The legislation also provides that in performing a cost-benefit \nanalysis, there is no requirement to do so ``primarily on a \nmathematical or numerical basis.'' And, second, agencies may choose \nhigher cost regulations where warranted by ``nonquantifiable benefits \nto health, safety or the environment.''\n  Nothing could be more clear to this Senator, and we hope we have made \nit clear in the bill, which is sponsored by Republicans and Democrats.\n  Mr. President, I have quoted from the bill wherever possible. It is \ninteresting that opponents of the bill never do. They probably have \nnever seen the bill and do not know the numbers, and they do not intend \nto read it. They have bought into this nonsense that some Members of \nCongress are for dirty meat, that we want dirty meat--that is what I \nhave read--that we want people to die of food poisoning.\n  I know they do not like to read these things because it is \ninconvenient, and they do not want the facts in many cases. But I \nchallenge the opponents to stop distorting the truth and start seeking \nit. They can read the bill. To help them, I have prepared a summary of \nprovisions that address the protections for health, safety, and the \nenvironment that I will include with this statement in the Record.\n  Then opponents can start telling us why they are really upset by \nregulatory reform. I suspect it has less to do with threats to the \nenvironment and more to do with the threat to Federal power in \nWashington, DC.\n  We have a lot of bureaucrats that might lose their jobs if we can \nease some of the burdens on consumers, farmers, ranchers, small \nbusinessmen and women, the people who have to pay for all the \nregulations, and, in some cases, the costs exceed the benefits. In some \ncases, there are no benefits at all. The most costly regulations are \nusually the ones that impose a Government-knows-best requirement, and \nthere is an entire culture devoted to telling the American people that \nthe Government knows best; Washington, DC, knows best.\n  Our legislation is a direct threat to a smug assertion. By golly, we \nordinary Americans hope you agencies do not take it personally, but we \nwould really like you to show us why a rule imposing hundreds of \nmillions of dollars makes sense and was the only way to do it.\n  So we think we are on to something here. It should not be a partisan \nissue, and it is not a partisan issue. A lot of my good colleagues on \nthe other side of the issue are supporting this, and we hope to have \nmore before the week is out.\n  The opponents are right in one respect: This is one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation this Congress will address. Americans \npay more in regulatory costs than they do to Uncle Sam through income \ntaxes. Overregulation costs the American family an estimated $6,000 a \nyear. I believe we can ensure regulations that both promote important \ngoals like food safety and also minimize costs wherever possible, and I \nbelieve it is our obligation to do so. In that respect, I am an \noptimist. I have never succumbed to the chirpings of the Chicken \nLittles and do not intend to start now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nanalysis of this legislation, particularly as it relates to protection \nof human health, safety, and environment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nS. 343: Responsible Regulatory Reform That Protects Health, Safety and \n                            the Environment\n\n\ns. 343 does not override existing health, safety and environmental laws\n\n       Sec. 624(a)--Cost-benefit requirements ``supplement and \n     [do] not supersede'' health, safety and environmental \n     requirements in existing laws.\n       Sec. 628(d)--Requirements regarding ``environmental \n     management activities'' also ``supplement and [do] not \n     supersede'' requirements of existing laws.\n\n\n        s. 343 protects human health, safety and the environment\n\n       Sec. 622(f) and Sec. 632(c)(1)(A)--Cost-benefit analyses \n     and risk assessments are not required if ``impracticable due \n     to an emergency or health or safety threat that is likely to \n     result in significant harm to the public or natural \n     resources.''\n\n[[Page S 9599]]\n\n       Sec. 624(b)(3)(B)--An agency may select a higher cost \n     regulation when \n     ``nonquantifiable \n     benefits to health, safety or the environment'' make that \n     choice ``appropriate and in the public interest.''\n       Sec. 624(b)(4)--Where a risk assessment has been done, the \n     agency must choose regulations that ``significantly reduce \n     the human health, safety and environmental risks.''\n       Sec. 628(b)(2)--Requirements for environmental management \n     activities do not apply where they would ``result in an \n     actual or immediate risk to human health or welfare.''\n       Sec. 629(b)(1)--Where a petition for alternative compliance \n     is sought, the petition may only be granted where an \n     alternative achieves ``at least an equivalent level of \n     protection of health, safety, and the environment.''\n       Sec. 632(c)--Risk assessment requirements do not apply to a \n     ``human health, safety, or environmental inspection.''\n\n\n      s. 343 does not delay health, safety and environmental rules\n\n       Sec. 622(f) and Sec. 632(c)--Cost-benefit and risk \n     assessment requirements are not to delay implementation of a \n     rule if ``impracticable due to an emergency or health or \n     safety threat that is likely to result in significant harm to \n     the public or natural resources.''\n       Sec. 533(d)--Procedural requirements under the \n     Administrative Procedures Act may be waived if ``contrary to \n     the public interest.''\n       Sec. 628(b)(2)--Requirements for major environmental \n     management activities are not to delay environmental cleanups \n     where they ``result in an actual and immediate risk to human \n     health or welfare.''\n       Sec. 801(c)--Congressional 60-day review period before rule \n     becomes final may be waived where ``necessary because of an \n     imminent threat to health or safety or other emergency.''\n\n\n          s. 343 does not place a ``price tag on human life''\n\n       Sec. 621(2)--``Costs'' and ``benefits'' are defined \n     explicitly to include \n     ``nonquantifiable,\n     '' not just quantifiable, costs and benefits.\n       Sec. 622(e)(1)(E)--Cost-benefit analyses are not required \n     to be performed ``primarily on a mathematical or numerical \n     basis.''\n       Sec. 624(b)(3)(B)--An agency may choose a higher cost \n     regulation when \n     ``nonquantifiable \n     benefits to health, safety or the environment'' dictate that \n     result.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/10/senate-section/article/S9597-5", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 343, the \nComprehensive Regulatory Reform Act, which will be before us today and, \nI suspect, for the remainder of the week.\n  I think that this is one of the most exciting opportunities that we \nhave had this year. This is one of the opportunities for this Congress \nand this Senate, this Government, to take a look at some of the things \nthat have been going on for 30 years, 40 years, without much \nexamination, which have simply grown and have continued to become more \nexpensive and larger, without a real examination of whether or not what \nis being done is the most effective way to do it, or whether or not it \ncould be done in a less costly way. I think it is an exciting \nopportunity.\n  I have just returned, as have most of our associates, from a week in \nmy home State of Wyoming. We did a series of town meetings and met with \nthe rangeland users and met with the sugar beet growers and the chamber \nof commerce and the Rotary. As has been the case for some time, the \nissue most often mentioned is overregulation and the cost of \noverregulation. So I am excited about the opportunity to do something \nabout that.\n  I suspect that we will run into the same kinds of discussions that we \nhave when we talk about doing something about welfare reform--that \nsomehow those of us who want some change in what we have been doing are \nless compassionate than those who want the status quo; that somehow \nthose of us who want to take a look at and change the way regulation is \nimposed are less caring about the environment and about clean water and \nclean air than those who support the status quo. That is simply not \ntrue.\n  I suspect that we will hear from the opposition on this bill that \nsomehow this bill will remove all of the regulatory requirements that \nexist. Not so. We will hear that somehow the regulations that are in \nplace to protect us for various kinds of water and air problems will be \neliminated or superseded. That is simply not so.\n  Many people can imagine what the last election was about. But I think \nwe have talked about it a great deal. There were at least three things \nthat I think were most important to the people of Wyoming. One was that \nthe Federal Government is too big, that it costs too much, and that we \nare overregulating. I think those are genuine responses that people \nfeel very strongly about.\n  So, Mr. President, here is our opportunity to do something about \nthat. Clearly, the regulatory system is broken. What is being proposed \ndoes not do away with regulations. It simply says there is a better way \nto do it.\n  As our leader just indicated, overregulation is a hidden tax that is \npassed on to consumers. It is not absorbed by businesses. It is not a \nbusiness issue, even though much of it affects business. The costs are \npassed on to you and to me. Furthermore, the regulations are not \nconfined to business. It goes much beyond that, into small towns, \ncities, the universities, and other areas.\n  Unfortunately, regulations have been applied generally. In our \nWyoming Legislature, I am proud that we have a situation where the \nstatute is passed by the legislature, the agency that is affected \ndrafts and creates the regulation, and it comes back to the legislature \nfor some overview to see, No. 1, if it is within the spirit of the \nstatute; No. 2, to see if it is indeed cost beneficial, that what it is \nset to accomplish is worth the cost of accomplishment.\n  We do not even have here an analysis of what the cost will be. The \ncost of regulation, as the leader indicated, is more than personal tax \nrevenues. Some estimate it between $650 billion and $800 billion. Now, \nthis bill will not eliminate all of that cost, of course, because there \nis a need for regulation, and there is a cost with regulation. The \npoint is that we are looking for a way to apply that regulation in as \nefficient and effective a manner as can be and do something that has \nnot been done for a long time, and that in the application of the \nregulation, to use some common sense in terms of what it costs with \nrespect to what the benefits are, and to take a look at risk-benefits \nratios to see if what will be accomplished is worth the cost and the \neffort of the application.\n  Furthermore, it gives us an opportunity to go back to some \nregulations that have existed and look at them. Let me give an example. \nIn Buffalo, WY, there are 3,500 people. The EPA said we need to enforce \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act. Fine. They are willing to do that. They \nare willing to put in a filtering system that costs $3 million for a \ntown of 3,500 and made a good-faith effort to comply.\n  One year later, EPA responded and said they would send a compliance \nschedule. Buffalo never received the schedule.\n  Then when Buffalo proceeded as they had set forth in their schedule, \nEPA claimed that Buffalo never let them know what was going on.\n  After that was worked out, EPA accepted, in writing, the town of \nBuffalo's plan. The following year, EPA again claimed the city did not \nlet them know what was going on and referred the case to the Department \nof Justice for prosecution.\n  When asked what happened, EPA said, ``We changed our mind.'' The \nbottom line, the city of Buffalo wanted to comply with the Federal \nmandate, but the Federal overregulation and bureaucracy prevented that.\n  The University of Wyoming. We had several contacts from the \nUniversity of Wyoming asking for a list of issues they were most \nconcerned about. Do you know what was at the top of the list? \nOverregulation. Not grants, not money--overregulation. This is the \nuniversity. This is not a business. This is the university, where a \ngood amount of their resources were there to educate young people.\n  We have the same problem in health regulations, in the disposal of \nhealth care waste, which goes far beyond the clean air. It will cause \nsome of the small hospitals in Wyoming to be closed. \n\n[[Page S 9600]]\n\n  Overregulation is particularly difficult for the rural areas of the \nWest, where in our case more than half of the State belongs to the \nFederal Government. The things we do in our way of life, in our \neconomy, our job creation, is always regulated more than most anywhere \nelse in the country. We are very, very, concerned.\n  Let me give one example. There are leases, of course, for livestock \ngrazing on Bureau of Land Management lands and on lands of the Forest \nService. The leases are renewed regularly. This year, it was decided \nthere had to be a NEPA study--that is supposed to be confined to areas \nof national concern--for every renewal of a grazing lease. The \nirrigators have to spend $100,000 this year to do a NEPA review on \ntheir conservation land. The cost of this is paid by you and by me.\n  Regulatory reform needs to have principles. This bill has them. It \nhas cost-benefit analysis. I think that is a proper and reasonable \nthing. You and I do that. We make decisions for ourself and our family. \nWe have a cost-benefit analysis, even though it may be informal. A risk \nassessment--it could be that the last few percentage points are too \nexpensive to be reasonable and common sense. We need a look-back \nprovision so we can go back and take a look at the regulations that now \nexist. There needs to be a sunset provision so that burdensome laws and \nburdensome regulations can be dropped or renewed. There needs to be a \njudicial review. S. 343 incorporates these principles.\n  I think we have a great opportunity to make better use of the \nresources that we have, Mr. President, to provide greater protection \nfor human health and safety in the environment at a lower cost and to \nhold regulators accountable for their decisions. What is wrong with \nthat? I think that is a good idea, to hold the Congress accountable for \nthe kinds of regulations, to limit the size of Government, so that we \ncan create jobs that help consumers improve competitiveness overseas.\n  We should take advantage of this opportunity. This week will be the \ntime to do it, to be realistic, to apply common sense, to reduce the \ncost and the burden of regulation. I am delighted that we will have a \nchance this year, this week, Mr. President, to do that.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, last week the Congress was not in session, \nbut the Federal Reserve Board met downtown in their marble building and \ntook a baby step in rectifying the mistake it made on seven occasions \nlast year when they increased interest rates in order to slow down the \nAmerican economy.\n  Last year, the Federal Reserve Board said it was combating inflation \nin our economy, so it desired to slow down the economy some and prevent \na new wave of inflation. Now it appears the Federal Reserve Board has \napparently won a fight without a foe. There was no wave of inflation \nacross the horizon.\n  Last week's announcement to decrease interest rates by one-quarter of \n1 percent made the stock market ecstatic. In fact, the Federal Reserve \nBoard acted to ratchet down inflation marginally and the stock market \nreached record highs.\n  In fact, if we look at the combination of economic news in the last \nweek or two, it is quite interesting. The Federal Reserve Board says it \nhas won a fight with a foe that did not exist. The stock market reached \nrecord highs. And corporate profits are at record levels.\n  The question would be, if all of those pieces of economic news are so \ngood for the American economy, if this is such wonderful economic news, \nthen why are the Americans so displeased? Why are the American people \nnot dancing in the streets about this economic news? Record profits \nshould mean that businesses are doing well creating jobs, expanding, \nhiring. Record stock market levels should mean that the experts think \nthe American economy is robust and growing.\n  The simple answer is the people in this country are not satisfied \nbecause this economic news masks an important fact. The American people \nare not satisfied with this economic news for the same reason that the \nFederal Reserve Board's actions last year were a mistake. The fact is, \nand the reason is, we are now living in a global economy.\n  That means that stellar economic numbers may not translate into \neconomic opportunities here in our country. Surrounding all of the \nbright economic news that was trumpeted last week, there was one small \nbut critically important fact: American wages are going down.\n  Yes, corporate profits are at record levels. Yes, the stock market is \nringing the bell. Stock market indexes have never been higher in their \nhistory. But the fact is, American wage earners, American workers, are \ndoing worse. Investors do better; American workers lose ground. \nCorporations do better, American wage earners do worse. Wealth holders \nsucceed; working families fail.\n  There is no economic news that this administration, this Congress, \nthe Federal Reserve Board, the captains of industry, or the investment \nmoguls on Wall Street can give the American people that will make them \nfeel better about this economy as long as their real wages are \ndeclining. Unless and until we stop a 20-year decline in American \nwages, the American people will not be satisfied.\n  I always find it interesting that the press trumpets every month the \nreport of how much we consumed. We measure economic health by \nconsumption. But, of course, that is not economic health. It is what \nyou produce that relates to whether you are healthy or not, not what \nyou consume. But we trumpet, every month, all kinds of indices about \neconomic performance and we see nothing--except maybe 2 column inches \nin the paper once every 6 months--about American wages. Yet every \nmonth, the indices show American wages are declining.\n  Frankly, we have a circumstance today where corporate giants, led by \nU.S. corporations and followed by their international competitors, are \nconstructing an economic model for the world that worries American \nworkers. They have decided they want to produce where it is cheap and \nsell back into established marketplaces. That means corporations \nincreasingly produce in Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Singapore, \nHonduras, China--around the world--where they can hire cheap labor, \noften kids. They can pay dirt-cheap wages, they can dump their \npollution in the air and in the water, make their product, and send it \nback to Pittsburgh for sale.\n  That strategy of playing the American worker off against 1 or 2 \nbillion others in the world who are willing to work for pennies an hour \nis a strategy that might well lead to record corporate profits, but it \nalso leads to declining U.S. wages. And that is the economic problem \nthis country has to fix.\n  The bottom line of economic progress in this country must be, ``Are \nwe increasing the standard of living for the American worker?'' And the \nanswer today, amidst all of the glory of the wonderful economic news \ntrumpeted every day in recent weeks, is no. The standard living for the \naverage American worker is not advancing. It has been declining.\n  Our economic strategy for the 50 years following the Second World War \nwas, for the first 25 years, a foreign policy disguised as economic \nstrategy to try to help everybody else. We did that and it was fine. We \ncould afford to do it because we were the biggest and the best and the \nstrongest and the most. And even as we did that we progressed and so \ndid the American worker. But for the last 20 to 25 years it has been \ndifferent.\n  Our trade policy is still largely a foreign policy. It does not work \nto support the interests of our country. And what we see as a result of \nit is that other countries are growing and advancing and our country, \nmeasured by standard \n\n[[Page S 9601]]\nof living--the standard of living experienced by American workers--is \nnot advancing.\n  The American people are tired of that. They want a change in economic \ncircumstances. And we, one day soon, must have a real, interesting, and \nthoughtful discussion about these economic policies. Now, more than \never, this country needs a full-scale policy debate about economic \nstrategy and what kind of strategy, including trade strategy and other \nstrategies, results in advancing America's economic interests--not just \nAmerica's corporate interests, not just America's investors' interests, \nbut the interests of all Americans.\n  That is a debate we have not had. We did not have it during NAFTA. We \ndid not have it during GATT. You could not have it, in fact. The major \nnewspapers of this country--the Washington Post, the New York Times, \nthe Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street Journal--would not even give you \nopen access to an opportunity to discuss these things. It is \ninteresting, with NAFTA, we counted the column inches on the editorial \nand op-ed pages ``pro'' and ``anti.'' It was 6 to 1 pro-NAFTA, pro-\nGATT--6 to 1.\n  These are areas where you ought to expect there to be freedom of \nspeech and open debate. But it is not so. And the economic interests \nthat propel that sort of imbalance in our major newspapers in our \ncountry, when we have these kinds of discussions, is the same economic \ninterest that prevents the discussions even from getting any momentum \nin a Chamber like this. One day soon, I hope, that is going to change. \nAnd the sooner the better, if we are interested in providing some \nsatisfaction for American workers whose only interest, it seems to me, \nis to work hard, have opportunity, and progress with an increased \nstandard of living.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/10/senate-section/article/S9600-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9601-S9602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me turn to the question of \nregulations. We, on the floor of the Senate, are going to be discussing \nregulatory reform. It has been of great interest to me to see what has \nhappened on the issue of regulations. It has become a cottage industry, \nand certainly a political industry, to decide that government is evil, \nand government regulations are inherently evil, and what we need to do \nis wage war against government safeguards and standards.\n  Let me be the first to say that there are some people who propose and \nwrite regulations that make no sense at all and that make life \ndifficult for people. That happens sometimes. I realize that. What we \nought to do is combat bad regulation and get rid of it. Bad government \nregulations that do not make any sense and are impossible to comply \nwith--we ought to get rid of them. I understand and accept that.\n  But I am not one who believes we ought to bring to the floor of the \nSenate initiatives that say, ``Let's step back from the substantial \nregulations that made life better in this country for dozens of \nyears.''\n  We have had fights in many different venues to try to decide: When \nshould we put an end to polluting America's air? How long should we \nallow America's kids to breathe dirty air because the captains of \nindustry want to make more profit? When should we decide you cannot \ndump chemicals into our rivers and streams? When should we decide we \nwant environmental safeguards so the Earth we live on is a better place \nto live?\n  We made many of those decisions already. We made fundamental \ndecisions about worker safety. We made decisions about the environment. \nWe made decisions about auto safety. Many of those decisions were the \nright decisions and good decisions. If we bring to the floor of the \nSenate, under the guise of regulatory reform, proposals that we decide \nwe ought to retreat on the question of whether we want clean air in \nthis country, then we are not thinking very much.\n  I do not know whether many Members of the U.S. Senate or many of the \nAmerican people fully understand how far we have come. Do you know, in \nthe past 20 years, we now use twice as much energy in this country as \nwe did 20 years ago and we have less air pollution? We have cleaner air \nin America today than we did 20 years ago, yet we use twice as much \nenergy.\n  Why do we have cleaner air? Is it because someone sitting in a \ncorporate board room said, ``You know, what I really need to do, as a \nmatter of social conscience, is to stop polluting; what I need to do is \nbuild some scrubbers in the stacks so there are fewer pollutants coming \nout of the stacks and that way I will help children and help people and \nclean up the air''? Do you think that is why we cleaned up America's \nair? The job is not done, but do you think that is why America's air is \ncleaner now than 20 years ago, because the captains of industry in \ntheir paneled boardrooms decided to give up profits in exchange for \ncleaner air?\n  Not on your life. Not a chance. The reason the air in this country is \ncleaner than it was 20 years ago is bodies like this made decisions. We \nsaid, ``Part of the cost of producing anything in this country is also \nthe cost of not polluting. You are going to have to stop polluting. Is \nit going to cost you money to stop polluting? Yes, it is. And we are \nsorry about that. But you spend the money and pass it along in the cost \nof the product, because the fact is we insist that America's air be \ncleaner. We are tired of degrading America's air, and having men, \nwomen, and children breathe dirty air that causes health problems and \nfouls the Earth we are living on.''\n  What about water? Do you know now there are fewer lakes and streams \nwith acid rain; that we have fewer acid rain problems, we have cleaner \nstreams, cleaner lakes in America now than 20 years ago?\n  Why is that happening? Is it because somebody decided that they would \nno longer dump their pollutants into the stream? No. It is because the \npeople in this country through their government said we want to stop \nfouling the streams. We had the Cuyahoga River catch on fire. The \nCuyahoga River in Cleveland actually started burning one day. Why did \nthat happen? Because the manufacturers and others in this country were \ndumping everything into these streams and thought it was fine. It was \nnot fine. We decided as a matter of regulation that it was not fine.\n  There are some people who say, ``Well, that is inconvenient for \ncorporations. It costs too much to comply with all of these. Let us \nback away on some of these restrictions.''\n  I want you to know that we are going back a ways. I have told this \nstory before. I am going to tell it again because it is central to this \ndebate. All government regulations are not bad. Some of them are \nessential to this country's health.\n  Upton Sinclair wrote the book in the early 1900's in which he \ninvestigated the conditions of the meatpacking houses in Chicago. What \nhe discovered in the meatpacking plants of Chicago was a rat problem. \nAnd how did they solve the rat problem in a meatpacking plant in \nChicago? They put out slices of bread laced with arsenic so the rats \ncould eat the arsenic and die. Then the bread and the arsenic and the \nrats would all be thrown down the same hole as the meat, and you get \nyour mystery meat at the grocery store. The American people started to \nunderstand what was going on in those meatpacking plants, and said, \n``Wait a second. That is not what we want for ourselves and our kids. \nIt is not healthy.''\n  The result, of course, was the Federal Government decided to pass \nlegislation saying, We are going to regulate. What would you rather see \nstamped on the side of a carcass of beef--``U.S. inspected?'' Does that \ngive you more confidence? It does for me. It means that carcass of beef \nhad to pass some inspection by somebody who looked at it not with an \neconomic interest, but who looked at it, and said, ``Yes. This passes \ninspection, and it is safe to eat.''\n  Or do you want the meatpacking plants--the captains of industry in \nthe meatpacking business who in the year 1900 would have been running a \nplant in which they were trying to poison rats in the same plant and \nmixing it with their meat? Well, I know who I would choose. I would \nchoose to have a food system in this country that is inspected so the \nAmerican consumer understands that we are eating safe food.\n  Let me talk about one other regulation that I am sure is \ninconvenient. In fact, I was involved with some of these \n\n[[Page S 9602]]\nwhen I was in the House of Representatives. People may recall that it \nwas not too long ago when you went to a grocery store and picked up a \ncan of peas or a package of spaghetti or an ice cream bar from the \nshelves or the cooler and looked at the side. What did you see? You saw \nthat this is an ice cream bar, this is a can of peas, and this is a box \nof spaghetti. That is the only information you got about that food--\nnothing more; nothing about sodium; nothing about fat; nothing more. \nBecause they did not feel like telling you.\n  So we decided that it would be in the consumers' best interest if \nthey had some notion what was in this product. You go shopping at the \ngrocery store and watch. People clog the aisles these days picking up \none of these cans. They turn to the back. They want to find out what is \nin it. How much fat is in this one? How much saturated fat is in that \nproduct?\n  You give people information and they will use it. It is good \ninformation. It improves their health. It makes them better consumers. \nIs that a bad regulation that we require people to tell the American \npeople what is in food? No. I think it is a good regulation. But I will \nguarantee you this. Those who are required to do it fought every step \nof the way. The last thing they wanted to do was to have to comply with \nanother regulation. I think these regulations make sense.\n  We are talking about regulations for safety, health, and the \nenvironment. Not all of them, not every one of them, but the bulk of \nthe directions of what we were doing with regulation makes a lot of \nsense.\n  I do not want the debate this week here in the Senate to be a debate \nthat is thoughtless. I would like it to be a debate that is thoughtful. \nLet us find out which regulations are troublesome, not which \nregulations are inconvenient or costly. I do not want to say to this \nindustry or to that industry, ``Yes. It is costly for you to comply \nwith the clean air requirements. So that is fine. We will understand. \nWe will give you a little break.'' I am sorry. I do not intend to give \nthem a break. I do not intend that they have dirty air so they can have \nmore profits.\n  I would like us to do this in a reasonable way. As I said when I \nstarted, there are some regulations that make no sense. I have seem \nsome of them. I have participated in trying to get agencies to change \nsome of them. I would be the first to admit that there are plenty of \npeople working in the Federal Government who know all about theories \nand know all about the details but do not have the foggiest notion \nabout what the compliance burdens are. These things need to make some \nrational sense. They need to be dealing with a goal that makes sense. \nThey need to be constructed in a way so that compliance is enhanced. \nBut I hope that the debate we have this week will really center on the \nquestions about government regulation. What are we doing this for? In \nmost cases, we are doing this for the public good.\n  So, Mr. President, I think this is going to be a fascinating and \ninteresting debate. We have some people in this Chamber who would like \nthe wholesale repeal of a whole lot of important environmental and \nsafety regulations. I do not happen to support that. Some would. Others \nwho say every regulation is terrific. I do not support that either. I \nthink what we ought to do is try to figure out what works and what does \nnot, to get rid of what does not, and keep what works and keep what is \ngood for this country.\n  I hope that is the kind of discussion we will have as the week goes \non on the issue of regulatory reform.\n  Mr. President, at this point I would like to yield the remainder of \nmy 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/10/senate-section/article/S9601-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9602-S9603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       BILLIONAIRES' TAX LOOPHOLE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the worst examples of Republican \nmisplaced priorities is the current blatant attempt to keep the tax \nloophole open for billionaires who renounce their American citizenship \nin order to avoid paying taxes on the massive wealth they have \naccumulated in America.\n  Under current law, these unpatriotic billionaires get a juicy tax \nbreak for turning their back on Uncle Sam. Does anyone in America \nseriously think they deserve it?\n  When Democrats initially tried to close the loophole last April, our \nproposal was rejected--supposedly because a few so-called technical \nquestions needed to be addressed.\n  It turns out that the only serious technical issue was how to keep \nthe loophole open, or at least save as much of it as possible.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation completed its long-awaited study on \nthe loophole on June 1 and it turned out to be a blatant attempt to \nsave the loophole, rather than close it.\n  The Ways and Means Committee found the ways and means to keep the \nloophole open. They have even given the bill an appropriate number--\nH.R. 1812.\n  What a perfect number for a tax loophole bill--1812. That is about \nthe year their thinking on tax reform stopped. Democrats will try to \nbring their 1812 bill into the 20th century when it gets to the \nSenate--and close that loophole tight on those unpatriotic \nbillionaires.\n  I just wish our Republican friends would put as much time and effort \ninto closing tax loopholes and reducing corporate welfare as they put \ninto keeping loopholes open.\n  We would save tens of billions of dollars, and balance the budget far \nmore fairly, instead of balancing it on the backs of Medicare and \neducation and low-income working families.\n  Tomorrow, the Senate Finance Committee will be holding a hearing on \nthe billionaires' tax loophole. It is vitally important that the Senate \nstand firm in its desire to close this flagrant loophole once and for \nall.\n  On April 6, 96 of us went on record in favor of closing it. If we \nreally want to close this loophole, we cannot accept the Ways and Means \nCommittee bill. That bill is more loophole than law.\n  It does not prevent massive income tax avoidance by patient \nexpatriates, and it does nothing to prevent avoidance of estate taxes \nand gift taxes.\n  First, the House bill allows expatriates to pay no U.S. tax on their \ngains if they wait 10 years before they sell their assets.\n  This part of the loophole already exists in current law, as has been \nrepeatedly pointed out.\n  There is no reason to leave it open. Expatriates should be taxed when \nthey expatriate--at the time they thumb their nose at Uncle Sam.\n  Second, under the House bill, gains from foreign assets built up \nduring U.S. citizenship would not be subject to U.S. tax after \nexpatriation takes place. All U.S. citizens pay taxes on worldwide \nincome, so why should not expatriates?\n  Any serious proposal to address this issue must tax the gains on the \nexpatriate's worldwide assets, and this tax must be imposed at the time \nof expatriation.\n  In addition, under the House bill, expatriates will continue to use \ntax planning gimmicks to avoid taxes on gains from domestic assets by \nshifting income from this country to foreign countries. As long as the \nTax Code exempts foreign assets from the tax, wealthy expatriates will \nfind new ways to shift assets and avoid taxes.\n  Third, the House bill cannot be effectively enforced. Expatriates can \nleave the U.S. tax jurisdiction without paying the tax or posting any \nsecurity. They merely fill out a form at the time of expatriation, and \nthe IRS will be left in the cold.\n  Fourth, the House bill does nothing to prevent expatriates from \navoiding gift and estate taxes. With good legal advice, an expatriate \ncan transfer all assets to a foreign corporation and then give it all \naway without any gift tax liability.\n  Finally, in a particularly obnoxious maneuver, the Ways and Means \nCommittee bill unsuccessfully attempted to gerrymander the effective \ndate of its watered-down reform in a transparent attempt to permit a \nfew more undeserving billionaires to slither through the full loophole \nbefore the mild committee changes take effect.\n  Under this proposal, wealthy tax evaders would have qualified for the \n\n\n[[Page S 9603]]\nloophole by simply having begun, not completed, the process of \nrenouncing their citizenship by the February 6 effective date.\n  The Ways and Means Committee knows how to set a strict effective date \nwhen it wants to. On the very bill where the controversy over the \nbillionaires' loophole first erupted, the committee set a strict \neffective date to prevent Viacom, Inc., from obtaining a $640 million \nbreak on the sale of its cable TV properties.\n  The committee required a binding contract to be reached by the \neffective date. Viacom could not meet that requirement, even though it \nhad taken many steps over many months before the effective date to \nnegotiate the contract.\n  Viacom lost the tax break because it had not taken the final step--\nand the same strict requirement of final action should be applied to \nbillionaires who are in the process of renouncing their citizenship.\n  If they had not completed the final step by February 6, they should \nnot be able to use the loophole.\n  Fortunately, the Democrats prevailed on the effective date, because \nof the spotlight placed on the issue. But that still did not stop them \nfrom finding an additional loophole for some of those seeking \nexemption.\n  To help these expatriates, the Republicans on the committee carved a \nnew loophole for expatriates who become a citizen of a country in which \nthe individual's spouse or parents were born.\n  In sum, at a time when Republicans in Congress are cutting Medicare, \neducation, and other essential programs in order to pay for lavish tax \ncuts for the rich, they are also maneuvering to salvage this \nunjustified loophole for the least deserving of the superwealthy--\nbillionaires who renounce America, after all America has done for them.\n  I say, this loophole should be closed now, and it should be closed \ntight--no ifs, ands, or buts. I intend to do all I can to see that it \nis.\n  Let us close the loophole, not just pretend it is being closed as the \nWays and Means Committee bill does.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/10/senate-section/article/S9602-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to a \nlittle green and red sticker on my lapel. It says, ``I love \nwatermelon.'' And Mr. President, I sure do.\n  Thanks to the hard work of South Carolina watermelon farmers like Jim \nWilliams of Lodge in Colleton County, Senators and their aides tomorrow \nwill be able to taste the sweet, juicy, red meat of the melon that we \ncall smile fruit. All day Tuesday, my staff will deliver more than 500 \nwatermelons to offices throughout the Senate.\n  This year, farmers in South Carolina planted more than 11,000 acres \nof watermelons. We produce all kinds of watermelons--Jubilees, \nSangrias, Allsweets, Star Brites, Crimson Sweets, red seedless, yellow \nseedless, and a variety of other hybrids marketed in the Eastern United \nStates.\n  Through the end of this month, farmers in Allendale, Bamberg, \nBarnwell, Colleton, Hampton, and other southern South Carolina counties \nwill harvest hundreds of thousands of watermelons. In the Pee Dee areas \naround Chesterfield, Darlington, and Florence Counties, the harvest \nwill continue until about August 20.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that all of these farmers will be \nlaboring in the heat and humidity to bring Americans what we call \nMother Nature's perfect candy. Our remarkable watermelons are sweet, \nsucculent, and, most importantly, nutritious and fatfree. However, \nwhile many of us savor the taste of juicy pink watermelons at the \nbeach, at barbecues, and at family reunions, we often forget the work \nand labor that goes into producing such a delicious fruit. In fact, if \nyou ask many children these days where watermelons come from, they will \nanswer ``the grocery store.'' The truth is, Mr. President, that our \nfarmers are among the most often forgotten workers in our country. \nWithout their dedication and commitment, our Nation would not enjoy \nsuch a wonderful selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other foods.\n  South Carolina farmers lead the way in the production of watermelons. \nFor example, my State was a leader in the development of black plastic \nand irrigation to expand the watermelon growing season. By covering the \nearth in the spring with black plastic, farmers are able to speed up \nthe melons' growth by raising soil temperatures. In addition, the \nplastic allows farmers to shut out much of the visible light, which \ninhibits weed growth. In addition, I am pleased to note that the \nscientists at the USDA vegetable laboratory in my hometown of \nCharleston continue to strive to find more efficient and effective ways \nto produce one of our State's most popular fruits.\n  Therefore, as my fellow Members and their staffs feast on watermelons \ntomorrow, I hope they all will remember the folks in South Carolina who \nmade this endeavor possible: Jim Williams of Williams Farms in Lodge; \nLes Tindal, our State agriculture commissioner; Wilton Cook of the \nClemson University Extension Service in Charleston; Minta Wade of the \nSouth Carolina Department of Agriculture; and members of the South \nCarolina Watermelon Association and South Carolina Watermelon Board in \nColumbia. They all have worked extremely hard to ensure that Senators \ncan get a taste of South Carolina.\n  I trust that all Senators and their staffers will savor tomorrow one \nof the finest examples of the excellent produce we grow in our State. I \nalso hope to see many folks wearing their ``I love watermelon'' \nstickers in celebration of the fruit that makes everyone smile--South \nCarolina watermelons.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/10/senate-section/article/S9603-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9603-S9604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              MILO WINTER\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to pay tribute to an \noutstanding educator, Mr. Milo Winter, of Rapid City, SD. Throughout \nhis career, he made tremendous contributions to our State in music \neducation.\n  For the past 26 years, Milo served as band director at Stevens High \nSchool. The community of Rapid City knows him for his commitment to \neducation and his drive for excellence. However, his reputation extends \nfar beyond the borders of our State. He is known across the United \nStates for his work at band festivals and clinics.\n  To see Milo's positive effect on his students and the community, one \nneeds only look at the achievements of the Rapid City Stevens Band. In \n1975, the band was selected by the United States Bicentennial \nCommission to represent the United States at a music festival held in \nthe former Czechoslovakia. This was the first performance by an \nAmerican high school band behind the Iron Curtain. In 1981 and 1984, \nthe band received first place honors at the Cherry Blossom Band \nFestival here in Washington, DC. The band's appearance in the 1987 \nTournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, CA, marked the first time a \nband from South Dakota performed in this world-famous parade. Perhaps \nthe greatest honor the band has earned is the Sudler Flag of Honor. \nThis award, presented in 1987, is one of the most prestigious awards a \nband can receive. To receive this award, bands must be nominated for \ntheir outstanding performance of march music and be approved by a \nnational committee.\n\n[[Page S 9604]]\n\n  Milo's leadership made these achievements possible. He consistently \nset high expectations for students, then saw them through with his own \nblend of encouragement and discipline. He demanded much of his \nstudents, but gave generously of his talent and effort in return.\n  This drive for excellence has been with Milo throughout his life. \nAfter receiving his degree from Augustana and his masters from the \nUniversity of South Dakota, Milo continued his pursuit of music by \nserving in the U.S. Army Band for 2 years.\n  Upon leaving the Army, Milo taught music at Beresford High School. \nAfter 2 years as the band director at Rapid City Central High, he \naccepted the position as band director at the newly created Rapid City \nStevens High where he continued teaching for the rest of his career.\n  Milo instilled a love of music in many students, but countless \nstudents came away from his classroom with much more. The lessons they \nlearned about setting goals, teamwork, attention to detail, and \nperseverance will stay with students throughout their lives. Many of \nthese students will count Mr. Winter among those leaders who forever \nshaped their careers and characters. Mr. President, students in South \nDakota have been blessed with a tremendous teacher and role model. On \nbehalf of the people of South Dakota, I thank Milo and wish him the \nbest in his retirement.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will probably require longer time than the \nremaining minutes before 1 o'clock. I ask unanimous consent that I may \nuse such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/10/senate-section/article/S9603-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9604-S9606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           C. ABBOTT SAFFOLD\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Walt Whitman said that man is a great thing \nupon the Earth and through eternity but that every jot of the greatness \nof man is enfolded out of woman. Shakespeare, in King Lear, tells us \nthat ``Women will all turn monsters.''\n  In the book of Genesis, however, we are told that God, seeing the \nincompleteness of man standing alone, wanted to find a helper for him. \nAnd so God created this helper--Eve--whose name means ``Life,'' and God \ncreated Eve from the rib of Adam himself. The symbolism of the rib is \nthat it was taken from the place nearest to Adam's heart, thus \nindicating the close relationship of man and woman. The real essence of \nthe story is that man and woman were made for each other, that woman is \nbone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. In the Genesis account, Eve is \nelevated to Ethereal beauty and lofty dignity. Milton, in his \n``Paradise Lost,'' has called her Queen of the Universe and fairest of \nthe fair.\n  Throughout all the ages of mankind's existence on this Earth, some of \nthe most vivid personalities have been those of women--such as Sarah, \nRebekah, Rachel, Hannah, and Mary, the Mother of Jesus--even with such \nwomen as Jezebel and Potiphar's wife. Many of the women depicted in the \nscriptures exerted great influence over their husbands, over kings, and \nover nations. Many of the women remain nameless and some appear in \ngroups under such headings as daughters, wives, mothers, widows. We are \ntold of Lot's wife, the woman who looked back, and 15 words in the Old \nTestament tell her story--one brief, dramatic record that placed her \namong the well known women of the world. The 15 words are, ``But his \nwife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.''\n  Then there is Jochebed, the mother of Moses--Hebrew lawgiver, \nstatesman, and leader--and her name rises up today, some 35 centuries \nlater, as one of the immortal mothers of Israel.\n  Miriam is the first woman in the Bible whose interest was national \nand whose mission was patriotic. She was the brilliant, courageous \nsister of Moses, and when she led the women of Israel in that oldest of \nall national anthems, ``Sing unto the Lord,'' four centuries of bondage \nin Egypt had been lifted. It was a turning point in Israel's religious \ndevelopment, and a woman led in its recognition. Miriam is the first \nwoman singer on record. The wonder of it is that she sang unto the \nLord, using her great gift for the elevation of her people, who, with \nher, exalted over their escape from their enemies.\n  The first women to declare their rights on the death of their father \nwere the five daughters of Zelophehad: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, \nand Tirzah. Their father, a Manassite, had died in the wilderness, and \nthe daughters explained that he was not in the company of Korah, who \nhad rebelled against Moses. Because their father had not died, \ntherefore, for any cause that doomed their family or their inheritance, \nthey declared that they were clearly entitled to what he had left. This \nhappened at a critical time with Israel. A new census had been made, \npreparatory to an entrance into the Promised Land. The new land would \nbe distributed according to the census taken before Israel departed \nfrom Egypt for the Promised Land. The daughters of Zelophehad had been \nnumbered among all those in the tribes who either were 20 years of age \nor would be 20 by the time the land actually was distributed, but they \nknew that under existing customs, they would have no property rights, \neven in the new land. What did they do? They marched before Moses and \nstated their case publicly. In order to be fair in the settling of the \ndaughters' case, Moses went before God, a God of justice and right, and \nthe great lawgiver came back and declared: ``The daughters of \nZelophehad speak right; thou shalt surely give them a possession of an \ninheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the \ninheritance of their father to pass unto them.'' Moses wrote a new law \nwhich stated: ``If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his \ninheritance to pass unto his daughter.''\n  The daughters of Zelophehad had filed one of the earliest reported \nlawsuits on record. In the American Bar Association\n Journal of February, 1924, there was an article in which this decision \nof the daughters of Zelophehad is quoted. It is described as an ``early \ndeclaratory judgement in which the property rights of women marrying \noutside of their tribe are clearly set forth.'' The decision handed \ndown in this time of Moses was a great victory for these five \ndaughters. At last a woman had rights, because these five women had \ndeclared theirs and had had the courage to fight their case through \nwith the authorities.\n\n  The only woman in the Bible who was placed at the height of political \npower by the common consent of the people was Deborah. Though she lived \nin the time of the ``Judges,'' some thirteen centuries before Christ, \nthere are few women in history who have ever attained the public \ndignity and supreme authority of Deborah. She was like Joan of Arc, who \n27 centuries later, rode in front of the French and led them to victory \nover the English.\n  One of the most lovable women in the Bible is Ruth, and her abiding \nlove embraces the person one might least expect it to--her mother-in-\nlaw, Naomi. Ruth was not only an ideal daughter-in-law, but she was \nalso an ideal wife and mother. Her story, which finally culminates in \nher marriage to Boaz, a man of influence, is one of the most beautiful \nromances in the Bible.\n  Then there was the woman of Endor, to whom King Saul went in \ndesperation, and she foretold his death. The King James version of the \nBible, which is the only version of the Bible that I will read, calls \nher ``A woman that hath a familiar spirit.'' Some modern writers have \ndubbed her the ``Witch of Endor.'' Lord Byron has called her the \n``Phantom Seer.'' Kipling gives one of the most vivid portrayals of all \nin these lines:\n\n       Oh, the road to Endor is the oldest road\n       And the craziest road of all.\n       Straight it runs to the witch's abode\n       As it did in the day of Saul,\n       And nothing has changed of the sorrow in store\n       For such as go down the road to Endor.\n\n  The first reigning Queen on record who pitted her wits and wealth \nagainst those of a king was the Queen of Sheba. She came to Jerusalem \nfrom her kingdom in Southwestern Arabia to investigate all that she had \nheard about Solomon, Israel's wisest and wealthiest king. She worked \nout a trade zone demarcation and alliance with Solomon, and Solomon's \ncommercial expansion followed after her visit. She was one of many \nrulers from far and wide who sought to learn about Solomon's wisdom. \nOthers sent Ambassadors, but she \n\n[[Page S 9605]]\nwas the only one to go herself, traveling a 1,200-mile journey by camel \ncaravan. She was a courageous, resourceful woman. The Queen of Sheba \nlives on now, nearly 30 centuries since her visit, as a woman whose \nspirit of adventure and whose resourcefulness, courage, and curiosity \nhave not been surpassed by any queen in history. She certainly had a \nsense of good public and international relations which is unparalleled \namong many of the national leaders of today.\n  Esther is the central figure in what is one of the most controversial \nbooks in the Old Testament, because not once does the name of God \nappear in that book. But its significance and importance to Jewish \nhistory stems from the fact that it has become a patriotic symbol to a \npersecuted people of the ultimate triumph of truth and justice. And the \ncourage of Esther becomes the dominating factor in the salvation of her \npeople. Though the author of the book of Esther is not known, \nhistorians confirm the fact that he showed an amazingly accurate \nknowledge of Persian policies and customs, and critics place his work \namong the masterpieces of literature. Like many great characters in \nhistory, Esther makes her first appearance as one of the humblest of \nfigures, an orphan Jewess. But 4 years later, she rises to the position \nof a queen of amazing power--a power which she manages to use wisely. \nThe ancient writer's estimate of Esther's importance to the story \nbecomes apparent, for in this short Bible book, Esther's name appears \n55 times. The name of no other woman in the Bible is recorded so often.\n  The setting is placed in the sumptuous palace of the Persian Empire \nduring the time of Artaxerxes II, who reigned 404-358 B.C. I shall not \nrelate this fascinating story here today, but Esther had a strong \nbelief in prayer, and she went before the king to intercede on behalf \nof her people. As she made ready to appear before the king, one of the \nmost courageous assertions made by a woman in the Bible is credited to \nEsther. She said: ``So I will go in unto the king, which is not \naccording to the law; and if I perish, I perish.'' Here is a woman who \nhad not only high courage but also sincere faith and devotion to the \ncause of her people. She had received a message from her cousin \nMordecai, placing upon her this great responsibility. He said: ``Who \nknoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?''\n  Mr. President, challenging words these were for a young, \ninexperienced queen, and they have come down to us through the \ncenturies, and may be considered applicable to us in the face of the \nchallenges of our own time.\n  It was Mary Magdalene who was the first to see Christ's empty tomb, \nand she was the first to report to the disciples the miracle of the \nresurrection, the greatest event the Christian world has ever known. \nCertain of Christ's disciples followed Mary Magdalene to the sepulcher. \nJohn went in first and gazed in silent wonder at the open grave, and \nthen Peter came and saw that the grave was empty and that the linen \ncerements were lying neatly folded in the empty sepulcher. Mary \nMagdalene, possessing a woman's sensitivity and able to believe even \nwhat eyes cannot behold, returned to the tomb and looked inside, where \nshe saw two angels in white sitting there, the one at the head and the \nother at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. Strange it was \nthat the first word spoken inside the empty tomb should be ``Woman.'' \nAnd then there followed the angel's question: ``Why weepest thou?'' \nMary Magdalene answered, ``Because they have taken away my Lord, and I \nknow not where they have laid him''. Then she turned, and Jesus stood \nbefore her. Not until he spoke her name, ``Mary,'' did she recognize \nthat he was Jesus. Her lonely watch by the grave in the early morning \nhad been an evidence of her faith. Because of her faith, she became the \nfirst witness to the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n  Lydia was a business woman, a ``seller of purple,'' and probably one \nof the most successful and influential women of Philippi, but more than \nthat, she was a seeker after truth, and thus she became Europe's first \nconvert to Christianity. Her house became the first meeting place of \nChristians in Europe. Lydia will ever stand among the immortal women of \nthe Bible, for she picked up that first torch from Paul at Philippi and \ncarried it steadfastly. She was one of many to spread the Gospel of \nJesus Christ through Europe and then farther and farther Westward, and \nit became brighter as the centuries unfolded.\n  One of the most influential women in the New Testament Church was \nPriscilla, a Jewess who had come out of Italy with her husband Aquila, \nwho lived first at Corinth and later at Ephesus. They had left Rome at \nthe time when Claudius, in his cruel and unjust edict, had expelled all \nJews. It is recorded that she and her husband were tent makers. The \nApostle Paul stayed with them at Corinth. She became a great leader in \nthe church at Corinth and at Ephesus and later at Rome. In the latter \ntwo\n places, she had a church in her home. Christians honor her today \nbecause she served God ``acceptably with reverence and godly fear'', \nand because she was not ``forgetful to entertain strangers; for thereby \nsome have entertained angels unawares.'' Priscilla, let us not forget, \nhad entertained a stranger, Paul, and from him had learned to strive to \nbe ``perfect in every good work . . . working in you that which is \nwellpleasing in his sight, through Christ Jesus.''\n\n  Mr. President, I shall close my brief comments on the women of the \nBible, by referring to the time when Christ sat at the house of Simon \nthe leper, and there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment \nof spikenard. She broke the box and poured the precious ointment on the \nhead of our Lord. Some of those persons who observed this were very \nindignant and asked the question, ``Why was this waste of the ointment \nmade? For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, \nand have been given to the poor.'' And so they murmured against the \nwoman, but Jesus said, ``Let her alone. Why trouble ye her? Ye shall \nhave the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will, ye may do them \ngood; but me, ye have not always.'' Jesus said, ``She hath done what \nshe could; she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying''. \nJesus went on to say that weresoever his gospel would be preached \nthroughout the whole world, this act of kindness which the woman had \ndone, ``shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.'' And so it is, that \nI am here today, twenty centuries later, speaking on the Senate floor \nabout this nameless woman who gave of her treasured possession to honor \nHim who was about to die. And, as Jesus foretold, this display of \nreverence and adoration by this nameless woman, shall be told and \nretold through all of the centuries to come.\n  Mr. President, one could speak volumes about the women of the Bible \nor the great Roman matrons or the women of ancient history or the women \nof the middle ages, and women of our own times. There is much to be \nsaid, for example, through words of praise concerning the women who \nhave been associated with our own institution, the United States \nSenate--Members, as well as workers who have labored faithfully, day \nafter day, year after year, in the service of the Senate. And it is \nsuch women, many of whom will always remain nameless, who, through the \nyears, and throughout all the parts of the globe, have been the real \npillars of civilization.\n  I rise today to pay tribute to just such a worthy person--a true \nprofessional, a staffer of such talent, energy, and engaging \npersonality that she is known throughout the Senate community simply by \nher first name--Abby. Abby Saffold has been a school teacher, a case \nworker, a legislative correspondent, a legislative secretary, chief \nclerk of a Senate subcommittee, a legislative assistant, a Floor Staff \nManager, Secretary for the Majority (a post to which I appointed her in \n1987), and now Secretary for the Minority. She is the first female to \never hold the post of Secretary for the Majority.\n  In short, Abby has done it all, and done it all very, very well. Few \nstaffers, indeed, few members, possess her grasp and understanding of \nthe workings and the purpose of the institution of the United States \nSenate. Her knowledge of legislative strategy, her managerial ability, \nand her negotiating prowess are all well known and greatly appreciated \nby everyone who has ever had the pleasure of working with Abby. \n\n[[Page S 9606]]\n\n  She is really unexcelled when it comes to an intuitive sense of this \nSenate and its machinations. Abby is the literal personification of the \nwonderful ability to maintain great grace under extraordinary \npressure--the true mark of the professional.\n  Few individuals understand the great personal sacrifice routinely \nmade by the legislative floor staff here in the Senate, on both sides \nof the aisle. Unpredictable schedules, long hours, intense pressures, \ntime away from loved ones at important moments, broken engagements with \nfriends and family--all are experienced to some degree by senior Senate \nstaffers, but no one group experiences these demanding and trying \ndisruptions with more frequency than the Senate floor staff.\n  These positions, in particular, demand extreme dedication, steady \nnerves, alert and facile minds, hearty constitutions, patience, and a \ndeep and abiding love for, and dedication to, this institution and the \nimportant work it must perform. Never was there a better example of \nthat dedication than C. Abbott Saffold. She is in every way a marvel, \nwith the ability to perform difficult and demanding duties, always with \na pleasant demeanor and unequaled coolness under fire.\n  I would be less than honest if I did not admit that Abby's decision \nto leave us causes me considerable sadness, because she is so much a \npart of the Senate family. In many ways, I cannot imagine the Senate \nwithout her. I know that for many months after her departure, I shall \nsearch in vain for her familiar cropped head and her friendly grin in \nthe Chamber, only to have to remind myself once again that she has \ngone.\n  I offer her my heartfelt congratulations on an outstanding Senate \ncareer, and on her service to her country. Certainly I wish her blue \nskies and happy days as she begins her well-earned retirement time. \nBut, I cannot deny that I regret her leaving. I shall miss her \nfriendship and her always sage advice. As Paul said of two women \nEuodias and Syntyche--both eminent in the church at Philippi--``They \nlabored with me in the gospel,'' so I say to Abby: ``You labored with \nme in service to the Nation.'' For me, there will never be another \nAbby.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/10/senate-section/article/S9604-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 343, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 343) to reform the regulatory process, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Dole amendment No. 1487, in the nature of a substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMichigan is recognized to offer an amendment relative to small \nbusiness.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will shortly offer the Abraham \namendment.\n  In essence, our amendment would ensure that Federal agencies \nperiodically assess the utility of regulations that disproportionately \nimpact small business.\n  I think it is critically important any regulatory reform bill take \ninto account concerns of America's small businessmen and women.\n  At this time, I yield to the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee as much time as he desires for comment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, and would like to \nthank the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Byrd, for his excellent remarks covering the women of the Bible \nas well as I have heard him cover on the Senate floor, and his tribute \nto Abby Saffold, who, of course, all Members have a great deal of \nrespect for.\n  Mr. President, I intend to start each day in this debate--I may not \nfully comply--with the top 10 list of silly regulatory requirements.\n  I would pick a few at random today. Let me start with No. 10: \nDelaying a Head Start facility by 4 years because of the dimensions of \nthe rooms; No. 9, forcing a man to choose between his religion and his \njob because rules do not allow workers to wear a mask over a beard--\nstupid rules, I might add, silly regulatory requirements; No. 8, \nthrowing a family out of their own home because of painted over lead \npaint, even though the family is healthy; No. 7, fining a gas station \nowner $10,000 for not displaying a sign stating that he accepts motor \noil for recycling; No. 6, reprimanding a Government employee who bought \na new lawn mower with his own money but failed to go through the proper \nprocedures; No. 5, citing a farmer for converting a wetland when he \nfills his own manmade earthen stock tank and made a new one, elsewhere \non his property--on his own property, I might add. No. 4, failing to \napprove a potentially lifesaving drug, thus forcing a terminal cancer \npatient to go across the border to Mexico to have it administered; No. \n3, prohibiting an elderly woman from planting a bed of roses on her own \nland; No. 2, fining a man $4,000 for not letting a grizzly bear kill \nhim.\n  These are my top 10 list of silly regulatory requirements. No. 1: \nRequiring Braille instructions on drive-through ATM machines. We can \nsee a lot of reason for that in our society today.\n  These are just a few of the reasons why we are here today. I intend \nto bring some more to the attention of Members as we continue to go on \nhere. We all know the regulatory process is out of control. Regulators \nhave an incentive to regulate.\n  Some regulations are not only counterproductive, they are just plain \nstupid, as some I have just mentioned. The status quo is not acceptable \nto the American people, especially if they get to know what is really \ngoing on in our society. And they all suspect the costs of regulation \nare mounting. Paperwork costs the private sector and State and local \ngovernments a small fortune. Compliance costs cost even a bigger \nfortune.\n  Regulation restricts freedom. What you can use your own land for, \nwhat medical treatment you can have or provide for your family, what \nyour company is required to do, et cetera, et cetera.\n  It is especially onerous on small businesses. Regulatory reform is \nabsolutely necessary to get the Federal Government off our backs. For \neconomic flexibility and growth as well as to reform personal freedoms, \nwe need to change the way in which the Federal Government regulates.\n  Regulatory reform is an essential part of making Government smaller. \nRegulatory reform will mean less Federal spending, lower Federal taxes, \nfewer Federal regulations, smarter regulations, and accountability on \nthe part of those in the bureaucracy.\n  This bill is about common sense. I think most Americans would agree \nthat our Federal Government is out of control and that the \noverregulatory system is eating us alive, especially in terms of the \nburdens it places on all Americans.\n  This bill simply requires that Government agencies issue rules and \nregulations that help, rather than hurt, people. It will require that \nthe Federal bureaucracy live by the same rules that Americans have to \nlive by in their own lives--you and I and everybody else. These rules \nare that the benefits of what you are telling people to do have to \njustify the cost.\n  The notion of common sense and accountability and rulemaking may be a \nradical idea inside the Washington beltway, but I believe that our \nfellow Americans are smothered in bureaucratic red tape in all aspects \nof their lives and they are pretty darned tired of the status quo.\n  This bill will not mean an end to safety and health regulations, as \nsome of its critics would have you believe. All it will mean is that \nthe people in Washington who devise such rules will have to ensure that \nthe interpretations of those rules, or the rules themselves make sense. \nThey will have to quit being the protectors of the status quo.\n        myths and fears: unfounded attacks on s. 343\n\n  In his first inaugural address, Franklin Delano Roosevelt inspired a \nnation beleaguered by the Great Depression with these calming words: \n``We have nothing to fear but fear itself.'' Now \n\n[[Page S 9607]]\ncertain Democrats, representing the left of that great party and \nclaiming to be the political heirs of Roosevelt, have turned 180 \ndegrees. Instead of pacifying hysteria they are engaging in the worst \nform of fear mongering.\n  They content that regulatory reform will either overturn 25 years of \nenvironmental law or roll-back environmental, health, or safety \nprotection. They also claim that passage of this bill will clog the \ncourts, allow judges to second-guess scientific findings, delay needed \nrulemaking, and require the creation of a new bureaucracy of thousands.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, the root of the \nhysteria of the left is not a concern over the protection of health, \nsafety, or the environment, but a concern over the loss of power. The \nliberal agenda has usurped power to the Federal agencies, which have \nbecome the left's biggest constituency. Real regulatory reform, such as \nS. 343, you see, will whittle away at the excesses of the modern \ncentralized administrative state. It will force the bureaucracy to \nrationalize and make more cost-effective its rules and regulations. It \nwill shift power back from Washington to the grass roots of the people. \nIt will transform bureaucracy into democracy.\n  This bill is a commonsense measure. It simply requires Federal \nbureaucrats to ask how much a rule will cost and what the American \npeople will get in return. Passage of this bill, in fact, will foster \nthe protection of health, safety, and the environment by assuring that \nthe American taxpayer will get more bang for the buck. It does so by \nmandating that the costs of regulation must justify the benefits \nobtained and that the rule must adopt the least costly alternative \navailable to the agency. This will assure more efficient regulations, \nultimately saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Actually, \nbillions of dollars.\n  Let me address certain myths arising from the fear campaign of the \nopponents of S. 343:\n  Myth No. 1: The bill will overturn or rollback environmental \nprotection or health and safety laws. That is pure poppycock. Section \n625 of the bill, the decisional criteria section, makes clear that the \ncost-benefit and risk assessment requirements supplement existing \nstatutory standards. Thus, there is no supermandate that overturns \nstatutory standards, such as the recently passed House regulatory \nreform bill. Instead, S. 343 works much the way the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act does. Where NEPA requires agencies to consider \nenvironmental impacts, S. 343 requires agencies to consider cost of the \nregulation. Neither statutory scheme overturns existing health, safety, \nor environmental standards.\n  So, forget about myth No. 1. It is phony. It is a lie.\n  Myth No. 2. They say cost-benefit analysis is unworkable because we \ncannot quantify benefits. In fact, one of these far-left liberal \noutrageous groups compared a cost-benefit analysis with what happened \nunder Hitler's regime.\n  It is hard to believe that we would have that in this day and age, \nfrom groups that claim to be representing the public.\n  Let us just forget that myth, because\n   opponents of S. 343, although they claim that the cost-benefit \nanalysis requirement in the bill requires that costs and benefits be \nquantified, their argument is that benefits, such as clean air or good \nhealth, are too subjective to be quantified. As a result, benefits will \nbe understated and rules consequently will not adequately protect \nhealth, safety, or the environment. That is their argument.\n\n  There is only one problem with this argument: S. 343 explicitly \nstates that agencies must consider qualitative--as well as \nquantitative--factors in weighing costs and benefits, Section 624 even \ngoes so far as to allow agencies to select a rulemaking option that is \nnot the least costly if a nonqualitative consideration is important \nenough to justify the agency option.\n  Myth No. 3: The requirements for cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessments will harm health, safety, and the environment by delaying \nimplementation of needed regulations. This is simply not true. S. 343 \ncontains emergency exemptions from cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessments in situations where regulations need to be enacted to \nprevent immediate harm to health, safety, and the environment. \nFurthermore, agency actions that enforce health, safety, and \nenvironmental standards, such as those concerning drinking water and \nsewerage plants, simply are not covered by the Act.\n  In any event, the cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment \nrequirements are hardly novel. Under orders on regulations that go back \nto the administration of President Ford, most agencies must already \nperform cost-benefit analyses for numerous rulemakings and many \nagencies, such as EPA, already conduct risk assessments as a routine \nmatter. What this bill will do is to assure that cost-benefit analyses \nare done for all rulemakings and that risk assessments are based on \ngood science.\n  Myth No. 4: The agency review and petition process will open up all \nexisting rules for review and this will grind all agency activities to \na halt. The agency review and petition process will have no effect on \nreasonable regulations. Only those regulations imposing unreasonable \ncosts without significant benefits and rules based on bad science are \nlikely to be modified or repealed. I might ask what is wrong with that?\n  Moreover, not all rules must be reviewed. Only major rules, which \nhave an expected effect of $50 million on the economy need be reviewed. \nAnd the agencies have 11 years to review these rules. This is more than \nample time to review rulemakings. As to the petition process, to be \nsuccessful in having a petition to review a rule not on a review \nschedule granted, the petitioner must demonstrate a reasonable \nlikelihood that the existing rule does not meet the decisional criteria \nsection. In other words, that the rule would not be cost-effective if \nthe rule was promulgated under the standards set forth in the bill. \nThis is an expensive proposition, for the petitioner must do a cost-\nbenefit analysis to demonstrate this point.\n  Ultimately, with regard to the petition process, it simply boils down \nto whether one thinks that the status quo is acceptable or not. \nUnderstandably, defenders of the status quo are horrified at the \nprospect that perhaps something ought to be done about rules already in \nexistence whose costs to the American people are greater than the \nbenefits that result. I disagree, of course, with that attitude.\n  Myth No. 5: The judicial review provision will create scores of new \ncause of actions clogging the courts and would allow judges to second \nguess agency scientific conclusions. Section 625 of the bill makes \nclear that judicial review of a rule is to based on the rulemaking file \nas a whole. Noncompliance with any single procedures is not grounds to \noverturn the rule unless the failure to follow a procedure amounts to \nprejudicial error--which means the failure would effect the outcomes of \nthe rule. Thus, section 625 would not allow for courts to nit-pick \nrules. Moreover, section 625 requires courts to employ the traditional \narbitrary and capricious standard, a standard which requires courts to \nshow deference to agency factual and technical determinations. This \nprevents courts from second, guessing agency scientific findings and \nconclusions.\n  I would also note that it is ironic that those who oppose the \njudicial review provision of S. 343 on the grounds that it will clog \nthe courts are the same people who oppose meaningful legal reform.\n  Why? Because they want these lawsuits to continue everywhere else. \nThey just do not want the American people and individual citizens and \nsmall businesses to be able to sue to protect their rights against an \nall-intrusive Federal Government which is over-regulating them to \ndeath.\n  Myth No. 6: Implementation of the bill would require a new \nbureaucracy of thousands. First of all, many agencies, such as EPA, \nalready perform cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments. This is \nbecause of the existing executive order that requires such analyses for \nrules effecting the economy at $100 million. According to an EPA \nsource, ``[o]ne big misconception about these bills is that risk \nassessments and cost-benefit analysis requires a lot more work than has \nroutinely been done at EPA.'' Second, the requirement for peer review \npanels to assure good science and plausible estimates for risk \nassessments, will not significantly hinder the promulgation of rules. \nPeer review only applies to risk assessments \n\n[[Page S 9608]]\nthat form the basis for major rules--having the effect on the economy \nof $50 million annually--or major environmental management activities--\ncosting $10 million.\n  I just wanted to get rid of some of these myths about this bill. I am \nsick and tired of articles written, like the one in the New York Times, \nthat have no basis in fact. As a matter of fact, I think this is one of \nthe most hysterical displays by the far left that I have seen. And it \nis even worse than the ``People For The American Way'' full-page ad \nagainst Judge Robert Bork that had some, as I recall, close to 100 \nabsolute fallacious assertions in it that they never once answered \nafter I pointed them out.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. One of the myths put out about the so-called Dole-\nJohnston amendment is that it contains a supermandate. That is, that \nthe present requirements of law--for example, on the Clean Air Act, \nwhen it sets standards, for example, of maximum achievable control \ntechnology or the other specific requirements of law--that somehow \nthose are overruled by this bill.\n  Would the Senator agree with me that the language is very clear in \nsaying that does not happen under this bill? To quote the language, it \n``supplements and does not supersede the requirements of the present \nlaw.'' And, in fact, other language in the bill specifically points out \nthat there will be instances where, because of the requirements of \npresent law, you cannot meet the tests of the risk justifying the cost? \nThe benefits justifying the cost? And, in other words, the requirements \nof present law, under the instant Dole-Johnston amendment, would still \nbe in effect and would not be overruled by this bill? Would the Senator \nagree with me?\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree 100 percent with the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana, who has coauthored the bill along with Senator Dole and \nothers here. Section 625 of this bill, the decisional criteria section, \nmakes clear that the cost-benefit assessment requirements supplement \nexisting statutory standards.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield----\n  Mr. HATCH. Thus, there is absolutely no supermandate.\n  Mr. GLENN. For a parliamentary inquiry? I wanted to straighten out \nthe time. It was my understanding the time, starting at 2 o'clock, was \nto be divided equally among proponents and opponents of the bill. The \nSenator from Michigan--it was my understanding the time so far, the \ntime of the Senator from Utah, had come out of the time of the Senator \nfrom Michigan? Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. I have used too much of this time, so I \nyield back my time.\n  Mr. GLENN. I know they were preparing a unanimous-consent request to \nthat effect. We do not have that yet. But it was my understanding that \nthose were the rules we were operating under. I just wanted to make \nsure everyone agreed to that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a factsheet I have \nwith me be printed in the Record at this point, as well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nS. 343: Responsible Regulatory Reform That Protects Health, Safety and \n                            the Environment\n\n\ns. 343 does not override existing health, safety and environmental laws\n\n       Sec. 624(a)--Cost-benefit requirements ``supplement and \n     [do] not supersede'' health, safety and environmental \n     requirements in existing laws.\n       Sec. 628(d)--Requirements regarding ``environmental \n     management activities'' also ``supplement and [do] not \n     supersede'' requirements of existing laws.\n\n\n        s. 343 protects human health, safety and the environment\n\n       Sec. 622(f) and Sec. 632(c)(1)(A)--Cost-benefit analyses \n     and risk assessments are not required if ``impracticable due \n     to an emergency or health or safety threat that is likely to \n     result in significant harm to the public or natural \n     resources.''\n       Sec. 624(b)(3)(B)--An agency may select a higher cost \n     regulation when ``nonquantifiable benefits to health, safety \n     or the environment'' make that choice ``appropriate and in \n     the public interest.''\n       Sec. 624(b)(4)--Where a risk assessment has been done, the \n     agency must choose regulations that ``significantly reduce \n     the human health, safety and environmental risks.''\n       Sec. 628(b)(2)--Requirements for environmental management \n     activities do not apply where they would ``result in an \n     actual or immediate risk to human health or welfare.''\n       Sec. 629(b)(1)--Where a petition for alternative compliance \n     is sought, the petition may only be granted where an \n     alternative achieves ``at least an equivalent level of \n     protection of health, safety, and the environment.''\n       Sec. 632(c)--Risk assessment requirements do not apply to a \n     ``human health, safety, or environmental inspection.''\n\n\n      s. 343 does not delay health, safety and environmental rules\n\n       Sec. 622(f) and Sec. 632(c)--Cost-benefit and risk \n     assessment requirements are not to delay implementation of a \n     rule if ``impracticable due to an emergency or health or \n     safety threat that is likely to result in significant harm to \n     the public or natural resources.''\n       Sec. 533(d)--Procedural requirements under the \n     Administrative Procedures Act may be waived if ``contrary to \n     the public interest.''\n       Sec. 628(b)(2)--Requirements for major environmental \n     management activities are not to delay environmental cleanups \n     where they ``result in an actual and immediate risk to human \n     health or welfare.''\n       Sec. 801(c)--Congressional 60-day review period before rule \n     becomes final may be waived where ``necessary because of an \n     imminent threat to health or safety or other emergency.''\n\n\n          s. 343 does not place a ``price tag on human life''\n\n       Sec. 621(2)--``Costs'' and ``benefits'' are defined \n     explicitly to include \n     ``nonquantifiable,'' not \n     just quantifiable, costs and benefits.\n       Sec. 622(e)(1)(E)--Cost-benefit analyses are not required \n     to be performed ``primarily on a mathematical or numerical \n     basis.''\n       Sec. 624(b)(3)(B)--An agency may choose a higher cost \n     regulation when \n     ``nonquantifiable benefits \n     to health, safety or the environment'' dictate that result.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it was my understanding that when the \nSenator from West Virginia concluded and we began discussion on the \nregulatory reform bill, that there would be 2 hours of time equally \ndivided between myself and Senator Glenn; and that the time for Senator \nHatch's statement--I did yield to him--was to come out of my time.\n  I agree with that. I would like to know how much of my hour remains \nat this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is 30 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I do not think that is correct. I believe \nSenator Hatch spoke for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nyielded to both sides on this matter will have begun at 1:15.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, would this \nthen mean that the time certain that was established for a vote later \nthis afternoon at 5:15 would have to be set back in accordance with \nthat?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not necessarily.\n  Mr. GLENN. Then, Mr. President, something has to give here because we \nwere supposed to have a certain time set aside for Senator Nunn, which \nI believe was 2 hours--2 hours for Senator Abraham and 2 hours for \nSenator Nunn; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Originally, that would have been 2 hours on \nthe first amendment and 2 hours and 15 minutes on the second.\n  Mr. GLENN. What would be the timing on the vote this afternoon if we \nagreed to the proposal made by the Senator from Utah?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I object to the proposal of the Senator \nfrom Utah in that the Senator from West Virginia did not conclude his \nremarks until 1:25 p.m. We were to start at 1:25. I would have no \nobjection in calculating based on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will announce that the bill was laid \ndown at 1:20 and that the next amendment would be laid down at 3 \no'clock pursuant to the previous order.\n  Mr. HATCH. Parliamentary inquiry: As I understand, there was supposed \nto be 2 hours of debate. That should not begin until 1:20. That means \nthat there should be 2 hours from 1:20.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The previous agreement was that the amendment \nby the Senator from Michigan could be laid down at 1 o'clock with no \nother time agreement, and that the other aspect of the agreement was \nthat the amendment could be laid down by \n\n[[Page S 9609]]\nthe Senator from Georgia at 3 o'clock with votes beginning at 5:15.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then I suggest, and I ask unanimous consent, that the 2-\nhour time limit on this first amendment begin at 1:20 and that the 2-\nhour-and-15-minute time limit begin on the second amendment at 3:20.\n  I withdraw my unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I suggest we proceed. We are wasting a lot \nof time on this. Let us just proceed. If we need extra time at the end, \nwhich I doubt that we will, then we can take appropriate action at that \ntime. Otherwise, let us proceed and hope we can hit the 3 o'clock \ndeadline anyway, if that is all right with the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Very well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMichigan is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1490 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n     (Purpose: To ensure that rules impacting small businesses are \n      periodically reviewed by the agencies that promulgated them)\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham], for himself, Mr. \n     Dole, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Grams, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1490.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (a) on page 27 line 13, strike ``subsection'' and insert \n     ``subsections''; and\n       (b) on page 27 line 13, after ``(c)'', insert ``and (e)''; \n     and\n       (c) on page 30, before line 10, insert the following:\n       ``(e) Review of Rules Affecting Small Businesses.--(1) \n     Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1), any rule designated for \n     review by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small \n     Business Administration with the concurrence of the \n     Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory \n     Affairs, or designated for review solely by the Administrator \n     of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, shall be \n     included on the next-published subsection (b)(1) schedule for \n     the agency that promulgated it.\n       ``(2) In selecting rules to designate for review, the Chief \n     Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and \n     the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory \n     Affairs shall, in consultation with small businesses and \n     representatives thereof, consider the extent to which a rule \n     subject to sections 603 and 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility \n     Act, or any other rule meets the criteria set forth in \n     paragraph (a)(2).\n       ``(3) If the Administrator of the Office of Information and \n     Regulatory Affairs chooses not to concur with the decision of \n     the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business \n     Administration to designate a rule for review, the \n     Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register the \n     reasons therefor.''\n       Redesignate subsequent subsections accordingly.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the amendment I have proposed with the \nmajority leader and other Senators would ensure that the concerns of \nAmerica's small businesses are not overlooked or ignored during the \nregulatory review process that S. 343 would establish.\n  We need some type of meaningful regulatory review process because, \nquite simply, the utility of a regulation may change as circumstances \nchange. The fact that a regulation withstood cost-benefit analysis at \nthe time of its promulgation provides no assurance that it remains \ncost-effective 5 or 10 years later. A review process with teeth, \nhowever, would ensure that regulations remain on the books only so long \nas they remain cost-effective.\n  Section 623 of the regulatory reform bill appears at first glance to \naddress the need to review periodically the cost-effectiveness of \nexisting regulations. Agencies would be required to publish a schedule \nof regulations to be reviewed. Regulations on the schedule would be \nmeasured against the cost-benefit criteria in section 624 of the bill. \nAnd, although the agency might have more than 14 years to conduct its \nreview of a regulation, the regulation would terminate if the agency \nfailed to complete its review of it within the time allowed.\n  As currently drafted, however, section 623 contains a significant \nloophole. Whether a regulation is subject to review under section 623 \ndepends, at least in the first instance, on whether the agency chooses \nto place the rule on its review schedule. This amounts to the fox \nguarding the henhouse.\n  Under the bill's current language, the only way to add a regulation \nto the list of rules chosen by the agency is to present the agency with \na petition that meets the extremely demanding standard set forth in the \nbill. It likely would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to hire the \nlawyers and technical experts needed to prepare such a petition. Small \nbusinesses by their very nature do not have such large resources at \ntheir disposal. Thus, under the current language of section 623, \nagencies potentially could overlook or even ignore the needs of small \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. President, small businesses are too important to our economy to \nlet that happen. Small businesses are the engines of job creation in \nour Nation. From 1988 to 1990, small businesses with fewer than 20 \nemployees created 4.1 million net new jobs, while large businesses with \nmore than 500 employees lost over 500,000 net jobs during the same \nperiod. It comes as no surprise, then, that 57 percent of American \nworkers are employed by a small business. Thus, when we overlook the \nneeds of small businesses, we put American jobs in jeopardy.\n  And when it comes to reducing the burden of regulations, the needs of \nsmall businesses are particularly acute. The hidden tax of regulatory \nburdens is highly regressive in nature: According to the U.S. Small \nBusiness Administration, small businesses' share of regulatory burdens \nis three times that of larger firms.\n  There are a number of commonsense reasons for this fact. First, \nunlike big businesses, small businesses cannot spread the costs of \nregulation over a large quantity of product sold to the public. Since \nthe regulatory costs borne by small businesses are thus concentrated on \na relatively small quantity of product, those costs have a \ndisproportionate impact on the cost of goods and services sold by small \nbusinesses. Put simply, the advantages of economies of scale apply to \nregulatory costs just as they do to other costs of doing business.\n  A second reason why regulations hit small businesses especially hard \nis that small businesses simply cannot afford to hire the lawyers, \nconsultants, and accountants needed to comply with the paperwork \nrequirements that inevitably attend regulatory mandates.\n  When it comes to small businesses, the agencies' avalanche of \npaperwork falls not on an accounting or human resources department but, \nrather, on a hard-working entrepreneur who often lacks the time or \nexpertise necessary to cross all the T's in the manner the agency has \ncommanded.\n  The magnitude of this burden truly cannot be overstated. The Small \nBusiness Administration estimates that small business owners spend \nalmost 1 billion hours per year filling out Government forms. An \nexample illustrates the point. Recently, a small construction company \ninquired about bidding on a modest remodeling project at a post office \nin South Dakota. In response to that inquiry, the owner of the company \nreceived no less than 100 pages of bidding instructions. Needless to \nsay, Mr. President, a 100-page book of bidding instructions might as \nwell state on its cover that ``small businesses need not apply.''\n  In short, Mr. President, given the importance of small businesses to \nour economy and their disproportionate share of the cost of \nregulations, we need to ensure that S. 343 contains a regulatory review \nprocess that is responsive to the concerns of small businesses.\n  Our amendment would meet that need by empowering the chief counsel \nfor advocacy of the Small Business Administration, also known as the \n``small business advocate,'' to protect the interests of small \nbusinesses during the regulatory process.\n  Under our amendment, the advocate would be permitted to add \nregulations that hurt small businesses to the list of regulations that \nthe agencies themselves have chosen to review, in accordance with the \noffice at the White House known as OIRA.\n \n[[Page S 9610]]\n\n  The advocate would do so pursuant to a simple process. First, the \nadvocate would consult with small businesses concerning the burdens \nthat regulations impose on them. Next, the advocate would consider \ncriteria such as the extent to which a regulation imposes onerous \nburdens on small businesses or directly or indirectly causes them not \nto hire additional employees.\n  On the basis of such input and criteria, the advocate would designate \nregulations for review. If the administrator of OIRA then concurred in \nthe advocate's designation of a rule for such inclusion, at that point \nthe rule would be added to the list of regulations the agencies have \nchosen to review. Additionally, if OIRA itself chose to designate a \nrule for review, that rule could be added to the agency's list.\n  Our amendment thus would be a small business counterpart to the \npetition process available to larger firms. Just as through the \npetition process high-priced lawyers and consultants would ensure that \nregulations impacting big businesses are not overlooked as regulations \nare reviewed, so, too, would this process ensure that regulations, the \nheavy costs of which are borne by small businesses, are not ignored in \nthe regulatory review process.\n  This task falls squarely within the advocate's mission. Created by a \n1976 act of Congress, the advocate's mission is to ``counsel, assist \nand protect small business,'' thereby ``enhancing small business \ncompetitiveness in the American economy.''\n  Pursuant to this mission, the advocate ``measure[s] the direct costs \nand other effects of Government regulation on small businesses and \nmake[s] legislative and nonlegislative proposals for eliminating \nexcessive or unnecessary regulations of small businesses.'' The \nadvocate also administers the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which has \nafforded it additional experience in assessing the impact of \nregulations on small businesses.\n  In fact, by allowing the advocate to designate rules for review, our \namendment merely builds on the foundation laid by the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act. Under that act, the advocate reviews agency analyses \nof the likely impact of proposed and final rules on small businesses. \nThus, under our amendment, the advocate's role in reviewing regulations \nwill be very similar to its role in promulgating regulations.\n  In summary, Mr. President, small businesses need an advocate in the \nregulatory review process. For too long, small businesses have been \nleft at the mercy of Federal agencies. Our amendment will ensure that \nsmall businesses' concerns are considered in a manner that reflects \ntheir contribution to our economy.\n  That is why the National Federation of Independent Businesses has \nscored our amendment as a key vote in its rating system.\n  In the end, Mr. President, our amendment will lead to more efficient \nregulations for small businesses and more jobs for American workers.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Michigan \nwill yield a few minutes to me on his amendment.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New Mexico \nsuch time as he shall need.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do we have enough time for me to ask him----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair should note that time is not \ncontrolled at this point.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, you say time is not controlled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is not controlled at this point.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On this amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. The discussion we \nhad a little while ago resulted in no agreement. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will you advise me when I have used 10 \nminutes, please.\n  Mr. President, the Federal regulatory process, from everything we can \ndetermine from our constituents and in various and sundry meetings \nacross this land and in our States, is simply out of control. Federal \nregulations affect in a very real way every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica.\n  The cost of Federal regulations, however, has been estimated to be as \nhigh as a half trillion dollars a year, $500 billion. Even the most \nconservative estimates of the cost of Federal regulations show that the \ncost of regulations has a profound impact on American citizens.\n  A recent Washington Post article reported that regulations ultimately \ncost the average American household about $2,000 a year. I believe one \nof the main reasons these regulations cost Americans so much is that \noften they are not generated in an efficient and commonsense manner. \nThat does not mean we do not need regulations, but we need efficient \nand commonsense regulations.\n  The sheer volume of regulations proposed and finalized by Federal \nagencies every year is staggering. For example, the registry, that is, \nthe Federal Register, in 1994 alone runs a total of 68,107 pages. They \ntake up an entire storeroom of space in my office as we attempt to \nfollow them.\n  Mr. President, how can anyone, no matter how earnest or diligent, \ncomply with all of these? In my State, small business makes up about 85 \nto 90 percent of the employers. From my standpoint, I have suspected \nthat they felt unrepresented and put upon, and about 2 years ago I \nestablished a small business advocacy group. We held field hearings on \nan informal and voluntary basis, and almost all the small business \nowners that I talked to and spoke with, the people who create almost \nall the jobs in our State, told me just how smothering this explosion \nhas become.\n  I would like to read a letter from one of my constituents in this \nregard, a small businessman in northwestern New Mexico, Mr. Greg Anesi. \nHe is the president of a small business in our State called Independent \nMobility Systems which makes equipment for the handicapped. His \nbusiness employs quite a few handicapped people. And Mr. Anesi wrote to \nme to tell me exactly how crushing simply preparing the paperwork \nrequired by regulations has become to his small business. The letter \nstates:\n\n       When we consider hiring additional employees, we are \n     limited by the fact that the more people we employ, the \n     greater the regulatory costs and the burdens.\n\n  Further, this crushing regulatory inefficiency can and does have a \nvery damaging impact on the environment and on human safety because it \ndiverts limited financial resources from the most pressing of \nenvironmental problems. The book called ``Mandate for Change'' reports \nthat in 1987, ``a major EPA study found that Federal Government \nspending on environmental problems was almost inversely correlated to \nthe ranking of the relative risks by scientists within the agency.''\n  One way to solve the problem is to use best available science when \nmaking regulatory decisions about the environment and human safety. I \nhave been a champion of that, and last year in fact I attached the \namendment to the Safe Drinking Water Act. That amendment would ensure \nthat the best available peer-review science was used when promulgating \nsafe drinking water standards.\n  Nor is the use of good science in environmental decisionmaking a \npartisan issue. In this same book, which I hold up, ``Mandate for \nChange'', which President Clinton endorsed as a book which tries to \nmove us toward a better future, on page 216 there is a specific call to \n``expand scientific research on, and use of, risk assessment as part of \na national effort to set environmental priorities.'' I am happy to see \nthat S. 343 has incorporated environmentally conscious, good science \nconcepts in its assessment provisions.\n  Another way to solve problems of inefficient Federal regulations is \nto make sure that agencies consider the costs and the benefits of the \nregulations they promote. I understand that will be a matter of very \nsignificant debate on the floor, what standard with reference to costs \nand how will costs and benefits relate one to the other.\n  Again, I do not believe cost analysis is a partisan issue. Every \nPresident since Richard Nixon, including President Clinton, has \nrequired cost-benefit analyses before rules are promulgated. \nUnfortunately, Federal agencies are not performing these analyses as \nwell as they should. The fact that both S. \n\n[[Page S 9611]]\n343 and Senator Glenn's regulatory reform bill contain cost-benefit \nsections show that both Democrats and Republicans agree on this point. \nPerhaps there is some disagreement as to how one would apply the costs \nand the concept of benefits in determining whether or not the costs \nwere justified is still in order, and we will debate that.\n  Mr. President, the Abraham amendment to S. 343 allows for agencies to \nput an existing regulation on a list of meaningful cost-benefit \nreviews. The problem with the bill's current language is that there are \nonly two ways for a regulation to be put on this list. First, it is up \nto the agency to choose to put an existing regulation on the list for \nreview, while allowing the agency to do this sort of thing rather than \nforcing them to is exactly the problem we are trying to address with \nthese bills. Second, an interested party can petition to get an \nexisting rule on the list but only if that party can show that the rule \nis a major rule.\n  Showing that a rule costs the national economy $50 to $100 million \ncan cost the interested party thousands of dollars. That is one of the \nproblems. Small business does not have thousands of dollars to prove \nthat the national economy will be influenced $50 to $100 million. When \nthe interested party is a small business, that cost is simply out of \nreach no matter how ridiculous the existing regulation might be.\n  Mr. President, that is why I support the Abraham amendment. This \namendment will empower the chief counsel for advocacy at the U.S. Small \nBusiness Administration, in concurrence with the administrator of the \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs, to add regulations to the \nagency's list which have significant impact on small business. This \namendment, therefore, would allow the small businessman, the little \nguy, the small business owner, a real opportunity to make sure that \nFederal agencies actually perform the cost-benefit analysis that \neveryone says should be done but that everyone agrees are too often \nignored in practice.\n  So, Mr. President, I compliment the Senator who has had to modify his \namendment, as I understand it, to include OIRA, the administrator of \nthe Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and some might think \nunder certain circumstances that might not be the best. But I think \nover time, when you combine the small business advocacy office and the \nadministrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in \nthe executive branch, over a period of time I think this amendment has \na chance for small business to get some of their concerns on the list--\nthat is, on the list to be reviewed--rather than it being as difficult \nas the base bill, S. 343, would provide.\n  I hope the amendment is adopted, and I thank the Senator for offering \nthe amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I want to make some remarks on the bill \nitself and then some remarks specifically on the amendment by the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  I firmly believe that this is one of the most important bills that we \nwill take up this year. That probably comes as a surprise to a lot of \npeople who think regulatory reform is pretty dry, arcane, and is about \nlike watching mud dry, as far as interest goes. It is what we termed in \nthe past a MEGO item, ``my eyes glaze over'' when you bring it up. That \nis about the interest that it will generate with a lot of people, \nbecause it is not debating B-2 bombers or the M1A2 tanks, or something \nlike that. It deals with the nitty-gritty of rules and regulations, how \nthey get published, why they are necessary, and so on.\n  Lest anyone think we have a lot of bureaucrats just sitting over on \nthe other side of town dreaming up rules and regulations to put out on \ntheir own volition, that is not the way these things happen.\n  We pass laws in the Senate and in the House of Representatives and we \nsend them over to the President. The President signs them. Then they go \nto the agencies to have the rules and regulations written that \nimplement them, that let them be put into effect, that make them \npractical so they can go out and affect everyone, literally, in this \ncountry--businesses, organizations, individuals, families, children, \nelderly. Everyone is affected by many of these rules and regulations.\n  If we did a better job in the Congress, I think perhaps we would find \nless necessity for rules and regulations over in the agencies and the \nDepartments. If we want to see the major problem area, we ought to look \nin the mirror, because what we do is too often see how fast we can get \nlegislation out of here. We do slapdash work on it here, send it over \nand then we are somehow surprised that the agencies and the people \ndoing the regulation writing do not do a better job, and then we are \nall concerned about why they did not do a better job when we did not do \na good enough job in directing them in what they are supposed to do.\n  Having said that, some 80 percent of the regulations written are \nrequired to be written by specifics of legislation passed in the \nCongress. So we bear heart and soul a lot of the blame on this thing. \nBut the importance of rules and regulations cannot be denied. It is \nwhat makes them applicable across the country.\n  Let me say this. I do not think there is a single Senator that I know \nof who thinks we should just go along with the status quo. The \nadministration started a review of this whole area 1\\1/2\\ years ago, \nand they already cut out a lot of rules and regulations. They are in \nthe process of doing more of that right now. So the Senate is \ninterested, the House of Representatives is interested, the \nadministration is interested, and it is that important. We are united \non the need to make some changes. So this is not a partisan thing \nacross the aisle on the need. The question is how we go about this.\n  Let me go back a few years to 1977. The Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, of which I am a member--I was not chairman at that time. \nLater on I was chairman of the committee for 8 years. Senator Roth \nchairs the committee now. But back in 1977, we had what was really a \nlandmark study. It was a landmark study on regulatory reform. It \nresulted in OMB and OIRA changes, the establishment of processes there. \nIt was an open process. So we had an interest through the years on \nthese matters.\n  In this year, we had four hearings on the bill in committee. It was \nbipartisan in support in that committee. We deliberated, we considered \neverything everyone wanted to consider, and we had a 15-0 vote when \nthat came out of committee. There was agreement on it, and it was a \nbill of balance.\n  I think we focused on many of the very central issues, and I will get \nto those in just a moment. But the bill that we have as S. 291 that has \nnot been introduced here--of course, we are dealing with S. 343, the \nbill proposed by the majority leader--but that bill we passed out of \ncommittee, the Roth bill--and the bill which we would have as an \nalternative, S. 343, now is basically S. 291 that came out of \ncommittee, with just three changes. Those three changes are: A major \nrule would be defined as one having a $100 million impact per year. No. \n2, if an agency fails to review the rules within 10 years, there would \nbe no sunset. In other words, an administrator in an agency could not \ndeliberately let it run beyond the time period and automatically have \nlaws and rules sunset without congressional action. And No. 3, the \ndifference between this and S. 291, as originally voted out of \ncommittee, is there is a simplified risk assessment process to comport \nwith the National Academy of Sciences guidelines on risk assessment.\n  Those are the only three differences. This is a bill that was voted \nout of committee 15-0. We find ourselves in a position where we have \nseveral differences between what was provided in the bill out of \ncommittee and what the majority leader has proposed with S. 343. No. 1, \nthe decision criteria, the test whether an agency can promulgate a \nregulation.\n  S. 343 proposes a least-cost basis. The bill voted out of committee \nproposed a cost-effective basis. There is a big difference between \nleast cost and cost effective.\n \n[[Page S 9612]]\n\n  Another area of difference is that of judicial review. Under judicial \nreview there are some major differences as to what would be judicially \nreviewable; in other words, what you can file suit in court on.\n  Another difference is the $100 million threshold. S. 343 has a $50 \nmillion threshold, which drastically increases the number of bills that \nwould have to be considered.\n  Another difference is the petition process.\n  Another is the sunsetting, as I mentioned a moment ago.\n  Another is how we do risk assessment.\n  The effectiveness of regulatory flexibility is another.\n  If the agencies have done their job or have not done their job.\n  The lack of sunshine, openness, a requirement for openness in our \nlegislation.\n  Of course, there is the area of specific interest fixes, and whether \nwe, as proposed in S. 343, knock out Delaney or toxic release emissions \nrequirements, inventory requirements that every community should have \nknowledge of.\n  These are some of the differences in the legislation between what we \nvoted out of committee and the legislation the majority leader brought \nto the floor.\n  Let me talk about the cost-benefit analysis as a tool and not a \nstatutory override. Now, there is substantial difference of opinion on \nthis. Regulatory reform, we feel, should build on our health and safety \naccomplishments, while applying better science and economic analysis. \nRegulatory reform on its own and without any other consideration should \nnot override existing environmental safety and health laws.\n  There seems to be a difference here. But in discussions about S. 343, \nthere has been a refusal to include language that in the event of a \nconflict between a law--the Clean Air Act, for example--and the new \nstandards in this bill that the law would govern. That is a major \ndifference. I know we say we are in agreement on that. But the language \nthat would spell that out very specifically has been difficult to come \nby up to now.\n  There are other statutory overrides in this bill, like the sunset of \ncurrent regulations if an agency did not act to rewrite or renew them. \nThere would be 10 years to review a petition process, and if it was not \nreviewed, the bill, according to S. 343, would sunset, would go out of \nexistence.\n  There is also what could be considered a rewrite of Superfund and the \nReg Flex Act. What they have in S. 343 is if the cleanup is worth more \nthan $10 million, or will cost more than $10 million, there needs to be \na new analysis of even work in process. I know there is a lot of work \ngoing on. But it is my understanding that that is still the intent of \nthe bill.\n  Under the cost-effective regulations, regulatory reform should result \nin regulations which are cost effective. S. 343 requires agencies to \nchoose the cheapest alternative, not necessarily the one which provides \nthe most bang for the buck. Here is an example: If a $2 increase in the \ncost of a bill would result in the saving of 200 lives, to make a \nridiculous example, the least cost would not permit that extra $2 \nexpenditure.\n  Another area of interest: No special interest fixes. Congress should \nenact reforms of the regulatory process, not fixes for special \ninterest. S. 343, as brought to the floor, rewrites the toxic release \ninventory which gives people the right to know what toxic substances \nhave been released in their communities. It repeals the Delaney clause \nagainst additives in cosmetics with a substitute. It delays and \nincreases costs of ongoing Superfund cleanups and prohibits EPA from \nconducting risk assessments to issue permits to even such things as \ncement kilns and others allowing them to burn hazardous waste.\n  So those are some of the areas. We have others. Better \ndecisionmaking, not a regulatory gridlock is what we are after also. \nRegulatory reform should streamline rulemaking. It should not just be a \nlawyer's dream opening up a multitude of new avenues for special \ninterests to tie up the process.\n  The bill, as brought to the floor, allows courts to review risk-\nassessment and cost-benefit procedures and to reopen peer review \nconclusions. It creates numerous petition processes for interested \nparties. These petitions are judicially reviewable and must be granted \nor denied by an agency within a time certain and these petitions will \neat up agency resources and allow the petitioners, not the agencies, to \nset agency priorities.\n  Now, a very major difference also is the reasonable threshold. The \nnew requirements should be applied wisely where the cost of conducting \nthe analysis are justified by the benefits. But S. 343 sweeps into the \nnew process an unwarranted number of regulations because it would, I \nbelieve, flunk its own cost-benefit test, because it provides for a \nthreshold of $50 million, where the bill we brought out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, that Senator Roth brought out, has a \n$100 million threshold, which means even then somewhere 400 to 600 \nreviews are going to have to be conducted per year. And cutting that \n$100 million standard in half, with no evidence that the extra taxpayer \ndollars needed to comply would be spent effectively.\n  In other words, how many can we really do effectively? That is the \nquestion. I think if we went to the $50 million threshold, we would \nprobably find the agencies being swamped. We are going to spend a lot \nof dollars making no progress, as far as the accomplishment of \nregulatory reform.\n  Last, but certainly not least, is sunshine. Regulatory reform should \nbe open and understandable to the public and regulated industries. It \nshould be sunshine in the regulatory review process.\n  S. 343 as brought to the floor has no sunshine provisions to protect \npublic participation and prevent secrecy in regulatory review. I can \nsay this, going back a few years, when we had the Council on \nCompetitiveness and a few things like that, we certainly need the \nsunshine provision. I think most people here would probably agree with \nthat.\n  Mr. President, the rules and regulations that we are talking about \ninvolve every child in this country, every family, the milk you drink, \nthe meat you eat, transportation, safety, water, air, all of these are \nthings that will be affected by this legislation. That is the reason \nthat I say it will be one of the most important bills that we bring up \nthis year.\n  I do not want confrontation on these things. I think the press has \ncontinued to play it mainly as confrontation. I do not like that, \nparticularly because we are talking about working out cooperative \nmethods and working out compromise on this so we can get a good bill \nfor the whole country. We all stand here united on the need for \nregulatory reform. So I think it is important that we try and work as \nmany of these things out as possible.\n  Now, with specific regard to the proposal made by the Senator from \nMichigan, I know his original proposal was one that I was prepared to \noppose. But he has modified that proposal. I think after we have \nchecked with some of the people involved on our side or wanted to be \ninvolved on our side, we may be able to accept the amendment over here. \nThe amendment, as originally proposed, while well-intentioned, I think, \nwould have added to special interest lobbying, would have delayed \nGovernment decision and frustrated effective regulatory reform. The \namendment would have allowed a single official, and not even the \nAdministrator of SBA but the chief counsel for advocacy, to determine \nany rule, any reg, to be put on the list for agencies. Agencies would \nhave been forced to put these rules on just with one person's say-so. \nAnd that could have been any existing rule he or she might have chosen. \nI did not favor that approach to it\n because I think we had adequate protection in the bill in S. 343 and \nS. 291 both to cover that. We had adequate procedures that would have \ncovered that without giving one person, in effect, what would be a \nczar's authority over all rules and regulations which already have to \nbe reviewed for small business under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, \nwhich is required for agencies to evaluate the impact of proposed rules \non small businesses and to consider less burdensome, more flexible \nalternatives for those businesses.\n\n  Both the Glenn-Chafee bill and S. 343, the one before the Senate, \nalso strengthen the Regulatory Flexibility Act by providing judicial \nreview of agency regflex decisions.\n \n[[Page S 9613]]\n\n  I think that is the right thing to do. I think both bills cover that. \nTrying to tighten up regflex is one thing, but creating a whole new set \nof powers for the Small Business Administration would be quite another \nthing.\n  I know the Senator has modified his proposal to say that now, instead \nof the chief counsel for advocacy at SBA being able to determine on his \nor her own that these things must be considered by the particular \nagency or department involved, he has said now that first they have to \nrecommend these up to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \nin the Office of Management and Budget, which is the office OIRA, that \nnormally passes on these things.\n  It is our understanding that would be an adequate stopgap, an \nadequate monitor, a governor, if you will, or a sieve, to sort out what \nmight be frivolous or might not be frivolous.\n  It is my understanding that the OMB, then, in the amendment as now \nproposed, would be able to stop that procedure if they wanted.\n  I ask my distinguished colleague from Michigan if that is his intent \nnow, that once the SBA counsel has submitted this to OIRA, we could \nturn it down and that would be the end of it.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. The Senator from Ohio is correct, I think. Our \nunderstanding is, with some changes which we made prior to introducing \nthe amendment here today, it was to provide sort of a fail-safe to \nensure that the concerns that the Senator from Ohio has expressed about \nthe possibility of having the advocate of the Small Business \nAdministration move into areas that were of negligible importance, that \nmight be extraordinarily burdensome to the agencies, to provide a type \nof a fail-safe by requiring concurrence--in other words, approval--\nalso, by the Administrator of OIRA.\n  Mr. GLENN. I was curious as to why the Administrator of the Small \nBusiness Administration was not the authority that would pass on these \nthings to OIRA, or make the decision, rather than taking a subordinate \nofficer and, in effect, elevating that officer for a greater authority \nthan the Administrator has in being able to send things off for review \nat a different place.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I will say we felt, of the various responsibilities at \nthe Small Business Administration, the advocate's office is, in effect, \na somewhat independent figure whose principal responsibility under \ncurrent law would seem to be very consistent with the responsibility of \ntrying to protect small businesses with regard to promulgation of new \nregulations.\n  We thought that was the logical place to impose this responsibility. \nAlso, the mechanism seemed to exist to do some of the study that is \nentailed in putting forth these recommendations.\n  We thought that this semi-independent status of the advocate, \ncombined with the authorities already given it, were ones that \njustified and supported the notion of allowing that.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my colleague.\n  As I said earlier, at the appropriate time, after I have had a chance \nto check with a number of people on our side interested in the \nlegislation, we may be able to accept. I, personally, think it is OK \nnow as far as putting OIRA on as sort of a governor or place in which \nthese can be judged before they would be sent to a department or \nagency. I would personally be prepared to accept it.\n  We would like to check with a few more people. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Abraham \namendment. I congratulate the Senator for, first, his concern about \nsmall business, which is a concern of all Members on regulations; \nsecond, for having an appropriate screening mechanism to prevent the \nagency overload.\n  Agency overload, Mr. President, is one of the principal problems with \nthis bill. We are all in favor, at least everyone that I have heard, \nsays they are in favor of cost-benefit analysis, says they are in favor \nof risk assessment. The question is, do we give the agencies more work \nthan they can do and overload their capacity to do it?\n  In its original form, the Abraham amendment might well have been \nsubject to that criticism in that any rule on a look-back which the \nadvocate designated would go into the workload of the agency.\n  However, in the form that the Senator from Michigan has proposed, \nthere is an appropriate screen because the head of OIRA would have to \nconcur with that judgment, which would ensure, I believe, that those \nrules which have a major effect on small business would be included in \nthe workload, as they should be, but that we could prevent the agency \noverload.\n  Mr. President, I think this is an excellent amendment which will \npresently protect small business on the look-back.\n  If I may speak for a few moments on the pending bill and on the Glenn \nsubstitute, which the Senator has spoken about, there are a number of \ndifferences, Mr. President, and I believe that the pending bill, the \nso-called Dole-Johnston amendment, is a much better bill in terms of \naccomplishing the control over a runaway agency.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] states that under \nthe Dole-Johnston bill, there would be a judicial review of the \nprocedures in the risk assessment management; and under the Glenn \nsubstitute, there would not be that review of procedures.\n  Mr. President, exactly the opposite is true under the language \nproposed. Under the language of the Glenn substitute, it states \nspecifically that any regulatory analysis for such actions shall \nconstitute part of the record and shall, to the extent relevant, be \nconsidered by a court in determining the legality of the agency action.\n  The risk assessment protocol is included as part of the record and \nshall be considered by the court--shall be considered by the court--in \ndetermining the legality of the agency action.\n  Now, what does legality mean, Mr. President? Legality can only mean, \nin my judgment, the legality as measured by section 706 of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. If it does not refer to section 706, \nthere is not, within the Glenn amendment, a separate rule for testing \nand determining legality.\n  Now, what does section 706 say? Section 706(D) refers to the \nprocedures, and that any rule which the reviewing court shall hold \nunlawful and set-aside agency actions which are ``without observance of \nprocedure required by law.'' `` * * * without observance of procedure \nrequired by law.''\n  There is nothing, Mr. President, in the Glenn substitute, to say that \nsection 706(D) does not apply. That is the only thing that legality can \nmean.\n  Now, when we get into a further discussion of what the Dole \nsubstitute shows, we will have a blowup of the language and make this \nclear.\n  Mr. President, exactly the opposite is true. That is, Senator Glenn \nsays that his amendment would prevent the review. We say it not only \npermits it, but requires it.\n And that, under the Dole-Johnston pending amendment, it prevents any \nsuch review by saying that, ``failure to comply with the subchapter may \nbe considered by the court solely for the purpose of determining \nwhether the final agency action is arbitrary and capricious or an abuse \nof discretion.''\n\n  Mr. President, another serious deficiency of the substitute is that \nthere is no enforceable petition process on the Glenn substitute, no \nenforceable petition process--no enforceable look-back process.\n  Oh, there are words in there about you can adopt it--you have the \npetition process as provided for under the present law. But what does \nthat amount to? I mean, if all you get is the petition process under \nthe present law, you get nothing. That is what this bill is all about. \nWhat happens when you have an oppressive regulation, of which there are \nmany, which did not follow a risk assessment protocol, which did not \ninvolve scientists or ignored the scientists, which is exorbitantly \nexpensive, and which you want to take a look at?\n  Effectively, there is almost nothing you can do about it, because \nthere are no standards by which you can seek that petition and get it \nreviewed. And, under the Glenn substitute, they simply take the present \nlaw and say: Whatever you do under the present law, we are not going to \ndisturb. There is no look-back process that is enforceable. None at \nall. What it says is that you shall look back at these, all these \nregulations, within 10 years, or you may request to extend that up to \n15 years. But what happens if you do not do it? It says you shall \ninstitute a rulemaking under section 553. What does that mean? It means \nyou submit a notice of proposed rulemaking, which can \n\n[[Page S 9614]]\ngo on forever, and which in turn is not enforceable. That is the \nproblem today. What happens when you can not get an agency to act? You \nhave no recourse at all.\n  Some of these agency actions are absolutely ridiculous. Two years ago \nI first proposed a risk assessment. And the reason I did was we found \nin some of the rules which come before the Energy Committee, which I \nchaired at that time, that these costs were out of control. We could \nnot figure out why it was, for example, that the cost of analyzing the \nYucca Mountain waste site--the costs of characterizing that site--had \ngone up a hundredfold--a hundredfold--from $60 million to $6.3 billion. \nAnd we said, Why could this be? How can the cost of just determining, \nin this case a site for storage of nuclear waste, whether that site is \nsuitable--not the building of the site, just determining whether that \nsite is suitable--how could those costs have gone up from $60 million \nto $6.3 billion?\n  One of the things we found that they had done was adopted a rule \nwhere they had ignored their own scientists, absolutely ignored what \nthe scientists had told them. They did not know what it was going to \ncost. The rule had no basis in health or safety. It was going to cost \n$2.1 billion to comply with and there was nothing anyone could do about \nit.\n  The Glenn substitute takes that same attitude, which is to say: Do \nnot worry about it. You are fully protected under the present rules. We \nare not going to give you a right to go to court. We are not going to \ngive you a right to enforce a petition process. We are not going to \ngive you a right to have an enforceable look-back process. We are going \nto leave it as under present law, and under present law all you have to \ndo is file your notice of proposed rulemaking and that is all you have \nto do. You cannot enforce and require the agency to proceed with that \nrulemaking.\n  So we will have a lot to discuss about this question of the two \nbills. There are improvements which need to be made, to be sure, in the \nDole-Johnston substitute. One of those, which I hope to propose and \nhave agreed to, and I have some confidence that we will be able to do \nso, is to take the CERCLA provisions--that is the Superfund, or \nenvironmental management procedures--out of this bill. I think they \nought to be considered separately. Almost everybody agrees that you \nneed to use risk assessment principles in determining cleanup when you \nhave Superfund sites, but that it would better be done in a separate \nbill, reported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee in the \nSenate. And I believe there is a desire on the part of that committee \nto proceed with that. I think we ought to take those provisions out.\n  I also hope at the appropriate time we can increase the threshold \namount from $50 to $100 million. Again, that relates to this question \nof overload. Because, just as Senator Abraham has so wisely provided a \nscreen to have a check on the amount of overload coming from \nconsideration of small business matters, we need a screen to lift that \nbar a little higher, from $50 to $100 million. There is going to be a \nlot of work to be done under risk assessment and under cost-benefit \nanalysis. There is a lot of work to be done. We do not want to overload \nthe agencies.\n  So, Mr. President, I quite agree with Senator Glenn when he says that \nthis is a very, very important bill. I am delighted there is, I believe \non the part of all parties--myself and Senator Dole, Senator Glenn, \nSenator Hatch, Senator Roth, those who have been the leaders in this \narea--a desire to try to find a way to provide for an appropriate risk \nassessment and appropriate cost-benefit analysis.\n  I believe, with that desire of all parties, that we can work our will \nand get a good bill. But make no mistake about it, risk assessment, \nputting science as opposed to politics or emotion or prejudice or \nsuperstition--putting science back into the decision process and having \na process that works, and that is required to be followed, a logical \nprocess--that tells the American taxpayer we are going to fully protect \nyour health and safety but we are not going to foolishly spend money on \nthings that do not relate to health and safety.\n  One final point about the Dole-Johnston amendment. My friend from \nOhio, Senator Glenn, says that under our amendment you must take the \nleast-cost alternative. Mr. President, that is simply not true. The \nbill very specifically states that where uncertainties of science or \nuncertainties in the data require a higher cost alternative, that you \nmay do so. Or, where there are--actually, to give the language here, \nthe language says, ``if scientific, technical or economic uncertainties \nor nonquantifiable benefits to health, safety, or the environment \nidentified by the agency in the rulemaking record make a more costly \nalternative that achieves the objectives of the statute appropriate and \nin the public interest and the agency head provides an explanation''--\nthat may be adopted.\n  So, Mr. President, what we say is you get the least cost alternative \nthat achieves the objectives of the statute unless the science is \nuncertain, or the data are uncertain, in which event you can get a more \ncostly alternative. Or you may make a more costly alternative if \nnonquantifiable benefits to health, safety, or the environment make \nthat in the public interest. What does that mean? That means, if it \nwould save more lives to do something else. How can you quantify the \nvalue of life? You cannot. But you can go to a higher cost alternative \nif those nonquantifiable benefits to health, safety, or the environment \nmake another alternative more advisable.\n  But we say that, if you are going to go to this higher cost \nalternative because of these nonquantifiable benefits, or if there are \nuncertainties of science, then you must identify what those \nuncertainties are, or you must identify what those nonquantifiable \nbenefits are, and then provide the least cost alternative that takes \ninto consideration the nonquantifiable benefits.\n  So what we are saying is you may go higher, but you have to say why \nyou went higher, and you cannot do it just because you want to or \nbecause it is politically attractive to do so or because some \nconstituent group wants you to do it. You have to identify what it is \nthat is uncertain or what it is that is nonquantifiable.\n  So, Mr. President, in closing, I will just say that the Abraham \namendment, I think, is a good one now that both protects small business \non the lookback procedures but provides the appropriate screen. \nTherefore, I support that amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. GLENN. I ask my friend from Louisiana. On this least cost versus \ncost effective, he talked about uncertainties. What if there are no \nuncertainties, if the science is good, everybody is agreed on that, and \nif all matters are quantifiable, lives may not be monetizable in dollar \nvalue but they are quantifiable on lives to be saved? I believe the way \nS. 343 is written now, even if only a $2 or a $20 expenditure would \nsave 100 lives, you still have to go with the least cost unless there \nis some uncertainty about the scientific data.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, that is not correct. I think it is an \nexcellent question. I think the problem with the interpretation of the \nSenator from Ohio is that he is putting a very tortured and incorrect \ndefinition of the term ``nonquantifiable benefits to health, safety and \nthe environment.'' The value of the human life is by its nature \nnonquantifiable. I mean, you may say there are 10 lives. You can \nquantify it in that narrow sense. But that is not the sense in which \nthis is meant. We are talking about values and benefits which are \nnonquantifiable. The value of breathing clean air is by its very nature \nnonquantifiable. How can you say when you go out on a beautiful, clear \nday where the temperature is just right, you feel good, how can you say \nthat is worth $764 a week? You cannot. It is by its nature \nnonquantifiable. The health, safety, or the environment are by their \nnature nonquantifiable and, therefore, we have provided that.\n  But all we are saying is, if you as administrator are saying that you \ncan save 10 additional lives, that you have to identify that as your \nreason for going to the more costly alternative, and if that was the \nreason, then you must take the least cost alternative that takes care \nof your 10 lives, that saves your 10 lives. \n\n[[Page S 9615]]\n\n  I hope I have made that clear to my friend from Ohio because it is a \nvery key point.\n  Mr. GLENN. It is a key point. I think it is indicative of the kind of \ndebate we are going to get into here on some of these specifics, the \nmeaning of words and so on. It has to be something that will hold up in \ncourt, that is understood by the courts. And that is a real major \nproblem on this whole bill. We spent days and many hours going through \nsome of these word differences. This is one example of it that is going \nto be debated further as we get into this bill. I know basically we are \non the Abraham amendment now.\n  Parliamentary inquiry. Does that run out at 3 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 3 o'clock the Senator from Georgia will \noffer an amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Louisiana yield for 10 \nseconds?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Bill Montalto, \nof the House Committee on Small Business, be permitted floor privileges \nfor the purpose of working on my amendment when it comes up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. First, Mr. President, I want to say how strongly I agree \nwith my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Ohio, when he \nspeaks about the need for a bipartisan approach to obtain regulatory \nreform. I want to say that I hope we can continue to work together as \nwe did in the Governmental Affairs Committee to move forward \nlegislation that accomplishes the goals that I think we all seek on \nboth sides of the political aisle.\n  Mr. President, I want to congratulate Senator Abraham for his \ncontribution in offering this amendment. I strongly agree with him that \nthere is no area of activity more adversely affected by some of the \nregulatory reform actions of the past than small business. I think we \nall agree that small business in many ways is the most important part \nof our economy as it is the primary area that results in growth in our \neconomy and, most importantly, is the area where the majority of jobs \nare being created.\n  So, again, I want to congratulate the junior Senator from Michigan \nfor his contribution in proposing this most important amendment.\n  This amendment would strengthen the lookback provisions of section \n623. It would provide a mechanism for adding rules adversely impacting \nsmall businesses to the agency schedules for reviewing rules.\n  As the amendment was originally drafted, it would have allowed the \nChief Counsel for Advocacy at the Small Business Administration to have \nsole discretion to add small business rules to the agency review \nschedules. To respond to concerns about political accountability and \nthe need for standards in selecting rules for review, Senator Abraham \nhas revised his amendment. I believe this revision is a balanced \nsolution to a very important problem.\n  One of my concerns was that, in providing this discretion solely to \nthe Chief Counsel for Advocacy at the Small Business Administration, \nthe original amendment was a delegation of an extraordinarily broad \npower. Since the Chief Counsel for Advocacy at the Small Business \nAdministration is, as the Senator from Michigan pointed out, semi-\nindependent in the same sense that inspectors generals are independent, \nit gave tremendous authority for this individual to take whatever \naction he or she thought was appropriate in requiring rules to be \nreviewed.\n  As revised, the Abraham amendment would ensure more political \naccountability regarding which small business rules are added to agency \nreview schedules. Small business rules could be selected jointly by the \nChief Counsel of Advocacy for the Small Business Administration and the \nAdministrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. \nAlternatively, the Administrator of OIRA alone could choose small \nbusiness rules for review. This would ensure that the Administrator of \nOIRA, a politically accountable official who also understands the \nburdens on the agencies, will be involved in the process.\n  In addition, the revised amendment makes clear that the standards \napplicable to other rules selected for review apply to the small \nbusiness rules. For example, the Administrator of OIRA and the chief \ncounsel must consider, in selecting a small business rule for review, \nwhether review of the rule will substantially decrease costs, increase \nbenefits, or provide flexibility.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Government must be more sensitive to \nthe cumulative regulatory burden on small business. As I said earlier, \nsmall business is, indeed, the backbone of America, a crucial provider \nof jobs, a wellspring of entrepreneurial innovation and a central part \nof the American dream.\n  And again I congratulate Senator Abraham for his hard work to help \nAmerica's millions of small businessowners, their employees, and their \nfamilies. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I would like to \nfirst thank the Senator from Delaware for his help, and providing this \namendment has made it, I think, a stronger amendment, and I appreciate \nhis judgment and guidance on these matters.\n  Mr. President, I would also say that the Abraham-Dole amendment has \nbeen strongly supported by all the Nation's major small business \norganizations, including the NFIB, the National Association for the \nSelf-Employed, the Small Business Legislative Exchange Council, and the \nchamber of commerce, among others. I ask unanimous consent that those \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Support the Abraham-Dole Small Business Protection Amendment to S. 343\n\n       Government regulations constitute an enormous burden for \n     small businesses. Therefore, periodic review and sunsetting \n     of regulations which can become out-of-date, obsolete or \n     excessively time-consuming and costly is a major priority for \n     small business in the regulatory reform debate. Seventy-seven \n     percent of NFIB members support reviewing and sunsetting \n     regulations.\n       The intent of Section 623 of the Regulatory Reform bill is \n     to make certain that regulations are sunsetted as they become \n     obsolete. Regulations listed on review schedules published by \n     the agencies would be measured against the cost-benefit \n     criteria in section 624 of the bill.\n       Unfortunately, regulations would not be subject to review \n     and eventually sunsetted unless the agency responsible for \n     the regulation chooses to place it on the review schedule? \n     That's almost like putting the wolf in charge of guarding the \n     sheep.\n       If an agency doesn't put a regulation, which is \n     particularly burdensome to small business, on the list for \n     review the only recourse is to petition to have the \n     regulation added to the review schedule. Petitioning will \n     cost small business owners money--lawyers, consultants, \n     researchers and others will have to be hired to prepare the \n     petition in order to meet the high demands set forth in \n     section 623.\n       The solution is the Abraham-Dole amendment. This amendment \n     would empower the Chief Counsel for Advocacy at the U.S. \n     Small Business Administration to add regulations to the \n     agencies' review schedules which have significant impact on \n     small businesses. The Advocate would seek input from small \n     business men and women on regulations that need to be \n     reviewed, would evaluate the suggestions from entrepreneurs \n     and direct agencies to take proper action for reviewing those \n     regulations. This amendment gives the only person in the \n     Administration who is exclusively responsible with \n     representing the special needs of small business the ability \n     to ensure that regulations affecting them are not overlooked \n     or ignored by agencies during the regulatory review process.\n       A vote is expected on the Abraham-Dole amendment after 5 \n     p.m., Monday, July 10. This amendment has the strongest \n     possible support from the National Federation of Independent \n     Business.

Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the 320,000 members of \n     the National Association for the Self-Employed, I am writing \n     to support your amendment to S. 343, the Comprehensive \n     Regulatory Reform Act of 1995.\n       Currently, S. 343 calls for sunsetting regulatins as they \n     become obsolete. The various regulatory agencies would judge \n     the regulations against the cost-benefit criteria outlined in \n     S. 343, seciton 624. The agencies would then place the \n     outdated regulations on a review schedule.\n\n[[Page S 9616]]\n\n       The Abraham/Dole amendment would grant authority to the \n     Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business \n     Administration to add regulations to the review list, thus \n     ensuring that all regulations affecting small business can be \n     reviewed in a timely manner.\n       We commend your efforts to give the Chief Counsel for \n     Advocacy this important authority. The Abraham/Dole amendment \n     would greatly benefit the small-business community.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Bennie L.

Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the Small Business \n     Legislative Council (SBLC), I would like to offer our support \n     for your amendment to the pending regulatory reform bill to \n     ensure regulations that have an impact on small business are \n     given a thorough review for ``cost-effectiveness'' after they \n     have been ``on the books'' for awhile. We commend you for the \n     initiative as it addresses just the kind of disadvantage at \n     which small business always finds itself in the regulatory \n     process.\n       As we understand it, the pending bill requires agencies to \n     review regulations for cost-effectiveness if the agency puts \n     them on a review schedule, or a private party petitions to \n     have them on the schedule. As you have correctly recognized, \n     the odds are that small businesses will not have the \n     wherewithal to either identify such regulations or petition \n     for their reconsideration. Giving the Chief Counsel for \n     Advocacy for Small Business the right to select the rules for \n     review seems to us to be a sensible, cost-effective \n     alternative to assure small business access to the process.\n       The Small Business Legislative Council (SBLC) is a \n     permanent, independent coalition of nearly one hundred trade \n     and professional associations that share a common commitment \n     to the future of small business. Our members represent the \n     interests of small businesses in such diverse economic \n     sectors as manufacturing, retailing, distribution, \n     professional and technical services, construction, \n     transportation, and agriculture. Our policies are developed \n     through a consensus among our membership. Individual \n     associations may express their own views.

Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the 215,000 business \n     members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 96 percent of whom \n     have fewer than 100 employees, I urge your strong and active \n     support for two amendments to be offered to S. 343, the \n     ``Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995.'' The Nunn/\n     Coverdell amendment ensures that small businesses benefit \n     from the broader protections of S. 343, and the Abraham/Dole \n     amendment guarantees a voice for small businesses in the \n     regulatory look-back process. To achieve meaningful reform \n     for that segment of our society hit hardest by regulatory \n     burdens--small businesses--these amendments are critical.\n       The Nunn/Coverdell amendment recognizes that there may be \n     many instances where a regulatory burden on small businesses \n     could be severe even though the $50 million threshold for a \n     complete regulatory review has not been triggered. By deeming \n     any rule that trips an analysis under the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act of 1980 a ``major rule,'' small entities will \n     receive the protection they need and deserve from the extreme \n     rigors they often experience from even the best-intentioned \n     regulations.\n       To address the problems associated with the mountain of \n     existing regulations and their impact on small entities, the \n     Abraham/Dole amendment will boost the power of small \n     businesses to benefit more effectively from the sunset \n     provisions of Section 623 of S. 343. Small companies often \n     need all of their people-power and resources simply to keep \n     afloat. They do not always have the ability to petition \n     federal agencies for review of particularly onerous existing \n     regulations. By vesting within the Small Business \n     Administration responsibility for ensuring that regulations \n     that are particularly problematic for small businesses are \n     not excluded from the regulatory sunset review process, small \n     businesses can be assured that their proportional needs are \n     always considered.\n       The Chamber hears regularly from its small business members \n     that federal regulations are doing them in. Support for these \n     two amendments will validate that their cries have been heard \n     and acted upon. I strongly urge your support for both the \n     Nunn/Coverdell amendment and the Abraham/Dole amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n[[Page S 9617]]\n\n                                                  National Roofing\n\n\n                                      Contractors Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 7, 1995.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: The National Roofing Contractors \n     Association (NRCA) strongly supports the ``periodic review \n     and sunsetting of regulations'' amendment that you and \n     Majority Leader Dole will offer to Section 623 of the \n     Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, S. 343.\n       As we understand it, the intent of Section 623 is to ensure \n     that regulations are sunsetted as they become obsolete. \n     However, a regulation would not be subject to review and \n     sunsetting unless the agency that administers the regulation \n     schedules it for review. This would allow agencies a \n     disproportionate amount of discretionary power to pick and \n     choose regulations for sunsetting.\n       The Abraham-Dole amendment would curb the potential for \n     agency bias by enabling the SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy \n     to add regulations which have a significant impact on small \n     business to an agency's review schedule. This would be done \n     with input from the small business community.\n       Earlier this year, NRCA testified in support of the \n     Regulatory Sunset and Review Act of 1995, H.R. 994. A copy of \n     our written statement, which discusses specific regulations, \n     is enclosed. Please note that attached to the statement is \n     the Wall Street Journal article, ``So You Want To Get Your \n     Roof Fixed . . .''\n       NRCA is an association of roofing, roof deck and \n     waterproofing contractors. Founded in 1886, it is one of the \n     oldest associations in the construction industry and has over \n     3,500 members represented in all 50 states. NRCA contractors \n     are small, privately held companies, and our average member \n     employs 35 people with annual sales of $3 million.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Craig S. Brightup,\n                                 Director of Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I rise in strong support of the Dole-Abraham amendment and \ncompliment my colleague from Michigan for his work in preparing this \namendment. Obviously, it is going to be very popular. It is going to \nmake a necessary improvement in the bill, which in its current form is \na very good bill. But because small business is such an important part \nof our Nation's economy and because regulations can have a particularly \npernicious effect on small businesses, because small businesses are not \nas well equipped as large companies are to hire the lawyers and the \nconsultants and the other people necessary to deal with the red tape of \nFederal regulations, I think it is especially important that small \nbusinesses not be unduly negatively impacted by regulation, and \ntherefore this amendment will certainly assist in this regard.\n  Small businesses are really the engine that drives our economy. In \nfact, from 1988 to 1990, small businesses with fewer than 20 employees \ncreated over 4 million new jobs in this country, and that was at the \nsame time, Mr. President, that companies with more than 500 employees \nlost over 500,000 net jobs during that same period.\n  As I said, small businesses bear a disproportionate share of the \nburden of regulation. According to the Small Business Administration, \nsmall businesses' share of the burden of regulations is three times \nthat of larger businesses.\n  Under the current language of section 623, a regulation would not be \nsubject to review unless the agency chooses to place it on the review \nschedule or an interested party successfully petitions to have it added \nto the review schedule.\n  Since small businesses, as I noted, frequently do not have the same \nkind of resources to hire the lawyers and the consultants necessary to \nprepare a petition that would meet the demanding standards set forth in \nsection 623, the bill's current language would allow agencies to refuse \nto review regulations that have a significant impact on small business. \nAnd that is where this amendment comes in. It is very important that \nagencies include in their review schedules any regulation designated \nfor review by the chief counsel for advocacy of the Small Business \nAdministration and OIRA. And that is the important point of this \namendment.\n  In selecting regulations to designate for review, the advocate could \nseek input from small businesses and would consider criteria such as \nthe extent to which the regulation imposes onerous burdens on small \nbusinesses or directly or indirectly causes them not to hire additional \nemployees.\n  The amendment thus would create a small business counterpart to the \npetition process which is available to larger firms, with the advocate \nrepresenting the interests of small businesses, just as the high-priced \nlawyers and consultants will represent, presumably, the interests of \nthose larger businesses in that petition process.\n  And, of course, it has been noted why the advocate of the Small \nBusiness Administration is ideally suited to this task, because, \naccording to the statute, and I am quoting now, its mission is to \n``enhance small business competitiveness in the American economy.'' And \nthe advocate ``measure[s] the direct costs and other effects of \nGovernment regulation on small businesses and make[s] legislative and \nnonlegislative proposals for eliminating excessive or unnecessary \nregulations of small business.''\n  As a matter of fact, the advocate also administers the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act which has afforded it additional experience in \nassessing the impact of regulations on small business.\n  So this amendment, Mr. President, would actually merely build on a \nfoundation laid by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Under that act, the \nadvocate reviews agency analyses of the likely impact of the proposed \nand final rules on small businesses. So under the Abraham-Dole \namendment the advocate's role in reviewing regulations would be very \nsimilar to its role in promulgating regulations.\n  Let me conclude with a couple points about concerns with this general \napproach, although, as I said, I think particularly with the amendment \nto the amendment that Senator Roth spoke about a moment ago this should \nbe a very popular amendment.\n  There was some question that it might be appropriate for there to be \na limit on the number of regulations that the advocate could designate \nfor review, but we think that under this process clearly agencies that \nchoose to review regulations that hurt small business likely will not \nhave many regulations added to their review schedule by the advocate. \nThose, of course, that ignore the concerns of small business could \nexpect to have their review schedule expanded by the advocate, but that \nis part of the incentive which we are building into this amendment.\n  And second, there was a concern that really we ought to only be \nconsidering major rules; otherwise, we could clog the courts and clog \nthe agency with an unnecessary workload.\n  It is true, of course, that the cost-benefit and risk-assessment \nrequirements generally apply only to the promulgation of major rules, \nbut many of the rules that hurt small business the most would not meet \nthe cost threshold for major rules, and this is particularly true if \nthe major rule threshold were to be raised from its current $50 million \nlimit.\n  For example, the NFIB estimates that OSHA's widely criticized fall-\nsafety rule would impose costs of $40 million annually, $10 million \nshort of the $50 million major rule threshold. This rule would require \nemployees, by the way, to wear an expensive harness with a lifeline \nattached to the roof any time that a worker works 6 feet or higher \nabove the ground.\n  The negative impact of this rule on small businesses was the subject \nof an op-ed in the June 13, 1995, issue of USA Today. It is a good \nillustration of how even with a rule like this, which achieved a great \ndeal of attention and would impose a significant cost on small \ncontractors, it nonetheless would fail to meet that threshold \nrequirement, and that is one of reasons why the kind of review called \nfor in the Abraham-Dole amendment is not only appropriate but is really \nquite necessary.\n  So, Mr. President, I am sure that most of our colleagues will be in \nstrong support of the Abraham-Dole amendment, and I certainly urge its \nadoption and would also indicate my strong support for the underlying \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I also would like to rise today as a \ncosponsor of the small business protection amendment to the Regulatory \nReform Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should be advised that under a \n\n[[Page S 9618]]\n  previous order, we are to turn to the amendment of the Senator from \nGeorgia at 3 o'clock.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate for about 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, again, I want to say I rise as a strong \ncosponsor of the small business protection amendment to the Regulatory \nReform Act, and as a strong proponent of holding Government accountable \nto the taxpayers, I believe this amendment would make a good bill even \nbetter.\n  I also compliment the Senator from Michigan for all the work he has \ndone in this area.\n  The negotiations that many of us have undertaken on the Regulatory \nReform Act have been long and often painful, especially as we witnessed \nthe watering down of rational provisions. The sunset provision has been \none of those casualties.\n  But the small business protection amendment would strengthen the \nprovision in the bill which cancels or sunsets regulations as they \nbecome obsolete.\n  Excessive Federal regulations and redtape impose an enormous burden \non this Nation. Regulations act as hidden taxes which push up prices on \ngoods and services for American households, dampen business investment \nand, ultimately, kill jobs.\n  What concerns me most, however, is that a large portion of Federal \nregulations do not have strong scientific merit to back up their \nenforcement. I am also concerned that we are currently prohibited from \neven conducting cost-benefit analyses on some of the extensive \nregulatory measures in this country. How can this Congress make well-\ninformed decisions if we cannot even consider these types of options?\n  More than 2 years ago, as a new Member of Congress, the first sunset \namendment I offered was to H.R. 820, and that was the National \nCompetitiveness Act. I mention this because my goal was not to hinder \nour ability to compete in the international marketplace. On the \ncontrary, with overregulation strangling our competitiveness abroad, my \ngoal was simply to provide a framework for ensuring oversight and \naccountability and to get agencies to start setting standards to \njustify the funding that they now receive.\n  After this first sunset amendment, I offered several more to various \nHouse appropriations bills, and almost a dozen were passed into law \nwith wide bipartisan support.\n  Let me remind you, Mr. President, that the concept of sunsetting \nregulations is not new. In fact, President Clinton's Chief of Staff, \nLeon Panetta, offered sunset legislation when he served in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives.\n  So now we have the opportunity with a single piece of legislation to \nsunset regulations that have outlived their usefulness.\n  As the 1995 Regulatory Reform Act is currently written, regulations \nwould be listed on review schedules published by the agencies. However, \na regulation would not be subject to review unless the agency chooses \nto place it on the review schedule. If the agency does not place a \nparticular regulation on the review schedule, an individual or a small \nbusiness may petition that agency to do so. But this is not as easy as \nit sounds. The individual or small business must meet unreasonably high \nstandards--standards so stringent that the average person would have to \nhire expensive lawyers and consultants just to figure out how to meet \nthat criteria.\n  What the small business protection amendment would do is to require \nagencies to include on their review schedules any regulation designated \nfor review by the chief counsel for advocacy of the Small Business \nAdministration in concurrence with the OMB's Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs. This represents an important step toward \nalleviating the burden of outdated regulations and also ensuring the \nfuture health of our economy.\n  Big businesses already have a loud voice in the regulatory process \nbecause they have access to resources often out of the reach of small \nbusinesses. But small businesses create millions of new jobs every \nyear, and this amendment would allow their voices to be heard as well.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that there is not a single Member of this \nbody who has not been contacted by a constituent from their home State \nbecause of some absurd and outmoded regulation. And yet some of my \ncolleagues will argue that strengthening the sunset measure in the \nRegulatory Reform Act would place an undue burden on the regulatory \nagencies, who would have to spend a lot more time reviewing and a lot \nless time regulating. I argue that is what regulators ought to do--that \nis, review and then retire regulations that are no longer needed and \nthen to fix those that are not working.\n  The fact is that strengthening the sunset provision of the Regulatory \nReform Act will have absolutely no impact on regulations which serve a \nuseful and realistic purpose. It will not make our air dirty or our \nwater unclean. It will not pollute our environment or jeopardize our \nhealth or our safety.\n  What this amendment will do is to enhance the accountability and \noversight that regulators have to the taxpayers of this country--the \npeople who must foot the bill for every rule and requirement imposed by \nthe myriad of regulatory agencies.\n  Establishing a fair procedure by which regulations can be reviewed \nperiodically to ensure and to maintain their effectiveness is just \nplain common sense. That is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \nAbraham-Dole small business protection amendment, and that is also why \nI urge my colleagues to give it their support today as well.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak briefly \nwith respect to the Abraham-Dole amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks. \nThere does not appear to be anyone else at this point who wants to \nspeak to the amendment.\n  I want to thank my colleague, the Senator from Minnesota, for his \nsupport on these matters pertaining to sunsetting regulations, as he \nalready indicated, before this Congress took office, and I am sure he \nwill continue his support in the process of putting together this \namendment. His broad support for sunsetting regulations has been an \nimportant ingredient in our efforts to bring this particular amendment \nto the floor. I want to thank him for his remarks today.\n  As I said earlier, Mr. President, when I offered the amendment, I \nthink that the bill we have before us has a system in place which will \nprovide big businesses with a vehicle, a mechanism by which they can \nbring regulations up for review, because they will be in a position \nfinancially to afford the kind of technical cost-benefit studies and \nother types of inquiry necessary to present a petition that can be \nsuccessful as it is considered.\n  Unfortunately, small businesses do not always enjoy that opportunity. \nIt is also the case that regulations which cost $30 or $40 million that \ndo not quite make it to the level which we consider major rules in this \nlegislation, at the $30 or $40 million pricetag are very costly rules, \nvery major rules from the standpoint of a small mom-and-pop business \nthat is out there in America trying to survive.\n  So I think this amendment, as I said at the outset, strikes the \nproper balance between the need to place some constraints on how many \nregulations come up for review, on the one hand, and the legitimate \nneeds of small businesses on the other to have their day in court.\n  My parents owned a small business for quite a long time. I know what \nthey encountered as small business people, truly a mom-and-pop \noperation, in attempting to just sort out the demands that we in \nWashington placed on their business. Others come to my office all the \ntime with similar expressions of concern. I believe this amendment \ngives the small business community a mechanism by which regulations \nthat are costly to small businesses can be brought up for review, even \nif they are not initially placed on the list of rules to be reviewed by \nagencies, and be brought up for review without necessitating on the \npart of small businesses \n\n[[Page S 9619]]\nwho often will not be able to afford the expensive process that the \npetition system provides.\n  I think it will be an effective addition to this bill and I hope an \neffective way by which small businesses across this country continue to \nhave their voice heard as they deal with Federal regulation in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I know we have run over our time for this \nparticular amendment, but I believe there is a small meeting still \ngoing on. I ask my distinguished colleague from Michigan if he had \nconsidered having the reporting authority for small business concerns \nbe the Administrator of the Small Business Administration?\n  It is a little unusual to go down somewhere in the organizational \nchart of any agency or department and give a particular person the \nauthority, no matter what their title or what their normal \nresponsibilities are, to bypass all other rules, regulations, and \nadministrative procedures for that particular department, to bypass the \nadministrator of their department, even though the administrator might \nnot agree with what he is going to propose, and bypass within the \ndepths of an agency the administrator and go directly to OIRA.\n  Would it not make more sense if we really did this through the \nadministrator as the first step on this process? Otherwise, you could \ncome up with a situation where you have an administrator who really \ndoes not agree, and maybe for some very good reasons, as to the actions \nthat will be taken by the counsel for advocacy. I ask, was that \nconsidered? If that was turned down, what were the reasons for not \ngoing that route of having the administrator represent his agency?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. The concern the Senator from Ohio expressed was one that \nwe took into account in the process of putting together the amendment \noriginally. What we tried to balance was the responsibilities of the \ndifferent officials in the Small Business Administration.\n  The reason that we felt this particular office was the appropriate \nplace to vest this authority was because of two things. No. 1, the \nresponsibilities of this office are expressly those of advocating the \nconcerns of small businesses. With all due respect to the head of any \nagency, as far as their set of responsibilities goes, whether it is the \nhead of the SBA or any of the other agencies of our Government, they \nhave other considerations they must take into account, whether it is \npolitical considerations or considerations that have to do with budget \nneeds or managerial duties. But this office was set up, as we \ninterpreted it, in an exclusive sense to try to really be the advocate \nof the small business community of America. It is the one place in \nGovernment where that power has been authorized by Congress.\n  We felt, as a consequence, that there would be fewer countervailing \ntypes of considerations brought before the advocate than at the other \noffices of SBA. We thought, as a consequence, the advocate could \nperform their jobs freed of, and somewhat liberated of, some of the \nother countervailing responsibilities that an administrator or other \nagents of the SBA might have. That is how we reached this judgment.\n  I think it certainly would be my expectation that the advocate would \nconsult with and discuss with the agency and with the SBA Administrator \ndecisions regarding regulations put on the rule. We thought this office \nwas the place where the least argument could be made, where political \npressures, special interest group pressures, and so on, were not \njustifying actions, and that in fact this had a certain amount of \nindependence and a specific amount of authority, as well as what I said \nearlier, some of the tools it will take to make these decisions, \nbecause it is part of the current responsibility of the office to \nexamine regulations for reasons of promulgation. So it makes sense that \nthis might be the place.\n  Mr. GLENN. I say to my colleague that I would certainly hope that in \nevery case--as he said, the normal procedure would be that there would \nbe consultation with the administrator.\n  Would it be acceptable to the Senator from Michigan to make it \nconsultation and approval of the administrator before this matter was \nbrought to OIRA?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. At this point, I would not be in a position to make that \nchange, I say to the Senator from Ohio. Because my mind is not fully \nclosed on this, there are a number of people who participated in \nputting together this amendment initially, and I need to consult as to \ntheir feelings on this departure. I know a number of them earlier \nexpressed the view that once we added the OIRA Administrator to the \nprocess in determining which regulations would be placed on the various \nagencies' lists, that we had satisfied any residual concerns which \nmight exist as to having a person with a direct appointment and \nresponsibility in the loop. I would need to go back and determine, I \nthink, from some of the other people who are part of this, their \nreceptive feeling to any change of that type.\n  Mr. GLENN. I would think we would get much more broad support if it \nhad that arrangement in it. If this is such an unusual procedure, to \nsay we go down within an agency and say we give that person \nresponsibility for taking the basic function of that agency and making \na review necessary by OIRA, or whatever else it might be--in this case \nOIRA--without the approval of the agency head--now, there are only two \nother places in Government that I am aware of where we do that. One is \nwith the inspectors general, and we provide them considerable leeway. \nIn fact, we require the inspectors general not only to report to their \nagency heads, we require them to give us those same individual reports \nbecause we feel if the IG's are so important in the work they do, that \nwe give them specific authority to report outside the chain of command \nto the appropriate committees of Congress, in addition to reporting to \ntheir agency head--not to bypass completely, but in addition to \nreporting to the agency head.\n  The other place we do that is in the Chief Financial Officers Act, \nwhere the chief financial officers are required, by law, to report not \nonly to their agency head but also to the appropriate committees of \nCongress.\n  Now, those are the only cases I know of where we authorize people, or \nrequire people, that if they want to take action, they are authorized \nto go outside the purview and outside the views of, and maybe the \nwishes of, their agency head, and do something that the agency head \nmight not agree with.\n  So I think there is that problem. I would feel more comfortable, I \nguess, if we had the agency head required to be consulted. And if the \nreport was still to go on to OIRA and the agency head objected, that \nreasons why the decision was made to go to OIRA over the objection of \nthe agency head were made part of that report to OIRA, I do not know \nwhether that was considered or not. But it seems that that would be a \nmore normal procedure for what we want to do.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I do not want to express the suggestion that we have \nspent a huge amount of time considering the specific role of the head \nof SBA. But let me go back to the point as to why the chief counsel for \nadvocacy was initially identified. That is, because in the reg flex \nlanguage that is currently on the statutes, it states specifically in \n602(b) that ``each regulatory flexibility agenda shall be transmitted \nto the chief counsel for advocacy of the Small Business Administration \nfor comment, if any.''\n  In other words, because that was the way the statutes currently kind \nof vested authority for reg flex, we thought it was a sensible way to \ndeal with it and was built more or less on that language. I think that \nwas more the guiding notion that we used than any other particular \nconsideration.\n  Mr. GLENN. Well, I say to my friend from Michigan that this is an \nenormously important position in that--I believe I state this \ncorrectly--all the rules and regulations being promulgated throughout \nGovernment are required to be submitted to SBA and be reviewed by SBA \nunder reg flex, the Regulatory Flexibility Act. So everything that is \ngoing to occur in Government in the regulatory field is submitted to \nSBA specifically now, whether it is intended to cover big corporations, \nsmall or private businesses, individuals, or whatever. They, in effect, \nget a crack at them to make their comment. \n\n[[Page S 9620]]\n\n  This office of advocacy is the organization within SBA that looks at \nthose. And so the recommendations that would be made to OIRA are \npotentially enormous in scope. All the rules and regulations \npromulgated by Government would have to go through that chain and could \nbe kicked up to OIRA for whatever consideration they wanted to make. To \ntake that out from under them--at least the oversight or the \ncoordinated action of the administrator of SBA--is a mighty big step to \nmake, and a mighty big important responsibility to give to that one \nperson, whoever he or she might be in that office of advocacy.\n  So I think it would be better if it went in the other direction. We \nare still checking with some of the people interested in this on our \nside. We are way over on our time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Nickles be added as \nan original cosponsor of the Abraham amendment No. 1490.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHatch, the Senator from Utah, be added as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President,\n   I strongly support the Abraham-Dole amendment, which would require \nagencies to include in their schedule to review existing rules, \npursuant to section 623 of S. 343, any existing regulation that \nsubstantially affects small business as selected by the chief counsel \nfor advocacy of the Small Business Administration.\n\n  Under section 623 as currently drafted, a regulation would not be \nsubject to review unless an agency chooses to place an existing rule on \nthe review schedule or an interested party is successful in having a \npetition to place a rule on the schedule for review.\n  Unfortunately, the petition process is costly and thus particularly \nburdensome to small businesses. Most small businesses do not have the \nresources to hire the attorneys, consultants, economists, or \nenvironmental experts, that may be necessary to prepare a petition that \nmeets the exacting standards in section 624 necessary for granting a \npetition to review rules that are burdensome to small business.\n  This amendment will allow the chief counsel for advocacy of the SBA \nwith the concurrence of head of OIRA to select rules to be put on the \nagency review schedule as a substitute for the petition process \navailable to larger businesses with greater capital assets. It assures \nthat the one official in the Administration exclusively responsible \nwith representing the needs of small business will have authority to \nensure that regulations burdensome to small business will be reviewed. \nIn essence, the advocate will act as an ombudsman for small business.\n  The advocate, however, does not have unrestrained discretion to place \nexisting rules on section 623's mandated review schedule. The advocate \nmust seek the input from small business as to what burdensome rules to \nreview and the amendment establishes criteria, such as whether the \nexisting rule causes small business not to hire additional employees, \nto guide the advocate in selecting rules for review. I do not believe \nthat the review schedule system will be overwhelmed by the addition of \nrules that burden small business. Under the Abraham-Dole amendment the \nadvocate will cooperate with the responsible agency and OMB to assure \nthe efficacy of the agency review process.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                amendment no. 1491 to amendment no. 1487\n\n  (Purpose: To provide small businesses improved regulatory relief by \n   requiring that a proposed regulation determined to be subject to \n chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the \n Regulatory Flexibility Act) will be deemed to be a major rule for the \npurposes of being subject to agency cost-benefit analysis and periodic \n  review; requiring factual support of an agency determination that a \n   proposed regulation is not subject to such chapter; providing for \n    prompt judicial review of an agency certification regarding the \n nonapplicability of such chapter; and clarifying other provisions of \n                   the bill relating to such chapter)\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I apologize to my colleagues for my voice. \nObviously, I am losing it, but I will do the best I can this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for himself and Mr. \n     Coverdell, proposes an amendment numbered 1491 to amendment \n     No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. NUNN Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent further reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 14, line 10, strike out ``or''.\n       On page 14, line 16, add ``or'' after the semicolon.\n       On page 14, insert between lines 16 and 17 the following \n     new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) any rule or set of closely related rules, not \n     determined to be a major rule pursuant to subparagraph (A) or \n     (B), that the agency proposing the rule determines will have \n     a significant economic impact on a substantial number of \n     small businesses, pursuant to subchapter I;\n       On page 39, line 22, strike out ``and''.\n       On page 39, line 24, strike out the period and insert in \n     lieu thereof a semicolon and ``and''.\n       On page 39, add after line 24 the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(C) an agency certification that a rule will not have a \n     significant economic impact on a substantial number of small \n     entities pursuant to section 605(b).\n       On page 40, line 5, insert ``and section 611'' after \n     ``subsection''.\n       On page 68, strike out all beginning with line 9 through \n     line 11 and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(A) include in the final regulatory flexibility analysis \n     a determination, with the accompanying factual findings \n     supporting such determination, of why the criteria in \n     paragraph (2) were not satisfied; and\n       On page 72, insert between lines 14 and 15 the following \n     new subsection:\n       (e) Amendments to the Regulatory Flexibility Act.--\n       (1) Improving agency certifications regarding \n     nonapplicability of the regulatory flexibility act.--Section \n     605(b), of title 5, United States Code, is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(b) Sections 603 and 604 of this title shall not apply to \n     any rule if the head of the agency certifies that the rule \n     will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact \n     on a substantial number of small entities. If the head of the \n     agency makes a certification under the preceding sentence, \n     the agency shall publish such certification, along with a \n     succinct statement providing the factual reasons for such \n     certification, in the Federal Register along with the general \n     notice of proposed rulemaking for the rule. The agency shall \n     provide such certification and statement to the Chief Counsel \n     for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration.''.\n       (2) Technical and clarifying amendments.--Section 612 of \n     title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n       (A) in subsection (a) by striking ``the Committees on the \n     Judiciary of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the \n     Select Committee on Small Business of the Senate, and the \n     Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives'' \n     and inserting ``the Committees on the Judiciary and Small \n     Business of the Senate and House of Representatives''; and\n       (B) in subsection (b) by striking ``his views with respect \n     to the effect of the rule on small entities'' and inserting \n     ``views on the rule and its effects on small entities''.\n       On page 72, line 15, strike out ``(e)'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``(f)''.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this amendment assures that the Nation's \n\n[[Page S 9621]]\n  small business community will derive full benefit from the fundamental \nchanges to the regulatory process proposed in S. 343.\n  The amendment accomplishes this goal by establishing a direct \nstatutory link between the existing requirement to the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act of 1980 [RFA] and the requirements of S. 343.\n  Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, whenever a Federal agency \nproposes a rule that is expected to have a significant impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities, the agency is required to conduct \na regulatory flexibility analysis, with opportunities for public \nparticipation, to minimize the expected burden.\n  The Nunn-Coverdell amendment would, No. 1, require that a proposed \nrule, determined to be subject to the RFA, be considered to be a major \nrule for the purpose of cost-benefit analysis and periodic review. But \nwe exclude the comprehensive risk assessment required under S. 343.\n  No. 2, the amendment would require agencies to provide factual \nsupport for any determination that a proposed regulation would not have \na significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses and is \nexempt from the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n  No. 3, the amendment provides for prompt judicial review of an agency \ncertification that the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to a \nproposed rule.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment.\n  This amendment enjoys strong support within the small business \ncommunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of letters from some of those who \nare supporting this amendment in the small business community be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n\n       Support the Bipartisan Nunn-Coverdell Amendment to S. 343\n\n       S. 343, the Dole/Johnston substitute, currently defines \n     ``major rules'' as regulations that have more than a $50 \n     million dollar impact. Those major rules are then subject to \n     cost benefit analysis, risk assessment and periodic review.\n       Unfortunately, some regulations that have a significant \n     impact on small businesses and other small entities may not \n     meet the $50 million threshold. A regulatory cost that may be \n     almost insignificant to a Fortune 500 company could have a \n     devastating effect on a particular segment of the small \n     business community. Or, the agency's estimate that the impact \n     is less than $50 million may be significantly undervalued.\n       A good example of an expensive regulation that falls under \n     the threshold is OSHA's so-called ``fall protection'' rule \n     requiring roofers to wear harnesses with lifelines that are \n     tied to the roof any time they are at least six feet above \n     the ground. Not only will the total cost to small roofing \n     companies be much more than $50 million, many believe the \n     rule may create a greater danger for workers who will have to \n     worry about tripping over each other's safety riggings.\n       The Nunn-Coverdell amendment, which is scheduled to be \n     voted on after 5 p.m. on Monday, July 10, solves this problem \n     by requiring all regulations that are currently subject to \n     the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Reg-Flex) of 1980 to be \n     subject to cost-benefit analysis and periodic review--but not \n     risk assessment.\n       Which regulations currently fall under Reg-Flex? Reg-Flex \n     requires the regulatory burden be minimized on those \n     regulations which have a ``significant impact on a \n     substantial number of small entities.'' Last year, 127 \n     regulations contained a Reg-Flex analysis. Small entities, \n     which often bear a disproportionate share of the regulatory \n     burden, include small businesses, small local governments \n     (like towns and townships) and small non-profit \n     organizations.\n       The Nunn-Coverdell amendment also allows prompt judicial \n     review of an agency's non-compliance with the Reg-Flex Act. \n     If an agency incorrectly states that a regulation does not \n     have a significant impact on small business--and it does--a \n     judge will have the authority to put the regulation on hold \n     until the Federal agency re-evaluates the regulation and \n     reduces the burden on small business as much as possible.\n       Agencies would also be required to provide factual support \n     to back up their decisions to ignore Reg-Flex.\n       The bipartisan Nunn-Coverdell amendment is a major priority \n     for small business and has NFIB's strong support. Regulatory \n     flexibility was recently voted the third most important issue \n     at the White House Conference on Small Business.

The Nunn/Coverdell amendment \n     ensures that small businesses benefit from the broader \n     protections of S. 343, and the Abraham/Dole amendment \n     guarantees a voice for small businesses in the regulatory \n     look-back process. To achieve meaningful reform for that \n     segment of our society hit hardest by regulatory burdens--\n     small businesses--these amendments are critical.\n       The Nunn/Coverdell amendment recognizes that there may be \n     many instances where a regulatory burden on small businesses \n     could be severe even though the $50 million threshold for a \n     complete regulatory review has not been triggered. By deeming \n     any rule that trips an analysis under the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act of 1980 a ``major rule,'' small entities will \n     receive the protection they need and deserve from the extreme \n     rigors they often experience from even the best-intentioned \n     regulations.\n       To address the problems associated with the mountain of \n     existing regulations and their impact on small entities, the \n     Abraham/Dole amendment will boost the power of small \n     businesses to benefit more effectively from the sunset \n     provisions of Section 623 of S. 343. Small companies often \n     need all of their people-power and resources simply to keep \n     afloat. They do not always have the ability to petition \n     federal agencies for review of particularly onerous existing \n     regulations. By vesting within the Small Business \n     Administration responsibility for ensuring that regulations \n     that are particularly problematic for small businesses are \n     not excluded from the regulatory sunset review process, small \n     businesses can be assured that their proportional needs are \n     always considered.\n       The Chamber hears regularly from its small business members \n     that federal regulations are doing them in. Support for these \n     two amendments will validate that their cries have been heard \n     and acted upon. I strongly urge your support for both the \n     Nunn/Coverdell amendment and the Abraham/Dole amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                           Small Business Legislative Council,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 1995.\n     Hon.

Paul Coverdell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the Small Business Legislative \n     Council (SBLC), I wish to offer our support for your \n     amendment to ensure that proposed regulations, with the \n     potential to have a significant impact on small businesses, \n     are subject to a comprehensive cost benefit analysis. It \n     makes sense to us to have as much data available as possible \n     to assess the full impact proposed regulations will have on \n     small business.\n       As you know, the delegates to the recent White House \n     Conference on Small Business included several references to \n     the regulatory process among their top recommendations. \n     Clearly, the cumulative burdens of the current regulatory \n     regime weighed heavily on their minds. We need to make \n     certain that we do not add to that regulatory burden \n     unnecessarily.\n       Along with the language in the Dole/Johnston version of S. \n     343 which allows for judicial review of agencies' compliance \n     with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, your amendment will \n     ensure we have a meaningful way to truly assess the impact of \n     regulations upon small business and to ensure we do something \n     to mitigate the impact.\n       The Small Business Legislative Council (SBLC) is a \n     permanent, independent coalition of nearly one hundred trade \n     and professional associations that share a common commitment \n     to the future of small business. Our members represent the \n     interests of small businesses in such diverse economic \n     sectors as manufacturing, retailing, distribution, \n     professional and technical services, construction, \n     transportation, and agriculture. Our policies are developed \n     through a consensus among our membership. Individual \n     associations may express their own views.

Sam Nunn,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: The National Roofing Contractors \n     Association (NRCA) supports the amendment that you will offer \n     with Senator Coverdell to remove the $50 million ``major \n     rules'' floor for small business in the Comprehensive \n     Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 (S. 343), in order to apply \n     cost-benefit and periodic review to all regulations impacting \n     small business.\n       Federal agencies are poor at accurately estimating the cost \n     of their regulations. OSHA estimated $40 million annually for \n     its new Fall Protection Standard (Subpart M) and said that it \n     would not have a significant impact on small business. NRCA \n     estimates its impact to be at least $250 million annually, \n     and it has already wreaked havoc on the industry.\n       Another example is OSHA's 1994 standard for asbestos \n     containing roofing material (ACRM). OSHA estimated the annual \n     costs to the roofing industry to be approximately $1 million \n     annually, while NRCA estimated approximately $1.3 billion! \n     OSHA's cost figures only took into consideration Built-up \n     Roofing (BUR) removal, and it had failed to cover the vast \n     majority of roof removal and repair jobs. NRCA estimated that \n     removals of asbestos-containing BUR constituted less than 12 \n     percent of all roof removal jobs.\n       Your amendment would end the tendency for agencies to \n     underestimate costs by making all regulations now subject to \n     the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Reg Flex), subject to \n     S. 343's cost-benefit analysis and periodic review \n     requirements. And we appreciate your language giving judges \n     the authority to immediately stay regulations if necessary.\n       NRCA is an association of roofing, roof deck, and \n     waterproofing contractors. Founded in 1886, it is one of the \n     oldest associations in the construction industry and has over \n     3,500 members represented in all 50 states. NRCA contractors \n     are small, privately held companies, and our average member \n     employs 35 people with annual sales of $3 million.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Craig S. Brightup,\n     Director of Government Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                          Towns and Townships,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 7, 1995.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: The National Association of Towns and \n     Townships (NATaT) strongly supports the Nunn-Coverdell \n     amendment to S. 343 that would require all regulations \n     currently subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 \n     (RFA) to be subject to cost-benefit analysis and periodic \n     review.\n       NATaT represents approximately 13,000 of the nation's \n     39,000 general purpose units of local governments. Most of \n     our member local governments are small and rural and have \n     fewer than 10,000 residents. Many of these small communities \n     have very limited resources available to provide those \n     services required of them such as fire and police protection, \n     road maintenance, relief for the poor and economic \n     development. Consequently, many regulations that have less \n     than a $50 million threshold have a very significant impact \n     on small towns and townships.\n       A good example is the commercial drivers license (CDL) \n     requirement for public sector employees required by the Motor \n     Vehicle Safety Act of 1986. While that law may not have \n     seemed to have a significant impact, it had a significant \n     impact on small townships that had to pay for the training \n     and testing of drivers to obtain a CDL, especially those \n     townships which use part-time drivers for snow removal or for \n     emergency response to floods or tornados. Recently, drug and \n     alcohol testing requirements were mandated for those who hold \n     CDL's, adding to the cumulative impact.\n       Your amendment will also allow prompt judicial review of an \n     agency's non-compliance with the RFA if an agency states \n     incorrectly that a regulation will not have a significant \n     impact on small entities. This has been a continual problem \n     Agencies have often claimed no significant economic impact on \n     small entities in their regulatory flexibility analysis while \n     giving no justification for their reasoning, though we have \n     believed quite the opposite.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, such a display of strong support for the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act has a very long history within the small \nbusiness community, going back to the late 1970's. The Regulatory \nFlexibility Act of 1980 has been looked upon as the small business \ncommunity's first line of defense with regard to the burdens of Federal \nregulations. Recognizing that the effective functioning of government \ncertainly requires regulations, the Regulatory Flexibility Act was \ndesigned to compel agencies to analyze their proposed regulations, with \nopportunities for public participation, so that the final regulation \nimposes the least burden on small businesses.\n  Mr. President, given my focus today on the needs of the small \nbusiness community, my remarks may suggest to my colleagues that the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act offers protections only to small business. \nIn fact, the act's protections are available to a fairly broad range of \nsmall entities in addition to small businesses, including small units \nof local government, educational institutions, and other not-for-profit \norganizations. My friend from Ohio, Mr. Glenn, was especially vigilant \nregarding the application of the Regulatory Flexibility Act to small \nunits of local government during his tenure as chairman of the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Enactment of the legislation that became the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct was a key recommendation of the 1980 \n\n[[Page S 9623]]\nWhite House Conference on Small Business. Last month, small business \npersons from across the Nation came together for the 1995 White House \nConference on Small Business.\n  It comes as no surprise that issues relating to regulatory relief \nwere key topics of discussion among the delegates at the 1995 \nconference. They made clear their strong concerns regarding the current \nFederal regulatory process, from the way agencies design new \nregulations to how the agencies implement the regulations under their \ncharge.\n  Many of the key features of S.343, and other legislative proposals to \nprovide greater discipline to the regulatory process, were endorsed in \nthe recommendations voted upon by the White House Conference delegates. \nIn particular, the White House Conference's recommendations on \nregulatory reform called for assessing more proposed regulations \nagainst rigorous cost-benefit standards. Similarly, the broader use of \nrisk assessment, based on sound scientific principles and compared to \nreal world risks, were included within a number of recommendations \nvoted the top 60 recommendations from the 1995 conference. Other \nconference recommendations called for the periodic review of existing \nregulations to establish their continuing need and to determine if they \ncould be modified, based upon experience, to make them less burdensome.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the delegates to the 1995 White House \nConference on Small Business adopted recommendations to strengthen the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act in many of the ways being done by the \nprovisions of S. 343, and by the Nunn-Coverdell amendment. Action today \nto strengthen the Regulatory Flexibility Act may well be the most \nprompt congressional response to a recommendation from any White House \nConference on Small Business.\n  Mr. President, in addition to establishing a statutory link between \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act and the requirements for cost-benefit \nanalysis under S. 343, my amendment takes other steps to enhance the \neffectiveness of the regulatory flexibility process. First, an agency \ncertification that a proposed regulation would not have a significant \nimpact on a substantial number of small businesses would have to be \nbacked up by facts. This is not the case today. Small business \nadvocates complain about their being deprived of the act's protections \nby such\n unwarranted certifications of nonapplicability.\n\n  Along the same lines, the Nunn-Coverdell amendment makes possible a \njudicial challenge of such unwarranted certifications early in the \nregulatory process. Abuse is prevented by requiring that the judicial \nchallenge be brought within 60 days of the certification and in the \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Supporters of \nour amendment within the small business community believe that this \nprovision and the enhanced judicial enforcement of the act already \ncontained in the bill will make the agencies take more seriously their \nresponsibilities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n  I know that during the debate on this provision concern will be \nexpressed that the amendment will substantially overburden the \nregulatory staff within the various departments and agencies. They may \ncite figures drawn from the semiannual regulatory agenda which suggest \nthat 500 or even 1,000 additional rules may be subject to cost-benefit \nanalysis under the Nunn-Coverdell amendment. I believe these figures \nare inflated and inaccurate for the reasons that will, no doubt, be \nsubsequently discussed.\n  In contrast, I am confident that the actual number is substantially \nsmaller, certainly less than 200. By the time you count those proposed \nregulations within a $50 million or $100 million threshold, a number \nwill be double counted: The number of proposed regulations covered is \nprobably somewhere around 150. Even that number may be inflated by \nproposed rules that are exempt under S. 343's definition of rule.\n  My estimate, Mr. President--and I recognize that it is an estimate \nthat is based upon 14 years of experience under the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act by the career staff of the Office of the Chief Counsel \nfor Advocacy at the Small Business Administration, the office charged \nwith monitoring agency compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. \nIt takes into consideration regulations for which regulatory \nflexibility analyses were done. It also takes into consideration those \nsituations in which the Office of Advocacy believed the Act applied and \nthe agency certified to the contrary.\n  While I agree that we cannot give the agencies an impossible set of \ntasks in reviewing proposed and existing regulations, we must not loose \nsight of the regulated public. I believe that they have a right to \ndemand that proposed regulations be thoroughly analyzed, and that they \nmeet rigorous standards of cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment when \nappropriate, and regulatory flexibility for small entities, Similarly, \nthe regulated public has a right to expect that existing regulations be \nreviewed for their continuing utility, and when possible, modified to \nreduce their burden.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NUNN. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I will not subject the Senator to a long \nseries of questions because I sympathize with the condition of his \nvoice.\n  Mr. President, we have had conversations, both Senators from Georgia \nand myself and my staff, Senator Roth, and others, concerning the \nproblem of agency overload. It seems to me that all sides in this \nendeavor want to arrive at the same place, and that is the maximum \nprotection for small business but a workable system for the agencies so \nthat the agencies will not be overloaded.\n  We had proposed to the Senator from Georgia an alternative, which is, \nin effect, to have the same kind of fix that Senator Abraham had in his \namendment, which is to give OIRA, in effect, a veto over these \nprocedures.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment that the \nSenators from Georgia and I have discussed be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the amendment was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       On page 14, line 10, strike out ``or''.\n       On page 14, line 16, add ``or'' after the semicolon.\n       On page 14, insert between lines 16 and 17 the following \n     new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) any rule or set of closely related rules, not \n     determined or designated to be a major rule pursuant to \n     subparagraph (A) or (B), that is designated as a major rule \n     pursuant to section 622(b)(2) (and a designation or failure \n     to designate under this subparagraph shall not be subject to \n     judicial review).''\n       On page 20, insert between lines 12 and 13 the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(2) If the agency has determined that the rule is not a \n     major rule within the meaning of section 621(5)(A) and has \n     not designated the rule as a major rule within the meaning of \n     section 621(5)(B), the Chief Counsel for Advocacy at the \n     Small Business Administration may publish in the Federal \n     Register a determination, and accompanying factual findings \n     supporting such determination, drawn from the initial \n     regulatory flexibility analysis, that the proposed rule \n     should be designated as a major rule because of its \n     substantial economic impact on a significant number of small \n     entities. Such determination shall be published not later \n     than 15 days after the publication of the notice of proposed \n     rulemaking. The Director or designee of the President shall \n     designate such rule as a major rule under paragraph (1) \n     unless the Director or designee of the President publishes in \n     the Federal Register, prior to the deadline in paragraph (1), \n     a finding regarding the recommendation of the Chief Counsel \n     for Advocacy that contains a succinct statement of the basis \n     for not making such a designation.''\n       On page 20, line 13, strike out ``(2)'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``(3)''.\n       On page 39, line 22, strike out ``and''.\n       On page 39, line 24, strike out the period and insert in \n     lieu thereof a semicolon and ``and''.\n       On page 39, add after line 24 the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(C) an agency certification that a rule will not have a \n     significant economic impact on a substantial number of small \n     entities pursuant to section 605(b)''.\n       On page 69, line 5, insert after ``entity'', ``, upon \n     publication of the final rule,''.\n       On page 69, line 7, strike ``A court'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``Notwithstanding section 625(e)(3), a court''.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I will not propose that amendment today, \nbut I simply ask the Senator, in fact both Senators from Georgia, if \nthey will continue to work with us with a view to dealing with this \nproblem of agency overload, hoping to find some alternative--if not the \none that I have sent to the desk for printing, then some other \nalternative, so that we may deal with that question of overload.\n\n[[Page S 9624]]\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Louisiana that the \nanswer is yes. I will certainly continue to discuss any modification of \nthis amendment that makes sense from the small business perspective, \nand also from the point of view of regulatory overload. This is a \ndifficult area. None of us knows precisely what the numbers of \nregulations that are going to be affected here. So we are dealing with \nan unknown. But I do think that when we are in doubt, we ought to tilt \ntoward not having a regulatory burden overwhelming the small business \ncommunity. That would be my perspective. But I will be glad to continue \nto try to work with him in this regard because I know he has the same \ngoal. We will continue to discuss it even as we debate it here on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his \nanswer.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I withhold.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first I want to thank my colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Nunn, for his dedication to this effort on behalf of \nsmall business. And we are all particularly sympathetic to the malady \nwith which he returned from the recess. We wish him well soon.\n  I also want to answer the question of the Senator from Louisiana. As \nwe continue through the process with Senator Dole and his bill, we \nwould obviously keep on the table discussions to try to facilitate his \nconcern. We did not have enough time to talk a little earlier. But \nwhile we remain concerned about agency overload, I think the Senator \nfrom Louisiana would join with myself and the Senator from Georgia and \nothers in sympathy for the overload that small business America has \nbeen suffering for too long, way too long.\n  Just to cite some of the figures, sometimes I think we forget what we \nare talking about when we talk about small business. There are over 5 \nmillion employers in the United States. Sixty percent of them are small \nbusinesses that have four--four--employees or less.\n  If you run a family business, or any endeavor, you understand what a \nlimited resource that is standing against the aura of the Federal \nGovernment. I remember years ago walking into our family business. My \nmother had come down to help us. We had four--myself, my father, my \nmother and one other at that time. I looked across the table. She was \njust staring across the room. This is many regulations ago. I asked her \nwhat the problem was. She had some government form in front of her, and \nshe was literally scared to death. She was afraid that she was going to \nmake a mistake that would somehow do harm to our family and our \ncompany. Even at that time it was threatening. And since that time--\nprobably some 15 years ago--it has been regulation after regulation \nafter regulation by the hundreds, by the thousands. People that had \nfour employees or less had an enormous problem trying to respond to \nwhat all these regulations ask of small business.\n  Here is an even more startling figure. Of the 5 million companies, 94 \npercent have 50 employees or less. That means only 6 percent of the \ncompanies in the United States fall into this category where they have \nthe kinds of resources--even as expensive as they are--to defend \nthemselves.\n  Half the small businesses are started with less than $20,000. More \nthan half the 800,000 to 900,000 businesses that are formed each year \nwill go out of business within 5 years. One of the reasons is they \ncannot keep up with what their Federal Government is demanding of them.\n  From 1988 to 1990 small businesses with fewer than 20 employees \naccounted for 4.1 million net jobs. Large firms--that is the 6 \npercent--lost half a million jobs.\n  The point I am making here is that these small businesses need a lot \nof nurturing and help and assistance from a friendly partner and not a \nlot of burden and bludgeoning from a bully partner. As we have \nrestructured corporate America, it is the small business that has given \nus the most to be optimistic about. They are creative, they take risk, \nand they are hiring people. They are virtually the only sector right \nnow that is hiring people.\n  The point I am making is that we need to underscore how much \nattention we as a Congress need to give to facilitating small business. \nWe have a lot of financial problems in our country that we have to \nresolve in the very near term. That is what all the balanced budget \nfights are about. But one of the four key components to fixing our \nfinancial discipline today is to expand the economy. We have such a \nlarge economy that a modest expansion gives us enormous relief, and the \none place that we have the best chance of expanding our economy is \nsmall business. It literally makes no sense for us to not only be not \nattentive to relieving them from regulatory burden and threat and cost, \nbut we should be very focused on the reverse; that is, creating every \nincentive that we can think possible to aid and abet small business.\n  Mr. President, the Congress has recognized this for a long time. And \nin 1980, as Senator Nunn has acknowledged, the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct was enacted. The idea was we were already worried about what was \nhappening to small business. We were already treating small business \nlike it was General Motors. So the Congress passed legislation that \nmade the Government begin to become more flexible to analyze the \nproportionate impact of regulations on small business. The problem was \nthat it did not require a cost analysis and there was no judicial \nreview. So it had been ignored far too much.\n  So while the Congress came forward and said we are going to do this, \nwe are going to really try to improve the situation for small business, \nit was a hollow promise. It has not achieved what it set out to do.\n  So the Nunn-Coverdell amendment takes the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct--which we have already passed; we have already acknowledged the \npurpose--and it said it will have to have meaning. It already requires \nextensive review and analysis. So we are simply saying that it will \nhave to add a cost analysis and that there is a regulatory review so \nthat it is enforceable, so that what the Congress meant to do in 1980 \nwill in fact happen in 1995, 15 years later. That says something else \nabout our Government.\n  The Senator from Louisiana has raised a legitimate problem. We are \nconcerned about the administrative functions of Government. But if I \nhave to choose between where the balance of the burden should rest, \nshould it rest on the U.S. Government, the EPA, OSHA, the Labor \nDepartment, and their millions and their thousands of employees, or \nshould it rest on the little company in Georgia that has three \nemployees? And if I have to pick between those two, I am going with the \nlittle company in Georgia. Given the scope of the resources both have, \nthe problem is a lot more fixable from a burden standpoint on the part \nof the Government than it is on that little firm and thousands of, \nmillions of, others like it across the country.\n  This is a good amendment. This will help small business. If we help \nsmall business, Mr. President, they are going to help America because \nthey are going to hire people looking for a job by the millions. And \nthey are going to expand our economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I wonder if I might have a few minutes on another topic. Is \nthe time divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is not divided.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, as the Serbian advance on Srebrenica \ncontinues, the administration, the U.N. bureaucracy, and some of our \nallies are busy defending their failed approach in Bosnia. They argue \nthat the Bosnians are better off if the U.N. forces stay in \n\n[[Page S 9625]]\nBosnia, that lifting sanctions on Serbia is the key to peace, that the \nSerb air defenses do not pose a threat to NATO air crews--the news from \nBosnia notwithstanding.\n  In his response to a letter from Speaker Gingrich and me, the \nPresident stated that he believed that the United States must support \nthe U.N. protection forces' continued presence in Bosnia. He said that \nUNPROFOR had played and was playing a ``critical role'' in diminishing \nthe conflict and was assisting the U.N. high commission on refugees in \nproviding aid to the Bosnian population.\n  In order to believe that the United States and European approach in \nBosnia is working, one simply has to play a game I call ``let's \npretend.'' The rules are simple. It goes like this:\n  Pretend that the U.N. forces are delivering humanitarian aid to those \nin need;\n  Pretend that the U.N. forces control Sarajevo airport;\n  Pretend that the U.N. forces are protecting safe havens such as \nSarajevo and Srebrenica and that no Bosnians are dying from artillery \nassaults and shelling;\n  Pretend that there is a credible threat of serious NATO\n   air strikes;\n\n  Pretend that the no-fly zone is being enforced;\n  Pretend that Serbian President Milosevic is not supporting Bosnian \nSerb forces;\n  Pretend that Bosnian Serb air defenses are not deployed against NATO \naircraft and are not integrated into Serbia's air defense system.\n  Pretend that the rapid reaction force will react forcefully and \nrapidly under the same U.N. rules of engagement which have made \nUNPROFOR impotent;\n  Pretend that U.N. forces can stay in Bosnia forever and that we will \nnever have to contemplate U.N. withdrawal.\n  Mr. President, if you can pretend all of the above, you can easily \naccept the administration's defense. On the other hand, if you react to \nreality and do not engage in multilateral make-believe, then you will \nnot be persuaded by the administration's case. Without taking the time \nto review the last year or two or three in Bosnia, let us just look at \nthe reports from the last week or so:\n  In Srebrenica, a so-called U.N. designated safe area, Serb forces \noverran U.N. observation posts and Serb tanks are within a mile of the \ntown center--in fact, we have just had a report that they are even \ncloser than that;\n  In Sarajevo, the hospital was shelled and more children were \nslaughtered;\n  Information surfaced that Bosnian Serb air defenses are tied into \nBelgrade's air defense system;\n  The no-fly zone was violated and NATO did not respond;\n  U.N. envoy Akashi assured the Bosnian Serbs that the United Nations \nwould continue business as usual in the wake of\n the downing of U.S. pilot O'Grady and the taking of U.N. hostages.\n\n  Mr. President, these are only a few examples of the reality in \nBosnia. It is this reality that should drive U.S. policy. It is this \nreality that has moved the Bosnian Government to reassess the U.N. \npresence in Bosnia. It is this reality that should prompt us to do the \nsame.\n  The fact is that despite the presence of over 25,000 U.N. \npeacekeepers and despite the impending arrival of the rapid reaction \nforce, the Bosnians are still being slaughtered, safe areas are under \nsiege, and the United Nations continues to accommodate Serb demands and \nveto even limited military action designed to protect United States air \ncrews. The fact is that the United Nations has become one of the means \nof securing Serb gains made through brutal aggression and genocide.\n  As Jim Hoagland aptly pointed out yesterday in the Washington Post, \nand I quote,\n\n       The war has now reached a point where the U.N.'s value free \n     equation of Serbs who are willing to kill with Bosnians who \n     are willing to die cannot be sustained and cannot be allowed \n     to spread deeper into the Clinton administration which too \n     docilely accepted Akashi's veto on retaliation. Americans \n     will no long support humanitarianism based on self-serving \n     bureaucratic cynicism and fear.\n\n  Not my quote but a quote in the Washington Post from Jim Hoagland, \nwho, I must say, has had a shift in his thinking recently.\n  The time for make-believe is over. The United Nations mission in \nBosnia is a failure. The Bosnians deserve and are entitled to defend \nthemselves. The United Nations must begin to withdraw and the arms \nembargo must be lifted. Therefore, I intend to take up a modified \nversion of the Dole-Lieberman arms embargo bill following disposition \nof the regulatory reform bill.\n  Mr. President, I think every day it is worse and worse, if it can \nbecome worse, in Bosnia, particularly for the Bosnians. It seems to me \nit is high time to act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire column in the Washington Post \nby Jim Hoagland be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 9, 1995]\n\n                      Bosnia: The U.N.'s Moral Rot\n\n                           (By Jim Hoagland)\n\n       The Serb missilemen who shot down Capt. Scott O'Grady's F-\n     16 over Bosnia committed attempted murder and got away with \n     it. After a month, there has been no American retaliation for \n     an act of treachery that once would have brought the heavens \n     down on its perpetrators.\n       Understand why the American government swallowed this \n     humiliation (without even a serious denunciation of the Serb \n     politicians in Belgrade who oversaw the shoot-down), and you \n     understand why the international effort in Bosnia has failed \n     so miserably--and why it should now be terminated.\n       A line has been crossed in Bosnia, a line that separates \n     humanitarian impulse from moral rot; a line that divides \n     ineffectiveness from dishonor. The United Nations is now on \n     the wrong side of that line, protecting the Serbs (and the \n     status quo) from retaliation for having downed O'Grady and \n     for killing, wounding, imprisoning and harassing British, \n     French, Spanish, Danish and other soldiers operating in \n     Bosnia under the U.N. peacekeeping flag.\n       This can only undermine U.S. and European support for \n     keeping those troops there and continuing an arms embargo \n     against Bosnia. It is now embarrassingly evident that in \n     Bosnia and elsewhere U.N. ``humanitarian'' operations are \n     guided by bureaucratic dedication to career and organization. \n     There is no room for justice, or for outrage over the Serbs' \n     long record of atrocity and betrayal, in the mandate of \n     Yasushi Akashi.\n       These are the two straws that break the United Nations' \n     back in Bosnia:\n       (1) Akashi, the Japanese diplomat who is Secretary General \n     Boutros Boutros-Ghali's representative in Bosnia, actively \n     blocked French and British efforts to form outside the U.N. \n     command a rapid reaction force to strike back at the Serbs \n     after hundreds of peacekeepers were taken hostage by the \n     Serbs and then released in June.\n       The rapid reaction force will be under Akashi's control and \n     will observe the same peacekeeping rules imposed on the \n     22,500-man international army already there, Akashi promised \n     the Serbs in a secret letter disclosed to reporters by the \n     Bosnian government.\n       The new troops, like the old troops, will not be permitted \n     to make distinctions between Serb aggressors, who have \n     ``ethnically cleansed'' Muslim territories and the forces of \n     the U.N.-recognized Bosnian government trying to regain its \n     lost lands. If Akashi has his way, the United Nations will go \n     on equating Serbs who blockade food shipments with Bosnians \n     who starve because those shipments do not get through.\n       (2) Following O'Grady's escape, Akashi, with the backing of \n     France and Russia, vetoed any new bombing raids on the Serbs. \n     The U.S. Air Force was denied the chastising effect of \n     retaliation and the preemptive protection of taking out Serb \n     anti-aircraft missile batteries that are linked to computer \n     networks controlled from Belgrade.\n       The chilling hostage-taking changes nothing, except to make \n     the United Nations command even more timid. The murder \n     attempt on O'Grady changes nothing except to end effective \n     enforcement of the no-fly zone over Bosnia. Score in this \n     exchange: Serbs everything, U.N. nothing.\n       That is galling, but it is now probably too late to fix. \n     ``You have to respond immediately,'' Sen. John McCain (R-\n     Ariz.), a fighter pilot in Vietnam and prisoner of war for \n     5\\1/2\\ years, told me. ``I don't think you can retaliate a \n     month or two later and expect to have any effect.''\n       But McCain also made this telling point: ``We made a \n     mistake in not publicizing the fact that this shoot-down \n     could not have happened without the Belgrade computers the \n     missile batteries are hooked up to. Instead the \n     administration is constantly sending an envoy'' to negotiate \n     with Serb President Slobodan Miloseyic--suspected by some in \n     U.S. intelligence of having given the order both for the \n     downing of the F-16 and the grabbing of the U.N. soldiers.\n       This is how moral rot spreads. The United Nations once \n     served as useful political cover for the major powers, who \n     wanted to limit their own involvement in the wars of ex-\n     Yugoslavia. The administration was right to try to minimize \n     the dangers of rupture within NATO over a unilateral U.S. \n     lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia.\n       But the war has now reached a point where the U.N.'s value-\n     free equation of Serbs who are willing to kill with Bosnians \n     who are \n\n[[Page S 9626]]\n     willing to die cannot be sustained and cannot be allowed to spread \n     deeper into the Clinton administration, which too docilely \n     accepted Akashi's veto on retaliation.\n       Americans will not long support humanitarianism based on \n     self-serving bureaucratic cynicism and fear. For better or \n     worse, American participation in the arms embargo will soon \n     come to an end and NATO member troops will come out. The war \n     is going to get bloodier. And the bureaucrats of the United \n     Nations, who now pursue policies that profoundly offend a \n     common sense of justice and decency, will not be blameless \n     for this happening.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/10/senate-section/article/S9624-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9626-S9628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, news reports indicate that President Clinton \nis on the verge of making a decision about normalizing relations with \nVietnam. I understand an announcement may come as soon as tomorrow. \nSecretary of State Warren Christopher has recommended normalization. \nMany Vietnam veterans support normalization--including a bipartisan \ngroup of veterans in the Senate, led by the senior Senator from \nArizona, John McCain. Many oppose normalization as well. Just as the \nVietnam war divided Americans in the 1960's and 1970's, the issue of \nhow to finalize peace with Vietnam divides Americans today.\n  At the outset, let me observe that there are men and women of good \nwill on both sides of this issue. No one should question the motives of \nadvocates or opponents of normalization. We share similar goals: \nObtaining the fullest possible accounting for American prisoners of war \nand missing in action; continuing the healing process in the aftermath \nof our most divisive war; fostering respect for human rights and \npolitical liberty in Vietnam.\n  I can recall in, I think, 1969 attending the first family gathering \nof POW's and MIA's. Only about 100 people showed up. I think I may have \nbeen the only Senator there. And I promised that group that within 3 \nmonths we would have a meeting at Constitution Hall, which seats 2,000 \npeople, and we would fill it up. And we did. And I remember wearing the \nJohn McCain bracelet for a couple of years back in those days when John \nMcCain was still a POW.\n  So I have had a long and I think consistent interest in the fate of \nPOW's and MIA's starting way back when nobody knew the difference, when \nbracelets were not ordinary, nobody knew what a POW/MIA was for \ncertain. And so it is something that I have had an interest in for a \nlong, long time.\n  The debate over normalization is about our differences with the \nGovernment of Vietnam, not with the Vietnamese people. The people of \nVietnam have suffered decades of war and brutal dictatorship. We hope \nfor a better future for the people of Vietnam--a future of democracy \nand freedom, not repression and despair.\n  The debate over normalization is not a debate over the ends of \nAmerican policy; it is a debate over the means. The most fundamental \nquestion is whether normalizing relations with Vietnam will further the \ngoals we share. In my view, now is not the time to normalize relations \nwith Vietnam. The historical record shows that Vietnam cooperates on \nPOW/MIA issues only when pressured by the United States; in the absence \nof sustained pressure, there is little progress on POW/MIA concerns, or \non any other issue.\n  The facts are clear. Vietnam is still a one party Marxist \ndictatorship. Preserving their rule is the No. 1 priority of Vietnam's \nCommunist Government. Many credible sources suggest Vietnam is not \nproviding all the\n information it can on POW/MIA issues. In some cases, increased access \nhas only confirmed how much more Vietnam could be doing. This is not \nsimply my view, it is a view shared by two Asia experts--Steve Solarz, \nformer chairman of the House Subcommittee on Asia and Pacific Affairs, \nand Richard Childress, National Security Council Vietnam expert from \n1981 to 1989. Earlier this year, they wrote:\n\n       Vietnam could easily account for hundreds of Americans by a \n     combination of unilateral repatriation of remains, opening \n     its archives, and full cooperation on U.S. servicemen missing \n     in Laos.\n\n  Again, not my quote but a quote by the two gentlemen mentioned. They \nconclude that,\n\n       Whatever the reasons or combination of reasons, Vietnam, in \n     the current environment, has made a conscious decision to \n     keep the POW/MIA issue alive by not resolving it.\n\n  This is a view shared by the National League of POW/MIA families \nwhich has worked tirelessly to resolve the issue for many years. It is \nalso a view shared by major veterans groups, including the American \nLegion, the largest\n veterans group. The media have reported that the Veterans of Foreign \nWars, the second largest group is supportive of normalization. Let me \nquote from VFW's official position adopted at its 1994 convention:\n\n       At some point in time but only after significant results \n     have been achieved through Vietnam/U.S. cooperative efforts, \n     we should . . . move towards normalizing diplomatic \n     relations.\n\n  A more recent VFW statement makes clear that normalization is not \nopposed by the VFW if it leads to a fuller accounting of POW/MIA cases.\n  If President Clinton intends to normalize diplomatic relations with \nVietnam, he should do so only after he can clearly state that Vietnam \nhas done everything it reasonably can to provide the fullest possible \naccounting. That is the central issue. The United States has diplomatic \nrelations with many countries which violate human rights, and repress \ntheir own people. But the United States should not establish relations \nwith a country which withholds information about the fate of American \nservicemen. As President-elect Clinton said on Veterans Day, 1992, ``I \nhave sent a clear message that there will be no normalization of \nrelations with any nation that is at all suspected of withholding any \ninformation'' on POW/MIA cases. Let me repeat: ``suspected of \nwithholding any information.'' Let me repeat, ``suspected of \nwithholding any information'' on POW/MIA cases. I hope the standard \nproposed by President-elect Clinton is the same standard used by \nPresident Clinton.\n  No doubt about it, the Vietnamese Government wants normalization very \nbadly. Normalization is the strongest bargaining chip America has. As \nsuch, it should only be granted when we are convinced Vietnam has done \nall it can do. Vietnam has taken many steps--sites are being excavated, \nand some remains have been returned. But there are also signs that \nVietnam may be willfully withholding information. Unless the President \nis absolutely convinced Vietnam has done all it can to resolve the POW/\nMIA issue--and is willing to say so publicly and unequivocally--it \nwould be a strategic, diplomatic and moral mistake to grant Vietnam the \nstamp of approval from the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from which I quoted earlier \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the San Diego Union-Tribune, Mar. 19, 1995]\n\n              Prisoner Issue Continues To Taint Relations\n\n            (By Richard T. Childress and Stephen J. Solarz)\n\n       Although the U.S. trade embargo with Vietnam has been \n     lifted and consular-level liaison offices have been opened, \n     relations between the United States and Vietnam are far from \n     normal. The major remaining bilateral obstacle, the POW/MIA \n     issue, is still cited by the Clinton administration as the \n     primary impediment to normalization.\n       Multiple intelligence studies from the war through today \n     conclude that Vietnam could easily account for hundreds of \n     Americans by a combination of unilateral repatriation of \n     remains, opening of its archives and full cooperation on U.S. \n     servicemen missing in Laos, 80 percent in Lao areas \n     controlled by the Vietnamese during the war.\n       While joint Vietnamese-American efforts to excavate \n     aircraft crash sites and otherwise ``clean up the \n     battlefield'' will continue to provide some accountability, \n     it will not be enough. What is needed is a decision by \n     Vietnam's ruling politburo to resolve the core POW/MIA cases, \n     including those Americans last known alive in the custody or \n     immediate vicinity of Vietnamese forces. That decision has \n     not been made.\n       Reasons offered for this have included a divided politburo, \n     a desire to exploit the POW/MIA issue for future financial or \n     political advantage, a continuing residue of hostility or \n     hatred toward Americans in Hanoi's ministries of interior and \n     defense, and a fear of embarrassment. Some also speculate \n     that Vietnam's leadership fears the United States will ``walk \n     away'' once the issue is resolved.\n       Whatever the reason or combination of reasons, Vietnam, in \n     the current environment, has made a conscious decision to \n     keep the POW/MIA issue alive by not resolving it.\n       This fundamental aspect of Vietnamese emphasis on the POW/\n     MIA issue has been central from the Paris negotiations in \n     1968-\n\n[[Page S 9627]]\n     73 and through every administration since that time. Knowing it to be \n     the most sensitive issue to Americans of\n      all the other bilateral humanitarian concerns, Hanoi has \n     consistently used it as the lodestar for leverage over \n     American policy. Similarly, the compelling nature of the \n     issue to Americans has caused it to be central in our \n     dealings with Vietnam over the years.\n       This centrality to American policy-makers has, however, \n     engendered different approaches. These have varied from \n     concerted efforts to define the issue away and defuse it, to \n     confronting the issue directly in order to resolve it. Even \n     policy-makers who viewed the POW/MIA issue as a hindrance to \n     healing or normalization demonstrated its centrality by \n     expending much political capital in a failed attempt to prove \n     the contrary.\n       Confronting the issue directly in negotiations has been the \n     only demonstrable path to progress. It is, ironically, the \n     path desired by the Vietnamese for reasons already outlined. \n     When Reagan administration officials reopened the POW/MIA \n     dialogue with Vietnam in 1981, the politburo was delighted. \n     Referring to the 1978-81 freeze in U.S.-Vietnam talks, \n     Hanoi's negotiators remarked that they ``didn't know we still \n     cared.'' That was also a challenge.\n       While the Clinton administration has rejected linking human \n     rights directly to questions to normalization, that, too, is \n     a potential obstacle. Strong feelings for linkage exist in \n     some human-rights organizations, the American-Vietnamese \n     community, the labor movement and in Congress. Linkage may \n     not be desired as a matter of executive branch policy, but \n     initiatives are possible in the new Congress along with other \n     domestic pressures.\n       In the mid-1980s, legislation was proposed to use Vietnam's \n     blocked assets to pay private claims, and significant lobby \n     pressure was put on the Reagan administration and Congress to \n     liquidate the assets. This initiative was opposed by the \n     administration and rejected by the Congress. The objection \n     then was that it would interrupt humanitarian cooperation, \n     that official claims of the United States government would \n     become secondary, and that such transactions should be \n     negotiated in the context of normalization discussions. \n     Sufficient funds existed to cover the private claims, and the \n     United States, as the custodian of the funds, was positioned \n     to settle them from a position of strength and leverage.\n       Vietnam's near-term and long-term economic goals are \n     central to its leadership. High on the leadership's bilateral \n     list is most-favored-nation (MFN) status and eligibility for \n     the so-called generalized system of preferences (GSP), an \n     additional trade concession.\n       But Vietnam's primitive economy and rudimentary trade \n     mechanisms hamper its accession to the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade and, accordingly, limit American \n     flexibility on commercial issues. In addition, various legal \n     and regulatory obstacles stand in the way. Some of the \n     relevant provisions can be waived through executive action; \n     under certain conditions legislation may be required.\n       In any event, since it is Vietnam, the Clinton \n     administration should be reluctant to take any significant \n     steps without close consultation with Congress.\n       Despite a significant loss of American leverage after the \n     trade embargo was lifted, one could argue that the United \n     States is again positioned for\n      progress. This plateau allows the Clinton administration \n     some breathing room to hold firm; to insist on meaningful, \n     unilateral action by Vietnam to meet the four POW/MIA \n     criteria set forth by President Clinton and to advance a \n     Washington-Hanoi dialogue on human rights in Vietnam.\n       In the interim, it is in both countries' interests that \n     Vietnam proceed with internal economic reforms. This would \n     assist Vietnam in further integrating into Asia generally and \n     the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \n     specifically. This long-term objective was shared in some \n     respects throughout each American administration since the \n     end of the Vietnam conflict.\n       Such integration would also provide greater exposure of the \n     Vietnamese leadership to international economic and political \n     norms, perhaps reduce some Vietnamese paranoia and help \n     convince the Vietnamese that the POW/MIA issue is a ``wasting \n     asset'' for them that needs to be resolved. Integration would \n     also mesh with Vietnam's desire for greater international \n     acceptance. Finally, it would serve to lessen Vietnam's \n     perceived isolation as a potentially threatened neighbor of \n     an increasingly assertive China.\n       However, American policy-makers also need to view this from \n     an internal Vietnamese perspective that would expect such \n     integration and acceptance to relieve pressure for political \n     reforms and improved human rights. Vietnam has boldly \n     endorsed universal declarations on human rights and attempted \n     to join the cultural argument between Asia and the West, as \n     if its political system were even comparable to those \n     advancing the argument in Asia.\n       For the foreseeable future, Vietnam will have three major \n     objectives: continued political control under the Communist \n     Party, economic development that does not threaten such \n     control, and a sense of security in its relationship with \n     China.\n       While political change is inevitable over time, it will be \n     due to internal factors, and American leverage will be at the \n     margins. Economic reforms have spawned divisions in Vietnam's \n     communist party and government, as well as regional tensions \n     between the North and the South. Recriminations are already \n     evident between reformers and hard-liners, and a significant \n     American role in the Vietnamese economic future will be \n     limited.\n       After listening to wishful speculation about a ``new \n     tiger'' in Asia, spawned by young consultants, service \n     industries and lobby organizations with a vested interest in \n     lifting the embargo, American businesses are again looking at \n     political and economic realities they tended to ignore for \n     the past four years.\n       Press accounts of Vietnam's economic potential before and \n     after the lifting of the trade embargo are strikingly \n     different.\n       Overblown stories of ``the last frontier,'' ``the emerging \n     tiger in Asia,'' and the loss of business to foreigners were \n     common themes before. Now, the media is beginning to report \n     about corruption, unenforceability of legal codes, currency \n     problems, bureaucratic hurdles, arbitrary decision-making by \n     government officials, the paucity of infrastructure and the \n     reality that Vietnam, with\n      few exceptions, is almost a decade away from real \n     profitability on an American business scale.\n       Profits for American companies operating in Vietnam are not \n     likely for several more years. A lot of money is being spent \n     and very little is being made.\n       Most experienced observers of Asia's geo-politics \n     recognize, as well, that Vietnam is not of real strategic \n     relevance to the United States in the 1990s. Nonetheless, \n     armchair strategists, military planners, and some in Congress \n     continue to argue otherwise, and worry aloud accordingly.\n       Still, Vietnam is certainly looking for strategic solace. \n     Its historic fear of China is underscored today by Chinese \n     claims on island groups in the South China Sea, plus China's \n     burgeoning economic and political clout. Although elements of \n     Vietnam's current agenda are variously shared by ASEAN, \n     American military power and political commitments are not \n     designed to ameliorate arguments between China and Vietnam. \n     The United States facilitated the end of the proxy war \n     between China and Vietnam in Cambodia not by taking sides but \n     by opposing both unworthy claimants in an international and \n     regional context.\n       The reality of the economic and strategic conditions now \n     and in the foreseeable future does not make Vietnam central \n     to American policy. The Vietnamese desire for real \n     normalization with the United States is recognized, but the \n     gap is wide and will remain so despite the wishful, almost \n     romantic thinking of some.\n       Vietnam and the United States do have a unique relationship \n     forged through shared recent history. Both sides can regret \n     missed opportunities. And while the history of bilateral \n     negotiations is tortured, the significance of historic \n     antagonisms can only be muted by a credible effort to resolve \n     the POW/MIA issue, the only path to real healing and \n     normalization.\n       In sum, fully normalized relations between the United \n     States and Vietnam are not on the immediate horizon. Vietnam \n     will remain, in an economic and strategic sense, of little \n     importance to the United States. Relations could conceivably \n     move forward in the absence of a real economic or strategic \n     rationale with significant progress on POW/MIA accounting \n     through unilateral Vietnamese action. The longer Vietnam \n     delays in this regard, the more likely normalization could be \n     linked to human rights concerns, as well. If this occurs, it \n     would be supported by those who, heretofore, believed Vietnam \n     would be able to forge a politburo consensus and finally end \n     the uncertainty of America's POW/MIA families.\n       Normalized relations are quite logical in an ideal world. \n     Full normalization with Vietnam is desirable, but as a \n     practical matter is not possible or prudent as long as it can \n     be credibly maintained that Vietnam can do more to account \n     for missing Americans.\n       If the Clinton administration proceeds with the elements of \n     normalization as an objective, rather than an instrument to \n     resolve bilateral issues, domestic and congressional \n     opposition is likely to increase. That, in turn, would \n     further reduce executive branch flexibility, and create a \n     renewed round of recriminations as well as a new gauntlet for \n     future negotiators.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I came over to address another issue. I \nlistened to the majority leader's statement with regard to actions that \nmay be taken by the President in the foreseeable future.\n  I want to commend what I thought was an excellent presentation by my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Kerry, as well as Senator McCain, on this \nissue on Sunday, as well as Senator Smith from New Hampshire who was \ntalking about this issue, I thought, in a very constructive, positive, \nbipartisan way.\n  I think for those who are looking to try to deal with an issue of \nthis complexity, of this importance, Members would be wise to take a \nfew minutes and review their presentations. I thought there were \nparticularly convincing arguments to be made in favor of moving the \nprocess forward at this time, and I thought the statements \n\n[[Page S 9628]]\nthat were made by, as I mentioned, my colleagues Senator Kerry and \nSenator McCain that support that change were very compelling. I thought \nthe observations of Senator Smith, which took a different view but, \nnonetheless, were related to the subject matter, were constructive as \nwell.\n  The country will be addressing this issue in the next several days or \nweeks. I think our Members would be wise to review their comments \nbecause they are individuals who have spent a great deal of time on \nthis issue and, obviously, have given it a great deal of thought. The \nfact that they come from different vantage points in terms of many \nother different issues, both in domestic and foreign policy, and still \nare as persuasive on this matter, I think really reflects some very, \nvery constructive and positive thinking.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/10/senate-section/article/S9626-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9628-S9637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1491\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the pending legislation before us is an \namendment by the Senator from Georgia, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GLENN. I particularly dislike having to oppose my good friend \nfrom Georgia, Senator Nunn. We worked together in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee on our bipartisan regulatory reform bill. We both \nsupported the bill. I certainly have the very highest regard for him. \nHe has always been a tireless champion of the interests of small \nbusiness men and women in our country, and I certainly applaud him for \nthat effort.\n  But I believe that while this amendment is very well-intentioned, I \nthink there are two serious problems. I do not believe the amendment \nshould be accepted. First, it revises the Regulatory Flexibility Act in \na number of ways that I think do not fit with workable regulatory \nreform.\n  First, the amendment would require cost-benefit analysis of all reg \nflex rules. That is, rules that have a significant economic impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities. This would be small businesses, \nlocal governments, and the like. Including these rules in the cost-\nbenefit analysis process would increase the number of rules that have \nto go through that analysis by over 500 rules. That is not a figure \ngrabbed out of thin air; that is the administration's estimate. It is \nbased on actual Federal Register entries over the last year.\n  Now, OMB has estimated that if this passed this way, there could \npossibly be as many as 600 to 800 rules and regulations that would fall \nunder this provision. That would raise the number of investigations and \nrulemaking procedures to something like three times our present number.\n  Now, agencies are going to be hard pressed with the budget cuts they \nare facing now just to do the analysis required if we just pass the \nGlenn-Chafee bill with its $100 million threshold. S. 343, which is \nbefore us now, would lower the threshold to an unreasonable $50 \nmillion. This amendment that we are considering now by the Senators \nfrom Georgia would have the potential of adding somewhere between 500 \nto the current rate, or up to as many as 800 more rules to that list. \nThat just overloads the circuits.\n  To make the point even further, one estimate before our committee by \none of the people testifying earlier this year was that each full-blown \nrule investigation costs somewhere around $700,000. If you take the 500 \nto 800 potential on this, that means we would be spending on \ninvestigations somewhere between $350 million for the 500 \ninvestigations, up to a potential of $560 million for the 800 \ninvestigations.\n  Let us say that is a pessimistic view of how much it costs, that \n$700,000. Even if you cut it in half, it means it is somewhere around \n$175 million up to, say, $270 or $280 million to do this increased \nnumber of investigations. So I say that agencies are going to be very \nhard pressed with these budget cuts to make it.\n  The second major problem with the amendment is the way it expands reg \nflex judicial review. The Glenn-Chafee bill is basically the bill \nbrought out of committee earlier and is designated as S. 1001. As \nopposed to S. 1001, this amendment would allow judicial review of final \nrule reg flex analysis. As opposed to that, this amendment permits \njudicial review of proposed rule reg flex decisions.\n  Now, this expands enormously the number of judicial challenges that \ncan be made, and it further overturns a principle that has been long \nheld that court review should wait until an agency makes its final \nrulemaking decision and then challenge the whole process, whatever it \nis, and not permit judicial review challenges all along the way, which \nmeans that the persistent challenger can keep something bogged down in \ncourt for years and years. It can literally bog down the whole process, \nthis number of new rulemaking procedures that would have to be \nreviewed.\n  So allowing judicial review of preliminary decisions about whether a \nrule is even subject to reg flex, which this would do, will bog down \nagencies and use more tax dollars unnecessarily and be a full \nemployment bill for lawyers, basically. I do not think that should be \nthe objective of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, further, I must admit that I do not understand exactly \nhow this whole thing would work. It would increase the complexity, as I \nsee it, and it would create more judicial review, to be added to our \nexpense in a substantial way.\n  Let me say that the Regulatory Flexibility Act was passed by Congress \nas a way to ensure that agencies would evaluate the impact of proposed \nregulations on small businesses and other small entities such as local \ngovernments. The act was also intended to ensure that agencies consider \nless burdensome and more flexible alternatives for these small \nentities.\n  I have supported the reg flex act from its inception when passed here \na number of years ago. But the legislation before us and the amendment \nwe are considering now would fundamentally change the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act by making its considerations the controlling factor, \nthe controlling decisional criteria, for the very promulgation of a \nrule. I do not think that is the way we ought to be going. We should \nensure that the Federal Government is more sensitive to the needs of \nsmall business. I certainly agree with that. That is why the Glenn-\nChafee bill, S. 1001, provides for judicial review of final reg flex \ndecisions, and the whole process can be challenged at that one time. It \ndoes not permit judicial challenge at each step along the way, which \nmeans multiple judicial review, and additional ways of stalling what \nmay be very good legislation.\n  Now, both bills also do provide--whether it is S. 343 or S. 1001, \nthey both provide for congressional veto. In other words, a rule or \nregulation being put out by an agency can be challenged and brought \nback to the Congress and lay here under one bill for 60 days or 45 days \nfor challenge here on the floor. That applies to small business \nprovisions or any other provision.\n  So it seems to me that we have provided adequate protection, quite \napart from the amendment as proposed by the Senators from Georgia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to talk about the \nsmall business amendment to S. 343 offered by Senator Nunn and Senator \nCoverdell.\n  This amendment would, of course, modify the definition of ``major \nrule'' to include rules that have a significant impact on small \nbusiness and small governments as provided in the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act.\n  This would have the effect of requiring all reg-flex rules to be \nsubject to cost benefit analysis and the decisional criteria, as well \nas to be subject to the petition process for reviewing rules.\n  Mr. President, as I have said before, I am deeply concerned about the \nimpact \n\n[[Page S 9629]]\nof the regulatory burden on small business. Indeed, that is exactly why \nI support the amendment offered by Senator Abraham earlier today.\n  The Nunn amendment in its present form does raise some serious \nproblems. I had hoped we could use an approach for this amendment \nsimilar to the Abraham amendment. So far, we have not been able to \nreach that agreement.\n  While I believe strongly in the need for regulatory reform, it must \nbe reform that is workable. I fear that, as drafted, this amendment \ncould place too heavy a burden on the agencies, which are already \npressed by the many other provisions of S. 343.\n  This amendment does not distinguish clearly between costly rules \nwhich deserve detailed analysis, and smaller rules which should not be \nsubject to time-consuming and expensive analysis.\n  I hope that we can work together to address the concerns about the \nworkability of this amendment, concerns shared by many of my \ncolleagues. I would welcome the opportunity to use some of the good \nideas in the Abraham amendment, such as giving OIRA greater \nresponsibility in selecting rules for analysis, or to pursue other \nsuggestions offered by my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, there has been an assertion that this \nwould unleash a flood of regulatory burden on the agencies. I want to \nmake the point again that quite the reverse would be the case. There \nhas been a regulatory flood on the small businesses of America.\n  As I said in my opening statement, if I want to pick where I want \nthat burden to be, it ought to be on the Government side, and not on \nthe backs of all these small companies with 4 or less employees, or 50 \nor less employees, which is almost all the companies in America except \nfor 6 percent.\n  Last year, 116 rules were swept up by the net of the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act, the act that is already in place.\n  Now, this idea that we would have 800, I think, is an unfounded \nassertion. If this had been in effect last year, it would have swept up \n116, just as it did last year. Because there is a judicial review, \nthere could be changes that would add some. I think it is most \ndifficult to assert that we will have 500 or 1,000 new rules that would \nrequire action under this amendment.\n  Assuming, again, that there is more burden, it ought to be on the \nback of the Government and not on the back of the small business. We \nshould be trying to protect the small businesses, not the regulators. \nThat is where our concern is properly fixed--helping small businesses \nto generate new companies, new jobs, and expand.\n  Now, I would just like to take a moment, Mr. President, and review \nwhat is already required under the act which Congress has already \npassed, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980. We have had any number \nof statements here asserting that we all support that.\n  Whenever an agency is required to publish a notice of proposed \nrulemaking for any proposed rule, the agency shall prepare and make \navailable for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility \nanalysis.\n  What does that include? Each initial regulatory flexibility analysis \nrequired under this act shall contain a description of the reasons why \naction by the agencies is being considered; a succinct statement of the \nobjectives of and legal basis for the proposed rules; a description of, \nand where feasible, an estimate, of the number of small entities to \nwhich the proposed rule will apply; a description of the projected \nrecording, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements of the \nproposed rule, including an estimate of the classes of small entities \nwhich will be subject to the requirement and the type of professional \nskills necessary for preparation of the report or record; an \nidentification to the extent practicable of all relevant Federal rules \nwhich may duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposed rule.\n  Each initial regulatory flexibility analysis shall also contain a \ndescription of any significant alternatives to the proposed rule which \naccomplish the stated objectives of political statutes and which \nminimize any significant economic impact of the proposed rule on small \nentities.\n  It goes on. Mr. President, that is what the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct required in 1980. I do not know how to do this without having a \ncost estimate. All we are saying in the amendment is that it should \ninclude a financial impact on small business--a financial impact on \nsmall business. And that there is an enforcement proceeding to ensure \nthat is done--the judicial review.\n  I would be hard pressed, Mr. President, having fulfilled the act that \nalready has been in effect for 14 years, I do not know how to do this \nas a former businessman and not understand economic consequences.\n  In other words, the argument I am making, Mr. President, is that the \nwork is virtually done under the existing law. We are simply saying, \nMr. President, that the Government is going to have to do and certify \nwhat we all intended all of small business to think we were doing when \nwe passed this act.\n  Several points, Mr. President. First, I think the assertion of the \nincreased burden is without sufficient evidence. The evidence we have \nwould suggest a modest increase.\n  Second, Mr. President, the act that is already required of the \nagencies requires virtually all that is necessary already. If we spent \nthe money to do all this work, why not have the fundamental question \nbefore the country and the American people: What is the cost going to \nbe?\n  The average small businessman today is spending $5,500 per employee; \nthe average American family is spending $6,000 a year because of the \nsurge of regulation. We ought to know what the impact of these \nregulations would be.\n  Last, Mr. President, the point I would like to make is that we ought \nto be in the business of being more concerned about the small business \nperson who has such limited resources and their ability to deal with \none regulation after another after another than with worrying about \nwhat the regulatory overload will be on the people who are making all \nthese regulatory reviews.\n  Mr. President, maybe a side effect would be that the agency will be \nmore careful in determining whether or not it needs to propose a new \nregulation. That is another way we could affect what the ultimate cost \nis of the review of the regulation. They might start thinking, for a \nchange, do we need it? And my guess is that this amendment, in fact the \noverall underpinnings of the bill itself, will suggest that the \nGovernment needs to be a little more thoughtful about imposing yet \nanother requirement, another burden, and another form on that little \ncompany of two or three people, all over America, who have so little \nability to respond or know, even, what the new regs require.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we all want and hope and believe in a \nsignificant and a meaningful regulatory reform. No one wants rules that \ndo not make sense or are not cost effective. No one wants, or should \nwant, regulatory requirements that exceed real needs. We want \nGovernment to be smart, efficient, reasonable and practical.\n  There are plenty of regulatory horror stories, some of which are \naccurate, some of which are not. There is more than enough evidence, \nthough, for us to be convinced of the fact that the regulatory process \nneeds fixing. It has needed fixing for some period of time.\n  We have been in the process of reforming it for years. Back in the \nlate 1970's, when the Governmental Affairs Committee conducted a \nlengthy set of hearings and issued a multivolume report on the \nregulatory process, the findings in those hearings led directly to the \nSenate passage, in 1981, of Senate bill 1080, the number was at that \ntime, by a unanimous vote, 94 to nothing.\n  S. 1080 looked similar in many ways to the legislation which we are \nconsidering this week. It had many of the same elements, including \ncost-benefit analysis of major rules, a procedure for reviewing \nexisting rules, legislative review, and Presidential oversight. \n\n[[Page S 9630]]\n\n  S. 1080 did not make it into law because the coalition supporting it \ndid not hold together once the bill got to the House. It was tough \nreform, and if it had been in place for the last 15 years we would not \nbe here today with the legislation before us. We would undoubtedly have \nhad a lot fewer horror stories and a lot more thoughtful regulation \nover the past decade and a half.\n  So we are here to try again, and I am all for it. We spent several \nmonths in the Governmental Affairs Committee earlier this year \nconsidering a bill introduced by Senators Roth and Glenn which, with a \nfew amendments, we reported to the full Senate for its consideration. \nMany of us think it is a solid bill. It was passed by a unanimous, \nbipartisan vote of 15 to nothing. It has cost-benefit analysis, risk \nassessment, legislative review, and a procedure for the review of \nexisting rules. It is tough but balanced. It is a bill that makes \nsense.\n  The bill is tough, the Governmental Affairs bill, which is basically \nnow the Glenn-Chafee bill. It is tough because it would require by law \nthat every major rule be subject to a cost-benefit analysis. It would \nrequire that each agency assess whether the benefits of the rule that \nit is proposing or promulgating justify the costs of implementing it. \nIt requires that agencies select the most cost effective rules among \nthe various alternatives.\n  These two elements are key controls to rational rulemaking. The \nGovernmental Affairs approach, now embodied in Glenn-Chafee, is tough \nbecause, by statute, it resolves once and for all the role of the \nPresident in overseeing the regulatory process. The bill gives the \nPresident the authority to oversee the cost-benefit analysis and the \nrisk assessment requirements, and recognizes the unique contribution \nthat a President, above all of the agencies, can make to rational \nrulemaking. It also gives Congress the right and the practical \ncapability to stop a rule before it takes effect.\n  The Glenn-Chafee approach is tough because it allows for judicial \nreview of an agency's determination as to whether or not a rule meets \nthe $100 million economic impact test and because a rule can be \nremanded to an agency for the failure of the agency to do the cost-\nbenefit analysis or risk assessment. It is tough because it requires \nexisting major rules to be subject to repeal should the agency fail to \nreview them in 10 years, according to the schedule and the requirements \nof the legislation.\n  The bill was reported out of Governmental Affairs, as I mentioned, by \na unanimous bipartisan vote. It is a balanced bill, and this is the \nbalanced half of it. It is balanced because it recognizes that many \nbenefits are not quantifiable and that decisions about benefits and \ncosts are, by necessity, not an exact science but require, often, the \nexercise of judgment. It is a balanced alternative because it would \nrequire that, to the extent the President exercises his oversight \nauthority over the rulemaking process, that authority must be conducted \nin the public eye and with public accountability.\n  It is a very important part of the Glenn-Chafee bill that we have \nsome sunshine on the rulemaking process right up to and including the \noffice of the President and the OMB. It took us years to get to that \npoint. President Bush promulgated an Executive order--President Clinton \nhas promulgated a similar Executive order--that called for sunshine \nwhen rules are kicked upstairs to the White House for their \nconsideration before final promulgation. This bill, this alternative \nwhich is called Glenn-Chafee, in a very significant step incorporates, \nor would incorporate into law, the basic elements of the Executive \norders of Presidents Bush and Clinton.\n  The Glenn-Chafee bill is balanced because it does not subject all \nrules to congressional review, just the major rules. It is balanced \nbecause it uses information as a tool for assessing agency performance \nand makes that information available to everyone to judge and to \nchallenge. It is practical because it does not overwhelm the rulemaking \nprocess by requiring cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment for less \nthan major rules. It is balanced because, while requiring an analysis \nand certification by the agency as to whether the benefits of the rule \njustify the costs, it does not override the underlying statutory scheme \nupon which a rule is based.\n  I believe the amendment before us, to address the specific amendment \non the floor, goes too far. It would provide for the interlocutory \njudicial review at an early stage in a proceeding in a way which could \nswamp both the regulatory process and the courts. What we are trying to \ndo is reform this system and not swamp it and not make it worse. We \nall, again--hopefully all of us--want to reform this system, the cost-\nbenefit analysis, with the kind of risk assessment which is essentially \nin both bills.\n  But what we must avoid doing is swamping either the regulatory system \nso that it becomes totally unworkable, or delaying it through \ninterlocutory court proceedings, which will, in effect, make the \nregulatory system unworkable.\n  I do not think any of us want that. We want a system which is \ncommonsensical and does not impose costs and burdens on this society \nwhere the benefits are inadequate. But surely there is a role for \nrules. There is a role for the rollback of rules, for the review of \nexisting rules, and we have to make sure, both in terms of new rules \nand review of existing rules, that we have a process which can function \nin a practical way.\n  The amendment before us would add this interlocutory appeal from an \nagency determination that a rule will not have a significant impact on \na small entity and, therefore, it does not require regulatory \nflexibility analysis.\n  One of the problems with having that interlocutory appeal is that it \nthen opens up the court process to two appeals on the same rule. You \nhave a rule up front to a court for an interlocutory appeal if an \nagency does not do a regulatory flexibility analysis. That then can go \nto the court of appeals. That then can be appealed to the court of \nappeals. That then can be appealed to the Supreme Court just on the \nquestion of whether or not the agency erred in failing to do a \nregulatory flexibility analysis. But that does not end it because there \nis still an appeal at the end on the subject of regulatory flexibility \nanalysis. This time, however, on the question of whether or not, \nassuming the regulatory flexibility analysis was done, it was done \ncorrectly.\n  So the amendment before us has really two problems. One is that it \nwill significantly increase the load on courts and the delays in the \nregulatory process. It does it unnecessarily because in the bill itself \nthere is judicial review of a decision by an agency not to conduct a \nregulatory flexibility analysis. But it is done at the correct time, \nwhich is at the end of the process, and it is done at a time when both \naspects of regulatory flexibility can be decided by a court at the same \ntime: One, if there was a failure on the part of the agency to conduct \nthe regulatory flexibility analysis, was that failure error; and, \nsecond, if there was a regulatory flexibility analysis, whether or not \nthe analysis was correctly done. That is the more practical way to do \nit. That is the way to avoid both swamping courts in judicial review \nprematurely, and that is the way if we can avoid having two judicial \nreviews in effect of regulatory flexibility analysis relative to the \nsame rule.\n  The amendment also is going to create a problem in that it is going \nto probably double the number of rules. We can debate how many more \nrules there are going to be subject to this elaborate cost-benefit \nanalysis requirement if we adopt this amendment. But the best estimate \nthat we can make is that it would at least double the number of rules \nthat will be subject to that cost-benefit analysis. It is costly. It is \nsomething which delays the process. It is obviously necessary when it \ncomes to major recalls. I think all of us agree on that. Both bills \ncontain that. The question is whether or not, given the downsizing of \nGovernment, we can effectively then load onto agencies these kinds of \nburdens to increase so dramatically the requirement relative to cost-\nbenefit analysis.\n  So for both those reasons, I hope that we would either defeat or \nmodify the amendment before us because to put it in the middle of the \nrulemaking, to put this interlocutory review in the middle of the \nrulemaking process, will use the court systems unnecessarily. It will \nuse them prematurely. And it will end up overloading both systems. That \n\n\n[[Page S 9631]]\nwould be harmful for people who are participants in the regulatory \nprocess, whether they are favoring a regulation or opposing it.\n  Again, I emphasize, this can work both ways. There are many \nbusinesses that want to review existing rules. We want the reviews to \ngo in a practical and a smooth way, too. There are many businesses \nwhich need new rules. For instance, the bottled water business has been \nwaiting for a rule for years to try to put some restrictions on the \nrepresentations of the type of water that is being sold as bottled \nwater, as spring water, for instance. It is the business which is \nwaiting for the rule. It is the business which is trying to stop the \nfalse representations relative to bottled water.\n  So this is not always the kind of outside groups versus business. \nThis is frequently business that needs rules to be changed or added or \namended. We have to make sure that this rulemaking process works in a \npractical and a functional way.\n  So, for that reason, I hope that the pending amendment will be \ndefeated or modified.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan referred to \nthe interlocutory appeal, and, in fact, the Nunn-Coverdell amendment \nhas been criticized because it allows two appeals, both an \ninterlocutory appeal to be taken within 60 days of the notice of the \nproposed rulemaking and a later appeal.\n  Mr. President, I have just been discussing with the Senator from \nGeorgia a modification of that amendment to make sure that the final \nappeal relates only to those classes of appeals which would not \notherwise be subject to appeal under section 706 of the Administrative \nProcedure Act or under section 625 of this act, which are, in effect, \nfinal agency actions, so that both the appeal and the remedy, the final \nappeal under this bill, would be a very limited and narrow one. But I \nwill describe that amendment when it comes up.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield just on that point for \na question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the amendment going to be modified so as to prevent an \nappeal on how a regulatory flexibility analysis has been conducted if \nthere were an interlocutory appeal on the question of whether a \nregulatory flexibility analysis should be done? Will the modified \namendment be precluding an appeal on how that regulatory flexibility \nanalysis has been conducted at the end of the rulemaking process? \nBecause that would be taking away from small business something that it \nnow has, for instance, with small units of government. I do not know if \nthat is the intent. I think it should be clear. But the double appeal \npoint that I was making, I think, is slightly different from the double \nappeal point which has been made previously, which is that the \ninterlocutory appeal that is provided here goes to the question of \nwhether or not there should be a regulatory flexibility analysis, and \nthat presumably there still would be an appeal at end of the process on \nthe question of how that analysis had been conducted, assuming one is \nordered. So that is still a double appeal.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The question is an appropriate one. The first appeal in \nthe interlocutory appeal process would be on the question of major \nrules, whether it meets the $50 million threshold, whether it is a \nmatter that involves the environment, health, and safety, or whether it \nhas a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses \nand, therefore, requires the regulatory flexibility. That appeal would \nbe taken within 60 days and putting the notice in the Federal Register. \nThe idea here is that you foreclose further appeals after that 60 days. \nNow there is in addition to that in the present Nunn-Coverdell \namendment a more limited petition for review which allows you to get \ninto the quality of the regulatory flexibility analysis.\n  What we are saying is if it is subject to an appeal under section 706 \nof the Administrative Procedure Act, or under section 625 of this act, \nthen the quality of that regulatory flexibility analysis insofar as it \nrelates to the question of whether the final agency action was \narbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion, they would have in \nthat appeal the right to test the regulatory flexibility analysis at \nthat point.\n  For those which were not subject to that, they would have the ability \nto appeal in any court in the Nation that has jurisdiction and to ask \nfor what would be an order to go back and do the reg-flex analysis.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is that at the end of the process? Is there an appeal open \nat the end of the process to order a reg-flex analysis if there were no \ninterlocutory appeal that had been asked?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So you have a choice as to whether to take an \ninterlocutory appeal on that issue or to make that part of the final \nappeal; is that correct?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. You have a choice. If you wait until the final appeal, \nit would be a more limited choice because the only remedy provided \nthere is for the court, in effect, to order the reg-flex analysis, and \nif that then would call for a modification in the rule, then the rule \nwould then be modified, but there would be, for example, no stay of the \nrule because of the inadequacies of the reg-flex.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It was my question--I am unclear--is it the intent of the \nmodified amendment that there could be either an interlocutory appeal \non the question of whether or not a reg-flex analysis has to be made or \nthat issue could be raised for the first time at the end of the \nrulemaking process, either one would be allowed?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No; the question of whether this is a rule which has a \nsubstantial, significant effect on a substantial number of small \nbusinesses, which is the trigger for the reg-flex, it is the intent \nhere--and this language has not been drawn--it is the intent here that \nthat test be only once.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And that it must be made on interlocutory appeal?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is correct. That is the intent. It is a little \ndifficult to give precise answers since the actual language has not \nbeen drawn. That is the intent. But as to the quality of that, you can \ntest that only later after the reg-flex attempt.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Louisiana for his answers, and I \nthen would withhold any further comment until after we see the language \non it. I wonder if the Senator will yield for one additional question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Surely.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the intent that the rulemaking process be stayed during \nthe interlocutory appeal on reg-flex?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No, not at all. That is the whole idea.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is that clear in the language of the amendment?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. We believe so, but if it needs to be further clarified, \nit can be. The idea here is that you want to have this determination \nmade early enough in the process so that you can remedy the defects in \nthe rule while the rule is still going on and not have to wait until it \nis all over with, because some of these rules take 2 or 3 years. And if \nyou do not find out until, say, your final appeal is 6 or 9 months \nafter the final rule, then you have to stay the rule and go back and do \nit all over again.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Of course, that is what judicial review is all about. \nThere is presumably an incentive to do the process right. That is why \nthere is judicial review at the end. And you do not wipe out judicial \nreview at the end in any event. You still allow judicial review in many \nways, so it is not as though you are doing a whole bunch of things up \nfront and thereby precluding the review at the end.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No, but you would preclude a review, for example, on \nwhether this is a major rule, whether it has $50 million, if that is \nthe trigger, or $100 million, which I hope we can get an amendment in \nto make it $100 million. That question would be reviewed, would be \nfinally reviewed on the interlocutory basis.\n  Does the Senator understand what I am saying?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it the intent of the sponsors of this bill, and the \nSenator indicates the sponsors of this amendment, to preclude judicial \nreview at the end of anything which can be raised by interlocutory \nappeal at the beginning?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator reask the question.\n  \n[[Page S 9632]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it the intention of the sponsor of the bill pending \nhere, of the Dole-Johnston bill, and is it the Senator's understanding \nthat it is the intention of the makers of this amendment, that the \ninterlocutory appeal which is provided is the exclusive remedy to raise \nthe issues that can be raised by interlocutory appeal and that if \nanyone fails to raise an issue, which could be raised by interlocutory \nappeal, by interlocutory appeal, it cannot then be raised at the end of \nthe rulemaking process?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is correct. And I hope our language will properly \nreflect that.\n  Mr. President, let me be a little more clear if not only for the \npurpose of this small business amendment, the reg-flex amendment, but \nalso for the purpose of the whole bill. The reason for having the \ninterlocutory appeal is that the question can be put at rest early in \nthe process.\n  If, for example, an agency determines that the rule is likely to have \nan impact of less than $50 million a year, then it would not be a major \nrule, would not require the cost-benefit analysis, or the risk \nassessment. They would make that determination early on, file that in \nthe record, and any party, any interested party, would then have 60 \ndays from the time of that determination to make this interlocutory \nappeal on the question of whether it was a major rule because of the \namount of dollars, whether it was a rule that affects health, safety, \nthe environment, which in turn requires the risk assessment, or in this \ncase whether it has a significant effect upon a substantial number of \nsmall businesses.\n  The idea is that if that appeal is not made within 60 days, that you \nare foreclosed from raising that later on in the process.\n  Keep in mind that if an appeal is made within the 60 days on the \nbasis that they failed to make it into a major rule, that the agency \nitself could make a determination, could in effect moot the appeal by \ngoing back and doing the cost-benefit analysis and the risk assessment.\n  What we find under the present law in areas like NEPA, National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, agencies tend to err on the side of \nconservative in doing an environmental impact statement, which is much \nmore involved than the environmental impact assessment. They will do \nthe statement rather than the assessment many times because they do not \nwant all their work to be thrown out X years later at the end of the \nprocess.\n  The result is that it frequently requires tremendous amounts of \nadditional expense in doing that which the law would not otherwise \nrequire. And the reason for the interlocutory appeal is to be able to \nget that question determined up front and early so that the results of \nthe whole system will not be thrown out.\n  The concern with the Nunn amendment, even as amended, when amended, \nis that it is likely to cause an agency overload or much more than the \nagencies are able to do.\n  The amount of personnel that the agencies have, the amount of moneys \nthat the agencies have in order to perform these risk assessments is, \nof course, limited. Now, how many additional rules would this require \nthe agencies to do? We do not know. OMB tells us that it could be \nhundreds of additional rules that would be caught under this \ndefinition.\n It could have the effect of doubling, tripling, or even a fivefold \nincrease in the amount of work that they have to do.\n\n  I hope, Mr. President, that if this amendment is adopted and becomes \npart of this law that that is not the result. However, I think that it \nis going to require continued analysis as this matter moves along. It \nis not my purpose, frankly, to vote for this amendment, although we are \nnot making, or at least I am not making, a major challenge to this \namendment, given the assurances of the Senators from Georgia that we \nwill be able to continue to work on it to avoid the question of agency \noverload.\n  However, until we have dealt with a more assuring way with this \nquestion of agency overload, I will not be able to vote for this \namendment.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I believe this amendment to S. 343 is of \nparamount importance. S. 343, as written now, will unquestionably \nbenefit small businesses by requiring Federal bureaucrats to only \npromulgate regulations that are cost-effective and based on good \nscience. But adoption of the Nunn-Coverdell amendment will guarantee \nthat small businesses, which represent the vast majority of employers \nand employees in this Nation, thus encompassing most Americans, will \nfurther benefit from regulatory reform by assuring that all regulations \nthat are currently subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, \ntermed the ``reg flex act,'' will also be subject to S. 343's cost-\nbenefit analysis provision and periodic congressional review.\n  Small businesses create most of the jobs in America. This is \ndemonstrated by the fact that from 1980 to 1990, small businesses with \nfewer than 20 employees created 4.1 million net new jobs. Compare that \nwith big business. Large businesses with more than 500 employees lost \nover 500,000 net jobs over the same time period.\n  According to the Small Business Administration, small business bears \na disproportionate share of regulatory burdens. In fact, SBA, the Small \nBusiness Administration, estimates that the burden of regulations on \nsmall business is three times greater than that for large businesses. \nIt is clear that to assure small businesses will continue to act as \nAmerica's locomotive for job creation, Congress has to lift the \nregulatory burden from small family businesses.\n  The Nunn-Coverdell amendment will accomplish this through several \nmechanisms. First, the definition of ``major rule.'' S. 343 is amended \nto include rules that have a significant economic impact on a \nsubstantial number of small businesses, virtually the same definition \nthat triggers the reg flex act. The determination of a rule as a major \nrule subjects the rule to S. 343's cost-benefit analysis. This will \nassure that rules affecting small businesses will be cost-effective and \nless burdensome.\n  This designation of rules having a substantial impact on small \nbusinesses as a major rule subject to cost-benefit analysis is \nnecessary to close a loophole in this bill. The $50 million threshold \namount for a major rule may be too high for many small businesses. For \ninstance, a regulatory impact of less than that amount may have a \ndevastating effect on a small business or a sector of the economy that \nmay not yet represent a significant burden on a Fortune 500 company. \nThe Nunn-Coverdell amendment would resolve this problem by requiring \nthat all rules that have a significant impact on small businesses be \nclassified as a major rule under S. 343.\n  A legitimate question is just how many regulations does this \namendment encompass? How many new major rules will be subject to cost-\nbenefit analysis under S. 343? In other words, what is the impact of \nthis amendment to Federal agencies' resources and personnel? And the \nanswer is, not that much. The reg flex act requires that regulatory \nburdens be reduced for those regulations that have a ``significant \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities.''\n  Small entities include small businesses as well as both small \ngovernments and charities, entities that shoulder a disproportionate \nshare of the cost of regulation. Last year under the reg flex act just \n127 regulations qualified for that act's special treatment. The Nunn-\nCoverdell amendment, as I understand it, would encompass only that part \nof the 127 regulations that affect small business and even 127 is not a \ngreat or burdensome amount.\n  The other mechanisms of this amendment that assure protection of \nsmall businesses involve modifications of the reg flex act. The most \nimportant establishes a requirement for agencies to conduct a cost-\nbenefit analysis before rules are promulgated under the reg flex act. \nFurthermore, the determination by an agency that a rule will not have a \nsignificant impact on small businesses is made judicially review-able. \nI believe that these changes will buttress our economy by reducing the \nburdens imposed on our small businesses by regulations.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the Nunn-Coverdell amendment. I \nthink it is a good amendment. I think \n\n[[Page S 9633]]\nit helps the bill. I think it closes a loophole. I think it protects \nsmall businesses. I think that it makes the regulatory forces in this \ncountry be more responsible and, above all, it amounts to common sense. \nTo me, that is what this bill is all about--common sense. I think it \nwould be well for us to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana and I previously \nhad a colloquy, and I very much welcome the language that he is going \nto be preparing to clarify a critical point, but it seems to me that \nthe more that point is clarified, the less of a favor we are doing for \nsmall business in this amendment. Let me explain why.\n  In talking with the Senator from Louisiana, and just talking with the \nsenior Senator from Georgia, it is quite clear that the intent of this \namendment is that an issue which can be raised on an interlocutory \nappeal must be raised at that time or else it is precluded from being \nraised at the end of the rulemaking process.\n  The problem with that is that an awful lot is learned about the \nimpacts of rules during the comment period. That is one of the reasons \nfor the comment period. To preclude a small business from taking \nadvantage of what is learned during the comment period so it can argue \non an appeal at the end of the rulemaking process that this rule has a \nsignificant impact on small business or on small units of local \ngovernment, it seems to me, is doing a disfavor, a disservice to these \nsmaller units.\n  So while that clarification I think is important in terms of \ncongressional intent and it is important in order to avoid two appeals \non the same subject, the better road to go here is to have the appeal \nat the end of the process, as it is in the way the bill is written now, \nwhere you can use the comment period to gain evidence as to why a \nregulatory flexibility analysis is essential. To preclude a small unit, \nbe it business or small unit of government, from taking advantage of \nthat comment period to make a case as to why a regulatory flexibility \nanalysis is necessary, it seems to me, is not the way we should be \ngoing in terms of trying to help both small businesses and small units \nof government.\n  So while I think the clarification is important, again, so we all \nunderstand what the intent is and while it is important in order to \navoid two appeals on the same subject, the conclusion that is reached \nhas the appeal at the wrong point. The appeal should be there. It is \nnew. It is important to small business that there be an appeal on this \nissue and the small units of government. But the right place for that \nappeal to come is at the end of this process where they can then use \nthe record which has been gained during the comment period to make the \nargument that there should have been a regulatory flexibility analysis \nand that failure to do so was an error which requires the rule to be \nremanded and to be done right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1491, As Modified\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 14, line 10, strike out ``or''.\n       On page 14, line 16, add ``or'' after the semicolon.\n       On page 14, insert between lines 16 and 17 the following \n     new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) any rule or set of closely related rules, not \n     determined to be a major rule pursuant to subparagraph (A) or \n     (B), that the agency proposing the rule determines will have \n     a significant economic impact on a substantial number of \n     small businesses, pursuant to subchapter I shall be deemed to \n     be a major rule for the purposes of subchapter II;\n       On page 39, line 22, strike out ``and''.\n       On page 39, line 24, strike out the period and insert in \n     lieu thereof a semicolon and ``and''.\n       On page 39, add after line 24 the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(C) an agency certification that a rule will not have a \n     significant economic impact on a substantial number of small \n     entities pursuant to section 605(b).\n       On page 40, line 5, insert ``and section 611'' after \n     ``subsection''.\n       On page 68, strike out all beginning with line 9 through \n     line 11 and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(A) include in the final regulatory flexibility analysis \n     a determination, with the accompanying factual findings \n     supporting such determination, of why the criteria in \n     paragraph (2) were not satisfied; and\n       On page 72, insert between lines 14 and 15 the following \n     new subsection:\n       (e) Amendments to the Regulatory Flexibility Act.--\n       (1) Technical and clarifying amendments.--Section 612 of \n     title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n       (A) in subsection (a) by striking ``the Committees on the \n     Judiciary of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the \n     Select Committee on Small Business of the Senate, and the \n     Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives'' \n     and inserting ``the Committees on the Judiciary and Small \n     Business of the Senate and House of Representatives''; and\n       (B) in subsection (b) by striking ``his views with respect \n     to the effect of the rule on small entities'' and inserting \n     ``views on the rule and its effects on small entities''.\n       On page 72, line 15, strike out ``(e)'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``(f)''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if I could ask the sponsors of the \namendment the following question, since we have not had a chance to \nlook at the modification.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I know this has been the subject of debate \non the floor--not publicly but among different Members. I wonder if we \ncan have a brief explanation. We only have a few minutes before the \nvote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is my intention to ask the senior \nSenator from Georgia this question. Is it the intent of the \nmodification to make it clear that there is only one appeal that is \npermitted on the issues which can be raised by interlocutory appeal and \nthat one appeal is the interlocutory appeal? Is that, as previously \nstated by the Senator from Louisiana, the purpose and effect of the \nmodification sent to the desk?\n  Mr. NUNN. If I could say to my friend, there are two parts of this \nmodification. One is to make it clear that risk assessment is not \nrequired under this amendment, only cost-benefit analysis. We talked \nabout that earlier this afternoon. There was an omission from the \ndraft.\n  The modification relates to judicial review. You made the point that \nsmall businesses might need two bites at the apple. The way the \namendment reads, there would be two bites at the apple. We intend to \nchange that at a later point during the debate on this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it the intent to modify it so there is only one bite at \nthe apple?\n  Mr. NUNN. This whole issue of judicial review will require more work. \nAs the Senator knows, it is complicated, and for me, is not fixed at \nthis point. We are going to have to work on it more.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it the intent later on to require or to provide only \none bite at the apple later on?\n  Mr. NUNN. That is my present intent. I am always persuaded by my \nfriend's arguments, so we may have to think more on that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it the intent that that one bite be the interlocutory \nappeal? Is that the present intent?\n  Mr. NUNN. I would like to work with the Senators on that.\n  Mr. GLENN. Would the Senator consider, rather than having a vote now, \nwaiting until it is modified and wait until later?\n  Mr. NUNN. I believe we ought to go ahead and vote. This judicial \nreview issue has to be addressed on the overall bill. So we are going \nto have to work on this issue more, within the overall bill. I would \nlike to vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am wondering if the first part of the amendment could be \nvoted on.\n  Mr. NUNN. There is no way to divide it at this point.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is a rather unusual thing we are doing. We are adopting \nan amendment which we are saying later on we know needs to be modified, \nand it is the intent of the makers to modify it. I would think it would \nbe better to modify it before we vote.\n\n[[Page S 9634]]\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Or you are going to get people locked in on this vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I do not think this is going to be the issue on which \npeople are voting. I hope I am not the first Senator to say on the \nfloor that an amendment is not perfect. It will require further work. \nThis will require further work on that limited point.\n  This is not the central point of the amendment. The central point is \nto have the small business community not be full beneficiaries of these \nvery important changes to regulatory review process.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Explanation of Absence\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the senior Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. \nSmith] is necessarily absent from the Senate and is holding an \nimportant meeting on Superfund reform in his home State. He has asked \nme to announce that had he been present for the votes we are just about \nto take, he would have voted in favor of both the Abraham and the Nunn-\nCoverdell amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1490\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Michigan.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  (At the request of Mr. Dole, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n  S0634\n\n\n                         explanation of absence\n\n Mr. BOND. I regret that I was unavoidably absent for the votes \ntoday. I was away from Washington to participate in a court-ordered \nappearance. If I had been present, I would have supported both the \nAbraham and the Nunn-Coverdell amendments.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, after more than a decade, it is about \ntime that we are starting to work on regulatory reform. We have a very \ngood bill going through the House of Representatives. Hopefully, we \nwill be able to get just as good a bill through the U.S. Senate. I am \nglad that we are able to do this under the leadership of our majority \nleader, Senator Dole, because this is a historic comprehensive \nregulatory reform. This bill, S. 343, is a response to the informal \nrulemaking that has exploded in the last 50 years that was not \ncontemplated in the original Administrative Procedure Act which passed \nin 1946.\n  S. 343 involves a number of major regulatory reforms. These include \ncost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, petition reopener, judicial \nreview, congressional review, peer review, and improvements to the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act.\n  S. 343 is the latest product of a long-term evolutionary process. The \nfoundation for S. 343 comes from the 97th Congress in the form, which \nwe passed at \n\n[[Page S 9635]]\nthat time 94 to 0, of S. 1080. S. 1080 was the culmination of over 20 \nyears of work in the Senate to reform the regulatory process. \nUnfortunately, that year, in the 97th Congress, the House leadership, \nthen under the control of the Democratic Party, did not believe that \nregulatory reform was needed, because they believed in the regulatory \nstate. So the House leadership neglected to follow through on that \nbill, and the bill was never considered by the other body.\n  Regulatory relief was a major issue in the congressional elections \nthis year. It was part of our Contract With America. S. 343 is part of \nthe fulfillment of the mandate that voters gave to the new leadership \nin Congress to bring about more effective and less costly rules and \nregulations.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight \nand the Courts, I began the Judiciary Committee's efforts in what has \nbecome an extensive legislative process. Beginning last February, my \nsubcommittee held hearings over 2 days and then held a markup where I \noffered a substitute, which was adopted and reported to the full \ncommittee.\n  Chairman Hatch then held another hearing before the full committee to \nconsider the issue in even more detail. After a number of delays to \naccommodate the Democratic side of the aisle, the committee held 3 days \nof markup over a period of 3 weeks, and so the committee finally \nreported the bill last April 26.\n  Since that time, Members and staff have worked extensively with those \nwho had questions or problems with the bill, even including the White \nHouse. We received, in fact, a number of very positive suggestions. And \nbecause they were positive, meant to be helpful, and it showed \ncooperation by the other side, including the administration, many of \nthese were included in the bill.\n  S. 343 deals with two overall topics directly relevant to regulatory \nreform. The first major topic is regulatory analysis, including cost-\nbenefit determinations for new and existing major rules or regulations \nof the Federal Government and, where relevant, Mr. President, risk \nassessment criteria and procedures.\n  The second major topic involves changes to the Administrative \nProcedure Act and other Federal statutes which contain equivalent \nprovisions. These changes are in the procedures that the agencies are \nrequired to follow in rulemaking and also in the standards of judicial \nreview and appeals of agency action.\n  Through these provisions, Congress will give Federal agencies new \nsubstantive and procedural guidelines on how the agencies are to use \nthe legislative powers which Congress has given them through other \nstatutes to regulate. The ultimate objective in our legislation is for \nbetter Federal rules and regulations, and by better rules, we mean, \nvery broadly speaking, rules that are to do social and economic good, \nwhere the benefit outweighs the harm.\n  A second objective is to make the rulemaking process more rational \nand more open and to give persons who are the intended beneficiaries of \nthe rule and those who are more likely to bear its costs greater \nopportunity to participate in the agency's proceedings. No one should \nreject the proposition that people who are to be affected by the \nregulations ought to have a part in the process of the agency's \nconsideration of those, and also, once that process is over, through \njudicial review, to have a means of assuring that agencies, in effect, \nobey the law. S. 343 does that.\n  These changes were designed then to supplement and to strengthen the \nregulatory analysis requirements of S. 1080, which is the core of the \nregulatory analysis that is in this new bill before us.\n  I view the overall primary focus of this bill to be accountability. \nThe essence of Government is accountability. The essence of lawmaking \nis accountability. The public holds us accountable through the regular \nelection process. The regulatory scheme of things in the administrative \nbranch of Government is somewhat removed from citizen participation, \nand the extent to which it is, I believe people who are regulators and \npeople who make the regulations and rules tend to be less accountable.\n  This bill, not as perfectly as is done through the election process \naffecting those of us in Congress, intends to bring accountability to \nthe process of the regulation and rulemaking of the faceless \nbureaucrat. This means agency accountability to the people as well as \nto Congress who has delegated its authority to the agencies. It also \nmeans congressional accountability to the people because we are \nultimately responsible for the laws that we pass. We should not punt to \nthe agencies and to the courts to make very important determinations \nthat ought to be made right here. Unfortunately, there will be those \nwho will try to misrepresent our intentions by arguing that this bill \nwill be used to gut our Nation's health, safety, and environmental \nlaws.\n  This argument, of course, is a sham, because there is not one among \nus who does not want to do everything that we reasonably can to protect \nthe lives of our people and who recognize the need for sound and \neffective regulations. We all breathe the air, eat the food, and drink \nthe water.\n  We all want our children and grandchildren to be as safe as possible. \nTo suggest otherwise, as some in this body are doing, and particularly \nas the media likes to popularize, is just downright shameful. We are \nconcerned about the lives of people. This does not compromise that \nprinciple whatsoever. What it means to do is that regulation and \nrulemaking be accountable; that people take into consideration \nalternatives; that there is not one way to do something, and that there \nought to be a relationship between cost and benefit, and there ought to \nbe a scientific basis for regulation. The fact is that many rules and \nregulations have become too rigid and costly. These rules themselves \ncould actually threaten our Nation's limited resources, as well as \npublic support for the necessary rules.\n  At a later time in this debate I am going to go into more specific \ndetail about how ridiculous and onerous many regulations have become.\n  Mr. President, Majority Leader Dole is to be commended for taking the \ninitiative on this legislation and following through on what the \nAmerican people want and expect. He is the leader of our party. Our \nparty had a mandate in the election to do that, and he is carrying that \nout in the responsibility that he has. The efforts that are being made \nin the debating of this bill, in the consideration of this bill, is to \nmake sure that our performance in office is commensurate with the \nrhetoric of the campaign. I think this bill is about as close as you \ncan get to having that be a possibility.\n  As others have said, we have to find ways to do things smarter and \ncheaper. As the committee report points out, we have become hostage to \nthe unregulated regulatory process. S. 343 will help us out of this \nquagmire by requiring sound, effective, fair, reasonable regulation \nthat will do the job the people intend that they do.\n  We have all heard today very real stories of agencies gone mad. Well, \nI want to relate one story here today where bureaucrats got out of \ncontrol. This story, and many others we will be hearing about, will \nunderscore the need for commonsense reform. This story happens in my \nState. S. 343 is about reasonableness and responsibility. The American \npeople are inspired by reasonable decisions. When the Government acts \nin the best interest of the majority of its citizens, the American \npeople are encouraged by the Government's responsible actions.\n  S. 343 is a responsible action which is in the best interest of the \nmajority of Americans. One of the main problems this bill addresses is \nunreasonable regulations and overzealous regulators.\n  This problem is clearly evident when it comes to agencies like the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. The EPA was instituted and developed \nto promote policy advancing a clean environment at reasonable costs \nwith fair and rational oversight. Fair and rational oversight, though, \nhas not been exhibited recently by the EPA. Presently, the EPA exhibits \narrogance and overzealous behavior while enforcing the agency's \nadversarial relationship with small business and farmers.\n  Innocent citizens are easy prey for presumptuous EPA bureaucrats. I \nknow this to be true because, as I have \n\n[[Page S 9636]]\nsaid, I have a constituent who has personal scars from unjustified \nhardships resulting from brash EPA officials.\n  This example happened outside a little town in the northwest corner \nof my State of Iowa. The name of that community is Akron, IA. It was \nbusiness as usual that day at the Higman Gravel Company. Harold Higman, \nthe owner, was outside topping off his pickup truck at the gas pump on \nhis property. Mavis Hansen, a trusted employee of 20 years, was inside \nthe office tending to the books, as she regularly did. Every other \nemployee was working at their normal business responsibilities that \nearly morning at 9 o'clock. You might say the morning routine had just \nbegun.\n  Suddenly, in a violent breech of the morning's routine, nearly a \ndozen unmarked cars roared onto the yard of the premise of that gravel \nbusiness. They screeched to a halt in cadence. Forty agents poured from \nthe cars and surrounded Mr. Higman, cocking their guns in unison.\n  One agent, who was clad in a bulletproof vest, leveled his shotgun at \nHigman. The agent pumped the gun once to load it. As Mr. Higman, the \nowner, gulped and his knees quivered, the agent fumbled for his badge, \nand as Mr. Higman groped for words and he voiced a demand for an \nexplanation, the agent responded with a ``shut up'' right in Mr. \nHigman's face.\n  Meanwhile, another agent stormed the office. There he found the \ntrusted employee of 20 years, the accountant, Mavis Hansen, at her desk \ntending to the books, as you would expect her to be doing at 9 o'clock \nin the morning. The agent stormed in with his gun and yelled ``freeze'' \nwith his gun cocked and left it aimed right at Mavis Hansen's head.\n  Poor Mavis Hansen sat frozen with shock, fear, and bewilderment. Now, \nMr. President, to this very day, she still has nightmares and bouts of \nnervousness due to what happened that horrible day.\n  Obviously, there must have been a reason for 40 agents to appear, \nshoving their shotguns down the throats of the owner and the bookkeeper \nof this gravel business in the small town of Akron in northwest Iowa. \nYou might wonder, was it some kind of a drug operation? Was there a \ncache of weapons? None of those, Mr. President. What the agents were \nlooking for were two so-called toxic chemicals that were allegedly \nstored at the Higman Gravel Co. grounds, supposedly buried in barrels.\n  Now, this is what they had been told. They had been told this, Mr. \nPresident, by a paid informant. But it turns out that this paid \ninformant was also a disgruntled former employee of the Higman Gravel \nCo. He had given the EPA a bum lead, and after 15 months of misery and \nordeal, a jury in a criminal case finally decided that Higman was \ninnocent. Mr. Higman and others were acquitted of charges stating that \nhe had knowingly stored illegal toxic chemicals on his property.\n  That decision and the 15 months of litigation cost Mr. Higman \n$200,000 in legal fees, lost business, and what is even more important \nin my State, Mr. President, it gave this very responsible business \nperson a damaged reputation.\n  It also cost the bookkeeper, Ms. Hansen--the woman that had the \nshotgun leveled at her as she was at her desk doing her books--two \nmonths leave of absence due to a nervous disorder, which still persists \nto this day.\n  Mr. President, the moral of this story must be prefaced with a \npoignant question: How in the world does the EPA justify such \noutrageous behavior?\n  It is the regulatory state gone out of control. They acted, as I have \nsaid, on rumor and innuendo. When the rumors did not pan out, they \npressed ahead anyway, costing innocent citizens financial and \npsychological fortunes.\n  I will not go through all of the details in this case, Mr. President. \nBut I think it behooves us as a society to take a broad view of this \ncase and see what lessons can be learned.\n  To begin with, the EPA used a force of 40 men comprised of Federal \nand local agents. They used a force equipped to attack a mountain when \nit was only a molehill.\n  Second, the EPA's advanced scouting of the situation was disgraceful. \nThey charged ahead with full force, though uninformed about the facts. \nThey did not look before they leaped.\n  All too often, Mr. President, I hear of such overzealous and heavy-\nhanded enforcement of our Nation's environmental laws. Yet, there is \nrarely accountability. This situation cannot continue. A presumption of \nguilt is formed. It is a foreign concept in our land. It should be a \nforeign practice as well.\n  The purpose of the EPA is certainly commendable. The purpose is to \nprotect the Nation from environmental pollutants and toxins. The EPA is \nsuppose to work to make our water clean and our air pure, and there is \nno one who would argue with those worthwhile goals. But the heavy-\nhanded tactics are inconsistent with EPA's worthy objectives. In fact, \nsuch policy erodes whatever moral authority the EPA may hope to have to \ndetect and deter pollution and polluters. Their image in the public's \neye will only suffer and the public's confidence in the EPA's fairness \nwill be shaken.\n  We certainly hope, Mr. President, that this reform will cause the EPA \nto reconsider its we-versus-they mentality, with respect to American \nsmall business. This bill will not overturn existing environmental law. \nThe Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act will require the EPA to \nreexamine existing rules and force them into revisions, but only, let \nme emphasize, where regulations are based on bad science or where a \nless costly alternative exists that achieves the statutory \nrequirements. Small businesses certainly share the goal of a clean \nenvironment at reasonable costs, with a fair and rational oversight by \nthe U.S. Government. Most, if not all, businesses want to comply with \nenvironmental laws and regulations.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that this reform will change the EPA \npolicy to promote a worthy social objective that fosters reconciliation \nand cooperation. This reform will help eliminate the heavy-handed \ntactics and threats against innocent citizens like Mr. Higman and Ms. \nHansen. Through this reform the EPA could once again return to its \noriginal purpose of promoting policy which advances a clean environment \nthrough fair and rational oversight.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to use this time to remark briefly \non the pending measure, which will be the subject of a vigorous debate \nover the next several days, and the focus of our work today and in the \ndays to follow.\n  The primary subject of this debate is the bill that was reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee in a very controversial markup which was later \nmodified through negotiations with Senator Johnston and other \ncolleagues.\n  I am grateful for the attention that Members have given the bill \nsince it was reported by the Judiciary Committee, for I believe, over \ntime, real improvements have already been made.\n  Nevertheless, throughout these negotiations, these clear differences \nhave emerged among those who advocated changes in the way Federal \nagencies issue regulations. It has become apparent that a new, more \nreasonable and judicious approach is needed if we are to enact \nresponsible, regulatory reform, without causing gridlock in the Federal \nagencies.\n  There remain a number of problems with S. 343 which argue against \nadoption in its current form. First, its passage will likely result in \na more convoluted, bureaucratic, and confusing system that practically \ninvites manipulation and litigation by the best lawyers money can buy. \nIt would allow, and even encourage, appeals and litigation throughout \nthe regulatory development process.\n  The multifaceted petition process will create massive burdens on \nFederal agencies at a time when we are attempting to cut budgets and \nlimit the size of Government.\n  The bill's $50 million threshold will drag hundreds of additional \nrules into this process, further burdening agencies. It also forces \nFederal agencies to choose the cheapest option, even if other \nalternatives are more cost effective and therefore more economical.\n  In sum, it would impose costs on Federal agencies that cannot be met \nunder current budget constraints. The Office of Management and Budget \nestimates that S. 343 would cost Federal agencies an additional $1.3 \nbillion and 4,500 full time employees each year simply to implement all \nits provisions. The Federal Government simply does not have \n\n[[Page S 9637]]\nthe resources to absorb those requirements. Nor should it.\n  In addition to overburdening Federal agencies, S. 343, as currently \nwritten, would roll back some of the most important laws that protect \nour environment, our health, and our safety.\n  For the first time in my lifetime, we are contemplating a \ncomprehensive retreat from the progress achieved in reducing air \npollution, in cleaning up our rivers and lakes, in taking steps to \nensure that the food we eat and the water we drink is safe and clean. \nIn the past, this effort has been embraced by leaders Republican and \nDemocratic. Whether it was President Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, \nor President Clinton, this Nation has realized great benefits from an \nextraordinary bipartisan commitment on these matters.\n  Mr. President, last year 2-year-old Cullen Mack of my home State of \nSouth Dakota fell ill from eating beef contaminated with the E. coli \nbacteria. As a result of experiences like Cullen's, I held a number of \nhearings in the Agriculture Committee and the Department of Agriculture \ndeveloped regulations which would help prevent recurrences of this \nproblem. The rules would modernize the meat inspection process, using \nsensitive scientific techniques to detect contamination and prevent \nspoiled meat from making its way into our food supply.\n  This much-awaited rule will be held up by this bill. It will be \ndelayed and perhaps even stopped. That is unacceptable and represents \none of the problems with this bill in its current form.\n  In its attempt to reform the regulatory process, the bill \noverreaches--I believe, to the long-term detriment to the American \npeople, including businesses. In South Dakota as in many other States, \nnot only will the public benefit from tough new meat inspection rules, \nbut so will the farmers and ranchers who raise the livestock and who \nbenefit from the assurance that their products will reach the market in \nthe best condition possible. The Senate should not support a process \nthat would compromise that objective.\n  I want to make clear that I'm not suggesting that somehow the \nproponents of S. 343 are advocating the degradation of our environment, \nor have set out to contaminate our drinking water, or that they are \nunconcerned with a child's potential exposure to toxins. But passage of \nthis bill will make those results more likely. And that is not a result \nthat I can endorse.\n  I know that some of my colleagues will be taking the floor to make \nthat case in detail, and to offer amendments which will attempt to \nameliorate the most harmful provisions of the bill. And I know that \nsome of my democratic colleagues have signed onto S. 343.\n  I also want to make it clear that there is a better alternative and \nthat a number of amendments will be offered which will improve the bill \nand which I hope all Members will give their serious consideration.\n  The comprehensive alternative will produce commonsense reform without \nwholesale harm. I am hopeful that after some healthy debate on this \nmatter, and in light of the amendment process that will begin today, my \ncolleagues can be persuaded to support our amendments and the \nalternative developed by Senators Glenn and Chafee, should it be \noffered. That is the best, most defensible path to regulatory reform, \nbecause it does not sacrifice the environmental, health, and safety \nstandards that American families have a right to expect and demand from \ntheir Government.\n  Mr. President, I can state with some confidence that no Member of \nthis body will argue for a regulatory status quo. No Member of this \nbody believes that every Federal rule is sacred. No Member will defend \nevery law we've passed as perfect in its real-world application. There \nare too many regulations in general, and, in particular, too many that \nmake no sense.\n  It is my strong hope that during this debate, we can come to \nagreement on a bipartisan regulatory reform bill that achieves serious, \nmeaningful change, but does so recognizing the budgetary realities \nfacing the Federal Government, recognizing the desire to prevent \nunnecessary and expensive litigation, and recognizing the fundamental \nimportance of ensuring that Federal agencies should be able to issue \nthose commonsense regulations which protect public health and safety, \nthe environment, and other matters that most of us agree should be the \nsubject of responsible Federal oversight.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/10/senate-section/article/S9628-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

A bill to provide for the liquidation or reliquidation of \ncertain entries of pharmaceutical grade phospholipids; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n      legislation correcting the reclassification of phospholipids\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, today I once again offer legislation to \ncorrect an obviously unintended and mistaken reclassification of \npharmaceutical-grade, FDA-approved egg yolk phospholipid by HTS, the \nHarmonized Tariff Classification System. Another provision of this \nlegislation has been accomplished in the Uruguay round GATT agreement.\n  Kabi Pharmacia is a U.S. company in Clayton, NC. Kabi has become a \nleading employer in rural Johnston County; it has 175 employees engaged \nin high-technology manufacturing and research work. The main product \nmanufactured by Kabi Pharmacia in Clayton is intralipid, a unique \nintravenous feeding solution. Kabi must import a key, unique intralipid \ningredient--pharmaceutical-grade, FDA-approved egg yolk phospholipid, \nbecause it is made only by Kabi's parent company in Sweden.\n  The duty on Kabi's phospholipid was set at 1.5 percent in the 1970's \nwhen Kabi began operations in Clayton. Beginning in March 1991, the \nunintentional HTS reclassification of the phospholipid more than \ntripled this duty, a situation that could not be corrected in the GATT \nagreement because it is a matter of U.S. law--which, of course, only \nCongress can change.\n  Mr. President, my legislation would return the rate on the \nphospholipid to 1.5 percent for the period from March 29, 1991, until \nJanuary 1, 1995, when the duty for Kabi's phospholipid and other \npharmaceutical components and products became zero under the GATT \nagreement, and refund the unintended duty increase. The amount of the \nunintended duty increase is $396,779.16.\n  Mr. President, there has been no disagreement that the duty increase \non Kabi's phospholipid was unintended and unwarranted. Simple fairness \nemphasizes the need for the legislation I offer today. The correction \nof the erroneous HTS reclassification must be retroactive in order that \nthere can be an equitable redress. It is a matter of simple fairness \nand equity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation (S. 1015) \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1015\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE PHOSPHOLIPIDS.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 514 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 \n     U.S.C. 1514) or any other provision of law, upon proper \n     request filed with the Customs Service not later than 90 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, any entry, or \n     withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, of pharmaceutical \n     grade phospholipids that--\n       (1) was made under subheading 2923.20.00 of the Harmonized \n     Tariff Schedule of the United States;\n       (2) with respect to which a lower rate of duty would have \n     applied if such entry or withdrawal had been made under \n     subheading 2923.20.10 or 2923.20.20 of such Schedule; and\n       (3) was made after March 29, 1991, and before January 1, \n     1995;\n\n     shall be liquidated or reliquidated as if such lower rate of \n     duty applied to such entry or withdrawal.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1016. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with the appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for the vessel Magic Carpet; to the \nCommittee on \n\n[[Page S 9639]]\nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                      jones act waiver legislation\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, in introducing a bill \nto allow the vessel Magic Carpet to be employed in coastwise trade of \nthe United States. This boat has a relatively small passenger capacity, \ncarrying up to 6 passengers on a charter business based out of Martha's \nVineyard, MA. The purpose of this bill is to waive those sections of \nthe Jones Act which prohibit foreign-made vessels from operating in \ncoastwise trade. The waiver is necessary because, under the law, a \nvessel is considered foreign-made unless all major components of its \nhull and superstructure are fabricated in the United States and the \nvessel is assembled entirely in the United States. This vessel was \noriginally built in a foreign shipyard in 1959, but since then has been \nowned and operated by American citizens. The owners of Magic Carpet \nhave invested substantially more than the cost of building the boat in \nmaking repairs to it and maintaining it--in American shipyards with \nAmerican products. This particular vessel is also of some historical \nvalue--Magic Carpet is a classic wooden yawl--few of these vessels \nstill exist today and very few operate along the east coast. The owners \nwish to start a small business, a charter boat operation, seasonally \ntaking people out of Martha's Vineyard.\n  After reviewing the facts in the case of the Magic Carpet, I find \nthat this waiver does not compromise our national readiness in times of \nnational emergency, which is the fundamental purpose of the Jones Act \nrequirement. While I generally support the provisions of the Jones Act, \nI believe the specific facts in this case warrant a waiver to permit \nthe Magic Carpet to engage in coastwise trade. I hope and trust the \nSenate will agree and will speedily approve the bill being introduced \ntoday.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1017.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, in introducing a bill \nto allow the vessel Chrissy to be employed in coastwise trade of the \nUnited States. This boat has a relatively small passenger capacity, \ncarrying up to 6 passengers on a charter business based out of \nGloucester, Massachusetts. Chrissy is a historical vessel, built in \n1912 in Friendship, Maine and is one of the last remaining Friendship \nsloops. The purpose of this bill is to waive those sections of the \nJones Act which prohibit vessels from operating in coastwise trade \nwithout proper documentation of its chain of ownership. The vessel was \nbuilt 83 years ago in Maine, but along the way the documentation has \nbeen lost. It is my hope that a document will be issued which will \nallow the owner to start a small business, a charter boat operation, \nseasonally taking people out of Gloucester.\n  I hope and trust the Senate will agree and will speedily approve the \nbill being introduced today.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS:\n  S. 1018. A bill for the relief of Clarence P. Stewart; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                   the clarence p. stewart relief act\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, today I offer a private bill to direct the \nSecretary of Agriculture to right a wrong committed against a dedicated \npublic servant.\n  Clarence P. Stewart of Lillington, NC, served 23 years with the \nAgricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service [ASCS] at the \nDepartment of Agriculture. In April 1981, Mr. Stewart was North \nCarolina State Executive Director when, during the transition to a new \nadministration, the ASCS decided to remove all State Executive \nDirectors as part of an what the Department described as a reduction-\nin-force [RIF].\n  Mr. Stewart considered appealing the ASCS decision but was told by \nhis superior at the ASCS not to bother, that he had no right to appeal \nthe dismissal action. Unfortunately, Mr. Stewart accepted this \ninformation at face value and did not appeal the ASCS decision.\n  Mr. President, years later, Mr. Stewart learned that, as a veteran, \nhe did in fact have a right to appeal his dismissal from the ASCS. He \nalso learned that 24 other State Executive Directors who had been \ndismissed at the same time as Stewart had appealed their dismissals to \nthe Merit Systems Protections Board and they had won. In this appeal, \nknown as the Blalock case, the Merit\n Systems Protection Board found that the State Directors had in fact \nbeen removed for cause rather than separated pursuant to RIF and as a \nresult could be removed only if they were given advance notice and an \nopportunity to reply. The Merit Systems Protection Board ordered the \nDepartment of Agriculture to reinstate, retroactively, the appellants \nto their positions.\n\n  Although none of the appellants actually returned to work, the \nDepartment of Agriculture, as part of a settlement agreement, gave each \nappellant 1 year and 10 months salary and recomputed retirement \nbenefits based on this increased salary.\n  Once Mr. Stewart learned of the Blalock decision he filed an appeal \nwith the Merit Systems Protection Board. Because his appeal was filed \nlate, the MSPB dismissed Mr. Stewart's appeal. He then filed a petition \nfor review with the MSPB, but that too was denied. Mr. Stewart, \ntherefore, has exhausted all possible avenues of administrative review.\n  Mr. Stewart is a North Carolina citizen who gave years of faithful \nservice to his State and country. He was wrongfully removed from his \njob as North Carolina State Director of the Agricultural Stabilization \nand Conservation Service. At the time, he was told he had no right to \nappeal the dismissal when, as a decorated veteran who served his \ncountry valiantly in World War II, he had a very real right to appeal. \nMr. President, I doubt that any of our colleagues believe that this \ngood man should be punished for having taken the word of his superior.\n  But for his superior's mistake, Mr. Stewart would have filed a timely \nappeal and would have prevailed just as the other 24 appellants did in \nthe Blalock case. Mr. President, I do hope that in the interest of \nequity Mr. Stewart will receive the same benefits that were afforded \nthe other State Directors.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 1019. A bill to direct the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to \nexamine the impacts of whirling disease, and other parasites and \npathogens, on trout in the Madison River, MT, and similar natural \nhabitats, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                 whirling disease response act of 1995\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in ``A River Runs Through It,'' Norman \nMaclean wrote, ``in our family, there was no clear line between \nreligion and flyfishing.''\n  These words sum up the way we Montanans feel about our blue ribbon \ntrout streams. Great flyfishermen--men like Bud Lily and Dan Bailey--\nare legends in Montana. And Montana rivers--the Madison, Yellowstone, \nMissouri, Bighorn, and Bighole--are the heart and soul of our State. We \nmark our calendars and plan our weekends around caddis and stone fly \nhatches or peak grasshopper season. These outstanding trout streams are \nin large part what makes Montana ``the last best place.''\n  But these rivers hold more that recreational value for Montanans. \nFishing is big business. It is the engine that drives the economies of \nmany communities throughout Montana. In fact, the net economic value of \nfishing in Montana is estimated to be nearly $300 million a year.\n  The discovery of whirling disease on the Madison River in late 1994 \nputs Montana's wild trout fishery at great risk. Whirling disease is a \nparasite that attacks the cartilage of young trout, particularly \nrainbow trout. Its impact has been devastating to rainbow trout \npopulations on the Madison River, where whirling disease has caused a \n90-percent decline in the last 3 years.\n  Whirling disease has also been detected in four other Montana river \ndrainages as well as in Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, California, Colorado, \nWyoming, and Utah.\n\n[[Page S 9640]]\n\n  Montana has taken the challenge of fighting whirling disease head on. \nFlyfishermen, scientists, State and Federal officials have joined \ntogether to learn more about this disease and find solutions. Today, I \nam introducing legislation that will better equip concerned Montanans \nto effectively deal with whirling disease and minimize its impacts to \nour world class wild trout fisheries.\n  The Whirling Disease Response Act of 1995 focuses on three \nobjectives: coordination, containment, and research.\n  First, the Whirling Disease Response Act coordinates all existing \ndata and research conducted to date on whirling disease. The act \nrequires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to compile, within 180 \ndays, a report that summarizes all efforts to date with respect to \nwhirling disease, to identify gaps in the available scientific \ninformation, and to make recommendations as to how the Federal \nGovernment can be a more effective partner to States confronted with \nwhirling disease.\n  Second, the act requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife to modify the \nEnnis Fish Hatchery so that it is a complete containment facility. This \nhatchery is critically important to wild trout research as well as to \nmaintaining healthy trout fisheries throughout the United States. The \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must make sure that this hatchery is not \ninfected with whirling disease or any other water borne parasite.\n  Third, and most important, this act requires the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service to significantly increase its role in whirling disease \nresearch. As debilitating as this disease is, relatively little is \nknown about how to stop its spread. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nmust make the fight against whirling disease a top priority. They must \nwork with affected States, universities, and sportsmen toward a \nsolution on whirling disease. This act makes whirling disease research \na priority for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  While Montana has a significant stake in fighting whirling disease, \nit is not alone--19 other States are impacted by whirling disease. It \nis in America's best interest that we work aggressively to minimize the \nimpact whirling disease has on our trout fisheries. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues from other affected States to see that we \nmake headway in minimizing the impact whirling disease has on America's \nblue ribbon trout streams.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S.J. Res. 37. A joint resolution disapproving the extension of \nnondiscriminatory treatment--most-favored-nation treatment--to the \nproducts of the People's Republic of China; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n          disapproval of most-favored-nation status for china\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President in 1974 Congress passed the Jackson-Vanik \namendment to the 1974 Omnibus Trade Act establishing a linkage between \nhuman rights and most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status for nonmarket \neconomies. The legislation was largely responsible, in my view, for the \nfantastic success of United States efforts to secure the freedom of \nmovement for over 1 million Jews and other persecuted minorities from \nthe Soviet Union.\n  Since 1989, when the Chinese military brutally gunned down hundreds \nof protectors in Tianmen Square and cracked down on the blossoming \ndissident movement in China, there have been efforts to link Chinese \nMFN to human rights improvements.\n  In 1991, legislation to set conditions for the extension of MFN to \nChina was passed by overwhelming majorities in both the House and the \nSenate, only to be vetoed by President Bush. The House overrode the \nveto, but the Senate sustained it by a mere one vote. In 1992 Congress \nagain passed bills to revoke MFN status for products manufactured by \nChinese state-owned companies. President Bush vetoed that as well, and \nonce again the Senate sustained the veto.\n  When President Clinton came to office in 1993, he issued an Executive \norder specifying seven areas in which the Chinese would need to make \n``significant progress'' if MFN were to be extended in 1994. I was one \nof those who strongly condemned the action of the administration when \nit abandoned this position in 1994, because I believe it undermined the \nPresident's own credibility on human rights, and relegated U.S. human \nrights advocacy from a policy with teeth to one of rhetoric and \nsymbolism. For the same reasons, I am disappointed that despite a year \nin which freedoms further diminished in China, President Clinton \nannounced on June 2 that he would seek to extend MFN status to China \nagain this year.\n  I am most outraged, though, Mr. President, that the United States \nwould even consider extending MFN to China at precisely the moment that \nthe Chinese have arrested a prominent human rights activist and \nAmerican citizen, Mr. Henry Wu, and threatened to try him for espionage \nand subject him to the death penalty. This is yet another disgraceful \nmark on China's human rights record, and will hopefully compel us to \nrespond finally with the toughest human rights policy possible.\n  Mr. President, that is why I am introducing today a joint resolution \nof disapproval, consistent with the Jackson-Vanik amendment of 1974, of \nthe extension of nondiscriminatory treatment to products of the \nPeople's Republic of China.\n  There is no evidence, Mr. President, that the granting of \nunconditional MFN status to China--an element of a so-called policy of \n``constructive engagement''--has improved China's human rights behavior \nat all. Both Assistant Secretary of State for Asia and Pacific Affairs \nWinston Lord and Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and \nHumanitarian Affairs John Shattuck have said publicly that the human \nrights situation has not improved in China. The State Department's own \n1994 report acknowledges that ``In 1994, there continued to be \nwidespread and well-documented human rights abuses in China.'' From the \nevents of the last 6 months, in fact, one can only conclude that the \nsituation has worsened--even with MFN and robust trade.\n  The Chinese Government continues to exercise significant control on \nopposition and dissent; to abuse systematically is prisoners, including \nthe use of slave labor and the alleged organ transplant of executed \nprisoners; and to impose harsh regulations in Tibet, while refusing to \nengage in any dialog with Nobel Peace prize laureate the Dalai Lama.\n  In the last 2 months alone, several prominent intellectuals have been \ndetained while their homes have been searched simply for signing \npetitions in support of more political openness. More have been taken \ninto custody and interrogated about their activities. Some have been \nquestioned, released, and then sent away from Beijing, while others \nhave just disappeared, including China's most prominent dissident, Wei \nJeisheing, whose whereabouts since February are unknown, except to the \nextent that he is confirmed to be in police custody. Two weeks ago, \nChen Ziming, another well-known prodemocracy activist, was suddenly \nreimprisoned after being released on a medical parole last year.\n  Stricter security laws have been adopted by the Politburo, and \nBeijing seems intent on limiting access of Chinese citizens to the tens \nof thousands of international nongovernmental organizations that will \nbe in China this September for the U.N. Fourth World Conference on \nWomen.\n  As the leader of the free world, the United States has the \nresponsibility to work to protect human rights worldwide. The most \nrecent action of the Chinese Government against an American citizen \nmakes it a personal issue for many us.\n  On June 19 Mr. Harry Wu entered northwest China, with a legal Chinese \nvisa and with a valid United States passport, and was immediately \ndetained by Chinese officials. For several days, China refused to \nconfirm that it was in fact holding an American citizen, and in effect \ndenied United States officials the access to our citizens that is \nsupposedly protected under a United States-China Consular Convention. A \nU.S. diplomat was even sent on a wild goose chase throughout the \nnorthwest provinces earlier this month in search of Mr. Wu.\n  The announcement this weekend that Mr. Wu is going to be tried as a \nspy and potentially subject to the death penalty is the one of\n the most egregious \n\n[[Page S 9641]]\nviolations I can think of. After spending 19 years in Chinese prison \ncamps, and then seeking refuge in the United States, Mr. Wu has been \nactively researching the abuse of Chinese prisoners, including the \ntrade of human body parts from executed prisoners to party officials. \nHe has produced a film which was aired on the British Broadcasting \nCorp., published articles on the subject, and testified before \ncongressional committees. He has publicized what can happen when the \nState has the will and instruments to take these actions, and has \nfought to halt this gruesome practice in China.\n\n  Mr. President, no one can possibly be deceived into thinking that Mr. \nWu was arrested by Chinese officials for any other reason except to \nsilence him. He is being threatened with death for uncovering horrid \nhuman rights abuses in China. The U.S. and international reactions must \nbe anything but muted or conciliatory.\n  Earlier this year, the administration was willing to play hardball \nwith trade when it came to Chinese piracy of software, and threatened \nto impose $1 billion worth of sanctions against products of specific \nstate-owned industries. The threat worked, and the United States \nachieved its goals. I would entreat the administration to address the \nplight of a human being just as seriously.\n  My joint resolution is intended to send the message that we cannot \nhave business as usual with China when human rights advocates, such as \nHarry Wu, are under the threat of death. In my view, MFN should not \nhave been extended to China this year at all given its human rights \nrecord, but now, especially, we cannot offer conciliations of this \nkind.\n  China's human rights record is deteriorating, despite MFN, and there \nis little, if no, evidence that economic engagement is improving the \nhuman rights situation in China, as was earlier promised. Though \nChina's economy is expanding brilliantly, political change is not \ncoming: in fact, the Chinese Government appears to be doing everything \nwithin its power to ensure that economic development does not bring \npolitical liberalization. If anything, the Chinese need MFN to continue \nthe trade and investment on which its economic development depends. For \nthis reason, we must use MFN as a lever to protect human rights in \nChina, and an American human rights crusader who is facing death.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 37\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     Congress does not approve the extension of the authority \n     contained in section 402(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 \n     recommended by the President to the Congress on June 2, 1995, \n     with respect to the People's Republic of China.\n

Mr. President, now that the Special Olympics World \nGames have come to a close, I rise to again thank those who made this \nremarkable event possible. As my colleagues know, these games were held \nJuly 1-9 in New Haven, CT. This tremendous competition brought the \nworld to Connecticut, and I want to take this opportunity to \nacknowledge some of the individuals who made it possible.\n  Were it not for the dreams and vision of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the \nSpecial Olympics would not exist. This outstanding organization has \nflourished since she launched it, and it has left an extraordinary mark \non the athletes, their families, their coaches and friends. I applaud \nEunice, her husband, Sarge Shriver, and all the members of their family \nwho have given so much to the Special Olympics throughout the years.\n  In New Haven, we were fortunate to have a member of the Shriver \nfamily at the helm of the 1995 World Games. I congratulate Tim Shriver \non a job well done. The success of these games is due in large part to \nhis hard work, dedication and leadership. I know Tim would agree, \nhowever, that this great success would not have been possible without \nthe help and support of Chairman Lowell Weicker, the Special Olympics \nstaff, the hundreds of volunteers and the cooperation and support of \nthe New Haven community. I thank Mayor \n\n[[Page S 9643]]\nJohn Destefano and all the residents of New Haven for contributing in \nso many ways to this important event.\n  Cities and towns across Connecticut were fortunate to serve as host \ncommunities for delegations from each of the participating countries. \nThis host program enabled families throughout the state to open their \nhomes and their hearts to our visitors from abroad. This program proved \ninvaluable for the hosts and the guests as cultures were commingled, \ntraditions were shared and lifelong friendships were forged. I thank \neach of the communities and families that offered their hospitality to \nthe world.\n  As with any event of this scale, the Special Olympics required \nsignificant financial support. I am proud to commend the many companies \nin Connecticut and throughout the country that donated hours of work \nand millions of dollars as corporate sponsors of these World Games.\n  Most importantly though, I want to recognize the athletes who \ncompeted in the Special Olympics. That is what these games are all \nabout. From bowling to bocce, soccer to tennis, aquatics to equestrian \nsports, athletes from across the world came together to demonstrate \ntheir strength, dedication and skill. The athletic abilities of these \nindividuals are tremendous, and their ability to overcome obstacles to \nmake it to New Haven is even more awesome.\n  Indeed it is inspiring to see what each of these individuals has \naccomplished. It is the athletes, friends, families and the coaches who \ndedicated themselves to this competition who deserve our highest \ncommendation. Their enthusiasm and spirit was infectious, and we \nsincerely thank them for sharing their talent with us during these \nOlympic Games.\n  All the athletes came together during the opening ceremonies, one of \nthe most memorable parts of these games. I will always remember the \nproud contingents of athletes from throughout the world entering the \nYale Bowl to open the Olympics. They were greeted by the President of \nthe United States and leaders of countries from El Salvador to Botswana \nand beyond. This spectacular event signaled the start of the World \nGames and kicked off a week of serious athletic competition and fun.\n  The opening ceremonies also launched a week-long demonstration of the \nability of the human spirit to soar. There are members of every \ncommunity who live each day with mental retardation and disabilities. \nWe stopped this week to hear them say: ``Watch us. We can do great \nthings.

Mr. President, one of the most frequent questions \nasked during the debate over the budget resolution was why, in the face \nof large deficits, were Republicans insisting on tax cuts. The answer \nis simple: Tax cuts work. By allowing Americans to keep more of what \nthey earn, tax cuts encourage economic growth, job creation, and an \nincrease--not decrease--in revenues to the U.S. Treasury.\n  Following the Reagan tax cuts in 1981, we witnessed one of the \nlongest economic expansions in the history of the United States. Over \n20 million new jobs were created while revenues to the Treasury \nincreased dramatically. Just as importantly, the benefits of the Reagan \ntax cuts were felt by Americans from all income classes--rich and poor.\n  Tax cuts enacted this year could achieve similar results. I am \nincluding a short article by Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr. which makes an \neloquent case for reducing the burden on the American taxpayer. As Mr. \nForbes makes clear, Republicans can, and should, cut taxes and balance \nthe budget at the same time.\n\n                            Fact and Comment\n\n\n                   memo to the gop: the 1980's worked\n\n                       (By Malcolm S. Forbes Jr.)\n\n       Republicans have accepted the notion that the 1980s were a \n     big fiscal mistake, that Ronald Reagan was wrong to insist on \n     tax cuts even in the face of congressional resistance to \n     reducing spending.\n       Republicans are now in effect saying that no budget cuts \n     mean no tax cuts. The GOP has it backwards. Properly \n     structured tax reductions would trigger a robust economic \n     expansion, as they did in the 1980s. They should be the \n     center on which budget cuts are structured. Voters would thus \n     see the GOP as the party of opportunity and growth, not as \n     the party of austerity. Growth would also expand government \n     revenues.\n       Reagan's much-criticized tax cuts were the principal \n     catalyst of our longest peacetime expansion. Federal income \n     tax receipts grew mightily. Even more impressive was the \n     extraordinary surge in revenues of state and local \n     governments. The federal deficits of the 1980s resulted from \n     our unprecedented peacetime military buildup--which finally \n     won the 40-year Cold War for us--and, more important, from \n     Congress' inability to say no to domestic spending \n     constituencies. If Republicans combine Reagan's pro-growth \n     tax approach with their antispending proclivities, they will \n     get credit for reviving the economy and curbing government.\n       Why should Republicans buy their opponents' bum raps about \n     what actually happened when Reagan ruled?\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/10/senate-section/article/S9643-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        CASSANDRA JONES SELECTED AS EAST-WEST SOCCER AMBASSADOR\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today, I would like to commend a \nvery special young Tennessean for her selection as an East-West Soccer \nAmbassador, an all-star team of American youth soccer players ages 12 \nto 19. At 12 years of age, Cassandra Jones of Soddy Daisy is 1 of 15 \nnationally recruited players selected for this all-star team, and one \nof the youngest national stars to ever compete in this international \nprogram.\n  Cassie Jones was selected for the team based on her current soccer \ntalent, her potential, and her ability to compete at the international \nyouth soccer level. The program, originally founded in 1982, is a non-\nprofit, national soccer club that has earned a national reputation as \nAmerica's leader in athletic diplomacy and well-rounded play \ndevelopment.\n  A straight-A student at Soddy Daisy Middle School, Cassie's \nexcellence on the soccer field is matched by her drive and \ndetermination in the classroom, as well as her interest in other \nextracurricular activities. In addition to soccer, she is involved in \nband activities, and enjoys reading and playing softball.\n  This month, Cassie and her Ambassador teammates will travel to \nnorthern Europe to represent the United States in a 2-week soccer tour \nof Scandinavia. Following a high-intensity training session in Denmark, \nthe East-West Ambassadors will compete in the prestigious Gothia Cup \ntournament in Gothenburg, Sweden. The Gothia Cup pits more than 900 \nteams from 50 countries in its competition. From there, Cassie will \nreturn to Denmark for another major tournament, the Dana Cup in \nHjorring.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to wish Cassie \nJones the best of luck as she enters her first international \ncompetition and embarks on what could be a very promising soccer \ncareer. I am confident she will represent the State of Tennessee and \nthe United States well, and I look forward to hearing more about her \nachievements, both on and off the soccer field, in the future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/10/senate-section/article/S9643-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JULY 11, 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, in 1969 the Cuyahoga River in Ohio caught \nfire. I repeat, the Cuyahoga River caught fire. This river was so \npolluted that it actually started burning.\n  As a result of this, Members of Congress and the President decided it \nwas time we did something about the rivers and streams in this country. \nFollowing that fire, that is a river catching fire, the Clean Water Act \nwas passed. It has been 25-plus years since that river burned. Since \nthat time, there has been a reversal of how the rivers and streams \nwere. Then, 80 percent of the rivers and streams were polluted. Now, \nabout 20 percent of the rivers and streams are polluted. We have made a \nlot of progress with the Clean Water Act, and that is the subject of \nthis discussion tonight.\n  We have heard a lot of talk lately about regulatory reform, and I \nthink it is important, because there is no area in the Federal \nGovernment--and as far as that goes, State government--that causes \npeople as much concern as regulations. They have not only had the laws \nto deal with, but in recent years the laws propound regulations and the \nregulations propound all kinds of business decisions that people have \nto make.\n  It used to be that when we passed a law, or a State government passed \na law, the laws could, in effect, be administered differently. If a \nbureaucrat wanted to administer the law in one part of the country in \none way and in another part of the country in another way because of \nthe climatic conditions, or whatever other variances there may be, he \nwas able to do that. But the courts have said that is not permissible, \nthat there must be, when a law is passed, rules promulgated so that law \nis enforced the same for everyone.\n  That has caused a lot of problems. We have heard, in recent days \nduring the debate on this issue, a great deal about the pros and cons, \nfor example, about threshold limits; that is, what dollar value should \nbe in effect before a regulation is treated one way as compared to if \nit is under that threshold amount, should it be treated a different \nway. We have been barraged by declarations about rolling back existing \nrules, and this has caused areas of disagreement.\n  Within the framework of this debate, I have tried to find a \ncommonsense approach to how we should approach this most important area \nof the law, namely regulation reform. All too often, in issues such as \nthis, it seems that common sense becomes clouded with political \nagendas, Presidential campaigns, congressional campaigns; obscured, \nperhaps, by various ideologies and smothered in the shouting from the \nright and the left. Common sense requires a balance, I think, in \nreform; a look at what is reasonable and then legislation that does not \nharm the whole to benefit just a few.\n  I do not know any Members of this body who would refuse small \nbusinesses the opportunity to grow and prosper. I know I feel that way \nbecause most of the jobs in this country are created by small \nbusinesses, not the General Motors, not the Lockheeds, not the \nAerojets, but, rather, small businesses--mom and pop stores. In fact, \nsmall businesses produce about 85 percent of the jobs in the United \nStates. So we must be responsive to how small business performs in our \ncountry. The better they perform, the more jobs are available, the \nbetter our country performs.\n  I have consistently been an advocate and have encouraged the \nstimulation of small businesses. They assume the risks of the \nmarketplace and, as I have already indicated, are the backbone of our \neconomy. But the profit of the business community should not come at \nthe expense of clean air, clean water, and clean food. We cannot \napproach all problems with a dollar figure as the principal \ndetermination in the cost-benefit analysis.\n  Mr. President, as with all of us, we have recently returned from our \nStates. Recently being in Nevada, and having had a number of town hall \nmeetings, I heard from many people expressing concern about a rolling \nback of regulations that put certain areas that they were concerned \nabout at risk, especially the environment. They were concerned also \nabout the cleanliness of food and, of course, the safety of workers. In \nfact, a recent poll in Nevada is very illuminating, as to how people in \nNevada feel. Nevadans do not believe they are overregulated in the \nareas of health and the environment. In fact, when you ask the people \nof the State of Nevada, ``Do you think that laws and regulations \nrelating to clean water are not strict enough? About right? Or too \nstrict?'' here is how the people of Nevada feel. Mr. President, 49 \npercent of the people in Nevada say that the clean water laws and \nregulations are not strict enough; 34 percent feel they are about \nright. Mr. President, that is about 85 percent of the people in Nevada \nwho feel that the clean water regulations are either just right or not \nstrong enough. Only 11 percent of the people feel that they are too \nstrict.\n  Clean air--again, 44 percent feel that the clean air regulations are \nnot strict enough. Remember, the State of Nevada has Las Vegas, it has \nReno, and then the vast majority of the State, areawise, is rural in \nnature. This takes into consideration the views of rural Nevadans. \nNevadans said that clean air rules and regulations and laws are not \nstrict enough, to the tune of 44 percent.\n Twenty-five percent said they are about right.\n  Mr. President, with the environment, when you ask the question \nbroadly, ``Do you feel the laws relating to the environment are not \nstrict enough, too strict, or about right?''--39 percent said they are \nnot strict enough; 29 percent said they are just right.\n  Food safety: 43 percent of the people of Nevada said they are not \nstrict enough, 43 percent said they are about right, and only 8 percent \nsaid that food safety regulations are too strict.\n  Workplace safety: Again, the same situation, not strict enough, and \nabout right. Those figures come to about 65 percent.\n  The people of Nevada are very concerned about food, water, air, and \nthe environment generally.\n  It is interesting, people in Nevada were asked the question--that is, \npeople over age 60--``Would you be less likely to vote for someone that \ntampered with Medicare or less likely to vote for someone that messed \nwith the environmental laws?'' Seniors, people over 60 years of age, \nsaid, ``We would be less likely to vote for someone that tried to \nweaken environmental laws.''\n  So I do not think Nevada is unusual. I do not know statistically how \nother States feel other than what I read in the Washington Post \nnewspaper yesterday, where a writer said that a recent Times-Mirror \nsurvey shows that although a large majority of respondents want most \ntypes of regulations rolled back, they make an exception for \nconservation rules. Seventy-eight percent said that Government should \ndo whatever it takes to protect the environment. So it sounds to me, \nMr. President, that nationwide the people feel the same as they do in \nNevada.\n  I am not advocating the existence of any program, rule, or regulation \nthat does not serve the public good. That would not serve anyone's \npurpose. In fact, it hinders more than it helps.\n  But I would like to look at what Senator John Glenn said when S. 343 \nwas introduced. Senator Glenn, who is the \n\n[[Page S 9645]]\nranking member of the Government Operations Committee, who has worked \non this bill in this area of the law a significant amount, said:\n\n       Any bill on the subject of regulatory reform to be \n     deserving of support must pass the test that is twofold: \n     Number one, does the bill support the reasonable, logical, \n     appropriate changes to regulatory procedures that eliminate \n     unnecessary burdens on businesses and individuals? Number \n     two, does the bill maintain the Government's ability to \n     protect the health, the safety, and the environment of the \n     American people? If the answer to both those questions is \n     yes, then the bill should be supported.\n\n  That says it all. I congratulate and applaud Senator Glenn for this \nstatement because that is what it is all about.\n  Mr. President, I believe that after the Government has acted on a \nproblem, and there is a need for the Government to act on that problem, \nafter time has passed I think it is important that we in Government \nlook at the action that was taken by our prior Government. We have to \nreexamine I believe for efficiency, and because of that we need a \nperiodic review. We do not have that. We should have that.\n  I have introduced legislation previously that said if Congress \nauthorizes a program, we should reauthorize that program every 10 \nyears, or it should fall. The reason I believe that is important is we \nhave had some really unusual things happen in this Chamber that I am \naware of.\n  It was just a year ago that I offered an amendment to do away with \nthe Tea-Tasting Board--I repeat, the Tea-Tasting Board, costing almost \n$0.5 million a year, which had been going on for 60, 80, 100 years. We \ndid not need it anymore. But it was just going on and on and on, like \nthe battery you see on television. Had we had something in place that \nwould have mandated a reauthorization of that program, the taxpayers' \nmoney would not have been wasted.\n  We had another program. During the Second World War it was important \nfor soldiers to have wool. When wool gets wet, you can still stay warm \nwith it. We did not have the synthetic products we now have. It was \nfound during the Second World War we were not raising enough wool and \nmohair. As a result of that, we made special provisions that there \nwould be a subsidy for people that would grow wool and mohair. This \nwent on for 50 years. There was no need for it anymore. It was only \nrecently that we terminated that program.\n  It should have been reviewed on a periodic basis. That is what we \nneed to do with laws, and we need to do the same with regulations. Once \na regulation is promulgated, there is no reason it should be there \nforever. There should be some way to reexamine that regulation that has \nbeen promulgated. That is what I am going to look for in the \nlegislation that is now before this body.\n  Mr. President, I chaired a subcommittee when the Democrats were in \nthe majority, a subcommittee in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. It was the Subcommittee on Toxic Substances Research and \nDevelopment. I chaired this subcommittee for a couple of Congresses. We \nhad some really interesting hearings there. We had hearings that dealt \nwith lead in the environment. And clearly as a result of those \nhearings, we focused attention on the need to do something about lead \nin the environment. We had physicians testify that it was the most \ndangerous condition for young children in America. Lead in the \nenvironment affected all people, no matter what race and no matter what \neconomic strata they came from. We focused attention on this. As a \nresult of that, legislation was passed that was directed toward taking \nlead out of the environment.\n  Mr. President, we held hearings on composite materials. These are the \nplastics that are used on airplanes like the Stealth fighter plane. We \nlearned that in the workplace, this substance was killing people and \nmaking thousands of people sick. As a result of the hearings which we \nheld, regulations were promulgated, workplaces were changed, and work \nconditions were changed. We needed to use composite materials. But we \nneeded to do it safely.\n  We held hearings on fungicides and pesticides on foods learning that \nsome of them were dangerous. As an example, hearings were held on a \nsubstance called alar, a substance to make apples, cherries, and grapes \nstay on trees longer than they normally would. This substance is now \nnot used in the United States.\n  We held a significant number of hearings, Mr. President, on TOSCA. \nThis is a program that we have now in effect that is old and needs to \nbe updated. It has not been yet.\n  My only reason for pointing these things out is to suggest that in \nthe areas I have mentioned, and in other areas such as lawn chemicals \nwhere we found people were getting sick, and we heard testimony before \nthe committee that people died as a result of improper application of \nthese substances and a lot of people got sick, that we have to be very \ncareful that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water.\n  We have problems with too many regulations. But we must have a \nframework in place that allows protection of people in the workplace, \nin the marketplace, so that we can enjoy life with clean air and clean \nwater. The regulations must be such that we can protect people but yet \nnot make the rules so burdensome that people cannot conduct business.\n  This Congress has already had consideration of regulations. The House \nput a moratorium on all regulations. This body felt that had gone too \nfar. Senator Nickles, the senior Senator from Oklahoma, and I \nintroduced an amendment. Basically, what the amendment said is that if \na regulation has an impact of more than $100 million, this body and the \nHouse would have the opportunity for a legislative veto. That \nregulation would not go into effect for 45 days. During that 45-day \nperiod, we would have the opportunity to review that. If we did not \nlike it, we could wipe that regulation off. It would not become \neffective. If it had an impact of less than $100 million, it would \nbecome effective immediately, but we would have 45 days to review that \nregulation. If we did not like it, we could rescind it.\n  This is a reasonable, sensible approach to regulatory reform. I am \nhappy to see that the version submitted by the majority through Senator \nDole has this approach in it.\n  That submitted by my friend, the senior Senator from Ohio, also has a \nprovision similar to this in it. I think that is important. It \nrecognizes that this body by a vote of 100 to nothing adopted the Reid-\nNickles amendment.\n  In sum, Mr. President, we need a sensible approach to regulatory \nreform. I think that we should all keep in mind what Senator Glenn has \nsaid. I think we would acknowledge what he said is right.\n\n       Any bill on the subject of regulatory reform to be \n     deserving of support must pass a test that is twofold. No. 1, \n     does the bill provide for reasonable, logical, appropriate \n     changes to regulatory procedures that eliminate unnecessary \n     burdens on businesses and on individuals? And, No 2, does the \n     bill maintain the Government's ability to protect the health, \n     the safety, and the environment of the American people?\n\n  That should be the goal that the majority and the minority work \ntoward on this legislation. Let us not form gridlock. Let us work to \nimprove the way that the American public must deal with these \nregulations and in the process protect what people want protected the \nmost, and that is food, water, and working conditions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I understand that ends this session \ntonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/10/senate-section/article/S9644-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECESS UNTIL 9 A.M.
