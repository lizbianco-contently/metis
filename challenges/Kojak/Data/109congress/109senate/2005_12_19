Madam President, there will be a period of morning \nbusiness this morning. Over the course of this morning, the House has \npassed both conference reports, the DOD appropriations conference \nreport and the spending reduction reconciliation report, as well, early \nthis morning. The first DOD appropriations passed 308 to 106 and the \nspending reconciliation 212 to 206 in the House just a few hours ago.\n  As our colleagues know, we have been waiting for House action on \nthose bills so those bills could be sent to this body. They have now \ncompleted their work on DOD appropriations, DOD authorization, and the \nspending reconciliation bill, all three of which we will be addressing \nover the next several days.\n  There has been a tremendous amount of work among and between the \nHouse and the Senate and among various interested parties, and now we \nare on the final stretch before the holiday season. It will be a \ndifficult time to get through the next couple of days because of a lot \nof tension, but I ask for our colleagues' understanding and patience as \nwe go through what will be challenging for us as quickly as possible to \naddress these issues. But all of these will be addressed, plus many \nothers. We will be working over the course of the morning to schedule \nboth conference reports, DOD appropriations and the spending \nreconciliation conference report.\n  I hope we can schedule Defense authorization, which is another bill \nwe have had on the floor and off the floor and on the floor, and \nChairman Warner has done a tremendous job with that bill. We were \nhoping to do that several days ago, but the House had not acted on it \nuntil this morning. It has now been completed, and we are ready to go \nto that hopefully this morning. Hopefully here in a few minutes we will \nhave a short time agreement, and then I will be working with the \nDemocratic leader to schedule an appropriate time for that vote.\n  On the deficit reduction conference report, as my colleagues know, we \nhave 10 hours for debate before that vote. We want to start that time \nas soon as we can. Every hour we put that off is just an hour later \nthat we will get out of here. We want to get that time started and that \ndebate started as soon as possible--10 hours before we vote on the \ndeficit reduction conference report.\n  A number of other issues are outstanding. In terms of judges, I am \nnot sure exactly when the next vote will be until we work out the \nschedule this morning. We will not have any rollcall votes this \nmorning, but I think we have told all of our colleagues that from noon \non, we may well be voting. We will just have to alert people in terms \nof the time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S13976-6", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13976-S13977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BOY SCOUTS AND GIRL SCOUTS OF AMERICA\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, yesterday I had the pleasure of hosting \nBoy Scouts and Girl Scouts here in the Nation's Capitol in celebration \nwith an event that looked at a bill that will be included in the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill, and this bill is the Support \nour Troops Act of 2005. We had an event to celebrate. We had a little \npress conference, and with the hot lights actually one of the Scouts \ngot a little faint, which many of us do, and it was remarkable to see \nthe Scouts' reaction. They knew exactly what to do and how to handle it \nas we stood before those cameras.\n  The event yesterday highlighted the tremendous contributions of \nScouting, a much beloved tradition in this country under congressional \ncharter in 1910 and since that point in time has served over 110 \nmillion Americans as participants in Scouting. Our efforts here in the \nSenate have been to protect that tradition for generations to come.\n  I have worked very closely with Roy Williams, the chief Scout \nexecutive for the Boy Scouts of America, and John Cushman, the national \npresident of the Boy Scouts of America, in fashioning this legislation. \nBoth were there at that event yesterday, as well as Troop 1100 from \nBurke, VA.\n  I have worked closely with Roy and John to craft what is commonsense \nlegislation, the Support our Troops Act of 2005. It will be passed here \nhopefully a little bit later today as part of that DOD bill. It passed \nthis floor in an overwhelming, bipartisan way earlier this year.\n  The bill is a straightforward victory for the Boy Scouts of America \nas well as other youth organizations that are helping to mold the \nhearts and the minds of our young generation today.\n  Without question, the success of Scouting relies on the commitment of \nthe Scouts and their leaders and their parents. But Scouting also \ndepends on having equal access to public facilities and participation \nin public programs and forums that allow Scouts to learn their field \ncraft, to sharpen their skills, contribute to their community, and to \nlearn the values that make America great.\n  Over the last few years, the Boy Scouts have been subjected to \nrepeated attempts to exclude them from public facilities. The attacks \nhave mounted so quickly that exclusion from Government forums has \nbecome the greatest legal challenge for the existence of the Boy \nScouts.\n  For example, last year, the Department of Defense was required to \nnotify American military bases worldwide that they cannot provide \nsupport to or directly sponsor the Boy Scouts of America. This \nunfortunate directive came about because of a lawsuit--a vindictive \nlawsuit--by the American Civil Liberties Union to demand that the \nGovernment discontinue its support of the Scouts. Their reason? Because \nthey argue the Scouts are a religious organization. Most Americans \nwould not recognize camping and building trails and fellowship and \nvoluntarism as distinctly religious activities, but the ACLU is bound \nand determined to undermine the Scouting mission at a time when \nprobably more than ever in history our Nation yearns for stronger \ncommunity ties, stronger family ties, and stronger fellowship, a \nculture of integrity, a culture of honesty, and a culture of character \nfor our young people.\n\n  That is why I sponsored the Support Our Troops Act, to ensure that \nthe Boy Scouts of America and the Girl Scouts of the United States of \nAmerica are not subject to unfair legal assaults, to remove any doubt \nthat Federal agencies may, indeed, welcome Scouts onto Federal \nproperty, to ensure that State and local governments cannot \ndiscriminate against the Scouts.\n  I have tremendous admiration for the Boy Scouts. I was a Boy Scout. \nThe first question I had yesterday from Scouts was: Were you an Eagle \nScout? I said, no, but the one goal I set and should have done was \nbecoming an Eagle Scout.\n  Scouting meant much to my three boys, Harrison, Jonathan, and Bryan, \nall of whom participated in Scouts, each of whom I have had the \nopportunity to camp with many times, with\n\n[[Page S13977]]\n\ntheir troops and with their Scouting entities.\n  Through exposure to the outdoors, through the hard work and virtues \nof civic duty, the Boy Scouts have developed millions of young \nAmericans into fine citizens today, community servants and, of course, \nfuture leaders. It is an honor to support this fine organization. Those \nvalues taught by Scouts have played an important role in shaping my own \nlife and that of my family, and now, because of the Support Our Troops \nAct, Scouting continues to enrich the lives of countless young boys and \ngirls and their families and their communities as it has always done \nover the last 100 years, strengthening the fabric of American life.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, I will not object if I \ncan follow the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is not in order to reserve the \nright to object.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to bring to the attention of \nthe body the extremely troubling tactics that some in this body have \nused over the past few days to try to push through a legislative \nproposal that, standing on its own, does not have the support of a \nmajority of the U.S. Congress. And I think these tactics reflect poorly \non this body and its leadership. Discarding the rules that govern all \nof us demonstrates contempt not only for the need to have and follow \nrules, but for the history, and future, of the United States Senate.\n  To be clear, I am talking about the inclusion of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge drilling provision in the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill, a provision we all know is controversial and has \nnot been able to pass Congress on a variety of occasions.\n  Drilling in the Arctic has absolutely nothing to do with funding the \nDefense Department. The distinguished minority leader has already \nsubmitted into the Record a letter from five retired U.S. generals who \nare arguing this very point: Funding for our brave men and women in \nuniform should not be jeopardized by including a highly controversial \nand unrelated provision to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nfor drilling.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be again printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 17, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader,\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Frist and Senator Reid: We are very concerned \n     that the FY2006 Defense Appropriations Bill may be further \n     delayed by attaching a controversial non-defense legislative \n     provision to the defense appropriations conference report.\n       We know that you share our overarching concern for the \n     welfare and needs of our troops. With 160,000 troops fighting \n     in Iraq, another 18,000 in Afghanistan, and tens of thousands \n     more around the world defending this country, Congress must \n     finish its work and provide them the resources they need to \n     do their job.\n       We believe that any effort to attach controversial \n     legislative language authorizing drilling in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to the defense appropriations \n     conference report will jeopardize Congress' ability to \n     provide our troops and their families the resources they need \n     in a timely fashion.\n       The passion and energy of the debate about drilling in ANWR \n     is well known, and a testament to vibrant debate in our \n     democracy. But it is not helpful to attach such a \n     controversial non-defense legislative issue to a defense \n     appropriations bill. It only invites delay for our troops as \n     Congress debates an important but controversial non-defense \n     issue on a vital bill providing critical funding for our \n     nation's security.\n       We urge you to keep ANWR off the defense appropriations \n     bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Joseph P.

Thank you, Madam President.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to read from the \nSenate's Web page and the Web page of the Senate Committee on Rules and \nAdministration--the very places the American public would refer to when \ninterested in learning how the Senate has said it will conduct \nbusiness. I have printed copies of the relevant pieces of these U.S. \nGovernment Web sites, and I ask unanimous consent that these be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Standing Rules of the Senate\n\n\n       chapter 28: conference committees; reports; open meetings\n\n       2.

INTRODUCTION\n\n       All legislative bodies need rules to follow if they are to \n     transact business in an orderly fashion. Legislatures must \n     have established rules if they are to operate fairly, \n     efficiently, and expeditiously.\n       Mr. Jefferson wrote in his Manual of Parliamentary Practice \n     that whether the rules ``be in all cases the most rational or \n     not, is really not of so great importance. It is much more \n     material that there should be a rule to go by than what that \n     rule is; that there may be a uniformity of proceeding in \n     business, not subject to the caprice of the Speaker or \n     captiousness of the members. It is very material that order, \n     decency, and regularity be preserved in a dignified public \n     body.''\n       The first Senate understood this concept, and on the next \n     day after a quorum of the Senators appeared and took their \n     oath of office, a special committee was created to ``prepare \n     a system of rules for conducting business.''\n       The committee consisting of Senators Ellsworth (Conn.), Lee \n     (Va.), Strong (Mass.), Maclay (Pa.), and Bassett (Del.) was \n     appointed on April 7, 1789, and on April 13, it filed a \n     report which ``was read, and ordered to lie until tomorrow, \n     for consideration.''\n       The following day the report was read again, but \n     consideration thereof was put off until April 15. On April \n     16, the new set of rules, consisting of 19 in total, was \n     adopted, but on April 18, another rule numbered XX, not \n     reported by the committee, was adopted.\n       The members of this first committee were qualified for \n     their task; all five were lawyers with experience in various \n     legislative bodies. Senators Ellsworth, Strong, and Bassett, \n     in addition to their other legislative experiences, were \n     members of the Federal Convention. Mr. Lee had been President \n     of the Continental Congress as well as a member of other \n     legislative bodies, and Mr. Maclay had served in the \n     Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly.\n       Other special committees formed to revise or reexamine the \n     Senate rules and to recommend changes therein, were created \n     from time to time until April 17, 1867. On this date a \n     committee of three Senators was appointed ``to revise the \n     rules of the Senate, and to report thereon early in the next \n     session.'' This committee became known as the Select \n     Committee on the Revision of the Rules and, as such, was a \n     continuous committee until December 9, 1874, when it was \n     designated as a standing committee to be known as the \n     Committee on Rules.\n       From 1789, when the first committee was appointed, until \n     1867, the beginning of a continuous committee on rules, the \n     Senate created nine special committees to revise the rules \n     of the Senate, but only seven (3) filed reports to the \n     Senate, and, pursuant to such reports during that time, \n     the Senate adopted three general revisions of its rules, \n     none of which were at the beginning of a new session. \n     During that same period, the Senate\n\n[[Page S13978]]\n\n     occasionally amended its existing rules and adopted \n     various procedural orders, some or most of which were \n     included in the body of the rules when each next general \n     revision was adopted.\n       The select committee, begun in 1867, consisted of three \n     Senators and was directed by resolution adopted on April 13, \n     ``to revise the rules of the Senate, and to ``report thereon \n     early in the next session.'' The committee filed its report, \n     which was ordered printed, on February 21, 1868, and the \n     Senate adopted this general revision of its rules on March \n     25, 1868. On December 21, 1874, the Senate adopted a \n     resolution instructing the standing Committee on Rules ``to \n     consider the propriety of revising and reclassifying the \n     rules of the Senate,'' and that it report accordingly at the \n     earliest day practicable. The committee made its first report \n     on March 2, 1875, which was ordered printed and recommitted.\n       On July 14, 1876, the committee filed another report on \n     rules revision; the Senate proceeded to consider this report \n     on December 18, 1876, which it recommitted on the same day. \n     On December 26, 1876, the Committee filed another report \n     which was ordered to lie on the table. The Senate began \n     consideration of this report on January 15, 1877, and after \n     three days of consideration and the adoption of various \n     amendments, the revision of the rules was adopted on January \n     17, 1877.\n       On March 2, 1883, the Senate adopted a resolution \n     instructing the standing Committee on Rules ``to sit during \n     the recesses of Congress, at Washington or elsewhere, for the \n     purpose of revising, codifying, and simplifying the rules of \n     the Senate.'' On December 10 of that year, a report was \n     submitted, which the Senate began to consider on December 13 \n     and continued with from time to time until January 11, 1884, \n     when another general revision of the rules was adopted.\n       On May 10, 1976, the Senate adopted Senate Resolution 156 \n     (submitted by Mr. Byrd, the majority leader) to authorize and \n     direct the Committee on Rules and Administration to prepare a \n     revision of the Standing Rules of the Senate. On November 7, \n     1979, a report was filed pursuant to the above resolution in \n     the form of Senate Resolution 274 (submitted by Mr. Byrd for \n     himself and Mr. Baker, the minority leader), to revise and \n     modernize the Standing Rules of the Senate without \n     substantive change in Senate procedure and to incorporate \n     therein certain other rules of the Senate. The resolution was \n     called up on November 14, 1979, and passed by a vote of 97 to \n     0, after a brief discussion thereon.\n       Between 1884 and 1979, many changes were made in the rules \n     of the Senate and its procedure. The history of these changes \n     has been piecemeal. Some amendments to the rules were \n     proposed by the Rules Committee in the form of resolutions \n     reported by that committee and adopted by the Senate, and \n     some resolutions amending the rules in various ways were \n     submitted, considered, and passed immediately or soon \n     thereafter without reference to a committee. Some changes \n     were made by the Senate agreeing to unanimous consent \n     requests to that effect, and precedents and practices of the \n     Senate since 1884 have had a great effect on the rules and \n     procedure. Additionally, some changes were made by a \n     combination of the above methods. For example, one of the \n     most controversial provisions of the changes in the Senate \n     rules since 1884 includes the cloture rule. The Committee \n     on Rules reported S. Res. 195 on May 16, 1916, to amend \n     Rule XXII to provide for a cloture procedure. It was \n     debated but did not come to a vote. On March 7, 1917, the \n     Senate was called into special session, and Senator Martin \n     of Virginia submitted a resolution (S. Res. 5) to provide \n     for a cloture procedure. It was similar to the resolution \n     reported by the committee and was adopted on March 8, \n     1917. A number of amendments have been made to this rule--\n     some reported and adopted; and some submitted, called up \n     for consideration without reference to a committee and \n     adopted. The so-called post-cloture amendment to rule \n     XXII, adopted in 1979, was called up without reference and \n     adopted, but the Committee on Rules and Administration had \n     reported a resolution in the previous Congress containing \n     a section therein that was very similar to the resolution \n     adopted in 1979.\n\n         II. Rules Committee--A Brief Sketch of its Development\n\n\n    HISTORY OF SPECIAL COMMITTEES ON RULES BEFORE THE CREATION OF A \n                      STANDING COMMITTEE ON RULES\n\n       The Senate first convened on March 4, 1789 without a quorum \n     (only eight Senators appeared) and without any rules. It was \n     not until April 6 that a quorum of the membership appeared. \n     During the interim, the Senate adjourned from day to day \n     without transacting any business except acting on proposed \n     communications to absent members requesting their attendance. \n     On April 7, a special committee to prepare and propose a \n     system of rules was created (Journal, p. 10) as follows: \n     ``Ordered, That Mr. Ellsworth, Mr. Lee, Mr. Strong, Mr. \n     Maclay, and Mr. Bassett, be a committee to prepare a system \n     of rules to govern the two Houses in cases of conference, and \n     to take under consideration the manner of electing Chaplains, \n     and to confer thereupon with a committee of the House of \n     Representatives.'' ``Ordered, That the same committee prepare \n     a system of rules for conducting business in the Senate.''\n       This committee performed its assignment and filed a report \n     on April 13, 1789, proposing 19 rules for conducting business \n     in the Senate. The report was adopted on April 16, 1789, \n     which gave the Senate the following 19 rules (Journal, p. \n     13):\n       The, report of the committee appointed to determine upon \n     rules for conducting business in the Senate, was agreed to. \n     Whereupon, ``Resolved, That the following rules, from No. I, \n     to XIX, inclusive, be observed.''\n       I. The President having taken the chair, and a quorum being \n     present, the journal of the preceding day shall be read, to \n     the end that any mistake may be corrected that shall have \n     been made in the entries.\n       II. No member shall speak to another, or otherwise \n     interrupt the business of the Senate, or read any printed \n     paper while the journals or public papers are reading, or \n     when any member is speaking in any debate.\n       III. Every member, when he speaks, shall address the chair, \n     standing in his place, and when he has finished, shall sit \n     down.\n       IV. No member shall speak more than twice in any one debate \n     on the same day, without leave of the Senate.\n       V. When two members rise at the same time, the President \n     shall name the person to speak; but in all cases the member \n     first rising shall speak first.\n       VI. No motion shall be debated until the same shall be \n     seconded.\n       VII. When a motion shall be made and seconded, it shall be \n     reduced to writing, if desired by the President, or any \n     member, delivered in at the table, and read by the President, \n     before the same shall be debated.\n       VIII. While a question is before the Senate, no motion \n     shall be received unless for an amendment, for the previous \n     question, or for postponing the main question, or to commit \n     it, or to adjourn.\n       IX. The previous question being moved and seconded, the \n     question from the Chair shall be: ``Shall the main question \n     be now put?'' And if the nays prevail, the main question \n     shall not then be put.\n       X. If a question in debate contains several points, any \n     member may have the same divided.\n       XI. When the yeas and nays shall be called for by one-fifth \n     of the members present, each member called upon shall, unless \n     for special reasons he be excused by the Senate, declare, \n     openly and without debate, his assent or dissent to the \n     question. In taking the yeas and nays, and upon the call of \n     the House. the names of the members shall be taken \n     alphabetically.\n       XII. One day's notice at least shall be given of an \n     intended motion for leave to bring in a bill.\n       XIII. Every bill shall receive three readings previous to \n     its being passed; and the President shall give notice at \n     each, whether it be the first, second, or third; which \n     readings shall be on three different days, unless the Senate \n     unanimously direct otherwise.\n       XIV. No bill shall be committed or amended until it shall \n     have been twice read, after which it may be referred to a \n     committee.\n       XV. All committees shall be appointed by ballot, and a \n     plurality of votes shall make a choice.\n       XVI. When a member shall be called to order, he shall sit \n     down until the President shall have determined whether he is \n     in order or not; and every question of order shall be decided \n     by the President, without debate; but, if there be a doubt in \n     his mind, he may call for the sense of the Senate.\n       XVII. If a member be called to order for words spoken, the \n     exceptionable words shall be immediately taken down in \n     writing, that the President may be better enabled to judge of \n     the matter.\n       XVIII. When a blank is to be filled, and different sums \n     shall be proposed, the question shall be taken on the highest \n     sum first.\n       XIX. No member shall absent himself from the service of the \n     Senate without leave of the Senate first obtained.\n       Two days later (April 18) the Senate adopted the following \n     motion, giving the Senate a total of 20 rules (Journal, p. \n     14): On motion, Resolved, That the following be subjoined to \n     the standing orders of the Senate:\n       XX. Before any petition or memorial, addressed to the \n     Senate, shall be received and read at the table, whether the \n     same shall be introduced by the President, or a member, a \n     brief statement of the contents of the petition or memorial \n     shall verbally be made by the introducer.\n       After the first session of the first Congress, a \n     considerable number of orders and resolutions to study a \n     particular rule or a general revision of the rules were \n     adopted before the Rules Committee became a standing \n     committee. This review will concern itself only with the \n     creation of special committees which were concerned with a \n     general revision of the rules as opposed to those created to \n     explore a certain procedure or particular operations of the \n     Senate. There were more special committees created to study \n     general revisions of the rules than there were general \n     revisions adopted; some committees never filed a report and \n     others filed reports which were rejected.\n       During the entire history of the Senate, only seven general \n     revisions of the rules since 1789 have been adopted, namely: \n     March 26, 1806; January 3, 1820; February 14, 1828; March 25, \n     1868; January 17, 1877; January 11, 1884; and November 14, \n     1979. The last three revisions were considered and reported \n     by the standing Committee on Rules before being adopted by \n     the Senate.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Let me start with reading from the Senate Web page's description of \nthe legislative process--our description to\n\n[[Page S13979]]\n\nthe public as to how we do business in our Nation's Capitol.\n  Under the heading ``Conference Committees; reports; open meetings,'' \nthe first sentence reads:\n\n       2. Conferees shall not insert in their report matter not \n     committed to them by either House, nor shall they strike from \n     the bill matter agreed to by both Houses.\n\n  This section goes on in more detail, but let me turn to what our \nconstituents, members of the public whom we expect to abide by the laws \nwe pass, would find if they visited the Senate Committee on Rules and \nAdministration Web site:\n\n       All legislative bodies need rules to follow if they are to \n     transact business in an orderly fashion. Legislatures must \n     have established rules if they are to operate fairly, \n     efficiently, and expeditiously.\n\n  The committee Web site goes on to quote from Thomas Jefferson's 1801 \nedition of the ``Manual of Parliamentary Practice,'' saying that:\n\n     . . . whether the rules ``be in all cases the most rational \n     or not, is really not of so great importance. It is much more \n     material that there should be a rule to go by than what the \n     rule is; that there may be a uniformity of proceeding in \n     business, not subject to the caprice of the Speaker or \n     captiousness of the members. It is very material that order, \n     decency, and regularity be preserved in a dignified public \n     body.''\n\n  A logical follow-up question is then: How is it that we find it \nacceptable to knowingly break our own rules? I am truly astonished at \nthe contempt I see certain of my colleagues showing for this \ninstitution on this issue.\n  I could stand here and read at length from the history of the Senate \nrules, as written by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, \nto reflect on how our rules came to be. I will not do that. But I do \nencourage my colleagues to read up on this history, because if we go \nforward on the path that some have set, I worry what it means for the \nfuture of this body. It most definitely opens the door to future \nabuses. If you don't like the rules, you break them. In fact, those who \nwant the drilling provision included in the defense spending bill, \nrecognizing that it breaks Senate rules, have actually put language \ninto the conference report that says once the bill is signed into law, \nSenate rule 28 would come back into effect.\n  In fact, let me read the exact language:\n\n       Section 13, Legislative Procedure: Effective immediately, \n     the Presiding Officer shall apply all of the precedents of \n     the Senate under rule 28 in effect at the beginning of the \n     109th Congress.\n\n  So apparently you can break the rules because you will immediately \nreinstate the rules. Is this the message the Senate is willing to send \nto the American public? I have more faith in this body than to believe \nwe are willing to sink so low.\n  Let's imagine the consequences if, in fact, this conference report is \naccepted. You can't move an unpopular proposal through the legislative \nprocess? No need to worry. You just attach language to an important \nfunding bill that says you want to reinstate the rules after you have \nbroken them. Is this the precedent that we, Members of both parties, \nwant to set, a precedent that says you can break the rules because you \nwill put them back in place? I sincerely hope not.\n  Additionally, how will we respond when our constituents ask us, how \nis it that the very people who make the laws that govern public \nbehavior simply ignore the rules governing their own behavior? What \nwill we say?\n  Madam President, I hope when it comes time for the Senate to go on \nrecord as to whether it believes its rules are important enough to \nstand, that a majority of this body will take the honorable position \nthat this institution's rules are worth defending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am sad to hear a Senator say that \nthis amendment that is controversial, the amendment to allow \nexploration and development of the Arctic Coastal Plain, has never \npassed the Senate. It passed the Senate this year as part of the \nreconciliation package. It passed both bodies in 1995 and was vetoed by \nPresident Clinton.\n  With regard to the question of the concept of matters being added to \nconference reports, we voted in 1995 on a motion to overturn the Chair. \nIt was a motion to overturn the Chair on the aviation reauthorization \nreform bill. It was the last bill before the Congress at that time. At \nthat time, there was an appeal from the Chair, and there was a vote to \noverturn the Chair. The Chair was not sustained. On that vote, there \nwere a series of Senators, here now, who voted to disagree with the \nChair.\n  We are not changing the rules at all. Rule XXVIII is not affected by \nthe amendment I am presenting to the Senate. I have been around here 37 \nyears. I know the rules. I was chairman of the Rules Committee for a \nwhile. As a matter of fact, I think I wrote, during the time I was \nRules Committee chair--I am still on the Rules Committee--the comments \nthe Senator read.\n  As a practical matter, the right to disagree with a ruling of the \nChair is inherent in any body, any legislature. In Roberts Rules of \nOrder, it is a little different than it is here. But we have the right \nto appeal the ruling of the Chair. When we do, it is not destroying the \nrule. It represents a difference of opinion.\n  Do you know what the difference of opinion now is? It is whether this \namendment, which is the amendment to go forward, as the Congress \nindicated in 1980 in the Alaska National Interest Conservation Lands \nAct, with the exploration and development of the Arctic Plain of \nAlaska, whether that is part of and related to national security.\n  Oil is related to national security. I will provide the statistics \nlater on how much oil the Department of Defense uses. This is an \namendment to pursue domestic production of oil, without which we will \nbe in great difficulty. The largest consumer of oil in the United \nStates is the Department of Defense. If the opposition disagrees with \nus on that position, then let's see whether the Senate believes that \nthis is a matter that is in the interest of national security.\n  We should not be having people say that it has never been done, that \nI am trying to do something that breaks the rules. We don't break the \nrules. We are living by the rules. This amendment is here because of \nthe rules. I intend to enforce the rules. One of the procedures in this \nSenate is to appeal the ruling of the Chair. We haven't had that ruling \nyet. There appears to be a presumption that it will happen.\n  But let's go back to 1980, to that time when we had the Alaska oil \npipeline amendment. At that time, we had the same opposition from the \nextreme environmental groups. It was going to destroy Alaska. It was \ngoing to destroy caribou. It was going to be inconsistent with our \nenvironment. There was no filibuster. There wasn't even the threat of \nfilibuster. The Senate at that time agreed that oil was a matter of \nnational security, and we don't filibuster national security issues. As \na matter of fact, in defense matters, on the defense Appropriations \nbill, et cetera, we need 51 votes, not 60, on various matters with \nregard to compliance and whatnot of the Senate. There are exceptions \nhere. They could get a couple of 60-degree votes when we have this bill \nbefore the Senate.\n  But the point I am trying to make is, the Senate, at the time we \npassed the Alaska oil pipeline amendment, did not filibuster. What has \nhappened is the constant filibuster now during this decade by people \nwho persist in trying to reverse the provisions of the 1980 act.\n  I will never forget the 1980 act because that act, in 1978, had been \nblocked by my then-colleague, Senator Gravel, in the closing minutes of \nthe Congress in 1978. It had passed the House. It passed the Senate. It \nhad gone to conference. It came out of conference, and Senator Gravel \nblocked that by demanding that the bill be read after the adjournment \nresolution had been presented to the Senate.\n  In the next Congress in 1979, my good friend Senator Jackson of \nWashington came to me and said: Ted, if you want to be involved in \nconsideration of this bill this year, you must come back to the \nInterior and Insular Affairs Committee. I had left that committee to \ncome to the Appropriations Committee. But as a matter of fact, I did. I \nleft the Appropriations Committee and went back to the Interior and \nInsular Affairs Committee. We worked on that same bill then for 1979 \nand 1980.\n  That was a period of extreme stress for me. I lost my wife in the \n1978 accident that happened after the blocking of that bill. We all \nknew that we had to\n\n[[Page S13980]]\n\ncome back in. As a matter of fact, the flight we were on was a flight \nto raise money to come back and ask people to help us lobby for the \npassage of something to get that bill done.\n  At that time Alaska's selection of lands under the act were blocked \nby what was called a freeze. They were blocked by an order made by \nPresident Carter under the Antiquities Act. We could not go forward \nwithout getting an act passed. So I split off from my then-colleague \nand said: I am going to help you. I only want one thing in this bill \nfor sure. And that is, I wanted the right to continue to explore the \nArctic Plain. The two Senators in charge of that bill, Senator Tsongas \nof Massachusetts, Senator Jackson of Washington said: You are right. \nAnd they put in the amendment that created section 2002 in the 1980 \nAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. It was their \namendment.\n  These people are filibustering fulfilling the commitment of Senator \nTsongas and Senator Jackson. As a matter of fact, I did vote for that \nbill and, at the time, there were enormous full-page ads in newspapers \nin my State which said: Come home, Ted. You no longer represent us. We \ncan't trust the Congress.\n  I said: I trust the Congress. I particularly trust Senator Tsongas \nand Senator Jackson. Unfortunately, God willed otherwise. Those two \ngentlemen left us prematurely and, as a consequence, we have fought now \nfor 25 years to fulfill that commitment.\n  Let me tell you a little bit more history, Madam President. I was in \nthe Department of Interior during the Eisenhower days. In 1958, I \nhelped write the order that created what was known as the Arctic \nWildlife Range. In that range, 9 million acres in northeast Alaska, oil \nand gas exploration was permitted.\n  The reason I asked for this amendment in 1980 was that I wanted to \ncontinue the fact that oil and gas exploration would be permitted.\n  I see I am close to the end of my time. I will finish my statement \nlater; others want to speak but I want to finish with this one comment, \nwith the permission of the Chair.\n  I am not trying to turn over the rules. I am not trying to do \nanything that others have not done. We have a full right to appeal the \nruling of the Chair, should it take place, that we disagree with the \nbasic assumption that oil is not needed in the interest of national \nsecurity. And those of us who will vote to make sure we vote on this \nconference report are ones who believe in national security. We cannot \nmention the vote in the House, but we can mention the statements in the \nHouse. See what they said on the House floor. We believe in national \nsecurity. This amendment must go through as part of the National \nSecurity Defense Appropriations Act of 2005.\n  I yield the floor. I will be back throughout the day, Madam \nPresident.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I wish to make a couple quick points \nregarding the remarks of the Senator from Alaska.\n  Let's be clear, the Senate has never passed the version of the Arctic \ndrilling that is included in this Department of Defense bill. That is \nsimply not the case.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator didn't say that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The Senator indicated we passed this provision before, \nand we had not. And if the Senator is not breaking the rules, why does \nhe need to create language that explicitly reinstates the rule? He \ncan't have it both ways--have language that says the rule doesn't apply \nin this instance but will go right back into effect. It clearly is \nbreaking the rule, and the Senator is trying to set a precedent for all \nthis. The aviation bill from the midnineties--I remember that one--they \ndidn't have the votes to put in this special interest provision for \nFederal Express business. It is something that never passed any \ncommittee in the whole Congress. Yes, they violated the rules and \nabused the rules to get that one done, too. I wouldn't use that as a \nprecedent. It is merely a precedent of the abuse that is occurring \nhere.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, is it possible for me to regain the \nfloor?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, let me say this. If it was possible to \nhave an appeal of the ruling of the Chair in 1996, it is possible now. \nThat is not breaking the rules. With regard to the version of this \nbill, we took the bill that passed the House and have added to it the \nprovisions that allow funding for disaster areas and other items, but \nthe basic portion of this bill that is coming to us in this amendment \nis, in fact, the bill that passed the House before.\n  Again, I want to say this. I think there is a lot of really extreme \ncomments about this Senator's actions. They can't come close to really \noffending the rules themselves. I have done nothing illegal. I have \ndone nothing immoral. I have done nothing wrong. I am pursuing--as a \nmatter of fact, there hasn't been a ruling of the Chair yet, but \nthinking there might be, we followed the procedure that was established \nby the distinguished minority leader in 2000. We put a provision in \nthere saying, look, if there is a ruling and consideration of this \namendment, we do not want to disturb the rules.\n  By the way, after the aviation ruling that I mentioned, the Federal \nAviation Reauthorization Reform Act, the rule wasn't changed; it was \nthe interpretation of the Parliamentarian. The Parliamentarian believes \nthat after a Chair is overruled, the rule is no longer enforceable. It \nis still there, but it is a question of enforcement, not a question of \nrepealing.\n  Even if we have an appeal of the Chair, and the Chair is overruled, \nwe won't take rule XXVIII out of the rules. It will be a question of \nwhether the Parliamentarian will tell the Chair that based upon \nprecedent that rule would no longer be enforceable.\n  So we put a provision in the bill saying in the event a ruling of the \nChair is overturned and there is a situation where the Parliamentarian \nwould advise the Chair that means rule XXVIII is no longer enforceable, \nthen we use the same approach of the Senator from Nevada, and we say \nthat will not be the case. We do not intend to destroy the rule. We \nintend to support the rule. We don't want it to be in hiatus.\n  After the 1996 act, it was inoperable for 4 years because of the \ninterpretation of the Parliamentarian, based upon precedent. I am not \ncriticizing the Parliamentarian; that is the basic precedent of the \nSenate. Once the Chair is overruled, that rule is unenforceable until \nreinstated. We are saying that is not our intent this time. We don't \nintend to attack the rule. We want the rule to stay in place. We want \nto make sure anybody who votes for this, in the national security \ninterest, that we must proceed with oil exploration in the Arctic, is \nnot being told, Oh, you are going to destroy rule XXVIII. It wasn't \ndestroyed in 1996. It was made inoperable by an interpretation of the \nParliamentarian.\n\n  By the way, again, that was consistent with precedent. We are saying \nthat precedent will not apply to this bill, the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill, when it comes before the Senate.\n  This is going to go on for a long time, but one thing I know is that \nI am not violating the rules. When I proceed with this amendment in the \nconference report, which I fully intend to do, and trust the Senate--I \nam putting my faith in the Senate to support national security as a \npart of the conference report.\n  Remember now, we don't have an amendment. We have a conference report \nnow. That is treated in a different manner than an amendment to the \nbill. I am not offering an amendment to the bill. I am managing a \nconference report on the Defense appropriations bill for 2006. As such, \nI expect that bill to pass, and I expect that bill to pass containing \nthe provision which is in the interest of national security, that we \nnow proceed with exploration and development of the Arctic Plain as was \nintended by two great Senators, Senator Scoop Jackson and Senator \nTsongas. It was their concession to the State of Alaska, as President \nCarter insisted on withdrawing 105 million acres of Alaska. Only 1.5 \nmillion acres were assured for the future development of our State. One \npoint five million were assured for the future development of the \nState, and 105 acres were set aside and not available for development. \nThere can be no oil and gas development in those other areas. In this \narea,\n\n[[Page S13981]]\n\nwe allowed 1.5 million acres to stay open for development.\n  More will be said later. I thank the Chair for her patience.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry, Madam President: If the Chair is \noverruled on rule XXVIII exceeding the scope point of order, would that \nset a precedent that would lower the standard for enforcement of that \nrule to such an extent as rendered almost impossible to enforce?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. It would lower the standard with \nrespect to enforcing the rule.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, let me say this. Clearly what is being \nattempted by the distinguished Senator from Alaska is wrong. As the \nSenator will recall, we had another Parliamentarian who was fired over \na matter similar to this. This is absolutely wrong what is being \nattempted here.\n  This is the Defense appropriations bill, and to wave the flag of \nnational defense, even at the very best, if ANWR goes forward, it will \nbe 10 years before any oil is produced. Oil companies made, as I \nindicated last night, $100 billion last year. This is a speck of oil \nif, in fact, it goes forward.\n  I know how strongly the Senator from Alaska feels about it. Why not \ndo it the right way? Even though I voted against this being inserted in \nthe reconciliation, which I think was wrong, it was done according to \nthe rules, and the Senator from Alaska and what he wanted prevailed. To \ndo it this way is absolutely wrong. It shows that if it is \ninconvenient, if the rules are inconvenient, then just overrule them. \nWe will play around with it. We will sustain the Parliamentarian at one \npoint, overrule him in another, and then come back in the same bill and \npretend as if nothing had ever happened. This has never been done \nbefore.\n\n  It shows absolute contempt for the rules of this body, and it shows \nthat Lord Acton was right. Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power \ntends to corrupt absolutely. That is what we have here. That is what is \ngoing on in Washington.\n  I will be happy to run through what I think are the ethical lapses \nthat have taken place in this town, led by the Republicans over the \npast year, but that is not necessary. I believe what we have is \nintellectual games being played in a negative fashion. This is \nabsolutely wrong to do this, to hold up this bill.\n  We will have a vote. As things now stand, we will vote on cloture \nprobably on Wednesday. Following that cloture vote, there will be a \nvote in upholding the ruling of the Chair, and we will see what happens \nat that time. The votes are very close. I would not be a betting person \neither way on either cloture or this rule, but understand that sticking \nthis in this bill has nothing to do with the national defense of this \ncountry. It has everything to do with breaking the rules to the \nconvenience of the powerful.\n  I am disappointed that this happened. I think it is wrong. I think \nwhen the history of this body is written, if this is allowed to go \nforward, it will be a dark day in the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President----\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, let me just finish. I have one additional \nthing to say.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Pardon me. I apologize.\n  Mr. REID. I will be finished just quickly.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Regarding conversations we had on this floor about this has \nbeen done before, returning to the Chair and later fixing it, it has \nnot been done before. This is a unilateral fix of a precedent in the \nsame bill. Anything that has been done before has been done on a \nbipartisan basis. I was part of changing it back with Senator Trent \nLott. It was the right thing to do. Scope of conference is very \nimportant. It should not be changed willy-nilly. It should not be \nchanged because it is inconvenient. The precedents of this body are \nextremely important, and I think they are being played with at this \ntime. It is really unfortunate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I again apologize to the Senator from \nNevada. I thought he had completed his statement.\n  I want to read to the Senate the comments I made in 1996 at the time \nthe point of order was pending on the FAA conference report, just to \nshow I have maintained a constant position with regard to this. I said \nthis:\n\n       Mr. President, this is a rather difficult situation. We \n     have just passed, recently, a Defense appropriations bill. I \n     was the chairman of that conference. Before it was over, we \n     had a whole series of other bills, a series of legislative \n     items. It was not necessary to raise a point of order. \n     Everybody knew we had exceeded the scope of the conference.\n\n  Now, this is 1996. I am again quoting:\n\n       I ask any chairman of a conference if he or she has ever \n     really been totally restricted by this rule? . . . When the \n     leader became aware that Senator Kennedy was going to raise \n     this point of order, the leader determined to raise it \n     himself. I take it that having done that, there is no \n     question this is a rather significant occasion. I hope it \n     will be a rather narrow precedent.\n       I point out to the Senate that this provision is not only \n     the only matter that exceeds the scope of the conference. We \n     had to include, at this administration's request, special \n     authority for the executive branch to purchase and deploy \n     explosive detection devices. We put in here the provisions \n     that pertain to the rights of survivors of victims of air \n     crashes. We put in the provisions requiring passenger \n     screening companies to be certified by the FAA. That is not \n     required under any existing law. We put in restrictions on \n     underage pilots, following the one disaster that involved a \n     young girl who was a pilot. We put in a provision requiring \n     the FAA to deal with structures that interfere with air \n     commerce.\n       My point is, as we get to the end of a session, we, of \n     necessity, include in a bill extraneous matters totally \n     beyond the scope. We know they are beyond the scope. As \n     the chairman of the Defense Appropriations Committee, I \n     knew all those items we brought to the floor earlier this \n     week were beyond the scope of the conference, but we did \n     not anticipate anyone would raise a point of order.\n       Anticipating that Senator Kennedy would bring this point of \n     order before the Senate, the leader made this point of order. \n     I ask the Senate to keep in mind this will be a rather \n     limited precedent, in my opinion. I do not know whether the \n     Chair will agree with me, but clearly when you get to the end \n     of a Congress, some things have to be done. We did not have \n     time to take up separate bills. We held a hearing on the bill \n     in the Senate Commerce Committee dealing with the rights of \n     victim-survivors of air disasters. They pleaded with us to \n     include that bill in this legislation. We have done so.\n       In other words, this point of order is not only valid, in \n     my judgment, against the amendment offered by Senator \n     Hollings, but against the other provisions where we have \n     exceeded the scope on various matters on this bill.\n\n  What I am saying is we have had this process year after year. I know \nof other amendments that have gone into bills like this at the last \nminute where people tried to get passed something that did not pass \nbefore, and because of the circumstances they passed.\n  In this instance, again, the Senate is going to hear this over and \nover again, that this is a matter of national security that I have for \n25 years tried to support the position taken by the Senator from \nWashington and the Senator from Massachusetts that this area should be \nopen to oil and gas exploration. We have had two environmental impact \nstatements. They have proved that no permanent damage will be done to \nthis area. We have disproved all the allegations concerning destruction \nof wildlife. As a matter of fact, there are seven to eight times more \ncaribou on the North Slope today than there were at the time the oil \npipeline was built and at the time we were told if that pipeline is \nbuilt there will never be another caribou in Alaska, in effect. They \nsaid we would destroy it.\n  The other day, they called it the Serengeti. I do not want to point \nout the Senator who said it, but one Senator went up there and viewed \nit. When that Senator got off the helicopter, that Senator said: What \nthe blank is this all about? That person had looked over the area when \nit was snowing and said: Why would someone possibly block this?\n  I have to say that this is the beginning of a long debate. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if a Senate filibuster over ANWR stops a \nDefense bill, the legislation can be quickly modified and passed. So \nthere is no impact on military finances. If someone proposing this \nloses, then we will reconstitute the conference and ANWR will be out. \nNow, this is not me talking. This is the distinguished\n\n[[Page S13982]]\n\nPresident pro tempore of the Senate, Mr. Stevens, quoted in yesterday's \nFairbanks Daily News-Miner.\n  Senator Stevens said: If the Senate filibuster stops the Defense \nbill, the legislation will be quickly modified and passed. There is no \nimpact on military finances. If we lose, the distinguished Senator went \non to say, we will reconstitute the conference and ANWR will be out.\n  That is the point. I appreciate the honesty of the interview with my \nfriend from Alaska with this newspaper because that is the way it is. \nIf we prevail, that is, those who oppose this being in the bill, on the \npoint of order which will likely be on Wednesday, then the Defense bill \ngoes forward. No one voting on this point of order will stop the \nDefense bill. No one voting for cloture will stop the Defense bill. \nThis bill will go forward. There is a continuing resolution that takes \nus to the end of the year, and we need not get that far. If, in fact, \nwe have a majority of the Senators who vote on this point of order and \nit prevails, then the bill will go forward, just as the Senator from \nAlaska said yesterday in the Fairbanks newspaper.\n  So I would hope that there would come a time--we could go home today. \nWe could be finished today. The Senator from Alaska knows he has the \nvotes to do what he did on reconciliation again. As soon as the new \nsession of this Congress convenes, we could take this out and goodwill \nwould prevail. We would go home tonight, and we would be home 4 or 5 \ndays before Christmas.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree. I agree with the statement the Senator read. I \nthink that is true. I am not accusing anyone of delay. I would be happy \nto have a time agreement on the conference report, and I would be happy \nto have a time agreement on any type of point of order or motion to be \nraised on the conference report. I will be glad to have a vote on the \nconference report by voice vote if it passes. I am anxious to let \npeople get home. I will be happy to get time agreements, and I do \nbelieve if we lose we can go back to conference and protect the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  I am not accusing anyone of harming the Department of Defense. I am \nurging people to think about national defense.\n  Would the Senator agree to any type of time agreement?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to consider anything that is reasonable. I \nam sure there are things we can do.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Good.\n  Mr. REID. One of the things I think would be appropriate, the way I \nunderstand things now, if everything is here by midnight tonight and \ncloture is filed, there will be a Wednesday cloture vote. After that \nWednesday cloture vote, there will be a vote on this point of order. \nThat would be Wednesday.\n  If it is necessary that there be cloture invoked on the Defense \nauthorization bill--and I am not sure that is necessary, but it is \npossible--the two cloture votes would be back to back.\n  So I would be happy to consider working out some reasonable time \nagreement. Maybe we could even have the vote on the point of order \nfirst.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator. I think that is the way to go.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S13982-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13982-S13986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE ALASKA WILDLIFE REFUGE\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise to raise my concerns about this \nprocess and the unbelievable avenues through which this legislation is \ncoming before us, just to try to open up the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge for oil drilling.\n  As my colleagues have just been discussing on the floor, these are \npriorities, for Congress to pass the DOD appropriations bill and the \nDOD authorization bill. As this Senator sees it, we could wrap up this \nbusiness today and go home. But because a provision in this legislation \ncoming over from the House opens up drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge, you bet there are Members on this side of the aisle--\nMembers on both sides of the aisle in the House and Senate--who have \ngreat concerns over this measure.\n  As one Senator who would like to wrap up the year today and go home \nand spend time with my family, I know there are the prospects of us \nstaying here to fight for something we believe in. It is very clear \nthat we could go home today if the Senator from Alaska would agree to \ntake this language out of the bill. So, in fact, this process is being \nheld up over the fact that he has inserted a controversial measure into \nthis legislation. It is such a controversial measure that House \nDemocrats and Republicans refused to vote on a budget bill while it \nstill remained in the legislation. That gives you some idea of how \ncontroversial it is. In fact, they took it out of the budget bill \nbecause they could not get the budget bill passed with it in there.\n  Now my colleague wants to say that somehow he is not holding up the \nprocess when it is very clear that he is holding up the process. We \ncould all go home today instead of arguing over something that has been \nargued over for 25 years. There is a reason we have been arguing over \nit for 25 years, and that is because there has been great division over \nthis issue.\n  The notion that this is about national security is unbelievable to \nme. To me, what national security is really about is passing a clean \nDOD appropriations bill that gives resources to our troops. In fact, we \nshould give the military in Iraq the ability to do a better job \nprotecting the security and infrastructure of the pipeline there. We \nlose 800,000 barrels a day of oil in Iraq that could be part of helping \nthe Iraqi government get on its feet and the rest of the world energy \nmarkets stabilize. But this ANWR measure is holding up a DOD bill \ninstead of giving the military all the resources they need. We are not \ntalking about an oil supply 10 years from now; we are talking about \nsomething we should be doing today in terms of securing existing \ninfrastructure. We should strip this ANWR language out and pass this \nbill.\n  I understand the Senator from Alaska thinks this ANWR provision is in \nthe interest of some, because I think it is in Alaska's interest. In \n2005, petroleum counted for 86 percent of the State of Alaska's general \nrevenues--86 percent of their State revenues. In fact, according to a \npublished article, State officials expect that at least until 2013, 74 \npercent of Alaska's general purpose revenues will come from oil \nrevenues. So I get why the State of Alaska cares so much. In fact, CBO \nrecently calculated that Alaska will get $5 billion in revenue from \nthis legislation if it is passed. Of course Alaska cares about this. Of \ncourse Alaska would hold up the legislative process and keep us here \nextra days to get this bill passed and get ANWR in by hook or crook, \nany possible way. Of course they would.\n  But don't say that this is in the national interest. What is in the \nnational interest of our country is to get over our overdependence on \nforeign oil. We need to start doing that now, as well as get off of our \noverdependence on domestic oil and fossil fuels in general. Instead of \nimplementing this Arctic drilling program, we ought to be implementing \npolicies that help us diversify and move forward, so people can have \naffordable energy rates in this country and not be held hostage by \nthese special interests.\n  It is another thing to say, somehow, this legislation has arrived \nhere through a clean process. The fact is you would basically have to \noverrule the Parliamentarian--which is our judge here. It is basically \nlike going to a Federal court, having a judge rule on something, then \nwhen the judge rules on it voting to overturn them, and then a few \nminutes later reinstating the rule. If that isn't a quick fix around \nthe legislative process here, I don't know what is. But this whole ANWR \nmeasure, trying to get it on any piece of legislation that is moving, \nhas been exactly that--every attempt to make the process go without \nadhering to the rules.\n  The fact is this legislation comes to us and basically takes away \nabout seven different laws that would otherwise apply to drilling in \nthe Arctic. It really is--it is a free ride, a back door that \ncircumvents seven different Federal laws and countless regulations that \nhave been on the books for years. So this is not just passing ANWR; \nthis is basically giving the oil companies a sweetheart deal around \nFederal laws and regulations that no other company has ever gotten. I \nguarantee, Scoop Jackson would roll over in his grave.\n\n[[Page S13983]]\n\nThere is no way Scoop Jackson would support drilling in the Arctic \nWildlife Refuge when you are overturning a law, the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, that he wrote. So you can mention Scoop \nJackson's name a thousand times, there is no way he would support this \nprocess.\n  Did you ever ask yourself why he didn't just authorize it to begin \nwith? I think he knew exactly what he was doing. He wanted further \nreview, and he certainly wanted environmental laws to apply. But, no, \nthis legislation basically overrides the environmental statutes. It \ncreates ill-defined environmental standards. It has a waiver for the \nlease and sale of land and cuts off the Secretary's ability to protect \nenvironmentally sensitive areas, and it allows the Secretary to lease \nan unlimited amounts of coastal plain. It takes a weak reclamation \nstandard and basically hamstrings the Federal agencies that are \nsupposed to do their job when it comes to protecting federal lands.\n  Maybe it is no surprise that, after trying to stick this on the \nbudget bill, having both Democrats and Republicans in the House defeat \nit, now there is an effort to try to stick it on the DOD appropriations \nbill.\n  In this Senator's opinion, this is nothing more than legislative \nblackmail, to try to get colleagues to vote for something because it is \na must-pass bill. That's because, in fact, the proponents of this \nmeasure know that there is great opposition to this process and to \ndrilling in the Arctic. I know the Senator from Alaska said in the \nFairbanks paper that he was not going to hold up the process. But \nnewspapers across the country know exactly what is going on. In fact, \nthe Oregonian just said a few days ago:\n\n       Arctic drilling has been thrown in with the defense bill \n     and the emotionally charged matter of supporting American \n     troops at a time of war. It does not belong there, something \n     that ought to be obvious to all but the most cynical members \n     of Congress.\n\n  All but the most cynical Members of Congress should see that this is \nobvious.\n  We actually had a letter from military leaders, military leaders in \nour country, raising the same concern:\n\n     . . . any effort to attach controversial legislative language \n     authorizing drilling to the Defense appropriations conference \n     report will jeopardize Congress' ability to provide our \n     troops and their families the resources they need in a timely \n     fashion.\n\n  That is coming from General Zinni and many others who wrote to us \nsaying, don't do this. This is crazy. We want to get about the process \nof getting a DOD bill passed.\n  The New Hampshire newspaper said:\n\n       He has threatened to attach the provision to the Hurricane \n     Katrina relief bill or to \n     the defense appropriations bill, a cynical \n     ploy. . . .\n\n  Trying to attach this, basically, should be rejected. Both approaches \nshould be rejected.\n  Even my newspaper in Seattle called this, ``dubious congressional \nstandards of fair play,'' because they know that this situation is one \nin which any legislative rule will be thrown out, just to pass drilling \nin ANWR.\n  We know that this issue is not without controversy. We know the oil \nspills of the past are raising great concerns for people. If they have \nraised so many great concerns for us, why would we give a blanket pass \nto drilling in ANWR and overthrow those Federal rules and regulations \nthat apply everywhere else? Why should we go to the extent of trying to \nattach it to a bill that has to pass, knowing that you are going to ask \nMembers to overrule the Parliamentarian and then, after you basically \nhave tried to overrule him, then go back and say the Parliamentarian \nwas right?\n  How far are we willing to go? How many rules are we willing to break \nin this process just to get a small amount of oil 10 years from now?\n  What the American people want is for us to do our job and send money \nto the troops and get them home. They do not want to sit and watch us \nstay here for 3 or 4 more days to continue to complain about this \nprocess. What they want us to do is pass legislation that gives the \ntroops the support they need. Let us give the troops the money they \nneed to make sure that 800,000 barrels a day are protected right now. \nLet's do a better job of making sure we're making the right \ninfrastructure investments, which will help everybody. Let's make sure \nthat gets done.\n  But this Senator still remains in opposition to drilling in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge, because you can't tell me that 5,504 \nspills on an annual basis in the North Slope since 1996 is a good track \nrecord. You just can't tell me that all those oil spills in the Prudhoe \nBay area and near the Trans-Alaska Pipeline constitute a good enough \ntrack record to now say you can open up drilling in an Arctic wildlife \nrefuge and have no impact. Last year, those spills totaled more than \n1.9 million gallons of toxic substance, mostly crude oil and diesel.\n  We know where this is heading. We know where it is heading with no \ngreat result for the United States. We are not going to see any oil for \na long time. It is a time in which the United States should be making \nan investment in diversifying off of our dependence on oil instead, and \nsupporting our troops.\n  This Senator plans to talk a long time about this issue. This Senator \nknows that we could be going home today, having finished our work, \nhaving a session that is ended, having Members back at home talking to \ntheir constituents and having the troops realize that we didn't play \npolitics with their legislation.\n  I hope we will get about doing business here today and closing this \nlegislative session. That's what we should be doing instead of figuring \nout what three or four other rules in the process need to be broken \njust to try to pass ill-conceived legislation that we have been \nbattling over for 25 years. Let us not hold the troops' money hostage. \nLet's pass this legislation in a clean fashion and get home to our \nfamilies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, my colleague from the State of \nWashington just discussed an issue that is going to be a recontested \nissue this week; that is, drilling in ANWR and an amendment that allows \nthe drilling in ANWR in Alaska attached to the DOD appropriations bill.\n  I was a member of the conference committee that met yesterday \nstarting at noon. I believe we finished close to 5 o'clock yesterday \nafternoon. We had a pretty aggressive and contentious discussion about \nthis issue.\n  I just want to say that while I believe we need to produce more \nenergy, I supported the Energy bill. I was a member of the Energy \nCommittee and am proud to support the Energy bill. It does mean that we \nneed to produce more oil, coal, and natural gas; produce more renewable \nforms of energy; move toward a different energy construct, such as \nhydro and fuel cells; have more efficiency and conservation. I support \nall of that.\n  But I said then, and I believe now that opening the most pristine \narea of our country that has been set aside ought to be a last resort, \nnot a first resort. Deciding to open that now and getting oil from it \n10 years from now makes precious little sense to me especially when \nthere are alternatives. But even more importantly, adding this \ncontroversial issue to the Defense appropriations conference report \nthat is going to come to the Senate really makes no sense at all. It \nadds a very controversial provision to a bill that basically is to fund \nthe actions of the Defense Department and support our troops. I do not, \nfor the life of me, understand why this is being done.\n\n  In order for this to be accomplished, there will have to be a debate \nin this Chamber. When the conference report comes to the floor of the \nSenate, which I assume is going to be Wednesday, the debate will ensue, \nand those who oppose adding this unrelated, extraneous, highly \ncontroversial issue to the Defense appropriations bill will make a \npoint of order that it violates the rules of the Senate, and it does. \nThere is no question about that. This is violative of rule XXVIII of \nthe Senate. My guess is, from what I hear, the proponents of doing this \nwill then, after the Parliamentarian and the Chair would rule that this \nviolates rule XXVIII of the Senate, ask that the ruling be overturned \nand have a vote on appealing\n\n[[Page S13984]]\n\nthe ruling of the Chair--in effect, changing the rules of the Senate in \nthe middle in order to accomplish doing something that otherwise would \nviolate the rules of the Senate.\n  Well, they are going to do that the Wednesday before Christmas, do it \non a Defense appropriations bill. I, for the life of me, do not \nunderstand how they think that is justifiable. But as I indicated, it \nwill be controversial and difficult this week as we go through this.\n  One of my colleagues who is pursuing this says he has a right to \npursue it. Right; indeed, he does. He has a right to pursue it, but it \nwill require, in my judgment, the violation of the rules of the Senate, \nand therefore the changing of the rules of the Senate in the middle of \nthis process. Doing it not only upholds his right but violates the \nrights of others in the Senate, in my judgment. It abrogates other \nrights that exist in the Senate.\n  I know this is all inside baseball to a lot of people, and foreign \nlanguage to people if they do not understand the rules of the Senate, \nbut rules are rules. There are rules established for the way the Senate \nworks for a very good purpose. If, in this circumstance, we decide that \nin this conference we can take anything, totally unrelated, anything, \nand stick it on this conference report, bring it to the well of the \nSenate in a way that is violative of the rules, but then simply by \nmajority vote decide to appeal the ruling of the Chair, it violates the \nrules and changes the rules and changes them back in a minute. There is \nkind of an arrogance there that, in my judgment, does not befit the \nSenate. We will have that discussion at some point later.\n  I wanted to say that I also was a member of the conference yesterday \nin which we discussed the issue of Katrina relief; that is, relief for \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita that hit the gulf coast. I said the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, who comes from that region and who has \npushed very hard to represent the gulf region in a very substantial way \nhas been successful in doing that.\n\n\n                            Disaster Relief\n\n  The one piece that yesterday bothered me, and I indicated so and \noffered an amendment on it, was a piece that the Senate had, with the \nleadership of Senator Cochran, previously represented to the House of \nRepresentatives, and that was there are many farmers who were \ndevastated by these hurricanes in the gulf. These hurricanes came \nrushing through and destroyed all the crops, and farmers were \ndevastated. So there is about $404 million in the disaster package that \nwill help those farmers in the gulf.\n  The point I made was--and I know the Senator from Mississippi had \npreviously supported this point because the Senate position was that we \nshould provide disaster relief not just for those farmers in the gulf--\nthey, in fact, should have disaster relief, but there are others in \nthis country who had weather-related disasters, and they ought to, as \nwell, be people who would be eligible for disaster assistance.\n  In my State, for example, torrential rains in the spring meant that 1 \nmillion acres of land were not planted, a million acres were not able \nto be planted. If you are a farmer and your acreage is in that million \nacres, you are done. You are in huge trouble. So they ought to also \nqualify for disaster aid. I offered the amendment yesterday afternoon \nto add the $1.6 billion to the package that would have allowed us to be \nfair to all of the rest of the farmers in this country who have been \nhit with weather-related disasters, and the Senate conferees passed my \namendment. We sent it to the House conferees, and they rejected the \namendment. So now we have a circumstance where there is no disaster \nrelief for those who have been hit by this disaster and weather-related \ndisasters in other parts of the country.\n  Family farming is probably easy for some to forget, but family \nfarming is very important to our country. These are families who live \nout under the yard light, in many cases far from town working to try to \nmake a living against all the odds, against the potential of a grain \nmarket collapsing, against the odds that there may be disease in their \ncrops or hail or too much rain or too little rain, all kinds of natural \ndisasters. And we, generally speaking, reached out to those family \nfarmers to say we want to help you because we want to be able to keep \nfamily farms on the land in this country.\n  Yesterday's action by which the House of Representatives rejected \nthat aid, the disaster assistance, is, in my judgment, a huge mistake. \nWe have had severe drought in Illinois, Missouri, parts of Iowa, and \nother States. As I indicated, we had torrential rains in some disaster \nareas in my State earlier this year, and there are other parts of the \ncountry in which family farmers suffered the same fate. I think it is \nwrong for this Congress to decide that some will get assistance and \nothers will not, if all have--in terms of the groups who would be \naffected, if all of them were affected by weather-related disasters. I \njust think that is wrong.\n\n  The House of Representatives rejected that because they said the $1.6 \nbillion was above the agreement, and the President and the White House \nwould not support it.\n  I want to just talk a little about our fiscal priorities. Because \nsomething is seriously wrong here.\n  Last year, we had a provision in this Chamber that provided a very \nsignificant tax cut, and it was a tax cut for the largest corporations \nin our country.\n  I objected to it, standing at this desk, but it got through the \nCongress, and it is now law. I want to talk about that tax cut just for \na minute because it is not just on the order of $1.6 billion we could \nhave used to help family farmers struggle through a tough time, it is \nabout a $60 billion tax cut to the biggest corporations in our country. \nIt was something that had nothing to do with the substance of the bill. \nIt was called the JOBS Act that was run through the Congress, the JOBS \nAct.\n  Presumably, it was titled the JOBS Act because those who offered it \nsaid it would create new jobs.\n  In fact, I will read a couple of comments from my colleagues. One of \nmy colleagues says the idea is for 1 year to reduce the tax burden and \nbring those profits back into this country, to invest them in ways that \nhelp your business, and this creates new jobs.\n  Another of my colleagues said, well, this is insourcing. This \ninsources jobs to the United States. This will create a lot of jobs in \nthe United States.\n  Another of my colleagues said if you are interested in creating jobs, \nit has been estimated on a conservative basis this proposal will create \n660,000 jobs.\n  What was this tax proposal? It was to say to the largest corporations \nin this country, do business here and overseas, if you have earned \nincome overseas, at some point you expect to bring that income back to \nthis country to your headquarters and to your stockholders, and when \nyou do that you would be paying corporate income taxes.\n  We have a corporate income tax rate of 35 percent, and when you \nrepatriate earnings, as they call it, from your overseas operation, you \npay income taxes in this country.\n  But there is a special little deal that has been in law for decades \nand decades--in fact, the first person who tried to get rid of this \nspecial deal was John F. Kennedy. That tells you how long it has been \nthere. It is called deferral. Do business overseas, move your plant, \nmove your jobs, do business overseas and, by the way, you get a tax \nbreak. You don't have to pay taxes on those earnings from overseas \nuntil you bring them back to this country. So that has been around for \na long time.\n  That tax break anticipates, though, at some point, even though you \ncan defer paying taxes, you are going to have to bring the profits back \nwhen you do business overseas, and you are going to have to pay taxes \nin this country on those profits. It would be at the corporate tax rate \nof 35 percent, except a year ago this Congress said the following: We \nwould like to create a great, big old dessert tray for the biggest \ncorporations in the country. When you bring your profits back in the \nnext year, we will tax them at 5.25 percent--no, not 35 percent, 5.25 \npercent.\n  Do people around this county have that right? Is there a Johnson or \nan Olson family, that brings their profits back or pays income tax at a \n5.25-percent tax rate? No, no, no. Real people pay taxes at rates far \nin excess of 5.25 percent. But now some of the biggest corporations in \nthe country are repatriating profits to this country and paying 5.25 \npercent in income taxes--5.25 percent, a fraction of what the lowest \nincome people in this country are\n\n[[Page S13985]]\n\npaying. And, oh, by the way, they are also cutting jobs at the same \ntime.\n  Now, let me just show a picture of a building in the Cayman Islands \nbecause it is part of the puzzle. This is a picture of a building in \nthe Cayman Islands. This is a five-story building on Church Street in \nthe Cayman Islands. It is called the Ugland House. This five-story \nwhite building on Church Street is the official address for 12,748 \ncorporations.\n  Now, you may ask, how can that be? It is just an address. It does not \nmean anything. All it means is they set up an address in the Cayman \nIslands so they can run their profits through the Cayman Islands and \navoid paying taxes in the United States.\n  Madam President, 12,748 companies run income through this building in \nthe Cayman Islands. It is just an address.\n  Now, the folks who push this bill on the floor of the Senate, that \nhas now cut taxes by $60 billion--$60 billion it costs this country in \nlost tax revenue from the biggest corporations in the country that are \nnow repatriating income at tax rates that are a fraction of what every \nother American pays--those folks said this is going to create jobs. \nWell, really? Let's just look at that. I will just give you a couple \nexamples. I could bring over a lot of charts.\n  Hewlett-Packard, they are bringing back $14.5 billion they made \noverseas, and they are going to pay a 5.25-percent income tax rate. \nThey also announced they are going to cut 14,500 jobs.\n  Motorola, $4.4 billion they are bringing back in repatriated taxes, \npaying a 5.25-percent income tax rate. They are cutting jobs.\n  Colgate Palmolive, they are cutting jobs.\n  The list is pretty substantial, actually.\n  Merck Corporation is cutting jobs, and repatriating earnings.\n  So to my colleagues who are on the floor pointing out that if we just \npass this $60 billion tax cut, in 1 year--$60 billion tax cut for the \nlargest companies in our country that do business overseas--they would \ncreate more jobs at home, I wonder, now, how they will come to the \nfloor of the Senate and answer the question: If you actually see the \nrepatriation of about $200 to $220 billion, and companies using a \nsubstantial portion of that to buy back their stock, and other \ncompanies repatriating it and cutting jobs, how do you, then, justify \nhaving given a $60 billion tax cut to the biggest corporations in this \ncountry? There will not be much of an answer to that.\n  I think of the quote from Will Rogers when I think of the wool that \nwas pulled over the eyes of the Congress, or perhaps it was not. \nPerhaps the Congress is controlled by a majority who just find it \nimportant every day to get up to see how you can give big tax breaks to \nthe biggest corporations or the highest income earners. Perhaps that is \njust an advocation that is now natural for those who control this \nCongress.\n  Will Rogers once said: It is not what they know that bothers me, it \nis what they say they know for sure that just ain't so. That is the \ncase with this $60 billion tax cut, in 1 year, that affects the largest \ncorporations in this country.\n  Here are some of the editorials and notices about it. October 16 of \nthis year:\n\n       It shouldn't escape Americans' attention that U.S. \n     companies have disclosed plans to repatriate $206 billion in \n     foreign profits this year under a one-time tax break allowed \n     by Congress on the grounds--you guessed it--that such a big \n     tax break would ignite a strong spurt in job growth. The \n     upshot, of course, is that no such job spurt appears to be \n     materializing.\n       Some have even announced plans to cut operations and jobs. \n     Colgate Palmolive repatriated $800 million in foreign \n     profits, planning to cut 4,450 jobs and a third of its plants \n     over the next 4 years.\n\n  Interestingly,\n\n       Even the primary advocate for the special, one-time tax \n     break, economist Allen Sinai, is now soft pedaling his \n     prediction of 660,000 new jobs over 5 years. He now says the \n     efficacy of the tax break will be hard to prove.\n\n  The Chicago Tribune, August 11: Motorola disclosed Wednesday it will \nbring $4.4 billion in profits back under the controversial Federal tax \nlaw that was passed, and announced Wednesday it will cut 500 more \nworkers than previously announced.\n  Hewlett-Packard is going to bring back $14.5 billion. And, by the \nway, they get to pay at a 5.25-percent income tax rate. Wouldn't every \nAmerican like to pay an income tax rate of 5.25 percent? But it is not \nso. Just the big shots do. They pay 5.25 percent, bring back $14.5 \nbillion, and lay off 14,500 workers. Almost perfect symmetry, isn't it? \nYou bring back $14.5 billion, pay a bottom-rate tax rate that nobody \nelse gets, and you lay off 14,500 workers.\n  It is not only this technique that is bothering me but many others \nthese days. There was a story recently in the Wall Street Journal about \nsome of the largest technology corporations that are setting up \nbuildings in other countries. This one is in Ireland. You set up a \nbuilding in Ireland--a tiny little quiet building, on a quiet street, \nin Dublin, Ireland--and then move your intellectual property, \nprogramming, and software and so on to a wholly-owned subsidiary in \nthat country, and then license it back in other countries where you are \nselling it, and run billions of dollars--billions of dollars--through \nthat little address in Ireland.\n\n  What is the purpose of that? Avoiding taxes. So you do not have to \npay taxes. In this case, one of the companies avoided paying $500 \nmillion a year in taxes to the U.S. Government by moving its software \nto Ireland, running the licensing through Ireland, and essentially \nmoving taxes and income away from the U.S. Government.\n  The question is, When will this stop? We are up to our neck in debt. \nWe have very substantial Federal deficits, the largest trade deficits \nin history, and we have corporations in this country that have decided \nthey want all the advantages America has to offer. But they do not want \nthe responsibilities to pay taxes. And they have friends in this \nCongress who will say: Oh, by the way, if you do pay, we will give you \na special discount rate, one of these blue light specials. Regular \nfolks are going to pay 20 percent, 30 percent, 35 percent, 36 percent, \nbut, no, you get to pay 5.25 percent.\n  I think it was Tom Paxton who used to sing that song ``I'm changing \nmy name to Poland,'' after Poland got a Government loan some years ago. \nPerhaps there are American families who might want to change their name \nto Hewlett-Packard or Motorola or Merck. Perhaps American families \nwould like to pay a 5.25-percent income tax rate. And maybe American \nfamilies would like to set up an address on Church Street in the Cayman \nIslands so they can run their income through the Cayman Islands and \navoid paying taxes. But maybe not.\n  Most American families say the Pledge of Allegiance, believe in this \ncountry and its promise, understand we have things to do together. We \nhave a Defense Department to fund. We build roads. We have the National \nInstitutes of Health to fund. We do so many things together in \nGovernment. We educate our kids. We have security on the streets in the \nform of law enforcement.\n  Maybe most Americans know that is what we do together, and the \nresponsibility is to pay taxes. Do we like it? Not necessarily. Do we \nunderstand it? Sure. But not everybody apparently understands it, \nbecause some decide to run their business through this five-story \nbuilding for the purpose of avoiding taxes.\n  Our domestic individual tax rates are 10 percent, 15 percent, 25, 28, \n33, and 35. Those are the tax rates for individuals who file individual \ntax returns. There is only one tax rate I know of that is lower than \nthat, and that is the tax rate the largest corporations will pay when \nthey bring $220 billion back that this repatriation provision allows. \nSo they will pay half the rate of the lowest rate the lowest income \nAmericans will pay. That is unbelievable. It was pushed through this \nCongress with the promise that it would produce more jobs.\n  Most of us said that is nonsense. We knew it wasn't going to happen. \nBut it was pushed through the Congress. At this desk right here, \nSenator Fritz Hollings--now not in the Senate; he retired--offered the \namendment to strip this provision out of that tax bill. Those who \nwanted this provision would hear none of it. They wanted it. They got \nit. So now we have some of the highest income enterprises in the world \npaying a 5\\1/4\\-percent tax rate on the repatriation of profits.\n\n[[Page S13986]]\n\n  When I mentioned the building on Church Street in the Cayman Islands, \nSenator Levin and I had the General Accounting Office do an evaluation \nof who is running operations through these tax haven countries. Fifty-\nnine of the 100 largest publicly traded Federal contractors--companies \nthat contract with the Federal Government, that have tens of billions \nof dollars in contracts with the Federal Government--had established \nhundreds of subsidiaries in overseas tax havens. In other words, they \nwant to do business with the Federal Government, make income from doing \nso, but want to run it through tax subsidiaries in tax havens to not \npay taxes to the Federal Government. It is unbelievable.\n  The point is, we sat yesterday in conference discussions for 4 hours \nand talked about all kinds of funding issues. There wasn't $1.6 billion \nto help family farmers through tough times, but there was $60 billion \nthis year given to the largest corporations to repatriate their profits \nwith the promise that they would produce new jobs. The fact is, those \njobs don't exist. This was an unforgivable gift, a giveaway that made \nno sense. It is one more example of doing the wrong thing at the wrong \ntime and pledging that somehow it is going to help advance the \ninterests of our country.\n  A man named Uwe Reinhardt from Princeton University probably captures \nall of this best in terms of priorities, warped priorities, wrong \npriorities. In a piece he had written talking about tax cuts and health \ninsurance, he wrote a memo at the start of it: Dear God, we had to \ndecide between health insurance and a tax cut, and we took all the \nmoney as a tax cut. We hope that pleases you. A grateful nation.\n  This is, after all, about priorities, what makes our country \nstronger, what improves our country. We have a very substantial Federal \nbudget deficit. Yet we will now, I believe this week, see the \nreconciliation bill with additional tax cuts that will substantially \nbenefit upper income people. On top of the Federal budget deficit, we \nwill see additional tax cuts benefiting upper income people. We have a \nsubstantial trade deficit, well over $700 billion a year, and a huge \nmovement of American jobs overseas, especially to China. Any worry \nabout that? Not much. You can't find much around here. I have spoken at \nlength about it. We actually have the incentive, the perverse, obscene \nincentive that says to a company today, on Monday, anywhere in this \ncountry: If you fire your workers, put a padlock on the front door of \nyour manufacturing plant and move the whole thing to China and hire \nChinese workers, we will give you a deal. You get yourself a tax break.\n  That is unbelievable, but it is in the law. Get rid of your \nmanufacturing workers. Shut down your American plant. Move the jobs to \nChina, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, we will give you a tax break.\n  We have tried four times to shut down that tax break, and \nunbelievably, there is a majority of Senators who believe that tax \nbreak should continue to exist, a tax break that says: On tipping the \nbalance, we believe we ought to provide incentives to move American \njobs elsewhere, get rid of American jobs in search of 30-cent labor \nwith 1 billion people around the world who are willing to work that way \nand companies who are interested in finding places where you can hire \npeople for 30 cents an hour. You can dump the chemicals into the rivers \nand the air. And by the way, you don't have to have a safe work plant. \nAnd importantly, if somebody tries to organize because they don't like \nthe working conditions, you can fire them. In some countries, they will \nput them in jail for you.\n  We say: Want to get rid of your American workers, want to find \ncheaper labor someplace, get rid of all the encumbrances? We will give \nyou a tax break if you want to do it.\n  That is unbelievable, but it is part and parcel of this whole story \nabout a five-story building with 12,748 companies calling it home for \nthe purpose of getting a tax break by running income through the Cayman \nIslands. Once again, companies that want all of the opportunities that \ncome with being American but seem to want to avoid some of the \nsignificant responsibilities; that is, to pay taxes to support this \nGovernment.\n  We will, in the next 24 or 48 hours plus, have a robust and \naggressive debate on the issue of attaching ANWR to the Defense \nappropriations bill. When that occurs--I assume on Wednesday--my hope \nis we will come to the right solution. The right solution is to pass \nlegislation that will fund the troops, fund the needs of the Defense \nDepartment. We have considered and will consider the issue of ANWR in \nthe future. There are other mechanics and other approaches by which \nthat should be considered and will be considered in the Congress. I \nbelieve this is an inappropriate approach.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S13986-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13986-S13989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, when I spoke earlier this morning, I \nfailed to make the comment that there are many provisions in the \nconference report that are beyond the scope of the original Defense \nappropriations bill and would be subject to rule XXVIII. For instance, \nthe hurricane supplemental; we have $29 billion for hurricane victims, \nincluding funding for education expenses, housing, and reconstruction \nefforts. That was not in the bill as it came out of either House. We \nhave the Gulf Coast Recovery Fund. This provides short and long-term \nfunding for Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, and Florida. Where \nfrom? From revenues from the approval of ANWR and from revenues from \nthe approval in the reconciliation bill of the sale of spectrum when \nthe transition takes place between analog and digital broadcasting.\n  Those are predictable funds. They are currently not scored, but they \nare moneys that, when they do come in, will be held in the Treasury to \nhelp those people in the gulf coast who need assistance.\n  There are also provisions in the bill concerning liability with \nregard to the manufacture of vaccines for avian flu. The basic bill had \na provision dealing with the provision of money for research on avian \nflu, but now the conference report before us ensures that the \nproduction of avian flu vaccines will be available in the United \nStates. Without this liability provision, we cannot assure that a \nsufficient supply of vaccines to protect us against a flu pandemic \nwould be available.\n  Our American industry moved overseas. Why? Because of decisions \nconcerning liability. In this bill is a provision authored by many \nSenators and Members of the House that deals with adding to the money \nthat we provide in the Senate version of the Defense appropriations \nbill, the provisions regarding liability and compensation being \nauthorized on an emergency basis, if it is ever needed. God help us it \nwill ever be needed.\n  The avian flu pandemic is a real possibility now. I think it is one \nof the great fears of those who are involved in medicine, and I think \nour majority leader is one of the leaders in trying to develop a \nprogram to prevent that pandemic, if it hits the United States, from \nbeing like the pandemic flu in the early 1900s and what it did not only \nto the United States but the world.\n  In addition to that, there is real money in this bill for home energy \nassistance, the so-called LIHEAP program. There is $2 billion for home \nheating assistance.\n  In addition to that, we provide 5 percent from the ANWR revenues to \nthe Federal Government to provide a long-term funding stream to deal \nwith the problems related to increasing fuel prices and its effect on \nthose people who need assistance to provide heating for their homes.\n  We also have in the bill provisions regarding interoperable \ncommunications equipment. All of us have been trying to prepare those \npeople, called first responders, to have the equipment necessary to \ncarry out their work. There is money in this bill for equipment grants \nto State and local governments to assure that first responders can \ncommunicate during national disasters and terrorist attacks.\n  We also have--again, there is not any other provision in either the \nHouse or Senate bill--we have emergency preparedness grants. We have \nmoney to give all State emergency preparedness people grants, and these \ngrants are based upon population and risk. It is a fair distribution of \nthese grants. Some\n\n[[Page S13987]]\n\nof my friends in the Senate from the larger population States have \nworried about distribution of such funds. These funds will be on the \nbasis of population and risk.\n  We also have for the first time--really at the basic insistence of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg--border security \nimprovements. We have funds for increased border security, helicopter \nreplacements, and security infrastructure, particularly in Arizona and \nCalifornia.\n  In addition, there is agricultural assistance that provides much-\nneeded funding for conservation at a time when our farmers are paying \nsuch record-high energy costs. This is assistance to farmers.\n  Why do I point these out? Those who attack this conference report on \nthe basis of being beyond the scope of rule XXVIII are attacking the \nwhole conference report. The subjects I have mentioned are beyond the \nscope of the original Defense appropriations bill, no question about \nit. We added it. I urged the conference to add it because I know of the \nneed in these areas for these funds and this legislation.\n  As I said before, I read the statements I made in 1996 when the \nSenate at another time had before it a bill pertaining to aviation \nwhere we did, in fact, have an appeal of a ruling of the Chair, and it \nwas overruled.\n  The concept of overruling the Chair is not a disaster for rule \nXXVIII. It is an opinion. It is a disagreement on the basis of the \nsentiments on the floor. It is really the Senate that decides these \nquestions. But it is true that as a result of having such a vote--by \nthe way, I have before me now a report of the Congressional Research \nService that pertains to S. Res. 160 reversing the Hutchison FedEx \nprecedents. On two occasions in the past regarding another rule, rule \nXVI, there has been an overturning of the ruling of the Chair, and by \nadopting this S. Res. 160, the Senate directed the Presiding Officer to \nonce again enforce the Senate rule, permitting points of order to be \nraised against amendments to appropriations bills authored by other \nSenators.\n  That is what we have done in this bill. The bill contains a provision \nwhich is similar to S. Res. 160, which was offered by Senator Reid, to \nreestablish the vitality of rule XVI.\n  Let me say this: By adopting, as the report says, S. Res. 160, the \nSenate directed the Presiding Officer to once again enforce the Senate \nrule permitting points of order to be raised. That is what we have done \nin this bill. We have added a provision which is like S. Res. 160 which \ndirects the Presiding Officer to enforce the rule as was intended.\n\n  There is a basic disagreement. We are looking to waive the rule for \none time. We are not seeking a precedent. We are not seeking to find \nsome way around rule XXVIII permanently. We are saying that in this \ninstance, because of the vastness of the problems we face, the problems \nof Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, the problems of avian flu, the \nproblems of LIHEAP, the problems of interoperable communications, the \nproblems of the emergency preparedness grants, the homeland security \nand border security problems, the agricultural assistance that is \nneeded, and the fact that ANWR, having passed both the House and the \nSenate, has been blocked by a filibuster.\n  What we are really trying to do is to avoid a filibuster being \ncontinued against a bill that passed the Senate and passed the House in \nthis Congress. By putting it in the conference report, we do that. It \ncannot be filibustered. Conference reports can't be filibustered, but \nthere can be points of order. We will be happy to face those.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will understand the reason for \nwhat we have done and why we have done it. We have done it because of a \nsincere belief that production of oil domestically has a great deal to \ndo with our national security and that our national defense cannot \noperate without the basic potential for our own production of oil.\n  In the event of a blockade, such as we had in the seventies, we have \nto depend primarily on our own oil. Today, we import almost 60 percent \nof our oil. In order to operate the Department of Defense in time of \nemergency if there is a blockade, we have to have domestic production, \nand that is a matter of national security. That is why we have pursued \nthis.\n  Beyond this, there is no question about it, this is important to my \nState--to our State, Madam President. You are from our State. The \nPresiding Officer dignifies the Senate by presiding over it. When we \nlook at the problem we have in oil pipelines carrying 2.1 million \nbarrels a day--that was its production at the height of the gulf war. \nAt this time, we are somewhere around 400,000 barrels a day. One-third \nof the oil is available to supply what we call the South 48 States. By \nlaw, that cannot be exported except by approval of the President. It \nhas only been waived one time that I know of.\n  As a practical matter, what we are looking at is finding out if it is \npossible to increase the supply of oil that is brought by the Alaska \noil pipeline to the rest of the country. That means a lot. We are here \nbecause it means jobs in our State, and it means income for our State. \nBut this is Federal land this time. Prudhoe Bay was on State land. We \nare talking about Federal land.\n  By the way, some people argue that this is a pristine area that has \nnever been explored for oil and gas. That is wrong. One well was \ndrilled in this area, drilled at Kaktovik. We have had oil exploration \nthere for years. When I was with the Interior Department in 1958, I \nhelped draw the order that established the Arctic Wildlife Range, 9 \nmillion acres in the northeast corner of Alaska. Oil and gas \nexploration was permitted. Then along came the withdrawals and demands \nof President Carter for additional withdrawals. We had a long debate. \nIt was a debate that lasted 7 years. It culminated in the act that was \ncalled ANILCA, Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, in \n1980. That act specifically reserved 1.2 million acres of that coastal \nplain for oil and gas exploration. When that is over, it will become \npart of the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, but at this time it is reserved for \noil and gas exploration.\n  What this provision in this bill says is go ahead with that \nexploration, which was the commitment made to us in 1980 by Senator \nJackson and Senator Tsongas. I will continue to talk about this, but I \nwant to make sure every Senator understands, although I did say if this \nconference report fails, we can quickly reconstitute another conference \ncommittee. The provisions I have mentioned that are beyond the scope \nwill be challenged. They will be challenged and some of them are part \nof the ANWR provision. We have taken the funds that will be received by \nthe Federal Government and committed them to assist in the recovery of \nthe disaster areas. We have committed them to assist in terms of low-\nincome heating, the LIHEAP program. We have committed them across the \nboard in many places in order to assure that funding is available for \nthese emergency areas where it normally takes time to have Congress \ncome in to being and consider a bill usually in a year to a year and a \nhalf.\n  We are saying in advance the moneys are in the Treasury and if they \nare needed for these emergency purposes they are to be released. In \nother words, the ANWR bill is not only a bill to proceed with oil and \ngas exploration development; it says the bonus that will be received \nand it will be shared in the LIHEAP program, it will be shared in the \ncommunications area and in the disaster area. As we get revenues from \nroyalties to the Federal Government, those will be committed to further \nprotect the completion of recovery from the disaster of these terrible \nhurricanes. It will be there to assist in our transition to a new form \nof digital communication. It will be there to assist the first \nresponders throughout the country. The ANWR revenues are very important \nrevenues. They are revenues that come to the Treasury from the \nproduction of oil and gas. As the price of oil goes up, those revenues \ngo up. They are real revenues, and we are saying to the people of the \nUnited States, if we develop this area, the money that is received by \nthe Federal Government will be committed to those people who are in \ngreat need.\n  So I tell the Senate, if this conference report comes down because of \na point of order, we will go back to conference, but many of these \nprovisions cannot be in there if ANWR is no longer there. I urge the \nSenate to listen to what is in this bill and to understand that the \nmotivation of this Senator in regard to those provisions came\n\n[[Page S13988]]\n\nout of the trip I took when I took the Commerce Committee to New \nOrleans. This is not something dreamed up. I see the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana is in the Chamber. We went down there and, along \nwith the people from the city and the State, we toured that area of \ndevastation. As I told my own people at home by television programming \njust recorded, I have seen devastation in my day. I saw the earthquake \nin Alaska in 1964. I saw the great interior of Alaska flooded in 1966. \nI saw enormous devastation in China in World War II where the Japanese \nhad bombed villages and areas out of existence. But I have never seen \ndevastation as has occurred in the New Orleans area as a result of \nfailure of those levees and Hurricane Katrina. It is something one \ncannot believe unless they see it, and when they see it they come home \nfilled with sadness. How can we possibly help those people? The Federal \nlaws do not contemplate that kind of devastation. The Federal laws \nassist people from normal types of hurricanes and even typhoons and \ntidal waves that have hit our States, but the real possibility is that \nunless we pass this bill, a lot of those people are not going to \nreceive the assistance they should have.\n  I see the Senator from Mississippi is behind me. I would be happy to \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate my good \nfriend from Alaska and commend him for his work as chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations. \nHe and the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, provided \nbipartisan and strong leadership in the crafting of this appropriations \nbill that is now before the Senate as a conference report. I am pleased \nas chairman of the full committee to have been a part of that \nconference as a member of the subcommittee and am very pleased that the \nleadership of Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye has been followed by \nthe House and Senate Committees on Appropriations so that we have \nbefore us a bill that not only funds the Department of Defense and \nrelated agencies for the next fiscal year, 2006, but also contains \namendments that were proffered and accepted by the conference dealing \nwith relief from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and others that have \ndevastated the Gulf Coast States of our country.\n  As the Senator from Mississippi, I have been in close touch with \nfriends and residents of the Mississippi gulf coast area and I have \nbeen pleased to join other Senators in trips to visit Louisiana and \nAlabama and get an impression and find out what the facts are about the \nseriousness of the devastation. The provisions of this conference \nreport will go a long way toward providing assistance that is needed \nright now, not over a period of years but right now, so people can \nrebuild and truly recover from this devastating hurricane.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will approve the conference report. The \nSenator from Alaska did a good job of outlining all of the provisions \nof the conference report. We are particularly grateful that the \namendment relating to disaster relief due to hurricanes in the amount \nof $29 billion was approved by the committee last night. There are \nother provisions in the bill, as Senator Stevens pointed out, that will \ndirectly affect our recovery efforts in a very positive way that are \nincluded in this bill. There is money that goes directly to levee \nassistance in the Louisiana area, a very high priority of the local \nofficials there. We have specified amounts that can be reconsidered in \nthe next fiscal year. All the money cannot be spent in 1 year. This is \nsomething people are realizing. We cannot appropriate in 1 year all \nthat is going to be needed in the outyears. Some of these projects are \ngoing to take not a few months to complete but a few years to complete. \nSo we are hopeful that with the full understanding of the Senate this \nconference report will be agreed to by a large vote of support for the \ncommittee's work in this area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to speak this morning on the great \nsuccess of the conference committee in reaching this package and urge \nall of my colleagues in the Senate, Republican and Democrat, to come \ntogether to have these necessary votes and to pass this important \nlegislation.\n  Let me start by thanking and recognizing the vital work of the two \nleaders in this endeavor. Senator Thad Cochran, the chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, has worked tirelessly on this package. \nOf course, he had all the motivation in the world coming from \nMississippi, but he has also reached out to all of us from all of the \ndevastated areas, certainly me and my colleague Mary Landrieu from \nLouisiana. I want to thank him for all of his great work and for being \nso generous with his time, thoughts, and efforts with regard to helping \nus meet our Louisiana needs as well.\n  I also thank and recognize the vital work of my chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, Ted Stevens, who spearheaded another crucial \ncomponent of this overall package. Ted came down at my invitation, as \nhe mentioned on the floor a few minutes ago, to tour the devastated \narea in greater New Orleans. Nobody can come down there and see the \ndevastation on the ground in New Orleans--or Mississippi, for that \nmatter--and not help but be truly moved and have their whole \nperspective changed. Perhaps the single best example of that is Ted \nStevens. He was very helpful and very sympathetic even before that \nvisit in early November. But when he was there on the ground, when he \nsaw that devastation, particularly in Lake View and the lower Ninth \nWard, when we were standing there together and he saw the levee breach \non the Industrial Canal and just hundreds upon hundreds of homes \neverywhere as far as the eye could see ravaged as a result of that, his \nlevel of understanding and his commitment grew even more. He has \nclearly been a vital partner in this important work. So I thank and \nrecognize his work, along with that of Chairman Cochran.\n  I urge all my colleagues in the Senate, Republican and Democrat, to \ncome together to make sure we have these crucial votes as soon as \npossible and to make sure we pass this important package.\n  I have been disappointed to hear some of the comments from the other \nside of the aisle, particularly those of the minority leader. He has \nexpressed outrage at some of the procedures that are involved in \npassing this crucial bill. I chuckle a little bit when I hear those \ncomments, for two reasons.\n  The first reason is that every procedure involved, every step that we \nwill take this year to complete this important work, has been done \nbefore in the Senate and has been done before in the Senate with his \nsupport. He has voted for these same procedures in the past, every \nsingle one, every step of the way. This is regular order. This is all \nunder the Senate rules. So for him to express this level of outrage is \nironic at best.\n  Second, what he proposes in rejecting moving forward is to reject \neverything in this bill save Defense appropriations. It is not simply \nto reject ANWR, which is the focus of his wrath, it is to reject all of \nthe hurricane relief, the entire package Senator Cochran has worked so \nhard to put together and fashion with his House counterparts. It is to \nreject all of the revenue from not only ANWR but DTV, which would also \ngo to the devastated region. It is to reject all of that. What Senator \nReid is proposing is to reject $2 billion for LIHEAP funding, which is \nabsolutely crucial for our citizens in the Northeast and elsewhere. \nWhat he is proposing is to reject crucial funding for communications \ninteroperability, which is a key need and a key priority for homeland \nsecurity.\n  Let's be clear. The path Senator Reid is urging us to go down is not \nsimply to vote against ANWR. We have had votes on ANWR. We are free to \nvote for or against ANWR. We had a clear and fair vote on ANWR earlier \nthis year, and it passed, no ifs, ands, or buts; perfectly fair. So he \nis not really just talking about that. He is talking about everything \nin this vital package save Defense appropriations. He is talking about \nall of the hurricane relief. He is talking about all of that DTV and \nANWR revenue that would also go to the devastated region. He is talking \nabout all that crucial help for LIHEAP, $2 billion upfront additional \nmoney into the future. It is very important for Northeastern States and \ncitizens and for others. He is talking about the crucial \ninteroperability piece for our first\n\n[[Page S13989]]\n\nresponders, a very important, top priority for homeland security.\n  We must do all that work now, this year, before Christmas, before we \nleave. The way we get this work done is to have these important votes. \nEvery Member of the Senate will be free to vote for or against. Every \nMember of the Senate will be free to vote as their conscience deems \nthey should on all of these procedural matters.\n  Again, Senator Reid has voted for all these procedures in the past. \nLet's be clear about that. So I urge us to put the politics aside, to \nnot make this yet another Washington partisan political fight. Far too \nmuch is at stake for us to do that. Far too much in my State of \nLouisiana. Far too much in the devastated State of Mississippi and \nAlabama and Florida, with Wilma, and Texas with Rita, and southwest \nLouisiana with Rita.\n  If there is ever a time for us to look at the substance and the \nnational good and not Washington politics, it is now. That is what \npeople sent us here to do, not play these partisan games. I urge \neveryone to put that substance first, to put the American people first, \nto put the people of the devastated regions of the gulf coast first and \nhave these votes and pass this crucial package of relief.\n  Let me be clear. ANWR is directly related to this relief because \nsignificant revenues from ANWR would go to the devastated region for \ncrucial needs in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, and Florida. \nThat is very much a part of this hurricane package.\n  Let me close as I began, by thanking the chairman of Appropriations, \nSenator Cochran, and Senator Stevens, the chairman of the committee on \nwhich I am proud to serve, the Commerce Committee, for their vital \nleadership, for their vital work. But for them, we would not be in this \nmoment of huge opportunity to meet the crucial needs of the still \nsuffering citizens of the gulf coast.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S13989-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HURRICANE RELIEF\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana for his eloquent statement about the importance of this \nlegislation. He has been a true leader in this effort to craft a bill \nthat will provide money now, needed desperately by the victims of these \ndisasters in the Gulf Coast States. He and his colleague, Ms. Landrieu, \nhave been very active, as all Senators know, in describing in detail \nthe dilemma that is faced by local governments, municipal governments, \nand county and parish governments in the region. Our State governments \nhave been stressed beyond imagination in terms of trying to make \nresources available to help save lives, to help rescue victims, to help \ncommunities that are struggling to repair and replace damaged and \ndestroyed infrastructure such as water and sewer systems, highways and \nroads and bridges. The list is almost endless of the challenges that \nhave been faced by the people of this region.\n  But the Senator from Louisiana has been, more than anybody I know, on \na daily basis working his heart out and trying his best to be sure that \nwe respond in the way that we should as a Federal Government, to \nprovide the assistance needed for a full and real recovery from these \ndisasters.\n  I also think about my colleague, Senator Lott from Mississippi, and \nCongressman Taylor in the House, who both lost their houses and \nsuffered real, serious personal losses as a result of Hurricane \nKatrina. They have been tirelessly and constantly in touch with the \nsituation as victims of this disaster but at the same time lending \ntheir energies, their imagination, their know-how, their leadership to \nprovide guidance and suggestions all along the way.\n  This is not the last bill we are going to see on the subject of \ndisaster assistance, but it is the most important because it provides \nreal money at once. It is made available immediately upon passage for \ndistribution to those who need the help the most. And it is urgent.\n\n  If we delay and get tangled up in a lot of parliamentary maneuvering, \ncriticism, second-guessing, and partisan infighting, whatever kind of \nresistance to this important appropriations bill, it will be a \ndisgrace. It will be a disgrace to the Congress and an injustice to the \nvictims of this disaster.\n  There are a lot of people we could talk about this morning--State \ngovernment leaders. Our Governor, Haley Barbour, has been up here for \ndays answering questions, providing information, making suggestions of \nalternatives that would be appropriate for the Federal Government to \nundertake to help the recovery, and identifying ways State governments \ncan share in the responsibility. The Community Development Block Grant \nProgram is one of the suggestions Governor Barbour made as a conduit \nfor funds to help rebuild communities and help landowners who have been \nharmed and who were outside the flood plain, didn't have flood \ninsurance, yet they were flooded and didn't have coverage to pay for \nthose losses and those damages. He is looking for ways to help \neverybody who needs help and who deserves help from their Government.\n  This bill provides this substantial amount of money and commitment \nfrom our Government at a time when it is truly needed. I am hopeful the \nSenate will act with dispatch and send this conference report to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  Leadership in the House and in the Appropriations Committee, the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, has also been very important and \ncrucial to this undertaking. The Speaker of the House, personally, and \nthe whip, Roy Blunt from Missouri, have been personally engaged in \ntrying to find ways to reach an accommodation with the Senate and with \nthe States affected. They have done a wonderful job. It has culminated \nin the presentation of this conference report.\n  The Congressman from California, Jerry Lewis, chairman of the full \ncommittee in the other body, and Congressman Bill Young from Florida, \nwho has had experiences with other disasters in the past, have been \nvery helpful in remembering how we responded to past challenges--\nHurricane Dennis, I recall--and there are others that Florida has \nexperienced. But everybody coming together and doing their best to sort \nthrough the challenges, identify ways to help, has culminated in the \npresentation to the Senate of this conference report. I am hopeful we \nwill respond.\n  As Senator Vitter said, everybody has an opportunity to vote to help \nus recover. We hope you will. It is a bipartisan effort. Democrats and \nRepublicans have both been involved, from both sides of the aisle here \nin the Senate and in the House as well.\n  We hope we will act quickly in response to the suggestions made by \nleadership here in the Senate and approve this conference report. We \nare deeply grateful to all who have been helpful, who have come up \nhere, stayed and talked and explained what the facts are, who testified \nbefore committees.\n  We have reviewed all the facts. We know what the situation is. Now it \nis time to act, and act is what the Senate should do now.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the past in this body, I have been \nhighly critical of some of the things that have gone on in the \nappropriations process. But I want to say the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee in this body, with the appropriations package \nwe are going to look at today, or whenever we get to it, has done a \nphenomenal job. I think the American people need to know this is the \ntype of leadership we have been looking for for a long time.\n  All of the additional spending for the victims of the hurricane, for \nLIHEAP, for all of the additional things we are going to be doing, has \nbeen paid for not on the backs of our children and our grandchildren \nbut in fact by making hard decisions on what to trim.\n  A lot of resistance is probably going to come with this, and the \nreason people are uncomfortable with it is because we are trimming the \nsize of the\n\n[[Page S13990]]\n\nFederal Government at the same time we have neighbors on the gulf coast \nwho need help, and those who are unfortunate with their heating bills \nthis year need help.\n  I want to have in the Record that both Senator Stevens on the Defense \nappropriations bill and Senator Cochran I believe have done a fantastic \njob, and they have set a benchmark for where we need to go next year in \nterms of any new programs we need to be paying for by making reductions \nin other programs. What it is doing is securing the future for our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  My hat is off to them. I think they have done a great job. We have \nlooked over the bill since last evening, since the numbers came \nthrough. We are very pleased. There are no gimmicks, no games being \nplayed with the numbers. Hard choices have been delineated in this bill \nwhich will require hard votes but for the right reasons.

Mr. President, I rise today to express great concern \nabout the process, about what has been happening as it relates to the \nDefense appropriations bill. I have supported every appropriations bill \nfor our troops since coming here to the Senate, and before in the \nHouse. I am deeply concerned about what I see in terms of abuse of the \nprocess, abuse of power involved in this debate on a bill that is \ncritical for our troops, a bill that without the controversial \nprovisions I believe would have overwhelming, positive, if not \nunanimous, support from this Chamber.\n  I want to start by reading a portion of a letter from five \ndistinguished retired generals from the Marines, the Army, and the \nNavy, that speaks to this in a way that I think we should all be \nlistening to. This is a letter to our leaders in the Senate:\n\n       We are very concerned that the FY2006 Defense \n     Appropriations Bill may be further delayed by attaching a \n     controversial non-defense legislative provision to the \n     defense appropriations conference report.\n       We know that you share our overarching concern for the \n     welfare and needs of our troops. With 160,000 troops fighting \n     in Iraq, another 18,000 in Afghanistan, and tens of thousands \n     more around the world defending this country, Congress must \n     finish its work and provide them the resources they need to \n     do their job.\n       We believe that any effort to attach controversial \n     legislative language authorizing drilling in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge to the defense appropriations \n     conference report will jeopardize Congress' ability to \n     provide our troops and their families the resources they need \n     in a timely fashion.\n\n  It goes on from there.\n  Mr. President, I would not agree more. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe full text of this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 17, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader,\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Frist and Senator Reid: We are very concerned \n     that the FY2006 Defense Appropriations Bill may be further \n     delayed by attaching a controversial non-defense legislative \n     provision to the defense appropriations conference report.\n       We know that you share our overarching concern for the \n     welfare and needs of our troops. With 160,000 troops fighting \n     in Iraq, another 18,000 in Afghanistan, and tens of thousands \n     more around the world defending this country, Congress must \n     finish its work and provide them the resources they need to \n     do their job.\n       We believe that any effort to attach controversial \n     legislative language authorizing drilling in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to the defense appropriations \n     conference report will jeopardize Congress' ability to \n     provide our troops and their families the resources they need \n     in a timely fashion.\n       The passion and energy of the debate about drilling in ANWR \n     is well known, and a testament to vibrant debate in our \n     democracy. But it is not helpful to attach such a \n     controversial non-defense legislative issue to a defense \n     appropriations bill. It only invites delay for our troops as \n     Congress debates an important but controversial non-defense \n     issue on a vital bill providing critical funding for our \n     nation's security.\n       We urge you to keep ANWR off the defense appropriations \n     bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Joseph P.

Cheney,\n                      Brigadier General, U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.).\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Now is the time--past time. There is no reason for us \nto be here today on this Defense bill. This could have been done. We \ncould have made it very clear that the dollars are there--critical \ndollars are there--for our troops, if it were not for an effort to \nsubvert the process and the rules of the Senate and the efforts that \nhave gone on to put things into this Defense bill that should not be \nthere.\n  Now, I am one who does not support drilling in ANWR. I have never \nvoted for that. There is no relationship, in my mind, to energy \nindependence or national security, as we look at the small amount of \nreserves that are there versus the tradeoff in terms of our environment \nand the commitment we have made as it relates to our environment. But \nregardless of that, that deserves a separate debate. We have had that \ndebate on the floor of this Senate. We have had it a number of times.\n  People have a right to have that debate and to be able to cast their \nvotes concerning that issue, but it should not be included in a bill to \nsupport our troops, the men and women who are serving right now around \nthe world. They deserve better than that. We can do better than that. I \nwould hope we could clean up this bill, get those provisions out of \nthere that have been put in for political purposes because they have \nnot been able to pass in other ways, and be able to strictly focus on a \nbill to support our men and women in the armed services.\n  What are some of the things in this underlying bill?\n  Well, it provides a 3.1-percent across-the-board pay raise for \nmilitary personnel. I support that. I am sure my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle do, as well.\n  It provides an increase for basic housing allowance to eliminate out-\nof-pocket housing expenses for military personnel. It is critical.\n  It provides $142 million for body armor and personal protection \nequipment. How many times have we heard concerns regarding this? This \n$142 million is important. It needs to get passed now. It should not be \npart of a political struggle that has been going on in the Senate, in \nthe House, and with the administration.\n  The bill would provide $12 million to provide treatment for soldiers \nwith head and blast injuries who are returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Again, on the equipment end, it would provide $1.4 billion for the \nJoint Improvised Explosive Device Task Force.\n  It provides $170 million for up-armored HMMWVs and another $464 \nmillion for humvee recapitalization.\n  It provides $293 million for Army night vision equipment.\n  It provides $1 billion to address equipment shortfalls for the Guard \nand Reserve. I can tell you, having talked with so many of our Guard \nand reservists, and having been there when they have left and been \nthere when they have come home, we owe them a budget that will address \nthe equipment shortfalls.\n  We also owe them efforts to support their families and the needs of \ntheir families as they have been deployed and redeployed and redeployed \ninto Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world.\n  We are past time to get this done. There is no reason we should see \nthe maneuvers going on that have gotten in the way of passing this \nbill.\n  There is no reason. I hope they do not succeed. These maneuvers \nshould not succeed. I hope we will say no and that we will then pass \nquickly the bill that has been worked on in good faith by so many.\n\n[[Page S13991]]\n\n  Let me give an example of another piece of legislation where this was \ndone. I commend both the distinguished Senator from Virginia and my \ncolleague, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Senators Warner and \nLevin, who worked through a complicated Defense reauthorization bill. \nThere were a lot of similar kinds of issues of extraneous measures \nbeing placed into that bill, but they worked through it. They kept \ntheir eye on the primary goal, which was to provide support for our men \nand women who are serving us, who are placed in harm's way, who are \nfighting terrorism, who are fighting to protect our families and our \ncountry, keep the focus on them, which they did. They have been able to \nproduce a bill that is for the troops, for the Department of Defense, \nfor the defense of our country, without extraneous measures in the \nlegislation. I commend both of them for their leadership. It is an \nexample time and again of what these two distinguished Senators have \nbeen able to do because they kept their focus where it should be--on \nthe defense of our country and the support of those who are defending \nus around the globe.\n  Compare that to what is in front of us today. Again, these measures \nare worth debating. The other issues that were put into the Defense \nbill deserve debate, have had debate on the floor of the Senate. They \ndeserve that debate. They deserve up-or-down votes. But to take the \nexcellent work that has been done on the Defense appropriations bill \nand put these together is plain wrong. I hope we will be successful in \nseparating these issues so that those of us who strongly support this \nappropriations bill, who strongly support our troops, will have an \nopportunity to, again, hopefully, vote yes unanimously, without the \ndebate on other issues such as drilling in ANWR where many of us are \nstrongly in opposition to that issue and others that were placed in \nthis bill.\n  This is an opportunity for us to stand together, as we have done, as \nwe will do on Defense reauthorization, as we have done so many times in \nthe Senate, standing up on a bipartisan basis for our troops. I hope we \nwill be able to do so again at the end of the day when this bill \nfinally comes before us. I am hopeful that my colleagues will join with \nme in separating the controversial provisions unrelated to defense from \nthis bill and give us the opportunity to support our men and women in \nthe manner which they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan has asked a \ngreat question: Why are we here? And why is this bill before us? We are \nhere primarily because, as I went through the process of trying to get \nthe Arctic national wildlife area, the coastal plain open for \nexploration and development as was promised in 1980, I ran across a lot \nof things that were involved in this process this year that I, \nincidentally, support.\n  I support LIHEAP. There is no question that there is a demand, \nbecause of the increase in the price of energy, for assistance to those \npeople who have to pay more for their heating oil. We tried to deal \nwith that in connection with the reconciliation act, and there was a \nbillion dollars in that bill for that program. We face a demand from \nthe people who believe in it, as I do, that that be increased.\n  The provisions of ANWR in this bill, as we go into the process of \ntrying to assist people who need assistance, will provide for $2 \nbillion for LIHEAP. That is $2 billion in 2006 in terms of \nappropriation of moneys now. These funds will be allocated based on \nemergency needs. That emergency will be repaid by funds generated from \nthis amendment. Those funds we hope will be generated in 2008.\n  Many people oppose declaring emergency after emergency. I agree with \nthat. I think the greatest increase in our budget now is interest on \nthe national debt once again. We have to stop that increase because as \nit increases, \nit squeezes out programs such as LIHEAP. But we put in here a provision \nto go ahead and help people in 2006 but repay it when the moneys come \nfrom ANWR.\n  If you don't want to vote for ANWR, you are not going to get money \nfor 2006 for LIHEAP. People say that is bad. That is the only place \nthey could find the money. That is a program I support very much. When \nyou look at these other areas, I will be coming back time and again to \nsay to people: OK, you oppose ANWR, but where are you going to get the \nmoney to do some of the things we want?\n  We have to stop exporting our money for oil. Every time we buy a \nbarrel of oil from offshore, we export jobs. We export money. We can't \nget it back unless we reduce the value of our exports in order to try \nto balance our payments.\n  I do believe we have a lot of problems. I will be discussing them \ntoday. But it is a good question: Why are we here? We are here because \nthe Senate passed ANWR in the reconciliation process. The House passed \nthe bill as a legislative item. The House insisted that we try to find \na way to pass the ANWR provision in the Senate without putting it in \nthe reconciliation bill. A bipartisan plea came to me from the House to \nput the ANWR provision on the Defense appropriations bill. I had said \nbefore: You don't want to do that. We have it in reconciliation. Why \ndid we put it in the reconciliation bill? Because there has been a \nfilibuster. We are not talking about a fair vote; we are talking about \nan assumption by opponents of this that we must have a filibuster every \ntime we try to find some way to increase our domestic production of oil \nand gas.\n  This is an area that is known as containing the largest single \nstructure on the North American Continent from which oil and gas can be \nproduced. We want to find a way to bring into production the oil from \nthat vast area. A well was drilled there, and it was what we call a \ntight hole. It was agreed at the time it was drilled that the \ninformation from that drilling would only be provided to the Department \nof Interior and to the companies that drilled it, but it must be \nsealed. No one has ever published the results of that well. But the \narea has been drilled.\n  I will say to the Chair that not one of the companies that \nparticipated in funding that well ever was discouraged from seeking the \nleasing at ANWR. So while they can't publish that it was good, their \nactions over 25 years demonstrate that it was good. The question is, \nShould we produce it? If we produce it, revenue from the bonus bids to \nget the leases will be used to repay what we spend in 2006 for LIHEAP. \nThis program is to provide low-income heating assistance. This is a \nvery legitimate way to get money for the home energy assistance program \nthat is needed right now.\n  Another thing that is tied into these funds is emergency \npreparedness. Another thing is equipment for first responders. Again, \nthe funds there come from spectrum sales.\n  Mr. President, the budget estimated $10 billion for spectrum sales. \nThe FCC says it will be $28 billion. I conferred with the Congressional \nBudget Office and said: Look, you have estimated $10 billion, and the \nFCC says $28 billion. I am going to assume it is going to be at least \n$20 billion.\n  They said: If you make that assumption, what you are doing in terms \nof spending in the bill, we cannot validate that because we deal with \ntotal predictability. You deal with probability when you look at that \nsecond $10 billion.\n  I was the author of spectrum originally. Before that, spectrum was \navailable through the FCC when it was released by one company. There \nwas a lottery to see who got the right to have it. They literally drew \nfrom a hat. Whoever got that draw out of the hat got a piece of paper \nthat entitled them to a license from the FCC worth millions and \nsometimes billions.\n  I say: Why do that? Why don't you have an auction for that? When I \nwas in the Department of the Interior, we used to do the same thing \nwith leases on Federal lands. I convinced them at that time to find a \nway to auction those off. That is why we have the auction for the \nleasing of ANWR. We will get revenues from auction, and the estimated \nrevenue by OMB and CBO is $2.5 billion. We know it is going to be at \nleast $18 billion. All we are assuming is there is an additional $2.5 \nbillion involved. As it comes into the Treasury, it is earmarked to pay \nback these emergencies we have declared. I think that is legitimate and \na way to be fiscally responsible--only if we lease ANWR.\n\n[[Page S13992]]\n\n  Those who want to take ANWR out of the bill are taking out funding \nfor the things that flow from it and flow from an additional assumption \nthat the receipts from spectrum are going to be more than estimated by \nCBO. I am going to be back again and again.\n  We have been involved in this debate for a long time. Every time I \ncome here I remember my departed friends, Senators Jackson and Tongass. \nAs an old friend of mine says, I get ``puddled up'' a little. They were \non the other side of the aisle, but we worked for the common good and \nwe got a commitment that 1\\1/2\\ million acres of Alaska would remain \nopen for oil and gas development. As they took the Carter bill through \nthe Senate that withdrew 105 million acres of my State's land--my State \nhas 365 million acres. This 105 million acres is roughly the size of \nCalifornia. All of that is not open for oil and gas development. It is \nnot open for hardly anything. We have national parks, wildlife refuge, \nwilderness areas, and a whole series of classified types of programs \nwhere the public land laws don't apply.\n  But the one area where the Mineral Leasing Act law still applies \nsubject to an act of Congress to proceed is the 1\\1/2\\ million acres on \nthe Arctic Plain. There is unquestioned money coming in from this \nauction, Mr. President. It will be big. Our oil industry is now \ndeveloping throughout the world. The great, dynamic, young President of \nConocoPhilips is in Moscow negotiating with the Russians today to get \nRussian oil for the United States. In 1980, we could not have even \ndreamed that we would have a chief executive officer of an American oil \ncompany in Moscow negotiating to get oil from Russia. We had just come \nthrough the embargoes of the 1970s, when the imports into the United \nStates of oil from Arab countries was barred by an embargo.\n  We are at the point now where we are dependent upon foreign oil for \nalmost 60 percent of our total needs for petroleum. What we are saying \nis why don't we do what we know should be done? Congress passed this \nbill in 1995. Both Houses voted for it. It was an amendment that went \nto President Clinton, and he vetoed the bill.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have a real problem in terms of our \ndomestic production. Let me say this. Production from Prudhoe Bay, the \narea that brought in the great amount of production for the United \nStates, averaged 1.6 million barrels a day in 1988, and it was down to \n381,000 barrels this year. That pipeline is designed to carry 2.1 \nmillion barrels a day, and it did for a little while. It is down to \n381,000 barrels. North Slope production has dropped from 2.1 million \nbarrels a day to 916,000 barrels a day. The production is expected to \ndrop even further during this period ahead of us.\n  The way to fill that pipeline back up is to complete exploration and \ndevelopment of that part of the Arctic Plain left open for development \nby my friends, Senators Jackson and Tongass after a long period of \ndebate. I do believe there is a lot to be said about this bill. In \n2004, our trade deficit was $651.52 billion; 25 percent of that, one-\nquarter--really 25.5--came from the importation of oil. People talk \nabout our trade deficit. That is $166 billion in 2004. The reason we \ncontinue to be importing more oil is because we are producing less at \nhome. We have doubled our energy imports since 1999. We have an \ninsatiable demand for energy.\n\n  I agree that we should develop alternative sources, but meanwhile we \nhave to meet the demand, which is enormous. We are importing now, in \nSeptember of this year, 9 million barrels a day, at an average cost of \n$55 per barrel. We spent $495 million a day--almost a half billion \ndollars a day is going out of the country to buy oil. For every barrel \nof oil we import, we send that $55 abroad. If that $55 was spent in the \nUnited States, changing hands several times in our economy, as the \npeople who work and develop and produce that oil pay for goods and \nservices, it would generate tax revenue. One of the reasons our tax \nrevenue is not going up as predicted is we are importing more oil.\n  For every $1 billion we spend to develop domestic resources, we \ncreate 12,500 jobs. That means in 2003 we lost over 1.3 million jobs by \nimporting oil rather than producing it here. The public lands of the \nUnited States have been closed to oil and gas exploration. This area \nleft open to oil and gas exploration in Alaska has been denied access \nfor the oil and gas industry. We have had a 75-percent increase in the \nprice of gasoline during this period. Why? The total cost of oil is now \ndetermined by foreign producers, not by competition with domestic \nproducers.\n  By developing the resources on the coastal plain, we could create \nbetween 700,000 and a million American jobs, and we would put $60 \nmillion back into the U.S. economy every day that we produce and send \nthat oil south in the oil pipeline.\n  I do believe there is every reason to be here today. There is every \nreason to say let's vote; let's vote on the conference report. That \nconference report ought to be approved. It has money for Defense and \nfor Katrina, in terms of the disaster area; it has the money for the \navian flu, and particularly the liability provisions that are necessary \nto make that work.\n  Mr. President, I think we should think twice about this and people \nsaying something is wrong here. We have repeatedly at times in the past \nchallenged the ruling of the Chair. We did it really in terms of very \ncontroversial subjects in terms of the FedEX bill and in terms of the \naviation bill in 1996. We are not trying to do something that has never \nbeen done. I have heard some Senators accuse me of breaking the rules. \nI am here because of the rules, Mr. President. I am here because we are \nusing the rules to try to achieve the passage of this very vital \nmeasure for our national defense because it has been filibustered. We \ndid pass it in connection with the Reconciliation Act this year, and I \nbelieve we ought to recognize that there is no question about our need \nto develop and produce in this area.\n  I don't want to keep going. I could go all month about ANWR. I have \nbeen dealing with it for 25 years. I don't even need any notes to keep \ngoing for a day. The point is if anybody else wants to speak, I will be \nglad to yield to them.\n  This is a very vital subject, as far as I am concerned. The necessity \nfor it is linked to national defense, there is no question about it.\n  This bill contains $446.7 billion for the Department of Defense. It \nincludes $50 billion to sustain contingency operations for Iraq and \nAfghanistan. It has a 3.1 percent across-the-board pay raise for \nmilitary personnel.\n  My colleague and I, my great friend and cochairman from Hawaii, \nSenator Inouye, managed this bill. There is no question we did our best \nwithin the amount of money allowed to take care of the essential needs \nfor the Department of Defense. Without this bill, the Department of \nDefense has to continue to defer spending, freeze contracts, postpone \nrepair projects, and delay hiring. It is currently operating under a \ncontinuing resolution. I opposed a continuing resolution. I said, no, \nlet's pass this bill, in July. I said when we came back in September, \nlet's pass this bill.\n  It has been delayed. Why? Because of so many demands on the Congress \ncoming out of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. We have been \nimmersed in trying to solve the problems that came out of those \nmonstrous disasters.\n  I do believe that if the Senate votes not to take this conference \nreport, we will need a new conference. We will have to appoint new \nconferees, and the process will start from the beginning. The important \nthing is, unless ANWR is back in there, there is not money for LIHEAP, \nthere is not money for first responders, there is not money for \ninteroperability, there is not the money for the various items we have \nbeen able to find ways to pay for because of the development of ANWR.\n  I predict we can quickly get at it if we have to, as I said, but if \nwe vote to do it, and we can vote today--we can vote for both this and \nthe reconciliation process today--this bill could be on the President's \ndesk tonight. It is right there. It is on the desk. It can be voted on. \nWe are ready to vote. The reason we sat through last night was they \nwould not let us vote.\n  I do think we should understand that the failure to vote on this bill \nis a failure to respond to the needs of the country. My staff and I \nhave worked many days on this. We have worked long hours, as I told my \ngroup at home. We have burned the midnight oil on this one. We examined \nthe needs when I\n\n[[Page S13993]]\n\nwent down to New Orleans with our Commerce Committee. We examined the \nneeds in hearings of our Department of Defense Subcommittee. We \nexamined the needs in terms of the Commerce Committee. Senator Inouye \nand I heard about the needs of first responders and the need for \ninteroperability equipment for them. This bill gives it to them. It \nresponds to their needs.\n  It doesn't pay all of them right away, but it says: Look, you can get \nthe money you need to start this, but as the money starts coming in \nfrom ANWR and spectrum, you will be able to proceed with the programs \nyou need to have funded.\n  This is a serious issue. Our national security depends upon a \nreliable supply of oil that is not subject to the whims of a foreign \ncountry or adversaries.\n  The fuel used by the Department of Defense is delivered today \nprimarily through the Trans-Alaska pipeline system, and much of it is \nrefined in our State right now. Jet fuel in our State used by the \nDepartment of Defense includes 52 million gallons per year at Elmendorf \nand other places, 21 million gallons per year in Eielson, 3.5 million \ngallons of JP5 used by the Coast Guard. A total of 76.5 million gallons \na year comes from current production of oil in Alaska.\n  The Alaska pipeline amendment, as I said before, was not filibustered \nbecause there was complete agreement in the Senate. Not one person \nsuggested that pipeline amendment should be delayed. It was a close \nvote. The Vice President broke the tie on the Trans-Alaska pipeline. No \none realizes it, but at the time, it was predicted there was to be 1 \nbillion barrels of oil produced from that area. We have produced 14 \nbillion barrels already.\n  Overall the Department of Defense uses 4.62 billion gallons of oil a \nyear. In Iraq alone, the total amount predicted to be consumed per year \nis 5.76 billion gallons. And yet we are almost totally dependent now on \nforeign sources. It is not right.\n  Let me quote from my good friend Senator Jackson, then chairman of \nthe Energy Committee, when he addressed the Senate on the pipeline. \nSenator Jackson said:\n\n       The pipeline involves a national security issue. There is \n     no serious question today that it is urgently needed in the \n     national interest to start the North Slope oil flowing to \n     markets.\n\n  That is the Democratic Senator from Washington, chairman of the \nEnergy Committee at the time.\n\n  People today challenge my statement that oil is a national security \nissue. He said that at the time of the debate on the oil pipeline \namendment in 1973. He said, I repeat:\n\n       This involves a national security issue. There is no \n     serious question today that it is urgently needed in the \n     national interest to start North Slope oil flowing to \n     markets.\n\n  This area known as ANWR is the balance of the North Slope production \narea, and it should be available for production.\n  I have a lot of other issues to mention. At the very least, we ought \nto compare our situation. In 1973, when the oil embargo took place, we \nimported one-third of our oil, our petroleum. Now we import 60 percent. \nWithout ANWR, by 2025, we will import 70 percent of our oil. We will be \nmore than two-thirds dependent upon foreign sources for oil.\n  What will we do in times of need? I remember those lines in the \nseventies. Some of us remember them well. I remember rationing in World \nWar II. Are we going to go to a system of rationing? Our foreign \nimports are not that secure, no matter what anybody says.\n  Senator Hutchison is on the floor, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nDefense appropriations bill, in favor of Katrina and Rita supplemental \nhelp. This is such an important piece of legislation. This is a bill \nthat has already passed the House. It only lacks Senate approval to go \nto the President and give the Defense Department the appropriations it \nneeds to do the job we are asking them to do. It will also help the \npeople on the gulf coast who have been waiting for the signal that they \nwill have some relief.\n  I start by talking about the defense part of this bill and say that \nit would be unthinkable not to pass the Defense appropriations that we \nmust have to stay in an orderly way, going into the next year, with the \npriorities we have set for this fiscal year. Continuing resolutions are \nlast year's priorities. So it is essential for Congress to act.\n  I have heard some on the floor say: ANWR is a big surprise. ANWR is \nhiding the ball. Putting ANWR in this bill is somehow thwarting the \nwill of the Senate. The opposite is true. The Senate has voted in favor \nof ANWR. The House and the Senate have voted in favor of ANWR.\n  If we were putting something in a conference report that had never \npassed the Senate, that would be one thing. ANWR has been adopted by \nthe Senate. Those who would hold up this bill are thwarting the will of \nthe majority. I do believe we have a national security issue and an \neconomic viability issue for our country if we put our heads in the \nsand and say, well, we know there is a shortage of energy, we know the \nprice of gasoline has gone up almost a dollar--it went up almost $2 \nafter the hurricanes hit for a short period of time, but thanks to the \nleadership of the President, who took very swift action opening the \nreserves, we were able to bring the price back down, but we know there \nis an energy shortage in the world. We know there are various reasons \nfor that because there are more consumers now, because the economies of \nChina and India and other places are now using more energy.\n  So if we are a country that is looking out toward the future, if we \nare a country that is going to make sure we have economic viability, we \nmust take the steps to assure that we have energy supplies from our own \nresources in order to meet this challenge, and that means that we look \nfor new sources of energy. It means we do research for renewable \nsources of energy. It means we highlight conservation and give tax \ncredits for all of these items that would add to our energy stability, \nand yes, it also means we provide more opportunity to drill for the \nbasic energy providers for our country, and that is oil and gas.\n  For some of those whom I have heard debating, to say, Oh, yes, we \nhave an energy crisis in this country, but we should not drill on the \neast coast and we should not drill on the west coast and now we should \nnot drill within 200 miles of Florida and we should not open up ANWR, \nis irresponsible. We should be looking to open up our own resources so \nthat we are not dependent on foreign countries for our energy needs, \nand we should do it by opening up ANWR, which is the largest domestic \nresource we have. Approval for this has been passed by a majority of \nthe Senate and a majority of the House time and time again. The will of \nthe majority is being thwarted again, because we are looking to the \nfuture.\n  Let us take another argument that could be made. Maybe the people who \nlive around ANWR or in whose State ANWR is do not want it. Are we \nforcing something on them by allowing this drilling? Oh, no. The people \nof Alaska have said time and time again they do want to drill in ANWR. \nThey want to drill in ANWR because they know it will be done in an \nenvironmentally safe way. They know that the area which would be \ndrilled is an area about the size of Washington National Airport in \nANWR, which is an area the size of the State of South Carolina. The \npeople of Alaska know that. They know it will not hurt the environment \nof their own State. They know it will provide jobs for their people. \nThey know it will provide quality education for their children and \nsmall business opportunities for the people who live there and would \ncome there to add to the economy of Alaska. So the people of Alaska who \nwould feel the direct impact of drilling in this very small area want \nANWR to be drilled because they know what it will do for the economy of \ntheir home State of Alaska. So we have the capability to drill in a \nvery small area.\n  By the way, it is grassland. There are no trees in this part of ANWR. \nSometimes I see the pictures on television against drilling in ANWR, \nand it looks like a pristine forest. There are no trees in this area. \nIt is a grassland. In fact, there will be drilling when everything is \niced over anyway. The roads will be ice roads that will melt in the \nsummer, when there will not be drilling, so there will be no footprint. \nSo I cannot think of anything more environmentally safe, and I think it \nis very\n\n[[Page S13994]]\n\nimportant for the future of the economy of Alaska and more importantly \nfor the future security of our country because economic security is \nnational security.\n  Can one imagine an economic downturn when we have had so many crises \nin our country in the last 5 years, starting with 9/11, a war on \nterror, an insurgency in Iraq, Afghanistan, which is on its way to \nself-governance, and then there is Katrina and Rita, a tsunami and an \nearthquake in Pakistan, and we are trying to help all of the people \naffected by these tragedies? An economic downturn--it would be \nirresponsible for us to allow it to happen if we have any control, and \nANWR is part of establishing our economic security by assuring that we \nwill have energy no matter what else happens, whether it is a hurricane \nor whether it is a foreign country that provides a good source for us \nof oil and gas that all of a sudden says: Well, we are not going to \nprovide that anymore, or if we do, it is going to be at such a price \nthat it will affect your economy.\n  We are over 50 percent dependent on foreign sources for our energy \nneeds today in America, and that is not a sign of the strongest Nation \non Earth. So to say that ANWR is a surprise is wrong. To say that it \nhas blind-sided the minority in this body is wrong. The Senate has \npassed ANWR before. We have passed it this year, and it is time that we \nget this bill to the President.\n  In the supplemental appropriations for the victims of Katrina and \nRita, it is so important that we have accomplished the first real help \nthat goes not only directly to the people but also to begin the \ninfrastructure improvements where the gulf coast has been ravaged. One \nof the things I have tried to do in this bill is to ensure that where \nthe evacuees have gone, the money will also go. This is hurricane \nassistance like we have never seen before.\n  In a normal hurricane, there are maybe 2 or 3 months of significant \ndisplacement, and there is a lot of cleanup and a lot of rebuilding, \nbut most people are back in their area after a few weeks. Katrina so \ndevastated Louisiana and Mississippi that people have had to flee with \nabsolutely nothing, and they have had to stay in other States, get jobs \nif they can, get housing where they can, and educate their children. So \nthat has meant that States such as Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Georgia, \nand Tennessee have paid a large part of the expense of the taking care \nof the people displaced by this hurricane, rather than the burden being \non those States actually hit by the hurricane.\n  So we have had to rethink the model for how to provide this \nassistance and how we meet the needs of today. My home State of Texas, \nI think it is well known, has taken in the range of 400,000 \nevacuees. We have in the range of more than 40,000 in our school \nsystems. We have had almost no reimbursement for the education of these \nchildren. We have had to repair schools that were closed so they can \nreopen. We have had to add temporary facilities. We have had to hire \nteachers and also try to welcome these children in so they would be \nable to function in the classroom. This has taken huge resources, tens \nof millions of dollars from our State.\n\n  I passed a bill in September that would have allowed the per-pupil \ncost of educating these students to be reimbursed, which would have \nespecially helped these States which have taken large numbers. Texas \nhas taken the most, but other States, relative to their populations, \nare in much the same situation. These are hits on education systems \nthat they cannot absorb. Yet the bill I passed in the Senate in \nSeptember never passed the House. Finally, last night, in this \nsupplemental appropriations bill we have addressed the needs of these \nchildren in the way I had asked in September that they be helped. We \nare giving the help to these school systems that have taken in these \nchildren.\n  Our school districts and our States have been footing the bill for \nthese added education expenses since the children came over--in \ndesolation, frankly--right after that level-5 hurricane hit the gulf \ncoast of America.\n  To think this bill would be held up because there are people on the \nother side who want to thwart the majority that has passed ANWR and \nwould hold up our Defense Appropriations bill and our supplemental \nappropriation for the victims of Katrina and Rita. I hope those who \nwould thwart this bill would reconsider.\n  In this bill, we have money for the education of the students, which \nhas been a priority for me. It also includes money for repairs and \ndredging of waterways in the hurricane-affected States; plus, of \ncourse, money to start rebuilding the levees in New Orleans; grants for \nthe Department of Labor for displaced workers; social services block \ngrants; Head Start money for children displaced by the hurricanes; \ncommunity development block grants in the hurricane-affected States, \nwhich includes Texas. Texas has spent just about all of its community \ndevelopment block grant money, much of it for hurricane assistance, so \nwe will look forward to replenishing some of that which was needed \nbefore the hurricane. It has money for highway, road, and bridge \nrepairs, and for State and local law enforcement assistance. I can tell \nyou, having toured in Houston, Austin, and Dallas, the convention \ncenters where evacuees were being held, there was a lot of overtime \nmoney for the law enforcement personnel, and that needs to be \nreimbursed because those police departments and sheriffs departments \nare not able to absorb that. There is money from the Small Business \nAdministration for disaster loans and money for manufacturing extension \ncenters.\n  There is an offset for all of this added money because there are many \npeople in our country who believe that spending more money and adding \nto our deficit is not the responsible thing to do. So there is a 1-\npercent across-the-board cut in discretionary spending. Veterans are \nexempt from this. Obviously exempt from this would be salaries of our \nmilitary and civilian personnel. There will be no cuts in veterans \nhealth care. That is something I talked to Senator Cochran about on \nSunday, to make sure we did not cut into the veterans health benefits, \nbecause we had just put in an added $1.2 billion because there were \nmore calls on the veterans health care programs. I certainly didn't \nwant to get into a hole in that department.\n  We have offset this supplemental expenditure with an across-the-board \ncut in the discretionary spending and other areas so we do not add to \nthe deficit.\n  In addition, in this conference report, we have ensured that avian \nflu vaccines will be available in this country. Again, we are looking \nout for something that we see happening in another part of the world \nand are trying to protect our citizens if somehow avian flu does come \nto our shores.\n  The LIHEAP money we have passed on this floor has an added amount of \n$2 billion for home heating assistance. That is very important in \ncertain places in our country where heating assistance is needed. We \nall know the cost of energy is going to be very high this winter.\n  There are border security improvements. I come from a State that is \nvery concerned about the security of our borders. I went with the \nmajority leader just 2 months ago on a helicopter tour of the border, \nwhere we saw the footprints that were very fresh in the fields in \nMexico, that walk right into the Rio Grande River, knowing those were \nillegal aliens who had just come into our country. We went to one of \nthe border stations where we saw illegal aliens being processed. They \nwere not from Mexico, they were from other countries. So the funds for \nincreased border security are in this bill. This is something that is \nimportant to the security of our country.\n  I hope we will be able to pass this bill without being thwarted by \nthe minority. We will have more than a majority if we are forced to \ncloture. I do not know if we will have 60 votes, but it will be the \nmajority of the Senate speaking on these important issues: the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations and the Katrina and Rita \nsupplemental appropriation which will get people the help they need in \nimportant areas such as education, debris cleanup, medical treatment, \nand reimbursement. It has provided for other areas of emergency needs \nsuch as the avian flu vaccine, LIHEAP assistance, border security \nimprovements--things that we have worked on all year in the Senate and \nwhich have the support of a majority of this body.\n  This is not the time to be held up on procedural motions that would \nrequire\n\n[[Page S13995]]\n\n60 votes when the majority should be able to go forward on policies \nthat have been set in the Senate all year. The Senate has passed ANWR. \nThe Senate has passed Katrina- and Rita-related supplemental \nappropriations. The Senate always passes the Department of Defense \nappropriations. It would be unthinkable not to be able to do that \nbefore we leave for the year, to fulfill our responsibility. I hope we \ncan come together at a time when we should show our country this unity.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for not to exceed 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 2145 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the issue before this body in the waning \ndays and hours of this first session of the Congress is whether the \nPATRIOT Act should be extended.\n  Why are people concerned about the PATRIOT Act? Let me read an \ninterview that took place, which is a condensation of a long story that \nappeared in the Washington Post about Las Vegas, NV. Barton Gellman was \nthe writer of the article, and here is what he said:\n\n       At the end of 2003 there was an . . . alert. One of the \n     reasons was a fragmentary report. . . . [At the end of 2003] \n     they tried [the Federal Government] for the first time ever \n     to create an instant real-time moving census of every tourist \n     and visitor in the city during its most visited period of the \n     year.\n\n  Forty-four million, 50 million people come to Las Vegas every year.\n  Continuing the statement of Mr. Gellman:\n\n       They sifted through about a million people who were \n     considered potential suspects to see if they could find any \n     match with any other indicator in their big database of the \n     terrorist universe. So they used grand jury subpoenas, they \n     used national security letters and they got every hotel \n     guest, every air passenger, every person who rented a car or \n     a truck or a storage space, and they made a giant database \n     out of that and started sifting [through] it.\n       In the parlance of the intelligence community, the whole \n     thing washed out. They had no suspects. There was no attack. \n     They had an undeniably important motivation here, but one of \n     the prices that the country has paid for that is that on the \n     order of a million people are now in government databases and \n     are staying there. So if you got a Las Vegas hotel room and \n     maybe if you were there with someone you ought not to have \n     been there with, what happened in Las Vegas did not stay in \n     Las Vegas.\n\n  The question was asked:\n\n       How can it be that four years into the Patriot Act the \n     national security letters have not been challenged in court \n     as, you know, a blatant intrusion of privacy?\n\n  Mr. Gellman continues:\n\n       Well, there have recently been two court cases. We know of \n     only two cases ever in which they were challenged. The \n     plaintiffs are not officially known to the public. I \n     discovered one of them. In the Connecticut library case that \n     was the lead of my story, the librarian who received a \n     national security letter was afraid to call a lawyer because \n     the letter said that he shall not disclose to any person that \n     he'd received it. But the reason there hasn't been much \n     public debate until now is because no one had any idea what \n     scale they were being used on. And crucially, people did not \n     know, even in Congress, that the great majority of these \n     letters asked for information about ordinary Americans and \n     U.S. visitors who are not suspected of any wrongdoing.\n\n  We do not know the exact number of these letters. And ``letters'' is \na word that is not appropriate. These ``demands.'' We know there are \n30,000. Could be more, may be less, but tens of thousands of Americans, \njust like what happened New Year's Eve in Las Vegas. That is why people \nare concerned, on a bipartisan basis, about the PATRIOT Act.\n  The President and the Republican leadership should stop playing \npolitics with the PATRIOT Act. They should join the bipartisan group of \nSenators who agree the Government can fight terrorists and protect the \nprivacy and freedom of innocent Americans.\n\n  Americans want both liberty and security. These two terms are not \ncontradictory. We do not have to sacrifice our basic liberties in the \ncourse of strengthening national security.\n  Democrats voted to support the PATRIOT Act. We voted for the original \nact in 2001. It passed with all but one Democratic vote. We voted \nunanimously for an extension of the bill in July of this year. \nVirtually every Senate Democrat has cosponsored Senator Sununu's--a \nRepublican--bill to extend the act for 3 months while negotiations on a \nlonger term extension continue.\n  We support the act, but we want to improve it. That is what this is \nall about.\n  Now, the President in his press conference today, of course, directed \nhis attention to me, among others. The President, I think, talked about \ntrust and credibility. So I am willing to take that at face value: \ntrust and credibility. I think it should be based on liberty and \nsecurity, but he wants to do it on trust and credibility.\n  Let's take a look at this. On 9/11, we had a terrible calamity in \nthis country. We responded quickly and passed the PATRIOT Act. We were \nwise, though, in setting certain sunsets; that is, if they were not \nrenewed, they would expire. We did that. That was the right thing to \ndo.\n  We are now back, and the time has come to look at how the PATRIOT Act \nhas worked. I read to the Senate what has happened with New Year's Eve \nin Las Vegas.\n  Trust and credibility: The President told us there were weapons of \nmass destruction in Iraq, that there were secret meetings in Europe, \nal-Qaida training in Iraq. The Secretary of State still talks about the \naluminum tubes. She talked about them then--yellowcake, things that \nwere supposedly there so they could develop these weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Every one of these the administration either knew or should have \nknown was absolutely not true. We were told that we would invade Iraq, \nand as we proceeded up these boulevards, they would be throwing \nbouquets. Well, there are 2,200 dead Americans, 17,000 wounded \nAmericans, a third of them grievously wounded, missing arms and legs \nand blind and head injuries, costing the American people $2 billion a \nweek.\n  Ronald Reagan said: Trust but verify. And that is what this is all \nabout, verifying what has gone on in the last 4 years with this PATRIOT \nAct.\n  I supported the first PATRIOT Act. I do not regret my vote. I \nsupported the bill that came out of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nunanimously. I supported the bill that came out of the Senate \nunanimously. But I, with other Senators, believe the PATRIOT Act as \npresently designed is not good for America.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator from Nevada aware of the fact that the \nPresident said today, at his press conference:\n\n       In a war on terror, we cannot afford to be without this law \n     [the PATRIOT Act] for a single moment.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada: Did the Senator from Nevada not ask \nunanimous consent to extend the PATRIOT Act as written for 3 months, \nand is it not true that when you made that request a few days ago, the \nRepublican leader of the Senate objected to extending the PATRIOT Act \nfor 3 months, after the revision of the law was held up here on the \nSenate floor?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I asked unanimous consent that a bipartisan \npiece of legislation extending this bill for 3 months be made \noperative. It was objected to by the Republican leader.\n  The President wants to talk about trust and credibility. I think we \nneed to look at that statement: Not for a single minute, not for a \nsingle hour should the PATRIOT Act not be in effect. Well, the burden \nof it not being in effect is solely on the shoulders of the\n\n[[Page S13996]]\n\nPresident without any question. All he would have to do is pick up the \nphone, call his Republican leader in the Senate, say go ahead, 3 \nmonths, maybe you guys can work something out.\n  This is a bipartisan piece of legislation. We support the act. We \nwant to improve it. That is what this is all about. Let's be clear who \nis killing the PATRIOT Act. Yes, we killed the conference report on a \nbipartisan basis. We did the right thing for America because we believe \nthat liberty and security should be part of this Government. Twice last \nweek a bipartisan group of Senators tried to move forward on a 3-month \nextension but instead of joining us, the President and the Republican \nleadership decided that they would rather see the bill expire.\n  Maybe the President has trouble getting away from being ``campaigner \nin chief,'' maybe not wanting to be as badly the Commander in Chief as \nhe wants to be ``campaigner in chief.'' Maybe he thinks this gives him \na political advantage. The responsibility of this bill going up or down \nis his and no one else's. It is time for the President to put politics \naside and national security first. The President and the Republican \nleadership should join us in supporting the PATRIOT Act and protecting \nAmericans. It would be irresponsible and a dereliction of duty for the \nadministration to allow these provisions to expire.\n  Nobody seriously believes that the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT \nAct should be allowed to lapse while this debate continues. Senator \nSpecter and Senator Leahy can work this out. Democrats are not the only \nones who believe we should improve the PATRIOT Act. Senators Sununu, \nCraig, Hagel, and Murkowski voted not to terminate debate last week. \nAll four of these Republican Senators have cosponsored the bill to \nextend the act for 3 months. I have had Senators from the other side of \nthe aisle come and say: That was a very close call. That was a hard \nvote for me.\n  There is a bipartisan coalition of Senators wanting a 3-month \nextension of the PATRIOT Act in its current form so that we can pass a \nbetter bill that will have the confidence of the American people.\n  Russ Feingold, the Senator from Wisconsin, one of the finest Members \nof Congress I have ever served under, a person who I believe is one of \nthe consciences of the Congress, someone with an impeccable record of \nacademics, a Rhodes scholar, Harvard law, he was the only person to \nvote against the PATRIOT Act the first time. He took this on during a \ncampaign for reelection. Millions and millions of dollars were spent to \ntry to exploit this by his Republican opponent, and it didn't work. He \nwon overwhelmingly. He said at a press conference this morning:\n\n       It is the President who wants to play chicken here. He \n     wants to have the risk taken that this would expire. All he \n     has to do is be just a little reasonable, [allow] the will of \n     the Senate. The law will be extended permanently, other than \n     certain sunset provisions. I think it's clear that the \n     president is the one who is playing politics with this.\n\n  So says Russ Feingold. Just as Senator John McCain called the \nPresident's bluff on torture not being part of what America does--\nrather than calling bluffs, he persuaded the President that we needed \nto check potential excesses in interrogation tactics--we also need to \nensure that we put in place checks on the Government's power to trample \non the privacy of innocent Americans.\n  I would hope the President would put down his campaign hat and put on \nhis hat that is the President of the United States, Commander in Chief, \nand recognize that legislation is the art of compromise.\n  I want to first ask unanimous consent----\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question to my friend.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the majority or even a few Members beyond the two who \nvoted for cloture had voted with the Republicans for cloture on the \nPATRIOT Act, isn't it true that the PATRIOT Act would have been on the \nfloor?\n\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry. Say that again.\n  Mr. GREGG. If we had been allowed to go forward without cloture, \nisn't it true that the PATRIOT Act would have been on the floor, if the \nDemocratic membership had voted for cloture?\n  Mr. REID. The PATRIOT Act is still on the floor. Cloture was not \ninvoked, so the PATRIOT Act is still in order.\n  Mr. GREGG. But wouldn't we be able to complete the business of the \nPATRIOT Act if cloture had been invoked?\n  Mr. REID. As I explained, and it has been talked about for some time, \nthe PATRIOT Act in its present form is not something that can muster \nthe parliamentary procedure to get through the Senate. As has been \nindicated, cloture was not invoked on this bill. The bill is still \nbefore the Senate. The reason being, a bipartisan group of Senators \nbelieves the bill is bad. I have given a number of reasons it is bad. \nThese should be corrected. The bill in its present form is not good. \nThe law that is now in effect, we have agreed that there should be a 3-\nmonth extension on it. It is a bipartisan group of Senators who have \nagreed to that. So I say to my friend from New Hampshire, it is the \nconsidered opinion of this Senator that if this goes down, based on \nwhat the President said this morning, if this bill is not in effect for \none day, the country can't afford that and, therefore, I think if he \nbelieves what he said, then he should agree to the 3-month extension.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield for an additional question.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. My point was, if there had been a vote which had invoked \ncloture so that we could have completed the business of the PATRIOT \nAct, we would have a vote on final passage of the PATRIOT Act, and it \nwould have been put into law because a majority of Members were for it. \nSo since the Democratic leader basically led the opposition to cloture, \ntherefore led the opposition to the ability to get to a final vote on \nthe PATRIOT Act, it does seem to me that you are a little bit in the \nposition right now like the person about 50 years ago in New Hampshire \nwho shot his parents and then, when he was brought before the court on \nthe murder charge, threw himself on the mercy of the court because he \nclaimed he was an orphan. Are you an orphan?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, who usually is very analytical and \nconcise, that example is pretty bad. I would also say that we could \nstand out here and say the reason we haven't finished the Defense \nappropriations bill is because there is extraneous matter put in the \nbill. If that had not been in the bill, we would be home wrapping our \nChristmas presents now. There are a lot of hypotheticals. That \nhypothetical doesn't apply. We are here in the real world. The real \nworld is that cloture was defeated on the effort to cut off debate by a \nbipartisan group of Senators. There is legislation now pending that \nwould take a matter of a minute to approve; that is, to approve a 3-\nmonth extension.\n\n\n                   unanimous consent request--s. 2082\n\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 2082, the 3-month extension \nof the PATRIOT Act; that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; the bill be read the third time and passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of the PATRIOT Act, as reported by the \nJudiciary Committee, S. 1389, Calendar No. 171; that the committee \nsubstitute be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object, would the minority leader \nstand for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. KYL. In the Philadelphia Inquirer, a reporter by the name of \nJames Kuhnhenn has quoted the distinguished minority leader, and this \nhas been out on the airwaves. I don't want people to be quoted \ninaccurately. This was according to a report of December 17, 2005, and \nthis comment is attributed to the Senator from Nevada: ``We killed the \nPATRIOT Act.''\n  I ask my friend, the distinguished minority leader, whether that is \nan accurate quotation of what the Senator said.\n\n[[Page S13997]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I stated earlier in my remarks a few minutes \nago that it is absolutely true that the conference report on this bill \nwas killed. Cloture was not invoked. I say to my friend, the Senator \nfrom Arizona, that is a fact. Maybe the term was the wrong term. Maybe \nI should have said defeated or whatever. But that quote is accurate, \nsure.\n  Mr. KYL. I will explain why I ask the question. It was reported to me \nthat in the remarks the distinguished Senator made, he said, ``Let's be \nclear about who is killing the PATRIOT Act.'' I just wanted it to be \nclear that the action taken to prevent us from getting a vote on the \nPATRIOT Act was an action, a filibuster, or not invoking cloture, and \nthat action has prevented us from completing action on the PATRIOT Act, \nwhich means we were not able to take a final vote on it and therefore \nto reauthorize it.\n  Mr. REID. Reclaiming my time, Mr. President, I appreciate the \nexample----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Objection, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Reclaiming my time, the example given by my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire, about killing a parent and \nclaiming to be an orphan, and my friend from Arizona talking about our \nhaving killed the PATRIOT Act--look, everyone knows Senate procedure. \nThe conference report was defeated. The ability to extend the \nconference report was made minutes after that, saying--in fact, it is \nno secret. I told the majority leader on the morning before that vote:\n\n       You don't have enough votes to invoke cloture. Why don't \n     you extend it for 3 months?\n\n  That wasn't done then. We offered to do that immediately after \ncloture was defeated. We offered it again today. Not only did we offer \nto extend it for 3 months, we offered to take up the bill that passed \nthe Judiciary Committee and the Senate unanimously and pass it in the \nSenate unanimously.\n  I think the appropriate thing to do would be to have the 3-month \nextension. Obviously, this business doesn't mean as much to the \nPresident as he said to the American public in his statement because it \nis up to him.\n  The PATRIOT Act does not expire until the 31st day of December of \nthis year.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to make the record clear. I was with the \nDemocratic leader when he made the statement about the PATRIOT Act. I \ntook it to mean that we defeated cloture on the conference report on \nthe PATRIOT Act. That was the way I understood it. It has been twisted \na little bit by some who want to read more into it. But it is accurate, \nI believe, to say that.\n  I will just ask the Senator from Nevada, at least once informally \nwith Senator Frist, and now four different times on the floor of the \nSenate, we have tried to extend the PATRIOT Act for 3 additional months \nwhile we work out our differences--an extension which would not change \nthe PATRIOT Act in any way whatsoever--so that for 90 days, at least, \nit could continue to be used and enforced without question. Now we have \nhad the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, object to extending the PATRIOT \nAct for 90 days.\n  One could reach the conclusion that the Senator from Arizona opposes \nthe PATRIOT Act as currently written if he opposes extending it for 90 \ndays, I might say. I am happy to allow the Senator to reply. If the \nSenator from Arizona supports the PATRIOT Act as currently written, why \nwould the Senator object to extending the PATRIOT Act for 90 days?\n  Mr. REID. Reclaiming my time, Mr. President. Mr. President, maybe----\n  Mr. KYL. If I may ask the minority leader----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, maybe I didn't have the education of a lot \nof my friends. I was educated in a little school in Searchlight, NV. We \ndidn't have English class. Maybe my choice of words wasn't perfect. \nMaybe I should have said we killed the conference report. But the fact \nis, that is what we had done. People can try to change the words and \nthe meaning of it all they want, but that is what happened. I may not \nhave the ability to express myself like the folks who were educated in \nall these private schools and fancy schools, but I understand the \nSenate rules. Everyone knows that cloture was defeated, killed, \nwhatever you want to call it. That means that cloture was defeated and \nthat bill is still before the Senate.\n  Any time the leader wants to bring it up again, he can do that. But \nthe fact is, we have offered on numerous occasions to extend it for 3 \nmonths. If it is not extended past December 31, 2005--as the President \nsaid, we have to have it every minute of every day. He should \nunderstand that the brunt of it not being extended is on his shoulders. \nEven the only Senator who voted against it 4 years ago said it should \nbe extended. That is Russ Feingold. We have I don't know how many \ncosponsors, but a significant number who believe that could be done.\n  But it appears to me that the White House and the Republican \nleadership in the House and Senate think they have a political issue. \nIf they think the American people are that unable to understand, then \nthey have a lot coming. The American people understand by virtue of \nthis bipartisan vote that this extension should be done the right way. \nThe right way is to extend it 3 months and see if the kinks can be \nworked out. Remember, the extension of the PATRIOT Act passed this body \nunanimously. It was changed in the House. They put a lot of things in \nit that should not be in it. It came back and Republicans and Democrats \nraised their arms and said: You cannot do this.\n  So the fact is, if the PATRIOT Act is not extended, the whole burden \nis upon the White House and the Republican leadership in this Congress.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the minority leader has the time right now; \nis that correct?\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has the floor, yes.\n  Mr. KYL. If the leader would like to relinquish the floor to me, I \ncan respond to the Chair rather than going through the minority leader. \nOtherwise, I will go through the leader and respond to the Senator from \nIllinois that way.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me respond to the minority leader and to \nthe question asked of me. The words that the minority leader used were \n``killed the PATRIOT Act.'' I don't suggest that this reflects his view \nthat the PATRIOT Act should not exist. I want to be very clear about \nthat, just as I am sure the question posed to me by the Senator from \nIllinois doesn't mean to suggest that my objecting to a 3-month \nextension means that I don't want the PATRIOT Act to exist. I have made \nit crystal clear in all of my comments before today that that is \nprecisely what I want to see--if not the PATRIOT Act in its existing \nform, until December 31, in the modified form as developed in \nconference between the House and Senate. I think we can both agree that \nwe understand that the PATRIOT Act is a good thing and indeed it is a \ngood thing whether in the existing form or in the form that came out of \nconference committee.\n  Let me address that for a moment. As we know, in the Senate, we \npassed it out unanimously--unanimously--and it is difficult for me to \nsee why Members of the other side of the Chamber are proud of having \nfilibustered it so it cannot come up--don't use the word ``killed \nit''--having prevented it from coming to a vote when, by everyone's \nagreement, about 80 percent of what the Senate passed unanimously ended \nup in the final version of the conference committee report. By 80 \npercent, I mean of the contentious issues. Most of the bill was not \ncontentious. There were a few provisions that were. On those, the House \nof Representatives in the conference committee conceded most of the \nground. So, in other words, the Senate mostly got its way in that \ndiscussion.\n  It seems to me that what the other side is basically arguing is, \nunless we get our way 100 percent, then we are not going to agree to \nthis. The distinguished minority leader pointed out that everybody \nknows how the filibuster rules work. I think it is also clear everyone \nknows how the two Chambers work together. We pass our version of the \nbill, the House passes its version of the bill, there are a few items \nin disagreement, and those are\n\n[[Page S13998]]\n\ncompromised. It is not that one Chamber gets its way and the other \nChamber has to concede to everything.\n  What has been clear from the House of Representatives is that 3 \nmonths, 6 months, 1 year is not going to change anything. They have \ncome to the conclusion that they have already conceded more than they \nshould have. Frankly, from my position, I would be of that same view.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. It seems to me that were there to be additional concessions \nmade, we would no longer have a PATRIOT Act that could easily be used \nby our law enforcement and intelligence people to protect us. It would \nmake it more and more difficult. As a result, you do have to draw the \nline somewhere and say: Look, if you try to change this any more, it is \nnot going to protect the American people; in fact, it is going to \nprevent law enforcement and intelligence people from doing their job of \nprotecting the American people.\n  There does come a point in time when you have to say this is it. \nEither you are going to be for extending this or not, and that is the \nposition we were in last week when the minority--a majority favored \nmoving forward; I think it was 52, 53 votes. A minority said no, but \nthat minority under our rules had the ability to prevent us from moving \nforward.\n  I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Arizona if he would \nconsider two questions. The first question is this: Is it not true that \nthe position we are arguing in the PATRIOT Act is the same position \nthat the Senator from Arizona voted for in the Judiciary Committee and \nat least did not object to on the floor of the Senate? So to suggest it \nis a radical position--I would like to ask the Senator, has he changed \nhis view on that?\n  Mr. KYL. Let me answer that question, and I will be happy to yield \nagain.\n  I don't believe the Senator heard me use the words ``radical \nposition.'' I have not contended anything is a radical position. What I \nhave said is it would not work. We do want something that will work to \nprotect the American people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I believe it worked when I \nvoted for it in the Judiciary Committee, as the Senator did, and agreed \nto in passing it unanimously on the floor. I think it still will work.\n  The second question I ask the Senator is this: Here is the choice we \nhave. The PATRIOT Act can expire on December 31 of this year or it can \nbe extended at least 90 days by a request being made on the floor. Does \nthe Senator from Arizona think it is better for the PATRIOT Act to \nexpire December 31 than to extend it 90 days?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me answer the question this way: Since it \nis not at all clear, given the holidays and the fact the Senate is only \nin session at the very end of January, that we could resolve heretofore \nunresolvable issues in 90 days, how about a 1-year extension? That way, \nwe would make sure the PATRIOT Act did not expire, we would have it in \nforce, and whatever time it took for us to try to reach agreement, \nthere would at least not be uncertainty; we would know what the law \nwas. If we were able to reach agreement in the meantime, then, of \ncourse, we could pass the bill and whatever changes that would be made \nwere made. Let me answer the question that way and perhaps not pose a \nspecific unanimous consent request but see what the response of the \nSenator from Illinois would be were I to do that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say through the Chair--and I am not sure of the exact \nparliamentary form we are using here--in a question to the Senator from \nArizona, based on his experience working in both the House and Senate, \nis it not more likely that when you say 1 year, it will be 11 months, 3 \nweeks, and 6 days before we consider this seriously again? Has it not \nbeen his experience--it has been mine--that in this legislative body, \nif one says 90 days, it is more likely people will get serious within a \nfew weeks and start talking about real change? Perhaps the Senator's \nexperience is different from mine. Giving it a year means putting off \nthe inevitable. Let's get this resolved and move forward.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator from Illinois certainly makes the point that \nwhen you have a longer deadline, work tends to be put off. I make this \npoint: The distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee is here. \nWe have been working for the better part of a year on this \nreauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. The chairman can tell us when the \nJudiciary Committee took it up. There were a lot of sessions before \nthat. For many months now, this issue of reauthorization has been well \nknown to all of us. We have known what the deadline was, and we worked \non it and worked on it hard.\n  I think people of good faith have reached the degree of compromise \nthey believe they can reach at this point. Given the fact that most of \nthe concessions were made by our House colleagues and that they have \nindicated they are not ready to make any additional concessions and \nthat the President has made it clear he does not want to see the act \ndegraded any further than the conference report presented to us, I \nsuggest that at some point legislators need to make a decision either \nto vote yes or no and not to hide behind what is, in effect, a \nprocedural vote--namely, a filibuster--and saying: We are really for \nit; that wasn't really a vote to kill it; we were just voting not to \nvote on it. When you filibuster a bill, when you vote not to vote on \nsomething, it is the same thing as voting against it in practical \neffect when the act expires on December 31.\n  So my suggestion is that we roll up our sleeves, if you want a real \ndeadline, instead of 3 months from now, we have another week. We are \ngoing to be here apparently until Friday. Let's conclude our work, vote \non it, have an up-or-down vote, and see whether people really are ready \nto go into the new year without an extension of the PATRIOT Act.\n  I am happy to yield the floor to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will pick up on comments made both by \nthe Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Illinois.\n  When the Senator from Illinois says if you have a 1-year extension, \nnobody will get serious about it until 11 months, 3 weeks, and 6 days, \nI agree with that. But if you have a 3-month extension, nobody will get \nserious about it until 2 months, 3 weeks, and 6 days.\n  The Senator from Arizona has made the comment that we are going to be \naround here for a while. I usually like to agree with Senator Kyl, but \nI hope he is wrong about Friday, or maybe, long about Thursday, I will \nhope he was right about Friday. We may be here longer than Friday. But \nwe know we have a cloture vote on Wednesday. So that means we have 2 \ndays, which is twice as long as the Senator from Illinois postulates if \nwe have a 1-year extension. That is twice as long, 2 days, to work on \nit.\n  I do not know what the House of Representatives is going to do. I \nknow that Chairman Sensenbrenner has been very cooperative, but I don't \nknow what his rejoinder would be. He is talking about an extension, or \nI have heard a rumor that there is talk in the House about an extension \nfor 4 years. I do not know what the President is going to do. He said \nhe will not sign an extension. I do not know what the majority leader \nis going to do. He said he is not going to bring it up. But I am ready, \nwilling, and able to sit down with the Senator from Idaho, who is in \nthe Chamber. I cosponsored his so-called SAFE Act. I am trying to work \nit out.\n  We passed a good bill out of the Senate. Everybody agrees with that \nbecause it was unanimous. We made certain changes because we have a \nbicameral system. I am ready to sit down at 2:10, 2 minutes from now, \nor right now, and see what people have in mind.\n  The distinguished ranking member at one time said that if we had a \nmodification on the conclusive presumption about which he feels very \nstrongly--it was the subject of a lot of floor debate--so that we did \nnot have a bar that on representation by certain ranking officials, the \nnational security interests or foreign diplomacy issues were \nconclusively presumed, there couldn't be disclosure, if there could be \nmodification of that standard, I think we might work that out.\n  That is a big point. It would be great for the country if it were to \nbe seen\n\n[[Page S13999]]\n\nthat Republicans and Democrats get together on something, practically \nanything.\n  I yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I think in the closing moments prior to the \ncloture vote and following that the Senator was very open, and I \nappreciate his willingness to come together with the House to try to \nresolve it. What is most important--and I want to say it and I want to \nsay it again--for those of us who offered the SAFE Act and stood \ntogether, our intent was not to kill the PATRIOT Act and it never has \nbeen. I would hope that this process does not end up in the PATRIOT Act \nexpiring without modifications of it and the reauthorization of it. The \nchairman certainly has spent a good deal of time in that effort, as \nhave I and many others. His willingness now to sit down and to attempt \nto work this out, all of that is doable and can be accomplished, \nespecially if the time we are now involved in, in dealing with DOD \nconference and DOD reauthorization and the budget reconciliation \nconference is going to be protracted to the extent of the rules of the \nSenate, then we do have that time more than ever.\n  I would hope it is possible to come together. I do know the Justice \nDepartment has stated that all ongoing investigations would not be \ncompromised during the period of time in which the PATRIOT Act might \nexpire. That is not the point. The point is we ought to do it. We ought \nto do it appropriately, and I would hope that in the end the chairman \nwould take us as close to the Senate version as we could possibly get \nbecause I think the work that came out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee is what this Senate ought to vote on once again and what \nought to become law.\n  I thank the chairman for yielding and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I do not know if anybody is going to \nagree with the proposed change that was made on the conclusive \npresumption. It may be that it is not negotiable. I do not know. All I \nhave to say is that there are a lot of people with a lot of diverse \nviewpoints, and I am prepared to sit down with anybody or everybody and \nsee what those viewpoints are.\n  The Senator from Arizona has been very cooperative. He has views. The \nSenator from Illinois does, the Senator from Idaho does. I am trying to \nget it worked out. On the floor, I am not prepared to say what \nconcessions would be made, but as long as we are going to be around \nhere, there is no harm in talking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am glad we are having this conversation. \nI think it shows that there is some room for dialogue and, I hope, for \nprogress to be made on this issue. I think it is unfortunate some of \nthese statements made earlier today by the President suggesting that \nthose who did not share his point of view on this issue were somehow \nnot as sensitive to the threat of terrorism. I can assure the President \nand all listening to this debate there is sensitivity to that threat of \nterrorism on both sides of the aisle by people who were on both sides \nof that cloture vote on the PATRIOT Act.\n  What is at issue are some fundamental questions about our \nconstitutional rights, our freedoms, and liberties in America. Each of \nus, when we assume the responsibility of Senator, swears to uphold the \nConstitution. There are so many important elements within that \nConstitution, but one might argue that the Bill of Rights is the most \nimportant because it is a guarantee of our individual rights and \nfreedoms. So when we initially enacted the PATRIOT Act in the fear that \nwas gripping this country after 9/11, there was a concern that perhaps \nwe had gone too far; perhaps we had given the Government more authority \nover our privacy, more authority over our freedom, than was necessary.\n  In the bipartisan wisdom of those who wrote the act, we promised that \n4 years afterwards we would revisit it and see if, in fact, it needed \nto be changed in any respect. That is what this debate is all about.\n  There may be some today who argue we should do away with the PATRIOT \nAct, but I cannot say who they might be. The only Senator who voted \nagainst it is supporting the reform that passed the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, so it is clear that he was prepared to vote for a PATRIOT \nAct with some modifications.\n  The Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, and I have been the lead \ncosponsors of the SAFE Act which, as he accurately described, was an \nattempt to modify the PATRIOT Act, not to abolish it, but to modify it, \nin certain respects, so as to protect our basic freedoms and liberties. \nWe were happy at the end of the debate in the Senate when the bill came \nforward in the Judiciary Committee on a unanimous, bipartisan vote, \nwhich I hasten to add is a rare thing in the Judiciary Committee, if \nnot the Senate. A unanimous, bipartisan vote on this measure brought it \nto the floor where it was enacted by a voice vote since there was no \nobjection to it on the Senate floor. That is an amazing testimony to \nthe fine work of the Senator from Pennsylvania as chairman of the \ncommittee and all the Members who compromised to reach that point.\n\n  It is worth noting for the record when that occurred. It occurred in \nJuly. It was in July that we finished our work on this and sent it over \nto the House of Representatives, understanding we were backing up \nagainst the deadline of December 31. It was not until November 9 of \nthis year that the House appointed their conferees. They waited 3 \nmonths or more before they appointed conferees and sat down to \nseriously debate this issue. Then a few weeks later, even with \nThanksgiving intervening, they produced this conference report. So if \nit is a matter of timing, it does not take that long to try to work out \ndifferences.\n  That is why those of us who are proposing a 3-month extension believe \nit is entirely appropriate and possible that we would reach an \nagreement in that short period of time.\n  I would like to spend a moment reflecting on the substance of this \ndebate. We have talked about the Senate procedure and timing and what \nwords were spoken by Members and what they meant, but it is important \nto get down to the substance of the issue to understand that what we \nare talking about are some fairly fundamental issues.\n  The first is the question of Section 215. That is a section that will \nallow the Government to obtain medical records, financial records, \nlibrary records and other sensitive personal information simply by \nshowing, under the current PATRIOT Act, that the information might be \nrelevant to an authorized investigation. That is as low a standard as I \ncan imagine, and it basically means that the Government, without proof \nof any wrongdoing on the part of any individual or group of \nindividuals, could secure a great deal of private personal information \nand cull through it simply by saying it may be relevant to an \nauthorized investigation.\n  When we passed the Senate bill reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act, we said \nthat it really should be a higher standard, not an impossible standard \nbut a higher standard; that the person whose records are being sought \nhas at least some connection to the kind of conduct we are trying to \nguard against. That is not a huge leap in terms of our legal standard \nin America. It is consistent with what we call due process.\n  The second concern with Section 215 is an equally important one. \nAssume that one is the custodian administrator of records, either at a \nbusiness or at a hospital, and they receive a notice under section 215 \nof the PATRIOT Act, the Federal Government wants all of their records \nin their hospital on hundreds, if not thousands, of patients, and they \nbelieve that is an unwarranted intrusion into the privacy of their \nclients; what can one do if they believe the Government has gone too \nfar?\n  Currently, under the PATRIOT Act, they are precluded from even \narguing their case in court, arguing that the Government has gone too \nfar. And section 215 has an automatic permanent gag that prevents any \nperson from speaking out, even if he believes his rights have been \nviolated. In my mind, that is a fundamental attack on a very basic \nfreedom in America.\n  So when we wrote the revision of the PATRIOT Act in the Senate, which \nall\n\n[[Page S14000]]\n\nof the Senators voted for, Democrats and Republicans, we said we would \ngive a person the right to go to court and to ask that this gag order \nbe lifted so that they could argue the merits of the Government's \nactivities. Those are two critical issues when it comes to the rights \nof the freedoms of Americans.\n  To argue that they are inconsequential, that they are not worthy of \nfight, is to ignore our basic responsibility. Many of us who are \narguing to extend the PATRIOT Act also want to include in it some very \nfundamental protections of the rights of Americans. That is what this \ndebate is about.\n  It is not about who can get the upper hand on the political debate on \na day-to-day basis. I think most Americans are weary of that. I am. \nWhat we are trying to do is extend the PATRIOT Act for 90 days past \nDecember 31 and work out these differences, significant differences but \ndifferences we can address and address successfully.\n  It is interesting to note that this debate about the PATRIOT Act, \nwhich is going on on the floor of the Senate and in the President's \npress conference, is occurring at a moment in time which is freighted \nwith significance in terms of the activities of this Government in \nrelation to the privacy and the personal rights of its citizens.\n  It was disclosed in the New York Times and Washington Post and other \nmajor papers last week that for several years now our Government has \nbeen eavesdropping on American citizens through the National Security \nAgency. This, to me, is a dramatic departure from the basic rules and \nprocess we followed for over 30 years in America, where we have said \nthat if you want to listen in on the conversation of my neighbor or \nsomeone in my family, you need to have a legal right to do so and that \nlegal right will be established by going to court to establish why it \nis necessary for you to listen in on that conversation; to establish, \nfor example, probable cause that a crime has been committed or probable \ncause or evidence that someone has engaged in unlawful activities. That \nis the American standard. It appears now, from what the President has \nsaid, that this administration for several years has rejected that \nstandard. The President has assumed the power to eavesdrop on the \nconversations of innocent Americans on the possibility that they will \ncome up with some evidence of wrongdoing. This is not only illegal, it \nborders if not crosses the border into a violation of criminal law. It \nis extremely significant.\n  In this holiday season with all the other things we are thinking \nabout personally, with the rush of Congress to adjourn and go home and \nbe with our families, I don't know if we are reflecting on the \nsignificance of what we have learned in the last several days. To think \nthat any President of the United States believes he has the power as \nCommander in Chief to basically avoid, ignore, or violate the laws of \nthe land is a significant charge.\n  I am encouraged that Senator Specter, the chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, a member of the President's own party, from \nPennsylvania, has promised us a thorough investigation when we return \nin January as to what has been occurring in terms of the National \nSecurity Agency and this eavesdropping. But I raise this because our \nentire discussion of the PATRIOT Act is in the context of this \nconsideration: Simply stated, have we gone too far in violating the \nbasic rights and liberties and freedoms of Americans in our pursuit for \nsecurity and safety? Can we strike a balance and be safe as a nation \nwithout endangering our basic freedoms and liberties? I think this \nquestion of eavesdropping on hundreds if not thousands of innocent \nAmericans raises that question foursquare. But I also believe the \nextension of the PATRIOT Act does as well.\n  When the Democratic leader of the Senate comes before the body twice \ntoday, as he did last week, and asks for an extension of time so the \nPATRIOT Act will still be in force, can still be used for 90 days while \nwe work out these significant questions, it is a good-faith offer. For \nhis critics--whether in the executive branch or legislative branch--to \nsuggest that he wants to do away with the PATRIOT Act or he is \ninsensitive to the terrorist threat is not a fair characterization of \nhis position nor the position of many of us. We believe the PATRIOT Act \nis important, but we believe some modifications will make it an act \nthat is more consistent with our constitutional rights.\n  I hope the Republican leadership in the Senate will reconsider their \nposition. I hope they will allow us to extend the PATRIOT Act for 90 \ndays. We can go home for the holidays and return in January, which the \nSenate Judiciary Committee is going to do, anyway, and get down to \nbusiness, rolling up our sleeves to work out this conference committee. \nLet's make sure the PATRIOT Act is not only reenacted but in a fashion \nthat is consistent with our basic freedoms.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I want to again commend the Senator for \nreminding the Senate of the substance of the issue. The substance of \nthe issue is that Americans are quite concerned they are going to lose \ntheir civil liberties. They certainly want the Government of the United \nStates to in fact prosecute the war against terrorists, but they don't \nwant our society, because of our protection of civil liberties, to \nchange into some other kind of society. Would the Senator agree that is \nthe substantial majority opinion in this country, to protect our civil \nliberties?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It certainly is in my State of Illinois and I suspect \nnationwide. It is interesting to me, the passions that many of our \ncolleagues bring to the fight of protecting a person's money--which is \nan important part of our job--but when it comes to protecting our \nfreedoms, I don't see the same level of passionate commitment. I hope \nwe will see that change during the course of this debate. But I think \nAmericans value their freedoms very much.\n  I always recall, as a practicing attorney, how many people would be \ndismissive of criminal procedures to protect defendants until it was \ntheir teenage son or daughter who was arrested and then they came to \ntheir attorney and said, What can we do? What does the law provide to \nprotect us?\n  I think we should all be sensitive to that fact.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few moments--there are a few details \nbeing worked out in the next few seconds--we will be moving to \nhopefully get the clock started on the omnibus deficit reduction bill. \nAs our colleagues know, as I outlined this morning, we have 10 hours to \nspend on that conference report. Then I know there are other \ndiscussions and comments that are wanted to be made about the PATRIOT \nAct. We plan on doing that using that time. A number of people have \nbeen waiting to speak on that.\n  At this juncture, while we work out the last few remaining details, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14000-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

That is for getting the clock \nstarted.\n  But, in the meantime, because we are sitting here with empty time, I \nask unanimous consent that Senator Kyl be permitted to speak, followed \nby Senator Kerry, in which case my intention is to come back and \npropound the unanimous consent request at that juncture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this resumes our discussion of the PATRIOT \nAct, which we were discussing before this little interlude. Since much \nof the attention has been focused on section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, I \nwant to discuss that for a little bit.\n  The Senator from Illinois, for example, was talking about that just \nbefore we broke and, specifically, talked about the subject of section \n215, which includes financial records, library records. Incidentally, \n``library'' is never mentioned in the PATRIOT Act. It is just that \nlibrary records are included in the general definition of business \nrecords. As a result, people have focused on that. So we are going to \ntalk about that for just a little bit.\n  As he pointed out, the standard for a court to issue a warrant is \nrelevance. That is the same standard that is used in all the other \ncivil subpoenas. It is a standard that the courts had begun to impose \nsince we did not have a standard within the law itself. Given the fact \nthat is the standard the courts began to impose--and it is a reasonable \nstandard--we amended that into the law. Part of what passed the Senate \nunanimously was a relevance standard. So there is nothing wrong with \nhaving a relevance standard. I would think those who are weary of the \napplication of the PATRIOT Act would agree this was a good addition. It \nis an additional safeguard to have a relevant standard.\n\n  What exactly is section 215? That is what I would like to address. \nWhat it allows is for the FBI to seek an order from the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act Court for the production of tangible \nthings--that is the definition--including books, records, papers, \ndocuments, and other items for an investigation to obtain foreign \nintelligence information. That is the key. You are before the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act Court, and you are asking for information \nthat pertains to an investigation of foreign intelligence information. \nThat is further defined in the act as information relating to foreign \nespionage, foreign sabotage or international terrorism.\n  It is impossible to get from the court--talking about getting an \norder from a judge--anything that isn't relevant to foreign espionage, \nforeign sabotage or international terrorism. All of this concern about \nwanting to find out what kind of books you checked out from the library \nis simply wrong. Anybody who talks about it in those terms and knows \nwhat I have said cannot be serious about objecting to section 215 of \nthe PATRIOT Act.\n  Let's put it in context. There are 335 administrative subpoenas \nauthorized for our Government. For example, if you are suspected of \nMedicare fraud, the Department of Health and Human Services has to \nissue an administrative subpoena to get information relating to whether \nyou might be guilty of Medicare fraud, such as your business records or \nsomebody else's business records that would perhaps go to proving that \ncase. Or perhaps bank fraud, you could get the bank records that might \npertain to that. In none of these other 335 cases is it necessary to go \nto a court first. There is only one exception. Under the PATRIOT Act, \nyou are required to go to the FISA Court in order to get a subpoena \nwith respect to terrorism. One would think that given the seriousness \nof terrorism and sometimes the emergency nature of it, it would be \neasier to get a subpoena dealing with terrorism than it would Medicare \nfraud or bank fraud. That is not the case. We care so much about civil \nliberties, we added this requirement that you have to go to court first \nin order to get the subpoena. This is not a search warrant. This is a \nsubpoena. It is merely a request for information. Unlike a warrant, a \nsubpoena does not allow the Government to enter someone's home or \nbusiness or property to take things. It is only a request. If the \nrecipient objects to it, the Government has to go to court and defend \nthe subpoena and seek an order for its enforcement. That, too, is where \nI disagree with my friend from Illinois. There is an ability to say, \nno, we will not submit the records, in which case the Government has to \nprove them in court.\n  Most Government agencies already have the authority to issue \nsubpoenas, and there are 335 of them in the code. It is interesting. If \nMohamed Atta were suspected of Medicare fraud, then the Department of \nHealth and Human Services could get a subpoena into business records \nthat might demonstrate whether he is connected with that Medicare \nfraud. It seems to me to be a little bit incongruous not to allow the \nDepartment of Justice to go to the FISA Court and ask for a subpoena in \nthe event that they suspect him of terrorism, especially when we have \nadded the other protections in here that the conference report has \nadded--the relevancy standard and an additional three-part test that \nmakes it clear that it has to relate to foreign espionage or terrorism.\n  Some people say: The section 215 subpoena is a little different \nbecause these other subpoenas relate to regulated industries. Even \nsubpoenas that are involved in investigating industries that are used \nto get information from citizens outside the regulated industry use it \nin a situation where people are outside of the industry and not just \nthe regulated industry itself. For example, if you are talking about \nsome kind of business fraud, if the SBA is seeking an administrative \nsubpoena, they are not just subpoenaing the beneficiary itself. They \ncan subpoena others doing business with the entity under investigation. \nIn one important way, the PATRIOT Act has more protections in it than \nany of the others because you are required to go to court first. I dare \nsay that most of the people who are raising questions about this don't \nadvertise the fact that you have to go to court, you have to get \napproval from a judge first.\n  Even a subpoena to appear before a grand jury is issued without going \nto the judge. There may be a misconception about that, but all the \nprosecutor has to do is write out the subpoena and you have to supply \nthese business records in accordance with the law to the grand jury. \nYou never have to go to a court first. The only time you have to go to \ncourt first is a subpoena invoked under section 215.\n  One of the complaints is that 215 can be used to obtain books from \nlibraries or other kinds of business records. Of course, to the extent \nlibrary records are business records, that is true. But it does not, \nobviously, allow the FBI to simply go into a library and figure out \nwhat somebody is reading. It can be used to get library records but \nonly if they are relevant to an investigation into foreign espionage or \nterrorism.\n\n  Let me give an example. Some people remember the case of the \nUnabomber, Ted Kaczynski. This was an example given by the Justice \nDepartment because his brother had actually relayed to Federal agents \nhis suspicion that Ted Kaczynski was behind the decades-long string of \nattacks. Remember the mail bomb attacks? At the time, the Unabomber had \npublished his manifesto in the New York Times which cited several \nobscure, even ancient texts. In order to confirm the brother's \nsuspicions, Federal agents subpoenaed Ted Kaczynski's library records \nand discovered that he had, in fact, checked out the obscure texts that \nhad been cited in the manifesto, thus helping lead them to Ted \nKaczynski as the Unabomber. Is there anything wrong with that? Would \nanybody have an objection to that? That didn't even require going to a \ncourt to get the subpoena.\n  Section 215 also could have been used directly in investigating the \nconspirators who acted on September 11. How so? We now know that in \nAugust of 2001, a month before September 11, individuals using Internet \naccounts registered to Nawaf al Hazmi and Khalid al Midhar had used \npublic access computers in the library of a State college in New \nJersey. The computers in the library were used to shop for and review \nairline tickets on the Internet travel reservation site. Al Hazmi and \nal Midhar were hijackers aboard American Airlines Flight 77, the flight \nthat took off from Dulles Airport and crashed into the Pentagon. The \nlast documented visit to the library occurred on August 30, 2001, a \ndozen or so days before that fateful day. On that occasion, records \nindicate that a person using al Hazmi's account used the library's \ncomputer to review September 11 reservations he had previously booked.\n  I hope the significance of this sinks in. Library records confirmed \nairline reservations on September 11. During that same month, August of \n2001, Federal agents knew that al Midhar and al Hazmi had entered the \nUnited States and initiated a search for those two\n\n[[Page S14002]]\n\nknown associates of al-Qaida. Had the investigators caught the trail of \nthese individuals and had the PATRIOT Act already been law, the \ninvestigators likely would have used section 215 to review the \nlibrary's records of their Internet usage. Imagine if we had then \npicked them up, how the course of history might have changed.\n  This is the use of section 215 relative to library records. It has \nnothing to do with you and me, nothing to do with what we read in the \nlibrary. It has to do with determining whether there is information \nrelevant to a foreign terrorist or international espionage, nothing \nmore. It could theoretically have had an impact on the course of events \nthat occurred on September 11, had we been able to use it in connection \nwith al Hazmi and al Midhar. I also want to mention the fact that over \nhalf a dozen reports submitted by the inspector general of the \nDepartment of Justice have uncovered no instances of abuse of this \nsection. The latest public report indicates that the authority had been \nused approximately three dozen times and that it had not been found to \nhave been abused. Moreover, in the conference report which was \nfilibustered, the one we would like to be able to vote on so that the \nact could be reauthorized, we require reports every 6 months to the \nCongress. These reports are very specific as to the kinds of \ninformation with respect to section 215 that we want to review, \nincluding whether, as a result of the audits done by the inspector \ngeneral, there is any potential abuse or there was any potential abuse \nof this section.\n  So, Mr. President, we have the original section 215, which already \nhad protections that are unlike any other use of an administrative \nsubpoena; added onto that is the requirement that you have to go to the \nFISA Court, that it must relate and must be relevant to an \ninvestigation into espionage or terrorism. And we have an after-the-\nfact report so that if anything went wrong, or that the inspector \ngeneral had reason to suspect. That information comes to the Members of \nCongress every 6 months. It seems to me that any fair reading and fair \nconsideration of section 215 would lead to the conclusion that it is an \nauthority that we need, that it is an important tool for law \nenforcement, that it has adequate protections built into it, and that \nall of the hype that surrounds this is, frankly, just exactly that--\nthat it is an effort to draw some kind of conclusion, create some kind \nof confusion here that something is wrong with the law, that it is \npotentially used to eavesdrop on American citizens or somehow sneak \ntheir records in a way that could nefariously be used by the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  There is not one example where this has occurred or where anybody is \ncomplaining about the use of section 215 that harmed them. With all of \nthe protections we have built in, I ask my colleagues, what else \nexactly do you want? What could you do? How would you change this? What \nwould be different? Why isn't the bill that is before us adequate to \nboth protect American civil liberties and, importantly, protect all of \nour freedoms by giving law enforcement and intelligence agencies the \nability they need to carry out their mission?\n  Let me conclude with respect to this argument that if we just had a \nlittle bit more time, maybe we could reopen this and resolve issues. \nFirst of all, the conference committee is closed. As a matter of \nprocedure, we cannot just reopen a conference committee. Secondly, a \nlot of things could have been raised or were raised in conference \ncommittee that would be revisited.\n  I will tell you what some of those things would be in the event you \nare interested in having these things revisited. I wanted to include a \nprovision relating to terrorist hoaxes. That is not in here. We know \nwhen somebody phones in with a hoax, the police or the fire department \nor the bomb squad or the hazardous material squad need to be sent out. \nIt can be a horrible drain on law enforcement, and there ought to be a \nway to deal with these hoaxes in a much more serious way.\n  Law enforcement would like to have a better definition of ``material \nsupport.'' This is used in statutes to deal with people who are \nproviding support--the accessory before the fact kind of situation. \nBecause of the kind of support that can be provided to terrorists, that \nsection probably could stand some further definition. I would like to \nbe able to do that in another conference committee.\n  The Classified Information Procedures Act is something that was \ninitially considered and should be considered again if a new conference \ncommittee is opened. Frankly, the House was asked to eliminate an \nimportant death penalty provision, and they did that in conference, as \nwell as some other provisions that I very strongly would like to have \nin the bill.\n  Let it be clear that if a new conference committee were created, \nthere would be all sorts of issues that would be brought to bear, and \nnegotiation is a two-way street. There are other ways we could improve \non by strengthening the PATRIOT Act. I would want to be sure that those \nthings are developed and are brought to bear.\n  Finally is this matter that has been brought up regarding \neavesdropping on the citizens of the United States. A couple of my \ncolleagues, just before the vote on the PATRIOT Act on the cloture \nmotion, said they had been going back and forth on whether to support \nit. They read the article in the New York Times and that was \ndispositive in their minds that they had to vote against cloture. Bear \nit in mind, it has nothing to do with the PATRIOT Act. In other words, \nthe disclosure of this kind of intelligence gathering that has been in \nthe news in the last 72 hours or so has nothing whatsoever to do with \nthe PATRIOT Act. I gather there is a view that, well, if the \nadministration does one kind of thing, they might therefore be willing \nto abuse the law in another situation. That is exactly why all of these \nprotections have been built into the PATRIOT Act.\n  I would think my colleagues would want to pass the PATRIOT Act, make \nsure that it is now the law, rather than leaving the PATRIOT Act the \nway it is today. They asked for an extension. Yet if they wanted to \nimprove it and add additional protections, one would think they would \nwant to act quickly to get these protections into the law. Congress \nwill, in fact, obviously, be looking into these new allegations. I urge \nmy colleagues, as well as the American citizens, to think about two \nthings. First of all, the question of whether anybody has complained \nduring the time, under both President Clinton and President Bush, the \nprocedures have been in effect for us to be able to gather certain \nkinds of information and to do so under the powers of the President. \nWhen we are at war, he has ability to accept communications of the \nenemy. Nobody has to point to a section of the law that gives him some \nkind of search warrant authority to go to a judge and ask for the \nability to do that. All Presidents have always used that authority in a \ntime of war. The President relies upon that authority in this \nparticular case. Members of Congress had been briefed on that for \nyears.\n\n  Only until this New York Times article came out did Members of \nCongress find themselves absolutely shocked that this kind of activity \nmight be going on and, furthermore, that it caused them to vote against \nconsideration of the PATRIOT Act, which that has nothing to do with. I \nwill say it again.\n  These stories in the media have nothing to do with the PATRIOT Act. \nSo it seems to me that that is not a good excuse for not being able to \nvote on the PATRIOT Act.\n  The second thing I want to say with respect to that is--and I \ncertainly do not refer to any of my colleagues in the Senate when I \nmake this comment--but there is in the media a significant degree of \nhypocrisy. I note some of the stories day after day were focused on the \nimproper disclosure of the identity of a person working for the CIA, as \nif this is about the worst thing that could ever occur. ``How dare \nanybody leak classified information'' was the mantra day after day. How \nindeed.\n  But have you heard anybody raise the question of the appropriateness \nof the leaking of this very highly classified program that is now out \nin the media and discussed by American citizens, about the collection \nof information that relates to terrorists? It is called eavesdropping \non American citizens, but that is not what it is. The President made \nclear in his press conference this morning that we are talking about \ncommunicating with terrorists or people who have connections\n\n[[Page S14003]]\n\nwith known terrorists. If you call one of those people, you might \nexpect that somebody might want to know about that. Or if they call \nyou. In that case, I guess you might consider yourself vulnerable to \nthe U.S. Government being interested in what you are doing talking to a \nterrorist. But we are not eavesdropping on American citizens.\n  The real question I ask is, where is the outrage with respect to the \nrelease of this classified information, disclosure of this highly \nclassified program which, as the President noted this morning, can \ngreatly degrade our intelligence capability and harm our ability to \nfight the war on terrorism? He was asked to give an example, and he \ndid. He gave the example of how it used to be that we knew how Osama \nbin Laden was communicating. He was communicating pursuant to a certain \ndevice. Somebody leaked to media that we had the ability to intercept \nthe communications from that particular device. Guess what he did. He \nstopped using it. He went underground, and we could no longer listen in \nto what he was saying. What he was saying beforehand was very helpful. \nNow we cannot hear anything.\n  The same thing is true here. Somebody, in order to hurt the \nadministration, I gather, decided it would be a really dandy thing to \nleak to the public a highly sophisticated program used to gather \ninformation from terrorists, to help us protect the American people in \nthe war on terrorism. Have you heard any condemnation of that on the \nSenate floor? Have you heard any condemnation of it in the mainstream \nmedia? No, they were very concerned when the identity of a CIA agent \nwho is known anyway, I gather, was released. I guess that is high \ndudgeon. I have not heard a peep out of anybody in the mainstream media \ncriticizing whoever it was that leaked this highly classified program, \nthat is now out in the public.\n  Mr. President, this leaker has to be brought to justice, and the \nPresident this morning said he gathered that the usual processes in the \nDepartment of Justice to look after such things were in place and were \nbeing pursued. I certainly hope so because every time a leak such as \nthis occurs, it degrades the country's ability to protect the citizens \nof the United States. Whatever this collection methodology is--and \nthankfully it hasn't been described in much more detail, but whatever \nit is, we don't want the other side to stop doing it or that is another \navenue of information that is closed off to us.\n  So why would we want to make a big public disclosure of all of this? \nAt a minimum, when those of us in the Congress look into this further, \nas we surely will, we will need to do this in a classified setting. I \nwonder how much of that will remain classified. I wonder whether we are \nable to keep a secret around here.\n  If we are going to fight the war on terror, let's remember, unless we \nwant to fight it on the battlefields of Afghanistan or the streets of \nBaghdad, the best way to defeat the terrorists is through intelligence-\ngathering agencies. What that means is having the capability to find \nout what the other side is doing so we can try to stop it by \ninfiltrating their organization, by compromising it in one way or \nanother. That is critical to fighting the war on terror.\n  Intelligence is our main method of dealing with this war. If we keep \ncompromising our capability because people feel compelled to breach our \nnational security, to violate the law because they want to bring \ninformation out that will embarrass the administration or that will \naffect the PATRIOT Act--the article, remember, according to some was \nwritten a year before the New York Times published it on the day we had \nthe vote on the PATRIOT Act. Perhaps coincidence. But unless we are \ngoing to start objecting to that kind of behavior, it will continue. \nThen we will wonder why our intelligence agencies and law enforcement \nagencies were not better able to protect us when there is another \nattack.\n  I urge my colleagues, as well as the American people, to consider the \nlosses we will suffer as a result of this kind of behavior and to try \nto bring to account those who engage in this kind of behavior, not to \ncondone it.\n  We in the Congress will do everything we can to make sure all \nauthorities are used legally. The President can be assured of that. But \nin the meantime, it seems to me we ought to feel a little bit more \nsecure that we have great capabilities collecting intelligence, and we \nneed the ability to do that in order to protect the American people.\n  I hope we will have another opportunity to take a vote on the PATRIOT \nAct, that we can extend it, we can reauthorize it so it can again be \nused to protect the American people from this evil of terrorism that we \nface.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto proceed for such time as I use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14003-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14003-S14006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE PATRIOT ACT AND DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I listened carefully, as others have, to \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona. I guess we certainly all agree \nwith his last statement about dealing with the evil of terrorism. We \nare all united in that effort, and all of us are pledged to do so \naccording to the resolution we passed in the aftermath of 9/11, giving \nthe President extraordinary power and authority to respond to those \nattacks. We are united in our efforts to deal with terrorism.\n  What we are not evidently as united on is our efforts to protect the \nConstitution of the United States of America, to protect the rights of \nindividual Americans. On that there is a division between the House and \nthe Senate.\n  I remind my colleague from Arizona, I think it was a couple of hours \nago when he was talking about this subject, that he talked about how we \ndon't want to see the PATRIOT Act further degraded; in other words, \nsomehow implying that if we go back to what we passed in the Senate \nunanimously, we would somehow be degrading the PATRIOT Act. We were \nadmonished not to ``hide behind the filibuster,'' that somehow people \nare hiding behind the filibuster which is the same thing as voting \nagainst the PATRIOT Act.\n  With all due respect, I never heard a more absurd or insulting \nargument to the rules of the Senate and to the nature of the Senate. In \nthe 21 years I have been here, I have seen Jesse Helms and countless \nothers stand up on the other side, in the minority or otherwise, and \nemploy the rules of the Senate which allow the Senate to take a little \nbit longer to consider issues. That is always what has separated us \nfrom the House and, indeed, which has provided a measure of safety with \nrespect to the legislation we pass for the country.\n\n  The fact is that what he has termed degrading the PATRIOT Act for \nmany of us is protecting the PATRIOT Act, protecting the Constitution, \nprotecting the country, protecting individual citizens. The fact is the \nSenate unanimously passed a PATRIOT Act that went over to the House \nwith adequate, better protections for the citizens of our country.\n  Let me be more specific about that for a minute, if I may, and I \ndidn't intend to speak about the PATRIOT Act. I intended to talk about \nthis morass we find ourselves in with respect to the Defense \nappropriations bill and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and I will \ntalk about that in a minute. But I want to talk about the PATRIOT Act \nfor a minute.\n  Every single one of us in the Senate joined together a few months \nago--in July, I think, precisely--to unanimously allow the PATRIOT Act \nto be passed. We supported the PATRIOT Act, and we supported it because \nwe know we need to give the President the tools to fight terror and it \nwould be irresponsible not to do certain things in the current threat \nwe face to respond appropriately. But we also have an obligation to \nprotect the privacy rights of Americans.\n  Americans all across this country increasingly are concerned about \nmedical records that find their way into the public sector, financial \nrecords that are lost, banking records that turn up in public, about \nthe theft of identity, Social Security numbers that are stolen. The \nconstant invasion on the privacy of Americans is something that ought \nto concern all of us, and there ought to be a balance as we fight \nterror.\n\n[[Page S14004]]\n\n  Sure, we all want to take the maximum steps possible in order to \nprevent another act of terrorism. Who here in their right mind isn't \ngoing to do what is reasonable to prevent another 9/11? This is almost \nan absurd argument. It is the traditional sort of let's create a wedge, \ndrive a big wedge between the American people and pretend to the \nAmerican people the argument is about something that it isn't, pretend \nto the American people that everybody from this line in the United \nStates over doesn't care about the security of our country and pretend \nthat the only people who do are over there. It is ridiculous on its \nface. It is an insult to the American people.\n  We ought to be doing everything in our power to guarantee we don't \nengage in those kinds of silly arguments, particularly when we are \nstuck here 5 days before Christmas Eve struggling over reasonableness \nand then we have a whole bunch of unreasonably, classically political \nwedge-driving issues.\n  If the same PATRIOT bill was on the floor today that we sent off the \nfloor, every Senator would vote for it. But it is not, and we are being \ntold that somehow we have to rush to judgment and give away rights a \nlot of people here think are important and worth fighting for because \nthe House insists they have a couple of provisions that were not in our \nbill.\n  Look at those provisions. The fact is the 215 section the Senator \nfrom Arizona was talking about--here is what it allows. It allows the \nGovernment to obtain library, medical, gun records, and other sensitive \npersonal information on a mere showing that those records are relevant \nto an authorized intelligence investigation. That is it. That is all it \nrequires.\n  In the Senate bill, we passed an additional test.\n  We said it has to be relevant, but in addition to being relevant we \nspecifically put in the word ``and.'' It has to be relevant, and one of \nthe three following things has to be shown: It has to pertain to a \nforeign power or agent of a foreign power, it has to be relevant to the \nactivities of a suspected agent of a foreign power, or it has to be \npertinent to a particular effort that is taken against a foreign power. \nThose are the three tests which we added to the relevancy test. We did \nthat specifically because we thought we ought to protect the rights of \nAmericans.\n  The fact is that requiring it to be pertaining to an individual who \nis in contact with a foreign government is a specific test that \nrequires either to go further than mere relevancy. It requires the \nGovernment to have a cause that is legitimate to be able to go in and \ninvade those kinds of rights.\n  Every Member of the Senate decided that was a worthy test and, \nunfortunately, that test was dropped. So that small change will \nactually allow the potential invasion of the privacy of American \ncitizens who may have no connection at all to a suspected terrorist or \nspy. We think that is an important restriction. That is what we are \nfighting about. We are not fighting about not having a PATRIOT Act; we \nare fighting about having the rights of Americans protected.\n  In addition, unlike the Senate bill, the conference report provides \nabsolutely no mechanism for the recipient of a 215 order. In other \nwords, if someone has received a 215 order and it is sent to them \nnotifying them with respect to the request for that information, there \nis no way for them to challenge an automatic gag order on that \nparticular requirement.\n  So the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act's court review is not \nsufficient. We do not think it provides adequate protection to an \nAmerican. The court only has the power to review the underlying order; \nthat is, to say whether the order was appropriately issued. They do not \nhave the right to review whether that person has a right to challenge \nit, a right to speak about it. They do not have the power to make an \nindividualized determination about whether there ought to be a gag \norder with respect to it. So the recipient of a 215 order is \nautomatically silenced under any circumstances. How is that fair? How \nis that consistent with American democratic principles?\n  The conference report also does not provide judicial review of \nnational security letters. The Senate bill did provide a judicial \nreview. We believe judicial review is important. So what we are \nfighting for is not whether to have a PATRIOT Act; what we are fighting \nover is whether to have a PATRIOT Act that keeps faith with the \nConstitution that we all swore to uphold and with our interpretation of \nthe legitimate limits of intrusion on the rights of Americans. That is \nwhat we are fighting for.\n  I would also mention that there are sneak-and-peek search warrants in \nthe conference report. Unlike the Senate bill, the conference report \ndoes not include any protections against those warrants. So rather than \nrequiring the Government to notify the target of those warrants within \n7 days, as the Senate bill did, the conference report requires \nnotification within 30 days. Now, that is a long time to go--even 7 \ndays is a long time to go, but 30 days is a really long time to go \nbefore one is notified of a Government search.\n  Those are just a few of the problems.\n  Let us repeat--because again it is part of the game that is played--\nit is not a good game. A lot of folks on the other side of the aisle \nare trying to suggest, Well, America, there are a bunch of folks who \nare strong on defense and people who are weak; there are a bunch of \nfolks who want to protect the Constitution and those who do not.\n  Let me say something. This is not about that. If it were, we would \nhave passed the 3-month extension of the PATRIOT Act right away. On \nseveral different occasions, Senator Reid has asked the Senate to \nproceed. We do not have to waste 1 day, not 1 hour, not 1 minute \nwithout a PATRIOT Act. We could extend the PATRIOT Act for 3 months \nright away, do it this afternoon, this evening, and then we could \nactually sit down and work out the differences in a reasonable way so \nthat we provide the protections which people think are worth fighting \nfor.\n  So this whole debate is just part of a larger breakdown in the \nSenate. The shame of what is happening with the Defense appropriations \nbill is that this entire debate is unnecessary, and it is also \ninappropriate. The fact is that the Arctic Wildlife Refuge drilling was \nput on the budget bill by breaking the budget rules. Everybody here \nknows that. The budget rules were changed so that drilling could be put \non the bill because they were unable to muster enough votes to do it \nunder the normal procedures of the Senate.\n  Then some courageous Republicans in the House stood up and said: This \nis wrong; we are not going to go along with this. All of a sudden, the \nfirst breaking-of-the-rules route was found to be unacceptable. So what \nis the response? To accept the rules of the Congress, to go along with \nthe will of the Congress? Oh, no, not that. We have to go find another \nway to break the rules. We have to go find another way to reinterpret \nit. So when the Parliamentarian rules that something is not \nlegitimately within the scope of the bill, as the rules of the Senate \nsay it ought to be, they are going to go ahead and try to vote and say: \nOh, yes, it is, we overrule the Chair, change the rules. If one does \nnot like the rules the way they are, they change them. How many kids in \nAmerican schools are taught that is the way to play? How many families \nteach their kids in America that what one does is break the rules if \nthey do not like them? How many institutions in this country would get \nalong if that is the way it is played?\n\n  The example we set is bigger than what happens on this floor or what \nhappens to Alaska and to the oil drilling. The fact is that what is \nhappening is, make no mistake about it, right on the Senate floor, \nRepublicans are putting oil companies ahead of troops. They are putting \noil companies ahead of the Defense bill. They are trying to hold a \nwhole bunch of Senators hostage to the very arguments we are hearing \nabout whether one is for defense or against defense.\n  My colleague, Senator Lieberman, who earlier joined us at a press \nconference, made it very clear there is nobody with a stronger defense \nrecord in the Senate, but he is not going to stand up and be pushed \naround that way and be put in a corner that suggests that he does not \nstand for defense, and nor should any other Senator. This is wrong. It \nis wrong for the Senate. It is wrong for the country. It is the wrong \nexample.\n  The fact is that this Defense bill could have been passed months ago.\n\n[[Page S14005]]\n\nBut who held it up? Do my colleagues know what held it up? What held it \nup was a President and a Vice President of the United States who were \nlobbying for torture. For months, they wanted to have the right to be \nable to finesse the rules and say that torture is permitted under \ncertain circumstances. It took a Republican Senator, Mr. McCain, to \nstand up and say that is wrong, that is not in the interest of our \ntroops, and that is not in the interest of our country. So the Defense \nbill was held up for almost 3 months because folks on the other side \nthought we ought to torture. Now here we are holding it up because they \nhave attached to it drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge.\n  I will state what the Military Officers Association thinks of that: \nThere is a possibility that negotiators might try to include a \nprovision allowing oil drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge \nin the bill. We are concerned--that is, the Military Officers \nAssociation of America is concerned that insertion of any divisive \nnondefense-related issues at the last minute could further delay \nenactment of this crucial legislation. Both defense bills are urgently \nneeded to support our military efforts. Congress is already 3 months \nlate passing them and needs to get off the dime.\n  We do need to get off the dime, but it is not just the Military \nOfficers Association that has weighed in. Yesterday, a group of five \nhigh-profile military officials sent the following letter to the \nSenate, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Frist and Senator Reid: We are very concerned \n     that the FY2006 Defense Appropriations Bill may be further \n     delayed by attaching a controversial non-defense legislative \n     provision to the defense appropriations conference report.\n       We know that you share our overarching concern for the \n     welfare and needs of our troops. With 160,000 troops fighting \n     in Iraq, another 18,000 in Aghanistan, and tens of thousands \n     more around the world defending this country, Congress must \n     finish its work and provide them the resources they need to \n     do their job.\n       We believe that any effort to attach controversial \n     legislative language authorizing drilling in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to the defense appropriations \n     conference report will jeopardize Congress' ability to \n     provide our troops and their families the resources they need \n     in a timely fashion.\n       The passion and energy of the debate about drilling in ANWR \n     is well known, and a testament to vibrant debate in our \n     democracy. But it is not helpful to attach such a \n     controversial non-defense legislative issue to a defense \n     appropriations bill. It only invites delay for our troops as \n     Congress debates an important but controversial non-defense \n     issue on a vital bill providing critical funding for our \n     nation's security.\n       We urge you to keep ANWR off the defense appropriations \n     bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joseph P. Hoar,\n       General, U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.).\n     Claudia J. Kennedy,\n       Lieutenant General, U.S. Army (Ret.).\n     Anthony C. Zinni,\n       General, U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.).\n     Lee F. Gunn,\n       Vice Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.).\n     Stephen A. Cheney,\n       Brigadier General, U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have debated for years, all the years \nthat I have been here, the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. It is stunning that \nan issue as controversial, as divisive as that would be put on a bill \nthat needs to pass by unanimous consent. I know Senator Stevens and \nothers have said we have had bills on which we have put a number of \ndifferent items, such as the omnibus bill back in the days of President \nClinton where we put seven or eight items on it--I forget exactly how \nmany. But the difference is we did it with unanimity. We did not have a \ndivided Senate over that issue. We did not have a vote. We all agreed \nall of those items ought to go into the bill.\n  What is different here is the disagreement, is the division over this \nissue. The fact is, many of us are very passionate about this issue, so \nmuch so that the Senate has been divided by one vote. A one-vote \ndivision is being disrespected in this effort because they know the \nrules of the Senate would prohibit them from doing it without changing \nand breaking those rules.\n  The fact is, ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, according to \nany definition I have ever seen, ceases to be a refuge. All the efforts \nto gloss over it do exactly that, they simply gloss over it. The fact \nis, we have heard arguments that you can somehow drill in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge in an environmentally friendly manner. We have \nheard that drilling in the refuge is going to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil. We have heard it is going to bring down gas prices at the \npump. We have even heard that it belongs in the national budget because \nof the revenues that are going to come from the lease sales.\n  Every single one of those arguments fails before legitimate, honest \nscrutiny. First of all, by definition, an industrial zone and a \nwilderness cannot occupy the same space--can't do it. You can't have a \nwilderness and have an industrial zone. So the minute you declare \n``industrial zone,'' gone is the wilderness. What has been set aside \nall these years since President Eisenhower, is eradicated, gone--gone \nfor all time.\n  In 1960, the Eisenhower administration first recognized the value of \nthat area, and it was established to be a unique wildlife and \nlandscape. Drilling proponents keep claiming we are only going to drill \non 2,000 acres--the oil corporations. But the fact is, when you look at \nthe plans and you examine how they go at it, in fact, the entire 1.5 \nmillion acres, the 102 area is going to be open to testing, to leasing, \nand exploration, and it does not happen in one compact area. That is \nbecause, as with the North Slope oilfields west of the Arctic refuge, \nyou have the development sprawling over a very large area stretching \nacross the Coastal Plain.\n  According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the potential oil under the \nCoastal Plain is not concentrated in one large reservoir. It is put in \nmany small deposits all across the plain. So to produce oil from this \nvast area, you have to create a network of pipelines and a network of \nroads, and all of those change the habitat of the entire Coastal Plain.\n  I will acknowledge that new drilling technology is more efficient, \nand we have done wonders in many ways. It is less harmful to the \nenvironment. But the advantages with respect to this particular area \nhave been greatly exaggerated. Even the new technology, such as \ndirectional drilling, does irrevocable damage. You have to have \npermanent gravel roads. You have to have busy airports for access. You \nhave production wells that are scattered throughout the area, across \nmore than a million acres of Coastal Plain, and you are going to have \nthe connection of pipelines. And the entire complex is going to produce \nmore air pollution than the city of Washington, DC.\n  No matter how well it is done, oil development has a lasting impact \non the environment. The industry itself has told us that. None other \nthan British Petroleum said, ``We can't develop fields and keep \nwilderness.'' That is the oil company speaking for itself.\n  If the facts and the frank admission of an oil company are not \nenough, then people ought to take a look at what the National Academy \nof Sciences said, and the Department of Interior, and a host of others \nwho have come to the same conclusion.\n  We also hear about the dependence on foreign oil. If the Arctic \nWildlife Refuge produces the maximum amount of oil they say it might be \nable to produce, if 20 years from now it is at maximum pumping--which \ndoes nothing, obviously, to affect prices and supply today--it is \npossible that at best you could reduce oil imports from 62 percent to \n60 percent. That is it--62 percent to 60 percent. It is not enough to \naffect the price of oil. It will not affect the global supply. It will \nnot affect our dependence on the Middle East. But it will destroy the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge and provide some profits to the \ncompanies that take it out in the meantime.\n  So everybody ought to understand that in its peak year for a single \nyear, somewhere around 2020, drilling might reduce your dependency by \nabout 2 percent. The price of oil will not drop, the price of energy \nwill not drop, the price of gasoline will not drop, and our \nvulnerability to world oil prices and to world unrest and to dangerous \nregimes will not change. After that single year,\n\n[[Page S14006]]\n\nthe flow of oil from the refuge is going to start to decline as the \nreserves are depleted.\n  Also, this is a phony argument that we need to somehow be doing this \nnow. It has nothing to do with the immediate security of our country. \nThe fact is, 95 percent of the Alaska oil shelf is open for drilling/\nleasing today--95 percent of it. There are vast areas of that shelf \nthat are open that are still not leased, still not producing. In \naddition, we have the largest oilfield in the world that is \nunexploited, which is in the Gulf of Mexico, the deepwater drilling of \nthe Gulf of Mexico. Those leases have already been granted. They have \nalready been environmentally permitted, but they are not being drilled. \nWhy? Because the price differential thus far has not brought people to \ndo that.\n  If we want to do something for immediate American help, provide a \nsubsidy, provide some assistance, do something that provides an \nincentive so that drilling takes place now. That would have far more \neffect than what is happening in this Alaska argument.\n  The bottom line: I said it again and again everywhere I went over the \ncourse of the last 2 years during the Presidential race. Every time I \nhad a chance, I talked about how we only have 3 percent of the world's \noil reserves. That is all we have in America--3 percent. The Saudis \nhave 46 percent. The Middle East has 65 percent. There is absolutely \nnothing the United States of America can do to drill our way out of our \npredicament--our dependence on oil. We have to invent our way out of \nit, and inventing our way out of it means moving to alternative fuels, \nmeans pushing the curve of discovery, doing what America has always \ndone in terms of creation of new jobs and new technologies. That is why \nit is a phony argument. That is the bottom line of why we don't have to \nbe here pushing to do this on a defense bill which is important to our \ntroops and to our country.\n  My hope is that in the next hours perhaps we can get a measure of \nreasonableness. But the bottom line still remains the same. There are \npeople who believe deeply in drilling. I understand that. I respect \nthat, and they can talk about that belief. That it not what this vote \nis about.\n  What this vote is about, in the end, is whether this effort to open \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ought to be allowed to circumvent \nthe rules of the Senate and whether this is the message we want to send \nabout the rules and how the Senate works; that nothing means anything \naround here as long as you can change it whenever you want.\n  We have to remember that what goes around comes around. I don't think \nit is good for the Senate. I don't think this is good for this \ninstitution. I don't think it is good for a majority or a minority, one \nof which may be the other any day in the future, and regret this kind \nof this kind of effort.\n  When we stand up for the rules, we stand up for history, we stand up \nfor the Constitution, and we stand up for what this Constitution gives \nto us as an individual responsibility--each and every one of us. And \nwhen we break the rules, we send a damaging, dangerous message to the \nrest of our country that looks to this place--ostensibly used to look \nhere anyway--for leadership.\n  When you read the polls today about where the Congress is and the \nesteem of the American people, you ought to think twice about whether \nthis is the way to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14006-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14006-S14009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share some thoughts about the \nPATRIOT Act and the situation we find ourselves in now with this \nlegislation that we passed 4 years ago that expired December 31. This \nlegislation that passed the Senate by a vote of 80-something, with one \n``no'' vote, all the rest of the Senate voted for it. It was made law, \nand we agreed to reauthorize it after 4 years. We have been involved in \nthat process.\n  I wish to say this has not been a rushed-up deal. We have not gone \ninto this without watching over it.\n  We have had--I am sure some of the Members may have forgotten--a host \nof committee hearings dealing with the PATRIOT Act. In fact, the \nnumbers I have is that the Senate Judiciary Committee had 13 oversight \nhearings over the PATRIOT Act. The House Judiciary Committee had 12 \noversight hearings this year alone dealing with the PATRIOT Act and our \nlaw enforcement against terrorism.\n  For example, I have a list of the hearings we held. On November 28, \n2001, not long after the act passed, there was a hearing entitled, \n``Department of Justice Oversight: Preserving Our Freedom While \nDefending Against Terrorism,'' witness Michael Chertoff, then-Assistant \nAttorney General, Department of Justice, Chief of the Criminal \nDivision. He is now the Department of Homeland Security Secretary.\n  Also on that panel were William Barr, former Attorney General of the \nUnited States; Philip Heymann, James Barr Ames, Professor of Law at \nHarvard Law School; Griffin Bell, senior partner at King and Spalding, \na former Attorney General of the United States under President Jimmy \nCarter; Scott Silliman, executive director of the Center of Law, Ethics \nand National Security at Duke University School of Law; Kate Martin, \nDirector of the Center for National Security Studies; Neal Katyal, \nvisiting professor, and Yale Law School professor of law at Georgetown \nUniversity.\n  Also, in December of 2001, another hearing: ``Department of Justice \nOversight, Preserving Our Freedom While Defending Against Terrorism.'' \nThe primary witness was Attorney General John Ashcroft.\n  Oversight Hearings on Counterterrorism, June of the next year, \nwitness list: Honorable Robert S. Mueller, III, Director of the Federal \nBureau of Investigation; Honorable Glenn A. Fine, inspector general for \nthe U.S. Department of Justice; Special Agent Colleen Crowley, chief \ndivision counsel for the FBI.\n  You remember she is the one who complained they did not listen to the \nevidence she had. And in fact, she made a lot of complaints. But if you \nboil it down to the bottom, the wall that had been put up, some of the \nrules and regulations and bureaucratic situations created by existing \nlaw at the time of 9/11, made it difficult for information to be \nshared. That has been fixed, in large part, by the PATRIOT Act and \nother acts that were passed.\n  Another one on oversight: Department of Justice with the Attorney \nGeneral himself; then another one in September of that year, ``USA \nPATRIOT Act In Practice: Shedding Light on the FISA Process.''\n  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, ``Court and Process,'' had a \nhearing on all of that so your people understand it.\n  The Honorable David Kris, associate counsel, Department of Justice; \nKenneth Bass, senior counsel with Sterne Kessler; William Banks, \nprofessor of law at Syracuse; Morton Halperin, director of the Open \nSociety Institute, a true civil libertarian, he had his day to be \nheard.\n\n  ``Tools Against Terror'' was another hearing, ``How the \nAdministration is Implementing the New Laws to Protect our Homeland''--\noversight on how these laws are being carried out; Glenn Fine, the \ninspector general, testified; Scott Hastings, associate commissioner of \nthe Office of Information Resources Management; Alice Fisher, Deputy \nAssistant Attorney General; Dennis Lormel, Chief of the Financial \nCrimes Section.\n  Another one: ``War Against Terror: Working Together to Protect \nAmerica,'' Attorney General John Ashcroft; Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity Tom Ridge; Honorable Robert Mueller, Director of the FBI.\n  We had them there to answer how we are working better with these new \nlaws to protect America.\n  Another one, oversight hearing: ``Law Enforcement and Terrorism,'' \nHonorable Robert Mueller, Director of the FBI; Honorable Asa \nHutchinson, Undersecretary for Border and Transportation Security.\n  Senator Hatch had a hearing in Utah with about 10 witnesses dealing \nwith all of the issues related to homeland security.\n  Another one: ``FBI Oversight, Terrorism and Other Topics''; ``DOJ \nOversight: Terrorism and Other Topics''; Department of Homeland \nSecurity, ``Oversight, Terrorism and Other Topics.''\n\n[[Page S14007]]\n\n  The top people in Department of Justice--and that is in the Senate, \nand that does not count the Intelligence Committee that has had \nhearings, and it does not count the 12 or 13 or more hearings which the \nHouse Judiciary Committee has had.\n  First, I want to say that we spent a great deal of time 34 years ago \nin drafting the first PATRIOT Act. How did it pass with only one ``no'' \nvote if it was an extreme act? It passed with such an overwhelming vote \nbecause we made a commitment from the beginning that we would not \nundermine any of the great civil liberties that we as Americans have \ncome to know and respect and cherish.\n  I remember asking witnesses. Somebody one time thought it was \nhumorous. But I asked these witnesses: Is there anything in this \nPATRIOT Act that any court is going to declare to be unconstitutional? \nEvery one of them said ``no.''\n  Why did they say that? Because the techniques that we allowed \nterrorism investigators to utilize have already been approved and were \nbeing utilized in other aspects of law enforcement already, but they \nweren't available in an effective way for these investigators.\n  If there was something that was expanded in any way, it was well \nwithin the principles of the law as had already been established by the \nSupreme Court of the United States. For example the roving wiretap--you \ncould always get a wiretap on a specific phone of a person, and you \nhave to have a big affidavit. It has to be monitored, and the judge has \nto approve it to be satisfied. You approved it in advance of that \nwiretap being effective, that you had probable cause to believe that it \nwas a justified act. Those facts are reviewable. If the judge was \nwrong, all the evidence that was gained pursuant to that would be \ndismissed, would be fruit of the poisonous tree and not be admitted in \na court of law.\n\n  We simply said: Wait a minute, we are seeing more and more terrorists \nwho travel around, use one cell phone and then another cell phone, move \nfrom apartment to apartment. Why not allow the courts to have an \nintercept of communications based on the phones that person may use if \nthere is sufficient evidence to show that person is connected to \nterrorism and it is relevant to a terrorism investigation and it meets \nall the standard burdens of proof that have always been used in \nintercepting communications?\n  I was a U.S. attorney for 12 years. In that 12 years, I think we did \none wiretap. These are not done routinely. In a big international \nterrorism security case, a wiretap can be incredibly valuable. It is \none thing to have a wiretap on a Mafia gang or a drug gang; it is \nanother thing to need to know a terrorist group may be plotting to kill \nthousands or tens of thousands of American people. If these intercepts \nare lawful for a drug gang, for a group of white-collar criminals, for \na Mafia group, they sure ought to be lawful for surveillance on \nterrorists.\n  We made that change and set forth all the standards, and we went \nthrough the legislation. We worked on the exact wording, word by word \nby word, and the bill we passed in this Senate unanimously came out of \nour Senate Judiciary Committee 18 to 0 a few months ago to reauthorize \nit. It said the order must describe a specific target with \nparticularity so that there could not be any confusion about which \nperson for whom the intercept is permissible.\n  The House bill had language they considered carefully. They came out \nwith this language: ``based on specific facts provided in the \napplications.'' Then it goes to conference. We go over the House bill \nand the Senate bill and try to hammer out on agreement. Many of the \nprovisions were complementary; they were approved in both bills. Where \nthe provisions were in conflict, the Senate language was adopted.\n  With regard to the roving wiretap multipoint wiretap provision, \nsection 206 of the original PATRIOT Act, basically the Senate version \nprevailed. I will talk about that for a few minutes because we have \nMembers of the Senate on the Senate Judiciary Committee who voted for \nthe bill when it passed unanimously a few months ago. We have Members \nof the Senate objecting today who were part of the majority of the \nunanimous Senate that approved it who are contending there were big \nchanges made in conference. These changes are why they are now opposing \na bill that just a few days ago they were supporting.\n  They should listen to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Specter. Senator Specter was part and parcel of all \nnegotiations. Members contended to get their own version of things. \nFrankly, some Members thought the language was not clear enough, and \nthere were some difficulties for law enforcement we would like to have \nseen closed because it could have led to jeopardizing national safety. \nWe held out and held out, but at the end, basically we gave in. As \nSenator Specter said, the bill that came out of conference was 80 \npercent the Senate bill. The Senate prevailed time and again even \nthough on some occasions I thought the House provisions were better. We \ncame in and moved a bill we thought we would have bipartisan support \nfor.\n  For example, there was a question about sunsets, what would be made \npermanent in the bill and what would have to come up for \nreauthorization or would sunset. The Senate bill eliminated all but two \nof the PATRIOT Act sunsets--the roving wiretap and the business records \nsunset. They were extended for 4 years. We said we will go 4 more years \nwith these two provisions. We extended the lone wolf provision for the \nsame period in the Senate. We passed it; 4 more years for those three \nprovisions.\n  The House did not sunset the lone wolf provision but did sunset \nsection 206 and 215, but for 10 years. They said they would be extended \nfor 10 years. So we go to conference and we debate this issue. I \nthought the original agreement was we would split the difference, as is \ncommonly done, and we would do it for 7 years. In fact, I signed the \nconference report at that point. I believe that is when I signed it. \nBut Senator Leahy and other Members of the conference did not like it \nand held out and held out.\n  We talked to Senator Specter and asked: Why are we coming back in 4 \nyears again? We just had a 4-year bill.\n  Senator Specter said: Look, it is important to the Members. We want \nsome bipartisan support, Senator Sessions. Would you support us on it \nin 3 to 4 years?\n  I said: All right, we will take the 4 years, the exact Senate bill \nlanguage.\n  Senator Kyl felt strongly about this also as we discussed it.\n  So we send that, thinking we made people happier and they would be \nenthusiastic supporters of a bipartisan piece of legislation important \nto protect the safety of the people of the United States of America.\n  Now, here is another example of the flap, this spasm we are having \nthat amounts to little or nothing: the delayed notice search warrant. \nAs a person who has been involved in supervising investigations \nrelating to large-scale international drug smuggling groups--not \nterrorist groups but those kinds of conspiracies--I have been made \nfamiliar with the difficulties of law enforcement, the burdens on law \nenforcement, the need to do things right. Our law enforcement agencies \ndo things right according to the instructions they are given.\n  There comes a time when it is important in an investigation to \nexecute a warrant, but at the time you execute it, it is not an \nappropriate time to arrest the people involved. That happened a lot. \nMaybe it is less important in a drug case than in a terrorism case \nwhere people may have poisonous gas or biological weapons hidden in \ntheir apartment, but in a drug case this is what you come down to. The \nlaw allowed and has always allowed, to my knowledge, a warrant with \nspecific stated facts. It could be approved, but that warrant has to be \nbased upon the same factual proof we have always had, but you would \nwant to ask the court to allow a search to be conducted of a house. \nInstead of immediately telling the person whose house or business or \nautomobile is being searched that you searched it, you delay notifying \nthem. You still have protected them from an unlawful search because you \nhave gotten a lawful court order based on facts proven to a Federal \njudge. In the case of terrorism and these cases I dealt with, proof had \nto be submitted. And then you could ask the court to allow you to delay \nnotifying the person who is searched for a period of time.\n\n[[Page S14008]]\n\n  This is important because otherwise you tip off the whole group, and \nthey will scatter like a covey of quail. They will be gone. If you do \nnot have everybody there at the time you do that search, then they have \nthe ability to notify one another and scram, and the whole thing can go \ndown in a hurry. So dealing with that complex issue is an important \nthing.\n  So with regard to the delayed notice warrants, I just want to say to \nmy colleagues and friends, I cannot tell you how important this is to \nour investigators, who may be out there this very moment surveilling \nsome sleeper cells of terrorist groups and who need to obtain \ninformation that could be critically important to identifying a major \norganization.\n  Maybe the individual they have information about, and for which they \nhave probable cause sufficient to conduct a search warrant of their \nhouse, is the only name they really have, but maybe they have good \nevidence this individual is talking to a number of other persons, and \nthat they may even be planning to bring a chemical or biological weapon \nor some other explosive device into the country or into that house, and \nthey want to search that house, and they have proof sufficient to allow \nthat to occur by presenting it to a Federal judge to get approval. But \nthey do not need to tell them right then because you are trying to \npenetrate the organization and get all of them, not just one or two. \nMaybe there are 20 or 30, and maybe you only know of 1 or 2 of them, so \nyou conduct these warrants, and you delay notification.\n  So I want to point out that what the big difference fundamentally was \nis this: The Senate bill said the investigators who go out and conduct \nthat warrant have to report back to the judge--in all of our \nlegislation, they have to report back to the judge--to see what they \ndid and how they did it and make an official report; they just don't \ntell the person whose house is searched. So the Senate bill said they \nshould have an initial period of delay of 7 days. The House bill said \nthey would have an initial period of delay of up to 180 days.\n  So we went to conference, and the House said: Well, we think 180 is \nappropriate under these circumstances. These are groups, terrorist \ngroups, whatever. It might be really necessary to have more time. We \nwere at 7. And then you could come back and ask the judge to extend it \nunder either one of the bills. So we hammered around and worked around, \nand we agreed on 30 days--much closer to the Senate bill's version, our \nversion, than the House bill's version.\n  So how is this some big deal? So we have Senators down here saying: \nWell, I think it is all right to have a delayed warrant for 7 days. I \njust don't want to have it for 30 days. So I think we need to get our \nact together here and try to reach some agreements and get this bill \npassed.\n  But I will say this: For those of us who believe strongly this act is \nimportant, it should not just be seen that we are now going to come \nback and water down this bill and erode the provisions that are in it \nand not have delayed warrants, not have section 215 authority, to \neliminate national security letters that have been part of the law for \n25 years. We cannot take these things out.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to study this legislation \ncarefully. Talk to the Department of Justice attorneys, call the FBI, \nif you need to. They will go over it step by step, word by word, line \nby line. As you go through that and consider the history of law \nenforcement, what is allowed to be done now, how this all occurs, you \nare going to feel so much better about it and not just react to this \nunfair choice that is presented: civil liberties or protection. We gave \ngreater protection while protecting civil liberties.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we just go back to trying to comprehend \nthe enormity of what has happened as Senator Reid, the Democratic \nleader in the Senate, had a big press conference to declare victory. He \nsaid:\n\n       We killed the PATRIOT Act.\n\n  It is not something I think is worthy of a leader of any great party \nin the Senate. It is the equivalent of the Democratic leader saying we \nhave no way to win in Iraq. These are the kind of statements that are \nreally contrary to what this Nation needs to do right now.\n  The PATRIOT Act is an act that we passed with one dissenting vote 4 \nyears ago and that we passed out of this Senate unanimously and out of \nthe Judiciary Committee unanimously just a few weeks ago and which has \nnow come back as only a modestly modified conference report. It ought \nto be unanimously affirmed again.\n  We have ended up with a filibuster led by the Democratic leader. I am \ndisappointed at that. I can't comprehend why it occurred and why this \nwould happen. There were a lot of contests, let me say, in the \nconference committee; a lot of hard work over every single word in the \nbill. But our version, the one we supported in a bipartisan way, was \noverwhelmingly the version that was adopted. We brought it back with \neveryone thinking we would have a great opportunity to pass it. In \nfact, some of us thought we went too far and that we had weakened law \nenforcement in ways that were not necessary.\n  We tried to resist, but in the end, at the request of Senator \nSpecter, in a bipartisan effort to move the bill quickly through the \nSenate, we dropped our objections and went along with that provision.\n  Lo and behold, we end up with another obstructing tactic to block one \nof the most important pieces of legislation we have passed in a long \ntime. At many of the hearings I mentioned before, the witnesses \ntestified unequivocally that this act had made America a safer place.\n  I mentioned earlier the sunsets. We have differences of agreement on \nthe sunsets. The Senate version was totally adopted on the roving \nwiretaps. By far, the Senate version was adopted on the delayed notice \nsearch warrants. I have explained how important and critical they are. \nJust ask an FBI agent or talk to a Federal prosecutor who has worked on \none of these cases how critically important it can be to have this \ndelayed notification. The Senate version of the bill was 7 days, the \nHouse version 180 days, and we agreed on 30. One would have thought \nthat would be the case.\n  With regard to the business records, the Senate bill had a very \ntroubling part to it. It had a three-part relevancy test. This test \nrequired the FBI, before they could obtain these records--and these are \nnot records in the personal dominion of a potential defendant; these \nare records they don't control but are in the control of a bank or \ntelephone company. They are not the words one says in a telephone \nmessage, but the telephone toll records. These are part of the records \nand have always been subject to a subpoena by law enforcement. Any \ncounty attorney in America can subpoena these records.\n  Because we wanted to go an extra mile and deal with the question of \nimmediate notification of the person whose records are being sought, we \nenhanced the requirements. So instead of issuing a subpoena, such as an \nIRS agent, without going to a U.S. attorney or without going to any \ncourt--an IRS agent can issue a subpoena for your income tax records to \nsee if you paid your taxes. A DEA agent can get your bank records to \ndetermine whether a person made money selling dope. For white collar \ncrime, Customs agents, there are about 200 or 300 provisions that allow \nfor these kinds of records to be obtained by administrative subpoena. \nBut we don't have that under section 215. They have to get a prior \napproval, and the agent has to certify it is related to a national \nsecurity investigation. Only then are they able to get library records \nor your bookstore records.\n  I don't know why they think that is just so big. Pardon me if I am \namused a bit. A county attorney in Illinois or Idaho can issue a \nsubpoena right now to the library for somebody's records. What is this \ndeal? But the association raised a ruckus, so we gave them all kinds of \nenhanced protections under this bill.\n  Again, the conference report went further than the Senate bill in \nmany areas in the direction of civil liberties. We did have private \nbriefings, secret briefings from Federal investigative agencies, and we \nlearned why there were defects in the three-part relevancy test.\n  By the way, the average district attorney in America and, I think, \nthe Federal attorneys, when they issue subpoenas for records, it only \nhas to be relevant to an investigation. For a U.S. attorney, it has to \nbe relevant to a Federal investigation. But, oh, here we\n\n[[Page S14009]]\n\ngo much further. You have to have a three-part test to what relevancy \nis in addition to certifying it is important to national security.\n  So we dealt with that problem. I thought we had reached an agreement \nin language that did not leave serious gaps in the need for records and \nability to obtain records that law enforcement was concerned with. We \nwere concerned about that, and we tried to change it, fix it. I thought \nwe reached an agreement on it. I thought we went too far, but I agreed \nto sign it because we needed to do this bill. That is why I agreed to \nsign the conference report.\n\n  Civil liberties that were not passed by the Senate or the House were \nadded to the conference report at the request of Senate conferees, \nmostly Democratic conferees. So we added some items in addition.\n  Under the report, the Attorney General must adopt minimization \nprocedures within 180 days of enactment of the legislation; that is, he \nmust create procedures that minimize any likelihood that civil \nliberties could be adversely affected. And he must submit an annual \nreport to Congress which enumerates the total number of applications \nmade under the act, the number granted, the number modified, the number \ndenied so we can have oversight over this issue.\n  Who is overseeing the county attorney? Who is overseeing the U.S. \nattorney who may be investigating a Member of Congress or the Senate or \na Governor for tax fraud or something such as that? They are issuing \nsubpoenas every day.\n  This is a very responsible, fully debated, intensely discussed piece \nof legislation. It is important to the safety of our country. It is \nimportant that we pass it and extend this act and reauthorize it. As of \nJanuary 1, the wall will go back up that would deny the right of the \nCIA to share foreign intelligence with the FBI that may have domestic \nintelligence and, therefore, be able to put the pieces together in a \npuzzle that will identify a criminal gang that may be intent on \ndestroying large parts of our country.\n  I believe that every effort has been made to assure that all the \nprovisions of this act are consistent with established constitutional \nprocedures. I believe not one line of it is going to be found to be \nunconstitutional. I believe it has all the protections and details that \nare necessary for good legislation.\n  There are some things in it that I think hamper law enforcement more \nthan necessary that have little or no relevancy to real civil liberties \nissues, but they are in there because people were concerned. People are \nconcerned so we dealt with the concerns, but we do not need to weaken \nthis act any more. It is time for us to pass this legislation, to \nreauthorize this act and not allow it to expire as of the end of this \nyear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alabama. On many \nissues, we are together, and that is as it should be. On other issues, \nwe, perhaps, do not agree. But I always--I always--hold his opinions in \ngreat respect, great respect. I admire him. And I admire the heritage \nhe brings to us from that great State of Alabama. I thank him always \nfor his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14009-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14009-S14010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ABUSES OF POWER\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, perhaps the greatest oration ever delivered \nwas the Oration on the Crown, delivered by Demosthenes in the year 330 \nB.C. In that inimitable oration, it seems to me the question was posed: \nWho least serves the state? And the question was answered in that \noration: He who does not speak his mind.\n  In this day, we should remember that. And I shall attempt to honor \nthat credo.\n  Mr. President, Americans have been stunned at the recent news of the \nabuses of power by an overzealous President. It has become apparent \nthat this administration has engaged in a consistent and unrelenting \npattern of abuse against our country's law-abiding citizens and against \nour Constitution.\n  We have been stunned to hear reports about the Pentagon gathering \ninformation and creating databases to spy on ordinary Americans whose \nonly sin is to choose to exercise their first amendment right to \npeaceably assemble. Those Americans who choose to question the \nadministration's flawed policy in Iraq are labeled by this \nadministration as ``domestic terrorists.'' Shame!\n  We now know that the FBI's use of national security letters on \nAmerican citizens has increased exponentially, requiring tens of \nthousands of individuals to turn over personal information and records.\n  These letters are issued without prior judicial review, and they \nprovide no real means for an individual to challenge a permanent gag \norder. And through news reports, my fellow Americans, through news \nreports we have been shocked to learn of the CIA's practice of \nrendition and the so-called black sites, secret locations--hear that, \nsecret locations--in foreign countries where abuse and interrogations \nhave been exported to escape the reach of U.S. laws protecting against \nhuman rights abuses.\n  We know that our Vice President, Dick Cheney, has asked for \nexemptions for the CIA from the language maintained in the McCain \ntorture amendment banning cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment. \nThank God, Vice President Cheney's pleas have been rejected by this \nCongress.\n  Now comes the stomach-churning revelation, through an Executive \norder, that President Bush has circumvented both the Congress and the \ncourt. Get that. Shame! Shame! He has usurped the third branch of \nGovernment, the branch charged with protecting the civil liberties of \nour people, by directing the National Security Agency to intercept and \neavesdrop on the phone conversations and e-mails of American citizens \nwithout a warrant, which is a clear violation of the fourth amendment. \nGet that. He has stiff-armed the people's branch of Government, this \nbranch, the people's branch. He has rationalized the use of domestic \ncivilian surveillance with a flimsy claim that he has such authority \nbecause we are at war.\n  The Executive order, which has been acknowledged by the President, is \nan end run around the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which \nmakes it unlawful for any official to monitor the communications of an \nindividual on American soil without the approval of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court. What is the President thinking? What \nis the President thinking?\n  Congress has provided for the very situations which the President is \nblatantly exploiting. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, \nhoused in the Department of Justice, reviews requests for warrants for \ndomestic surveillance. The court can review these requests \nexpeditiously and in times of great emergency. In extreme cases, where \ntime is of the essence and national security is at stake, surveillance \ncan be conducted before the warrant is even applied for. This secret \ncourt was established so that sensitive surveillance could be conducted \nand information could be gathered without compromising the security of \nthe investigation. The purpose of the FISA Court is to balance the \nGovernment's role in fighting the war on terror with the fourth \namendment rights afforded to each and every American. Yet the American \npublic is given vague and empty assurances by the President that amount \nto little more than ``trust me.''\n  But we are a nation of laws and not of men. Where is the source of \nthat authority the President claims? I defy the administration to show \nfor the record where in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or \nwhere in the United States Constitution they are allowed to steal into \nthe lives of innocent American citizens and spy.\n  When asked recently what the source of that authority was, Secretary \nof State Condoleezza Rice had no answer. Secretary Rice seemed to \ninsinuate that eavesdropping on Americans was acceptable because FISA \nwas an outdated law and could not address the needs of the Government \nin combating the new war on terror. This is a patent falsehood. The USA \nPATRIOT Act expanded FISA significantly, equipping the Government with \nthe tools it needed to fight terrorism. Further amendments to FISA were \ngranted under the Intelligence Authorization Act of 2002 and the \nHomeland Security Act of 2002. In fact, in its final report, the 9/11 \nCommission noted that the removal of the\n\n[[Page S14010]]\n\npre-9/11 ``wall'' between intelligence officials and law enforcement \nwas significant in that it ``opened up new opportunities for \ncooperative action.''\n  But the President claims--hear me!--that these powers are within his \nrole as Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy. Make no mistake, the \npowers granted to the Commander in Chief in this Constitution are \nspecifically those as head of the Armed Forces.\n  These warrantless searches are conducted not against a foreign power \nbut against whom? Against unsuspecting and unknowing American \ncitizens--like you, like you, like you, and like you! They are \nconducted against individuals living on American soil--not in Iraq, not \nin Afghanistan. There is nothing within the powers granted in the \nCommander in Chief clause that grants the President the ability to \nconduct clandestine surveillance of American civilians. Nothing. We \nmust not allow such groundless, foolish claims to stand unchallenged.\n  Now, the President claims boundless authority, an unlimited authority \nthrough the resolution that authorized war on those who perpetrated the \nSeptember 11 attacks. But that resolution does not give the President \nunchecked power to spy on our own people. Read it. That resolution does \nnot give the President unchecked power to spy on our own people. That \nresolution does not give the White House, this administration, the \npower to create covert prisons for secret prisoners. That resolution \ndoes not authorize the torture of prisoners to extract information from \nthem. That resolution does not authorize running black hole secret \nprisons in foreign countries to get around U.S. law. That resolution \ndoes not give this President, or any President, the powers reserved \nonly for kings and potentates.\n  I continue to be shocked and astounded by the breadth with which this \nadministration undermines the constitutional protections afforded to \nthe people--the people--and the raw arrogance with which it rebukes the \npowers held by the legislative and judicial branches. The President has \ncast off Federal law enacted by Congress, often bearing his own \nsignature, as mere formality. He has rebuffed the rule of law, and he \nhas trivialized and trampled upon, trampled under foot the prohibitions \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures guaranteed to Americans by \nthe United States Constitution. This Constitution still lives. This \nConstitution was made for all time, for all administrations, for all \nPresidents, for all Senators.\n  We are supposed to accept these dirty little secrets, and we are told \nthat it is irresponsible to draw attention to President Bush's gross \nabuse of power and constitutional violations. But what is truly \nirresponsible is to neglect to uphold the rule of law.\n  We listened to the President speak last night on the potential for \ndemocracy in Iraq. The President claims to want to instill in the Iraqi \npeople a tangible freedom and working democracy, at the same time that \nhe violates our own U.S. laws and checks and balances. President Bush \ncalled the recent Iraqi election ``a landmark day in the history of \nliberty.'' I daresay in this country we may have reached our own sort \nof landmark. Never have the promises and protections of liberty seemed \nso illusory, so fleeting. These renegade assaults on the Constitution \nand our system of laws strike at the very core of our values and foster \na sense of mistrust and apprehension about the reach of Government.\n  I am reminded of Thomas Payne's famous words: ``These are the times \nthat try men's souls.''\n  These astounding revelations about the bending, the twisting, the \nstretching, and contorting of the Constitution to justify a grasping, \nirresponsible administration under the banner of ``national security'' \nare an outrage. Congress can no longer sit on the sidelines. It is time \nto ask hard questions of the Attorney General. It is time to ask hard \nquestions of the Secretary of State, of the Secretary of Defense, and \nof the Director of the CIA. The White House should not be allowed to \nexempt itself from answering the same questions simply because it might \nassert some kind of ``executive privilege'' in order to avoid further \nembarrassment.\n  The practice of domestic spying on citizens should stop immediately. \nOversight hearings need to be conducted. Judicial action may be in \norder. We need to finally be given answers to our questions: Where is \nthe constitutional and statutory authority for spying on American \ncitizens? Where? Where is that authority to be found?\n  What is the content of these classified legal opinions asserting that \nthere is a legality in this criminal usurpation of rights?\n  Who is responsible for this dangerous and unconstitutional policy?\n  How many American citizens' lives have been unknowingly affected?\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, let us in our day remember the words \nof Brutus to Cicero:\n\n       Our ancestors scorned to bear even a gentle master!\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14010-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14010-S14011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to commend my \ncolleague from West Virginia, Robert C. Byrd. Some of the people who \nare witnessing this session of the Senate had a chance to hear this man \nspeak just moments ago. I do not know of another Senator more dedicated \nto our U.S. Constitution or one who has been more fearless in attacking \nPresidents of both political parties when he thinks that they have gone \ntoo far. Senator Byrd's speech should be read by every American as a \nreminder of basic freedoms in this country that we should never, ever \ntake for granted.\n  I listened to his speech as I was sitting in my office and I thought \nI would come to the Chamber and try to follow in his footsteps, though \nwhat I have to offer cannot possibly match what he had to say.\n  Several things have occurred over the last several years which are \nhistoric in nature and troubling. This administration has decided on \nthree occasions, at least three separate occasions, to depart from the \ntraditions of America, traditions which we have followed for \ngenerations, Presidents, Republican and Democratic alike.\n  It was this administration which told us we could no longer wait to \nbe threatened by another country, we could no longer wait to be \nattacked by another country, we must act preemptively, we must strike \nfirst, based on intelligence and information we must attack first, and \nthat is why we invaded Iraq. What did that intelligence lead us to \nbelieve? That Iraq had weapons of mass destruction threatening the \nUnited States and our allies; that Iraq was developing nuclear weapons \nthat could threaten the Middle East and the United States; that Iraq \nwas in concert in some way with al-Qaida and responsible for the 9/11 \nattacks; that Iraq was securing fissile material from Africa to \nmanufacture into nuclear weapons. All of those things were told to the \nAmerican people, some by the President in his State of the Union \naddress, and every single one of them turned out to be wrong.\n  The President told us we needed to attack Iraq for those reasons, and \nit turned out none of the reasons were valid, not one. So he would \nchange the foreign policy of the United States not to wait and \ncarefully make a decision about whether we commit our troops and our \ntreasure but, rather, to move preemptively--a departure from foreign \npolicy for generations.\n  Secondly, this administration said that we had to depart from the \ntraditions of the United States for generations when it came to the \ninterrogation of prisoners. This Bush administration argued that we had \nto redefine torture in a way that was inconsistent with treaties the \nUnited States has accepted as law of the land. Terrible things \noccurred. We saw the worst of them in some of the photos from Abu \nGhraib and reports from other agencies.\n  Thank goodness for the leadership of Senator John McCain, a \nRepublican of Arizona, himself a POW in the Vietnam War, also a victim \nof torture in that experience, who stood up to the administration and \nsaid, You are wrong. Torture is not American. If we are fighting for \nvalues, those values cannot include torture.\n  He was responding to our troops who were writing to Members of \nCongress saying, Give us clarity, give us direction, tell us if the \nworld has changed;\n\n[[Page S14011]]\n\nsoldiers, graduates of West Point, who were told we do not engage in \ntorture as soldiers representing the flag of the United States of \nAmerica. Thank goodness for the leadership of Senator McCain in \nconfronting the Bush administration and forcing them to back down when \nit came to this dramatic change in the standards for torture.\n  Now comes another chapter in changing the tradition of America under \nthis administration relative to our right of privacy as American \ncitizens, the PATRIOT Act, which I voted for to give this Government \nmore powers to fight terrorism, but we said every 4 years we will look \nat it to make certain we have not gone too far, that we have not given \nup our basic rights and freedoms in the name of security and safety.\n  Now we are involved in a debate. My colleague from Alabama has been \nto the floor several times. As a former prosecutor, he argues that \nunder the PATRIOT Act we have to trust the Government, we have to trust \nthe prosecutors, not to go too far. Unfortunately, that is not the \nstandard in America. The standard in America says in this Constitution, \nthis Bill of Rights, that our basic freedoms are guaranteed to us, and \nbefore this Government takes those freedoms or infringes upon them, \nthere must be good reason and good cause.\n  Last week, on a bipartisan basis, we said, Stop this version of the \nPATRIOT Act, make certain that changes are made so that the freedoms \nand rights of Americans are protected. In the midst of that debate came \na revelation which is truly astounding, a revelation that for years the \nBush administration, through Government agencies, has been involved in \nwiretaps and eavesdropping on American citizens. The reason this is of \nconcern, of course, is that it violates a longstanding legal \nrequirement that the Government has to obtain a court order to \neavesdrop electronically on an American in the United States. We spell \nout with specificity what the Government must do if it is going to \ninvade our privacy, listen to our conversations, hack into our \ncomputers, whatever it may be. The grounding for that is not just some \nspeech on the Senate floor or the House; the grounding for that is this \nConstitution, where its fourth amendment makes it clear from the \nbeginning of this Nation the standard we would use, a standard worth \nrepeating in the fourth amendment:\n\n       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n     houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches \n     and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall \n     issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or \n     affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be \n     searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\n  That is in our Constitution that we have sworn to uphold. And for \nthousands of unsuspecting Americans, their basic records, their \ncommunications, their computers have been looked at and listened to by \nthis Government, without legal authority.\n  So therein lies the third dramatic departure of this administration, \nfrom a tradition which most of us assumed would never be violated, a \ntradition which says that our privacy can be compromised if a President \nassumes the power to do it. This President did not come to Congress \nsaying, I need powers to listen to America's conversations. No. He just \ndid it. He said he has the power to do it as Commander in Chief.\n  Well, there are some obvious questions that should be asked when we \nhear these things. Where is the concern in Congress? Where is the sense \nof outrage in the Senate? Where is the sense of obligation that our \ngeneration owes to our children to make certain that we are held \naccountable to protect their constitutional rights? I am glad that \nSenator Specter of the Judiciary Committee has said we will have a \nhearing on this, and we should. This is a serious matter.\n  Some of us saw recently a movie about Edward R. Murrow titled ``Good \nNight and Good Luck.'' I remember Edward R. Murrow. As a young boy, I \nused to see him on television from time to time. This movie depicts the \nMcCarthy era where the Congress in this case overstepped its authority, \nand one Senator from Wisconsin literally destroyed lives, literally \ninfringed on the rights and liberties of individual citizens. The sense \nof outrage in America rose to such a level that eventually he was \ncalled to task and discredited for what he had done in violation of the \nbasic rights of American citizens. It took some time. In the beginning, \nthe red scare kept people quiet, they did not want to raise this issue.\n  Sadly, in this war on terrorism, we may be going through a parallel \nmoment in history, where our fear of another 9/11 has kept us entirely \ntoo quiet and silent when this Government has gone too far. I hope what \nwe have learned about this wiretapping and this eavesdropping, these \nviolations of basic rights of citizens, will cause all Americans, not \njust those of us serving in the Senate, to stand up and speak out. If \nwe swore to uphold this Constitution, it was not just the paper that it \nis written on but the spirit and values that it stands for, values of \nprivacy and freedom which once lost may never be reclaimed.\n  I urge my colleagues to read carefully the earlier remarks of Senator \nRobert Byrd and consider carefully our individual responsibilities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I ask what the order is at this moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business, with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14011-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14011-S14012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      APPEALS REFORM ACT LANGUAGE\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern that \nlanguage was not included yet again by this Congress in the \nsupplemental bill--which is now embodied in Defense appropriations--to \nclarify that categorical exclusions as used by the U.S. Forest Service \nunder the Appeals Reform Act of 1993 are exempt from comment and \nappeals.\n  That sounds technical, doesn't it? It isn't so technical if you \nbelieve in the Healthy Forest Act and the ability of the Forest \nService, as so prescribed by the Congress, to operate under that \nspecific act. A legislative fix is desperately needed as projects \ncontinue to pile up and create additional backlog for our U.S. Forest \nService.\n  At the heart of this issue is when, where, and how the public is \nincluded in the execution of categorical exclusions extended in the \nprojects. By definition, categorically excluded projects are categories \nof action which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant \neffect on the human environment and therefore normally do not require \nfurther analysis in either an environmental assessment or an \nenvironmental impact statement. The Forest Service requires scoping on \neach and every project on Forest Service land in which they want to \nutilize the categorical exclusion.\n  Let me quote from the Forest Service Environmental Procedures \nHandbook:\n\n       Scoping is required on all proposed actions, including \n     those that would appear to be categorically excluded.\n\n  In other words, those actions the Forest Service may take on Forest \nService ground in a given watershed that we have said are excluded \nunder the Healthy Forest Act, as it relates to the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act--meaning an environmental impact statement--we \nstill say the Forest Service scoping is required on all proposed \nactions, including those that would appear not to need a categorical \nexclusion.\n\n       If the responsible officials determine, based on scoping, \n     that it is uncertain whether the proposed action may have a \n     significant effect on the environment, prepare an EA [and \n     that is chapter 40]. If the responsible official determines, \n     based on scoping, that the proposed actions may have a \n     significant environmental effect, prepare an EIS.\n\n  That is an environmental impact statement.\n  In other words, we have tried to be very careful within the law to \nmake sure that happens. I am going to submit for the Record a much more \ndetailed understanding of what exactly we mean because it is critically \nimportant at this moment that we allow the Forest Service to get back \non track.\n  Having said that, I have talked legalese as it relates to a specific \nact of Congress and a law that is in place now for our Forest Service \nto act. What does it mean in real life, what does it mean on the \nground? I think all of us witnessed the fires of late fall and early \nwinter in the greater Los Angeles watershed that were burning the scrub \noak in the foothill country in back of Los Angeles. In most instances, \nthose\n\n[[Page S14012]]\n\nfires in the past have not only consumed the scrub oak, they have \nconsumed, in some instances, hundreds of beautiful and very expensive \nhomes that are within those areas. This year, it is interesting that, \nof the thousands of acres that were burned, only one home was burned.\n\n  In talking to the firefighters, why were they able to control the \nfires in a better way and why were fewer homes lost, they said very \nclearly, because it was the thinning and the cleaning of the brush and \nundergrowth that was allowed by the categorical exclusions of the \nHealthy Forest Act. In other words, the fuel buildup that naturally \noccurs on public lands, and in this instance in urban watersheds in \nwhich the Healthy Forest Act is more specific, categorical exclusions \nwere granted. In other words, the scoping process of the Forest Service \nto determine the impact that the action of cleaning and thinning would \nhave on public lands was determined not to be of major environmental \nconsequence, and therefore the Forest Service was allowed to proceed.\n  Along comes a judge just this summer and says: no no, you have to do \nan EA, you have to do an EIS, on all, including those provisions the \nCongress spoke specifically to as it related to categorical exclusions. \nIn other words, within the category an exclusion is allowed for certain \nactions on forested public lands for the purpose of sustaining the \nquality of the watershed and the health of the forest, and so on and so \nforth.\n  What is clearly a loss now is that the Forest Service, in planning \nfor next year's actions on the ground--the thinning and the cleaning of \nour forests to ensure forest health, to bring down the overall threat \nof fire--has been dramatically diminished by this judge's action.\n  We had hoped in the supplemental to gain the language necessary to \nreinstate the categorical exclusions, as was and as has been clearly \ndebated as the intent of Congress. That has been denied. So when \nCongress reconvenes in January and early February, we are going to have \nto work overtime to make sure that we get this law into place.\n  What does it mean? It means protecting watersheds. It means \nprotecting homes that have been built up against the forested lands, \ndoing the right kinds of actions which result in the cleaning up of our \nforests and the ensuring of the vitality of the environment within.\n  What the judge's action means in essence is that you have to spend \ntens of millions of dollars perfecting an EA--or in this instance a \nfull environmental impact statement--to be able to proceed. We believe \nthat under certain circumstances where the health of the forest is \ncritical, and in this instance the Los Angeles Basin, where we saw the \naction of being able to control fires because the overall fuel load on \nour public lands was dramatically reduced by the thinning and the \ncleaning in that region of the country--without that we simply will not \nbe able to move forward as expeditiously as the Healthy Forest Act \nintended that we move. That is what is at issue here. I had hoped we \nwould gain that. We have not gained that in the DOD appropriations and \nsupplemental language that was applied.\n  Federal lands recovery work that is going on in Mississippi and \nLouisiana and Texas, work that was caused by the hurricanes Katrina and \nRita, is now included in this problem. So are, overall, 800 planned, \ncategorically excluded low-impact projects and hazardous fuel reduction \nprojects affecting over 234 communities and 200 currently planned, \nprescribed burning projects that, if delayed, would more than likely \nput them beyond optimum and safe burning conditions, delayed because of \nthe action of the judge and therefore pushed off for another year.\n  That is the critical nature of this issue and why I have come to the \nChamber. As one of the chief cosponsors of the 1993 Appeals Reform Act, \nI know we had no expectation or belief that categorical exclusions \nplaced in 1993 would be subject to the Appeals Reform Act. It is \nimportant that we move forward to clarify this language.\n  I understand some on this floor today think otherwise.\n  Perhaps it would be wise to review the amount of public participation \ninvolved in the development of the Categorical Exclusions regulations \nthat both the Clinton administration and then the Bush administration \nhave developed since the Appeals Reform Act was first passed in 1993.\n  In the mid-1990s, the Clinton administration proposed significant \nchanges to the Categorical Exclusions. They did this through an \nAdministrative Procedures Act--APA--rulemaking process which included \nboth a proposed and final rulemaking, including extensive review of \nnumerous public comments.\n  Those categorical exclusions withstood a number of legal challenges \nand remained in place until 2003.\n  In 2000, the Bush administration undertook extensive analysis of \nthousands of projects to develop a series of new categorical exclusion \nproposals.\n  After review of literally thousands of projects the Bush \nadministration proposed a number of changes to the Clinton \nadministration's categorical exclusions. They did this through an APA \nrulemaking that again included extensive public comments.\n  I think it is important that my fellow Senators understand that the \noriginal Heartwood II settlement agreement, which attempted to nullify \ncategorical exclusions, was rejected by the District Court in which it \nwas brought and the case was dismissed.\n  Now, the Eastern District Court of California has chosen to resurrect \nthat settlement agreement and impose it nationally.\n  I know that some people in the Chamber today may still be concerned \nthat the land managers may miss something and not realize there could \nbe a potential problem.\n  Between the scoping that is required, the extraordinary assessment \nthat is required, and the public notice requirements that will be \nrequired if this language is maintained, it is inconceivable to me that \nprojects that might be environmentally detrimental could be carried out \nthrough the categorical exclusion process.\n  This body should reject the efforts of the ``gum up the works'' crowd \nwho want more process to slow down more projects.\n  The current categorical exclusions are based on more data and \nanalysis than anytime in history.\n  We have more protections to ensure they are not misused than anytime \nin history, and we will have more public notice on categorical \nexclusions than anytime in history if we adopt the language in this \nbill.\n  I hope this Congress sees fit to address this situation before it is \ntoo late. We thought we could. We will have to return early next year \nto get that kind of work done.\n\n  What is at stake now is the health of the forest, the health of the \nwatershed, and literally hundreds of thousands of homes spread across \nthe landscape that are about or near public forest, public lands, that \ncould find themselves in a condition that would jeopardize their \npresence by fire, which could ensure where fuel-laden lands exist.\n  I thought it was important that I submit that for the Record because \nit is critically important that we move forward on that issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Every Senator supported the \nSenate's reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act last July when it passed \nthe Senate unanimously.\n  Last Friday, 47 of us said the House-Senate conference report is not \nyet good enough. Before we make the PATRIOT Act permanent, we must make \nit right.\n  The PATRIOT Act that we passed 4 years ago, which I supported, gave \nthe Federal Government unprecedented powers to conduct surveillance on \nAmerican citizens and demand information about their private \nactivities, about their personal lives. We passed the PATRIOT Act \nhastily in the Senate 4 years ago, too hastily in retrospect. We passed \nit when my caucus was in the majority. So we, and I, were\n\n[[Page S14013]]\n\nresponsible for that haste. It seemed necessary in the immediate \naftermath of 9/11.\n  One important consideration for this Senator, then, when we voted for \nthe PATRIOT Act was that it would sunset in 4 years, and this Congress \nwould take the time to review it carefully and modify it as necessary \nto assure the proper balance between combating terrorism and protecting \nthe privacy of innocent Americans.\n  As I said 5 months ago, the Senate passed unanimously our \nreauthorization of the PATRIOT Act with important changes to protect \nconstitutional rights of innocent American citizens.\n  The House passed its version of the new PATRIOT Act in July, also, \nallowing plenty of time for the House-Senate conference committee to \nresolve their differences in the best interests of all Americans. But \nthe House did not appoint conferees until last month. The House leaders \nchose to engage in this take-it-or-leave-it brinksmanship to try to \nforce the Senate to accept their permanent invasion of the private \nlives of innocent Americans.\n  Last Friday, 47 Senators--5 Republicans, 41 Democrats, and 1 \nindependent--said: No, we will not accept this version of the PATRIOT \nAct. We do not oppose the PATRIOT Act, as the President and others have \nfalsely charged. Most of us voted for the original law 4 years ago, and \nall of us in this Senate voted for the new one last July. Many of us, \nmyself included, have proposed extending the existing law for another 3 \nmonths to give conferees time to resolve our remaining differences to \ndesign a permanent PATRIOT Act that most of us can support.\n  What we haven't said is there is more brinkmanship with the President \nand the Senate leader threatening to let the existing law expire so \nthey can blame 47 of us for supposedly weakening the protections of the \nAmerican people.\n  Let us be very clear. Let the American people be very clear. If the \nPATRIOT Act is allowed to expire, that is the choice and the \nresponsibility of the President and the Senate majority leadership.\n  Today is December 19. The Senate is still in session with 12 more \ndays until the year's end. That is enough time either to revise the \nconference report so that it has broad bipartisan support in the Senate \nor to extend the existing law.\n\n  All of us, every Member of this Senate, supported the Senate version \nof the new law that passed unanimously 5 months ago. It is absurd and \nwrong for detractors to claim that we do not support it now when we \njust disagree with a few but a very important few features in it.\n  Last Saturday, President Bush also reasserted his right to do \nwhatever he deems necessary to protect the American people from \nterrorist attacks. That is an enormous responsibility, one that \nCongress shares with him. However, we differ in our approaches.\n  The President's legal counsel has opined that he has the \nconstitutional authority as Commander in Chief and the legal authority \nfrom Congress post-9/11 to override or ignore any laws or limitations \nthat he decides necessary to combat terrorism.\n  Whether Congress intended ``any and all force necessary'' to include \nthat authority is highly questionable. But that is the President's \noperating assumption.\n  If the President can do whatever he wants, whether it is legal or \nnot, and his decision to do it makes it legal, then in a sense the \nPATRIOT Act is not even necessary because the President can order it \nall done anyway.\n  In another sense, however, our getting the PATRIOT Act right becomes \neven more imperative because we are a nation of laws, laws which must \nbe followed by everyone--even the President, even the FBI, even the \nNational Security Agency, during good times and bad, during war and \npeace, because our existence as a nation, as a constitutional democracy \nrequires it and depends upon it.\n  No external threat to our way of life could be so great as the danger \nthat our rule of law not be obeyed by our most powerful institutions \nand individuals.\n  This Senate exists to make those laws. Every one of us--all 100 of \nus--takes that responsibility most seriously because we assume that our \nlaws matter, that they will be honored and obeyed, or that they will be \nenforced so that they will define the legal courses of action that \neveryone in this country must follow. Otherwise, we are irrelevant and \nlaws that we enact are meaningless.\n  Our operating assumption, however, continues to be that our laws will \nbe obeyed, and, thus, our efforts in the Senate do matter. That is why \nwe want and we deserve the time necessary to get our laws right. That \nis the way our process is supposed to work. All 41 or more Senators to \nhold up legislation in order to get it right is the way our process is \nsupposed to work.\n  It is strange, to say the least, that those who assert their right to \nignore our rules and our laws are vilifying us in this Senate for \nfollowing them.\n  For people watching us today who may be unfamiliar with the details \nof the existing PATRIOT Act, let me give you an example of what it is \nthat we are trying to correct.\n  According to the Washington Post, last year, under the PATRIOT Act, \nsome 56 FBI field agents signed over 30,000 national security letters. \nThat is 100 times more than before the act. They were not directed \ntoward possible terrorists but, rather, to people, to businesses, to \nuniversities, to libraries that might have information about people who \nmight be terrorists. The PATRIOT Act requires them to turn over the \ninformation demanded, the most personal information, including health \nrecords, Internet use, upon demand, with no recourse. It is a criminal \nact under the PATRIOT Act for them to tell anyone else about the \nGovernment's demands, even to consult with an attorney.\n  Under an Executive order which President Bush signed 2 years ago, all \nthat private-personal information remains permanently in the \nGovernment's files and can be shared with other Government agencies \neven after the suspect has been determined to be completely innocent.\n  The new PATRIOT Act, which 100 Senators unanimously supported last \nJuly, would not prevent the Federal Government from demanding that \ninformation on some 30,000 businesses, universities, and individuals \nevery year in order to combat terrorism. It would only provide minimal \nlegal rights of independent judicial review of those demands when some \ninnocent person, business, library, or university believes the Federal \nGovernment has gone too far.\n\n  No one wants to prevent the Federal Government from stopping \nterrorists or preventing terrorist acts against the United States. We \ndo want to prevent some people, however well intended they believe they \nare, from going too far. Secret torture prisons in other countries is \ngoing too far. Spying on Americans is going too far. Denying due \nprocess, even the right to consult with an attorney, for innocent \nAmericans, is going too far.\n  Former Republican Congressman Robert Barr said it well:\n\n       Enough of this business of justifying everything as \n     necessary for the war on terror. Either the Constitution and \n     the laws of this country mean something or they don't. It's \n     truly frightening what is going on in this country.\n\n  Thank you, Congressman Barr.\n  Those in the Senate who believe the Constitution and our laws enacted \nunder it still mean something, we are trying to get the PATRIOT Act \nbefore we make it permanent, and we deserve our right to do so. It is \nan inversion and a perversion of the values of this great Nation when \nit becomes legitimate to set up illegal torture prisons in other \ncountries or to conduct illegal spying in this country but illegitimate \nfor the Senate to carry out its own due process.\n  This Senate must not adjourn for this year until we either extend the \nexisting PATRIOT Act or pass a new one acceptable to a broad bipartisan \nmajority of this Senate. Anyone who prevents Members from doing one or \nthe other is placing their personal politics ahead of the protection of \nthe American people. That would be dangerous and destructive personal \npolitics. That is why we must vote on a 3-month extension of the \nexisting PATRIOT Act or a new conference report before we adjourn this \nyear.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S14014]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the conference report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the House to the bill (S. \n     1932), to provide for reconciliation pursuant to section \n     202(a) of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2006 (H. Con. Res. 95), having met, have agreed that the \n     Senate recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the \n     House, and agree to the same with an amendment, and the House \n     agree to the same, signed by a majority of the conferees on \n     the part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record of Sunday, December 18, 2005.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are now on the deficit reduction \nconference report. We have 10 hours of debate, 5 hours equally divided. \nI know my colleague from North Dakota wants to speak tonight.\n  Just for the edification of our membership, we will run some time off \nthe clock tonight--I think about 2 hours--and then come back tomorrow \nand continue the debate and hopefully wrap this up tomorrow.\n  This bill is a culmination of a lot of work done in the Congress, by \nthe President, and by the Members of the Republican Party, to try to \nput some discipline into the fiscal accounts of the Federal Government. \nThis bill represents the first time in 8 years that the Federal \nGovernment has attempted to control the rate of growth in entitlement \nspending. People who watch this debate understand this issue, but just \nto frame it again, Federal Government spending is divided into \nbasically three different areas.\n  There is interest on debt, which we have virtually no control over.\n  There is the discretionary spending, otherwise known as the \nappropriations process, which means every year we spend a certain \namount of money. It is really up to us how much we spend, and it is for \nspecific programs. The majority of it goes to the defense spending, but \nother money goes to education, it goes to environmental issues, it goes \nto highways--things for which every year we appropriate, saying we are \ngoing to spend this much. We can change that number arbitrarily from \nyear to year, and we do.\n  The third element of Federal spending is called mandatory entitlement \nspending. This spending occurs as a matter of law because certain \npeople have come to certain situations in their life which allows them \nto receive a benefit from the Federal Government. They may be veterans \nwho have served us well; they, therefore, get benefits. They may be \npersons of low income who need assistance, especially a child in a low-\nincome family who needs assistance. They may be a retired citizen who \npaid into Social Security, who gets health care under Medicare, or a \nlow-income person who gets health care under Medicaid, especially \nnursing care. These are entitlements. They make up the vast majority of \nFederal spending. Discretionary spending only makes up 30 percent of \nthe Federal accounts, and half of that is defense spending.\n  Entitlements are also the fastest growing part of the Federal \nGovernment. We know because the baby boom generation is going to \nretire, and spending on entitlements, specifically on Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, the health care accounts especially, is going to \nincrease radically over the next generation's 30 years as the baby boom \ngeneration begins to retire. It is estimated today by the Comptroller \nGeneral that there is a $44 trillion--that is trillion dollars with a \n``T''--$44 trillion unfunded liability, which means we don't know how \nwe are going to pay for it. The obligation is in place already for the \ncost, primarily for health care programs for retired people who are \ngoing to be the baby boom generation.\n  The practical effect of having that high an obligation out there and \nunpaid for is our children are going to have to pay the price. The \npractical effect of that is our children and our children's children, \nthese wonderful young people who work here as pages, when they become \nearners and have kids of their own are going to have to pay so much to \npay for programs which are already on the books to support our \ngeneration, the baby boom generation, they are essentially not going to \nbe able to have as high a quality of life as we have. They are not \ngoing to be as comfortable in sending their kids to college, buying a \ncar, buying a home, or just doing the day-to-day activities of life \nbecause they are going to have to pay a huge tax burden for our \ngeneration, unless we do something about it.\n  That is what this bill is about. For the first time in 8 years, the \nFederal Government has stepped up and said: We are going try to do \nsomething--the Republican side of the aisle--about this huge burden we \nare going to put on our children through entitlement accounts by \naddressing those accounts. We have been aggressive on the discretionary \nside. We have essentially frozen nondiscretionary spending, but on the \nentitlement side it continues to grow at a dramatic rate. This bill is \na step, really\n\n[[Page S14016]]\n\nmore than a toe, but putting our whole foot up to our ankle in the \nwater of trying to control entitlement spending, mandatory spending. It \namounts to almost $40 billion in savings in Federal spending.\n  If this bill passes, it will reduce the debt of the Federal \nGovernment which will be passed on to our children by $40 billion. That \nis a big number. It is a big number in New Hampshire, and I know it is \na big number in the State of every Member of this Senate. In the \ncontext of overall Federal spending, regrettably it is not as big a \nnumber as I would like, but it is still a big step forward on the road \ntoward fiscal responsibility, and it is the first attempt to do this in \n8 years. And this is an important point to stress. This is the only \nopportunity any Member of this Senate is going to have in this session \nof this Congress to try to control spending, to try to reduce the debt \nof the Federal Government.\n\n  We are going to hear a lot of talk from the other side saying: Well, \nyou have a tax relief bill out there which is being reconciled, and it \nis twice the size of the spending restraint here. The tax bill isn't \nbeing voted on tonight or tomorrow; the deficit reduction bill is being \nvoted on tonight or tomorrow. If you want to reduce the deficit, if you \nwant to reduce the debt of the Federal Government, reduce the costs \nthat will be passed on to our children and our children's children, \nthis is your opportunity to do it. If you want to vote against the tax \nrelief bill, go ahead.\n  I note as an aside that the tax relief bill has as its major function \ncommitments to programs which I think have vast support across this \nCongress. In fact, I have heard other Members on the other side of the \naisle say: Why aren't we passing a patch to the AMT so 20 million \npeople do not fall under the alternative minimum tax? That is $30 \nbillion of the tax bill. Why aren't we extending the deductibility of \nState and local sales taxes? That is a big chunk of the tax bill. Why \naren't we extending the R tax credit, which causes us to create jobs \nin this country by giving entrepreneurs an incentive to go out and \ninvest in R?\n  We are hearing that from the other side of the aisle. The majority of \nthe items in the tax relief package of $70 billion are items which have \nvery broad support in this Congress--Democratic and Republican support. \nSo it is a bit of a straw dog--in fact, it is a very large straw dog, \nmaybe a Newfoundland straw dog--to claim that extension of the tax bill \nfor some reason, the majority of which is supported on both sides the \naisle, is somehow reducing the effort on the deficit in this bill.\n  The two don't have that much relationship, and furthermore the tax \nbill already has broad support on the main elements of it. The only \nones at issue are dividends and capital gains, which do not even impact \nthis year or next year because that part of the tax relief package \ndoesn't kick in until 2009 or 2010.\n  This is it, folks. It is your one chance as Members of Congress, as \nMembers of the Senate, to actually do something about the debt we are \ngoing to pass on to our children. You have an opportunity to reduce \nthat debt by almost $40 billion.\n  In addition, I would note, there is a net number, the $40 billion.\n  There are initiatives in this bill which are fully paid for which \nmake a lot of sense and which are pretty good policy. We decided to put \nthem in after we had saved money to pay for them.\n  For example, the Pell Grant Program is expanded dramatically to low-\nincome kids. This is a program to encourage low-income children who are \nespecially interested in math and science to be successful in our \nschools. We know it is the seed corn for our productivity and our \ncompetitiveness as a Nation to promote math and science skills.\n  There is an expansion of Medicaid to low-income children. About 1 \nmillion--over 1 million--needy kids today who are low income, who do \nnot have health coverage will get health coverage.\n  There are efforts in this bill to assist the people in the gulf \ncoast, significant efforts. It would be very hard, I would think, if I \nwere from the gulf coast to vote against this bill because there is a \ntremendous amount of funds being focused on the gulf coast, to address \nthe needs of the gulf coast in the area of education and in the area of \nMedicaid. Literally billions of dollars, all paid for.\n\n  In addition, there is money for LIHEAP, $1 billion. Those from cold \nregions of the country know because of the runup in the price of gas \nand oil it will be very hard for a number of low-income families to \nmake it through the winter. They will have to make some tough choices. \nWe want to fund the low-income energy assistance program. This bill \ndoes it; it pays for it with spending reductions.\n  In addition, there is significant and positive welfare reform \nlanguage which the Governors are asking for, bipartisan governorship is \nasking for, as well as Medicaid reform language--again, with \nbipartisan, strong support from the Governors--giving the Governors \nmore flexibility and allowing them to deliver more service to more low-\nincome people at less cost.\n  This bill has a lot of good policy in it as well as saving $40 \nbillion. It is the first and only opportunity--not the first \nopportunity because we voted on it a few times--the last opportunity to \ncast a vote to save $40 billion and not pass the debt on to our \nchildren.\n  It is a positive bill. I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his spirited \ndefense of this package. He is quite right. There are elements of this \npackage that are positive. There are elements of this package that at \nsome point we will adopt. Perhaps we will adopt them this year.\n  The chairman has left out certain chapters in the book of \nreconciliation. Reconciliation was part of this year's budget process. \nThere are three chapters in the book. The first chapter is the spending \ncuts that have now come back from the conference report, deliberations \nbetween the House and the Senate, that cut spending $40 billion over 5 \nyears. That is $8 billion a year when the budget is $2.5 trillion. If \nmy math is right, that is one three-hundred-fiftieth of the spending \nfor a year.\n  But what is left out of the chairman's presentation is the other \nchapters of the book. Chapter No. 2 is the tax cuts. He is quite right, \nthey are not before the Senate today, but they are coming. They are \npart of this package. They are part of this book. They are the second \nchapter. The second chapter cuts $70 billion of taxes. Put the two \ntogether, a $40 billion spending cut and a $70 billion tax cut, and \nguess what. You have increased the deficit, not reduced it.\n  This is all part of a package. It is part of the budget process, \nthree chapters that one has to read to reach a conclusion on the \nmeaning of the book. The third chapter is the one they really do not \nwant you to read. The third chapter increases the debt of the country \nby $781 billion. That is the third chapter. We do not hear them talk \nabout that chapter at all. There is a reason for that.\n  If we go back and look at what the President has said--in 2001, when \nwe enacted his economic program, he said:\n\n       [W]e can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \n     deficits, even if the economy softens.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That was in March of 2001. At that time, wasn't the \nFederal budget running a surplus?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly right. The Senator from Maryland, \na valued member of the Senate Committee on the Budget, remembers very \nwell the budget was in surplus. In fact, we had a projection from the \nadministration that we were going to have almost $6 trillion of \nsurplus.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So at the time we were running this surplus--and let me \njust note, it had taken a lot of work to get out of an earlier deficit \ninto surplus--and there was some concern expressed that the excessive \ntax cuts the President was proposing would throw us into a budget \ndeficit and we would lose that surplus, the President told us in no \nuncertain terms that there was no reason to fear budget deficits; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly correct. The President told us \nthere was no concern about the possibility of budget deficits. In fact, \nthe Senator may recall this chart provided by the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the\n\n[[Page S14017]]\n\nOffice of Management and Budget of the President that said this was the \nrange of possible outcomes going forward with the fiscal affairs of the \ncountry. They adopted the midpoint of this range of possible outcomes \nshowing very dramatic surpluses, all above the line, dramatic surpluses \nthroughout this entire period coming to 2005.\n  Look what actually happened. At that time, the worse case scenario \nwas this bottom line. We can see for the most part it was all in \nsurplus territory. This is what they said was the best case scenario. \nThey adopted the middle of the range of possible outcomes.\n  I can remember very well our Republican friends saying to me: Don't \nyou understand, Senator, it will be way above this midrange because the \ntax cuts will generate greater economic activity and more revenue.\n  Now we can look back and test that theory and see what happened in \nthe real world. Here is what happened in the real world: This red line, \nit is far below the worst case estimate of what might happen. In fact, \nit represents massive deficits, the biggest in our history. That is \nwhat really happened.\n  Then the President said the next year, in the State of the Union \nAddress:\n\n     . . . Our budget will run a deficit that will be small and \n     short-term . . .\n\n  That was after saying there would not be any deficits. That proved to \nbe wrong.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So the previous year the President was saying there \nwould be no deficit, and a year later, in the face of what obviously \nwould be a deficit, he said, well, it will be a small and short-term \ndeficit.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is exactly what he stated in 2002, small and short-\nterm deficit. Now we are able to check that record.\n  He made that claim in 2002, the first year we were into deficit, \nafter running surpluses in the years leading up to that.\n  In 2001, the first year he was in office, the budget from the \nprevious administration had a surplus. The next year, after his \npolicies were adopted, we plunged into deficit. Then he told us that \nyear the deficits were small and short term.\n  The chart shows what has happened. The next year the deficit got much \nworse. In 2003, it was approaching $400 billion. In 2004, the deficits \nactually exceeded $400 billion. This year, the deficit is over $300 \nbillion. Of course, much of the Katrina costs have not been included in \nthis year's deficit because it will be coming next year.\n  It is very interesting, the President was wrong about saying no \ndeficits. We saw that in 2002. So in 2002 he said they will be small \nand short term. He was wrong again. Instead of small and short term, \nthey are large and long lasting; in fact, the biggest deficits we have \never had in the history of the country.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In 4 years, after the President said there would be no \ndeficits, we have incurred deficits of, according to my quick \ncalculation, over $1.2 trillion; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is correct.\n  If you go to the next step, what we have is a situation that is more \nserious even than that. The deficit does not capture the increases in \nthe debt. The deficit last year was $319 billion. I say ``last year'' \nbecause we are now in Federal fiscal year 2006. That started October 1. \nSo the 2005 deficit ending the end of September, the year ending the \nend of September, was $319 billion. But here is how much got added to \nthe debt: not $319 billion but $551 billion. All of it has to be paid \nback.\n\n  Of course, as the Senator knows, the big difference between the two \ncalculations--the deficit and what got added to the debt--the biggest \ndifference is the money being taken from Social Security to pay other \nbills.\n  Last year, the last Federal fiscal year, $173 billion of Social \nSecurity money was taken to pay for other things. The result is, when \nyou add that with the deficit and other trust funds that are being \nraided--another $59 billion--what got added to the debt was really $551 \nbillion.\n  If we look back on the relationship between spending and revenue \nexpressed as a share of gross domestic product--and we do it in that \nway because economists tell us that is the best way to make these \ncomparisons--the red line on this chart is the spending line. You can \nsee, the spending had come down substantially until we reached the year \n2000. Spending had come down each and every year of the Clinton \nadministration as a share of gross domestic product. Now we have had a \nsubstantial uptick because of defense costs and homeland security, \nrebuilding New York.\n  But look at the revenue line. The revenue line, which was at a peak \nwhen the President came into office--he said this was a record high. He \nwas right--but look at how the revenue plunged with the President's \npolicies. Most of this is tax cuts. And the other, of course, is \neconomic slowdown. The result is, we have opened up a chasm between the \nrevenue line of the United States and the spending line. We see that \ngap going forward, and really at the worst possible time because this \nis before the baby boomers retire.\n  In looking at that, the President told us--the next year, after his \n2002 address--in 2003:\n\n       [O]ur budget gap is small by historical standards.\n\n  So first he told us there would be no deficits. Then he told us the \ndeficits would be small and short term. Both of those proved to be \nwrong. Then he said to us, well, they will be small by historical \nstandards.\n  Let's check that assertion because here is what we see: They are not \nsmall by historical standards. In fact, they are the biggest deficits \nwe have had in the history of the United States. I know the President \nlikes to say, well, as a share of GDP they are not as big as the \ndeficits in the 1980s. But that is because he excludes the money he is \ntaking from Social Security. Back in the 1980s, there was no money to \ntake from Social Security, or very little. Now there are large amounts \nto take from Social Security, and the President is taking it all, every \npenny; last year, $173 billion.\n  Over the next 10 years, under the President's plan, he is going to \ntake $2.5 trillion of Social Security money and use it to pay for other \nthings. This is at a time when he says there is a shortfall in Social \nSecurity. Well, he is helping create the shortfall in Social Security \nbecause he is taking the money and using it to pay for other things. \nThen the President told us in 2004:\n\n       So I can say to you that the deficit will be cut in half \n     over the next five years.\n\n  Let's review. In 2001, he told us there were going to be no deficits. \nHe was wrong. In 2002, he said it was going to be small and short term. \nWrong again. The next year he told us, in 2003, the deficits were going \nto be small by historical standards. Wrong again. They are the largest \ndeficits we have ever had in dollar terms. And if you measure \nappropriately, as a share of GDP, it is as large as the deficits in the \n1980s, when you include the money from Social Security that he is \ntaking to pay for other things.\n  Now he says he is going to cut the deficit in half over the next 5 \nyears. Well, let's examine that claim. Here is what the President says \nis going to happen: The deficit is going to get cut in half over the \nnext 5 years. But he has really left out a lot of things to make that \nassertion. He has left out the war cost past September 30 of this year. \nThere is nothing in his budget for that. He has left out the money to \nfix the alternative minimum tax, the old millionaire's tax that is \nrapidly becoming a middle-class tax trap. It costs $700 billion to fix. \nHe has no money in his budget to do it. And, of course, his Social \nSecurity plan, which is the biggest budget buster of all, he has no \nmoney in his budget to do that.\n  When you put all those items back in, you see quite a different \npicture emerge. In fact, past this 5 years, you see the deficit growing \ndramatically. Of course, the biggest reason for that is, the cost of \nthe President's tax cuts absolutely explodes in the second 5-year \nperiod.\n  Now, the President told us, back in 2001, how important it was to pay \ndown the debt. He said at the time:\n\n     . . . [M]y budget pays down a record amount of national debt. \n     We will pay off $2 trillion of debt over the next decade. \n     That will be the largest debt reduction of any country, ever. \n     Future generations shouldn't be forced to\n\n[[Page S14018]]\n\n     pay back money that we have borrowed. We owe this kind of \n     responsibility to our children and grandchildren.\n\n  So the President, back then, was telling us he was going to pay down \nthe debt. Well, there is no paydown of debt occurring here. The debt is \nexploding. It was $5.7 trillion back in 2001. It is $8 trillion today. \nAnd here is where it is headed: By 2010, under the terms of the budget \nthat we are discussing, the debt is going to reach $11.3 trillion. So \non this President's watch, the debt will have doubled. All the while, \nhe was telling us he was going to have maximum paydown of the debt, and \nthat we owed it to future generations to pay down debt. There is no \npaydown of debt going on here. The debt is skyrocketing.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This reconciliation process really is a package, in \nwhich you have to consider not only the spending cuts but the tax cuts \nthey are pushing through, as well as the increase in the debt. Am I \ncorrect that this reconciliation package includes raising the debt \nlimit by some $800 billion?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is correct. This package really does have \nthree chapters. The first chapter is the spending cuts, $40 billion \nover 5 years. There is only $8 billion a year in a $2.5 trillion \nbudget. It is so insignificant. But then the second chapter is cutting \ntaxes $70 billion, which, if you put the two together, there is no \ndeficit reduction going on here. They are increasing the deficit. And \nthe third chapter is extending the debt limit of the United States by \n$781 billion.\n  That is what happens if you read this whole book. It is not a \npleasant ending.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to tell the Senator one story. I was in a \nshopping center over the weekend, and I saw a bumper sticker on a car. \nThe bumper sticker said: ``Mr. Bush, we will be forever in your debt.'' \nJust then, the person whose car that was came along, and I said to \nthem: What was it you were thinking about that the President has done \nwhen you say we are going to be forever in his debt? I thought it was \nfor something he had done. The person said: Think about it. I meant \nexactly what it says. Mr. Bush, we are going to be forever in your \ndebt.\n  Here is the debt, which the Senator from North Dakota is pointing \nout. I think the person is right. We are going to be forever in this \ndebt. This is what is being handed to this generation, the next \ngeneration, and the generation after that.\n  As the Senator pointed out in the previous chart, they have doubled \nthe debt over this very short time period.\n  Mr. CONRAD. They have doubled it. And the amazing thing to me is our \ncolleagues are out here with a bill that is headlined, ``Deficit \nReduction.''\n  If you read the fine print and look at their own estimates of what \nhappens if this budget is finally approved and implemented, here is \nwhat it does to the debt. Anybody see any reduction of deficit here \nanywhere? This is taking us from $7.9 trillion of debt at the end of \nfiscal year 2005 and it is going to run it up to $11.3 trillion in 5 \nyears. Each and every year, according to their estimates of what their \nbudget does, the debt of the country is going to increase by $600 to \n$700 billion a year. They are out here talking about a deficit \nreduction package. Please. Do words have no meaning? Do we make phrases \nup in order to fool people? People aren't going to be fooled because \neach and every year they are going to be able to see what has happened \nunder the claims that are being made. Have the deficits been reduced? \nHas the debt been reduced? Or is it skyrocketing?\n  I make the assertion today that if this budget is actually \nimplemented for the next 5 years, for which it has been approved, at \nthe end of the time, the debt will be dramatically larger than the debt \ntoday. The kind of stunning result of all this is that our country is \nborrowing more and more money, much of it from abroad. I went and \nlooked at the external debt of the country. It took 42 Presidents--here \nare their pictures, all of these Presidents--224 years to run up a \ntrillion dollars of external debt. In fact, it was $1.01 trillion of \nexternal debt. This President has more than doubled it in 5 years. This \nPresident has run up more debt that is held by foreigners than 42 \nPresidents did in 224 years. That is a remarkable accomplishment. I \nhesitate to call it an accomplishment because accomplishment suggests \nsomething positive. There is nothing positive about it.\n  The result is, here are the countries to which we owe money. We owe \nJapan almost $700 billion. We owe China almost $250 billion. And my \nfavorite is the Caribbean Banking Centers. We owe them over $100 \nbillion. One would think, in the midst of all this, Congress would want \nto actually do something to reduce the deficit.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me go back to this external debt that is being held \noutside the country. Isn't it important to understand, as difficult as \nthe deficit and debt problems are, that when the debt is held \ninternally, it is Americans owing it to Americans. But when the debt is \nbeing held externally, it means that as a nation, we have to service \nthis debt which is being held outside of the country. So that amount \nbecomes a charge, as it were, against our own standard of living; isn't \nthat correct? Would not our standard of living be lowered as a \nconsequence of having to meet this external debt-servicing requirement?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly right. What is happening now is, \nwe used to borrow the money largely from ourselves. Now we are \nborrowing from abroad. Since the President took over, the debt of the \ncountry has gone from $5.7 trillion to $8 trillion. That is a $2.3 \ntrillion increase. Look at this: The debt has increased by $2.3 \ntrillion, but a trillion of it has come from abroad. Over 40 percent of \nthe debt that has been increased under this President is coming from \nabroad. Again, I go back to the historic record. It took 224 years and \n42 Presidents to run up a trillion dollars of debt held abroad. This \nPresident has exceeded that amount in 5 years.\n  During the President's term, the debt has increased $2.3 trillion, a \ntrillion of it coming from foreigners.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield? I note from his chart, in 2001, \nwe had $5.7 trillion in debt, of which $1 trillion was held abroad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So about a sixth, maybe 17 or 18 percent, was being \nheld abroad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This President has added $2.3 trillion in debt, of \nwhich $1.1 trillion is being held abroad. So there has been a dramatic \nshift in who is holding this debt and what that represents in terms of \na burden on our society.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is very dramatic. You can see the trend continuing. \nNow, when we have a bond auction, about half of the debt is being \nbought by foreigners.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There is a wonderful line in a Tennessee Williams play \nwhere Blanche DuBois says: I have always depended on the kindness of \nstrangers. It seems to me that is what is happening to the fiscal \nsituation of the United States. We are becoming increasingly dependent \non foreigners and in particular foreign countries, since this debt now \nis being purchased largely by the central banks and not by individual \ninvestors. There has been a dramatic shift in terms of who is holding \nour debt. We are becoming increasingly dependent on others for our \nfiscal survival. It is a dramatic and deeply concerning development.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I spoke to the student council leaders of my State. There \nwere 900 to 1,000 of them in the room. I pointed out this fact about \nmore and more of our debt being held externally. I asked them: How many \nof you think this is a sign of strength and how many think it is a sign \nof weakness? Some people say this is a sign of strength that people \nwill loan us this amount of money. And I would say 98.9 percent of the \nstudents said they saw it as a sign of weakness, not a sign of \nstrength. Maybe one reason is they realize they are the ones who will \nhave to pay this bill.\n  Now we have this bill before us. Here is the total spending we are \ngoing to do over the next 5 years--$14.3 trillion. Our friends come \nhere with $40 billion of spending cuts. That is one three-\n\n[[Page S14019]]\n\nhundredth, less than one three-hundredth, in fact, one three-hundred-\nfiftieth of the spending that is going to occur over the next 5 years, \none three-hundred-fiftieth of the spending. Of course, it is going to \nbe completely topped by the tax cut that they are proposing, a tax cut \nof $70 billion that is going to occur. It is interesting. Why do we \nhave this package before us? Here is what the chairman of the Ways and \nMeans Committee said in the House. He told a group of lobbyists that \nthe spending cuts are necessary to make room for tax cuts. The spending \ncuts are $40 billion over 5 years. The tax cuts in the Senate are $70 \nbillion. In the House, the tax cuts are even bigger. In the House, the \ntax cuts over 5 years are $95 billion.\n  Some people have said to us: Senator, who knows what is going to \nhappen in 5 years? How about this next year? What is the comparison in \nthis package between the spending cuts and the tax cuts? Here you have \nit. In the Senate package, the spending cuts are $5 billion for the \nyear and a $2.5 trillion budget. That is one five-hundredth of the \nspending. And the tax cuts are $11 billion. So in the first year, they \nare $6 billion under water. They are adding to the deficit, adding to \nthe debt by $6 billion, not cutting it as they claim here in their \nspeeches. But when you put the whole package together, they are \nincreasing the deficit.\n  If you look at the House package and their proposed tax cuts, it's \nmuch worse. Five billion dollars of spending cuts, $21 billion in tax \ncuts in the first year. So they are adding to the deficit by $16 \nbillion in the first year alone, adding to the debt.\n  (Mr. Talent assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question on that chart?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is it not also important to ask the question, who is \nbeing affected by the spending cuts and who is benefitting from the tax \ncuts, because that gives you a sense of what the priorities are? It is \nmy perception that the spending cuts are affecting those who have \nlittle--working people, or people in difficult circumstances, such as \nyoung people trying to get a college education. The tax cuts for which \nthese spending cuts are being imposed--as the chairman of the House \nWays and Means Committee said, to make room for them--are going \nprimarily to benefit those at the upper end of the income and wealth \nscale. So aren't those the priorities that are being set here? People \nhave to make the connection. They say we are doing the spending cuts to \nreduce the deficit. Of course, then they admit they are trying to hold \nthe deficit down through spending cuts in order to make room for the \ntax cuts.\n  So you have to ask, who is being hit by the spending cuts? Who is \ngetting the benefit of the tax cuts? Those priorities, it seems to me, \nare standing completely on their heads. They are just the wrong set of \npriorities. We have to make that connection, don't we, to understand \nwhat is happening?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We do. I have in my hand a report from the Center on \nBudget Policy Priorities, a group the Senator knows well, a very well \nrespected group in this town. This is the headline: ``Budget Conference \nAgreement Contains Substantial Cuts Aimed at Low-Income Families and \nIndividuals.''\n  One of the points they make is that this budget agreement increases \nthe copayment and premiums for those who are on Medicaid. Those are the \nleast fortunate among us. They say:\n\n       A large body of research has found that such cost-sharing \n     increases are likely to lead many low-income Medicaid \n     patients to forego various health care services and \n     medications or not to enroll in Medicaid at all.\n\n  Second, it provides for benefit reductions. They go on to report that \nthe conference report retains about a third of the House-passed cuts \nthat, for many Medicaid beneficiaries, would eliminate the Federal \nstandards which assure that they receive comprehensive health care \ncoverage.\n  It goes on. Some of the cuts are for, stunningly enough, child \nsupport enforcement. So they are cutting funds for child support \nenforcement. The CBO estimates show the conference report includes a \nbillion and a half in cuts in Federal funding for child support \nenforcement efforts. That is funding that States use to track down \nabsent parents, for child support orders, and to collect and distribute \nchild support. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this \nloss in Federal child support funding will result in child support \ngoing uncollected over the next 5 years of $2.9 billion.\n  Some of those advocates for this say they are friendly to families. \nWhat is friendly about letting deadbeat dads escape their \nresponsibilities to their kids and their families? That is part of what \nis done here. If this package were really reducing the deficit, that \nwould be one thing. It doesn't reduce the deficit. This package, when \nyou include the tax cuts, dramatically increases the deficit. When you \nlook at this package, not only does it cut child support enforcement \nand Medicaid for those who are the lowest income among us, it also \nbadly underfunds child care because also buried in the package is \nreform of welfare.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it would cost $8.4 \nbillion for the States to meet the new work requirements. Only a \nbillion dollars is provided. So if we are going to have these people go \nto work, one of the things that happens is the cost of childcare goes \nup. The cost of childcare goes up by $8.4 billion, and they short-\nfunded it by $7.4 billion. We all know who gets the benefit of the tax \ncut. The tax cuts on the House side go overwhelmingly to the wealthiest \namong us. The average tax cut just on the capital gains and dividend \nprovisions in the House bill provides those earning over a million \ndollars a year a $35,000 tax cut.\n  I don't find this in any religious teaching that I have been exposed \nto. But the message is very clear. We take from the least among us to \ngive to those who have the most among us. That is what this bill does. \nOn top of that, when you put the whole reconciliation package together, \nit increases the deficit, increases the debt, and in chapter 3 expands \nthe debt of the United States in one fell swoop by $781 billion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In light of what we previously looked at as to how this \ndebt is being financed from outside the country, in effect what is \nhappening is that in order to give tax cuts to very wealthy people, we \nare borrowing from Japan, China, Korea, and the Caribbean money \ncenters, and so forth and so on. That is where we are finding the money \nto fund this debt that is being created and run up in order to give tax \ncuts to wealthy people, is it not?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I was speaking to people in my State, and one person in \nmy audience said: You know, the President says that it is the people's \nmoney and we ought to give it back to the people. Well, that is \nabsolutely true. This person in the audience said: But it is turning \nout that it is the Chinese people's money, the Japanese people's money. \nThat is whose money we are giving back. We are having to borrow from \nthem to give it back.\n  This is a bizarre situation that we are in, but that is what is \nhappening. Some say, well, if you borrow the money, somehow it will pay \noff. Let's make sure that Chairman Greenspan doesn't believe that. He \nsaid this before the Joint Economic Committee:\n\n       We should not be cutting taxes by borrowing.\n       We are borrowing in huge amounts.\n\n  This is his statement on restoring the pay-go provisions that we \ntried hard to get restored, which say you can have additional tax cuts, \nbut you ought to pay for them. You can have new spending, but you ought \nto pay for it.\n  He said this on March 2 before the House Budget Committee:\n\n       All I am saying is that my general view is I like to see \n     the tax burden as low as possible. And in that context, I \n     would like to see tax cuts continued. But as I indicated \n     earlier, that has got to be, in my judgment, in the context \n     of a pay-go resolution.\n\n  That is what we offered to our colleagues, but they didn't accept it. \nHere are the major provisions in this package. It cuts low-income \nbeneficiaries in Medicaid. It cuts child support. It cuts foster care. \nI mean, really, is this the priority of the country to cut child \nsupport enforcement, foster care, and medical help for those who have \nthe least among us?\n  It delays Social Security supplementary benefit income payments for \npoor, disabled individuals. Now there\n\n[[Page S14020]]\n\nare new work requirements imposing unfunded mandates on the States.\n  Mr. President, I think these are the wrong priorities for the \ncountry. The reconciliation bill unfairly targets Medicaid \nbeneficiaries. The Senate proposed no increase in cost sharing for \nthese very low income people. The House insisted on $2.4 billion from \nthose same very low income people. The conference report included 80 \npercent of what the House proposed.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The way the Medicaid Program is structured, as I \nunderstand it, is that in order to be a Medicaid beneficiary, in order \nto receive Medicaid to meet your health care needs, you have to be \nadjudged to be at an income level that is so low it is clear you can \nnot afford medical care. In order to get Medicaid to begin with, don't \nyou have to meet that requirement?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Absolutely. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And now they are proposing to take people who get \nMedicaid because their income is so low that they can't meet their \nhealth care needs in any other way, and they are imposing additional \nburdens on these Medicaid recipients.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to my colleagues, it is not just in Medicaid. They \nare cutting foster care. They are cutting child support enforcement. \nYou have to ask yourself: What can they be thinking?\n\n       The President's 2006 budget cites the child support program \n     as one of the highest rated block/formula grants of all \n     reviewed programs government-wide.\n       This is a program that epitomizes the value of parental \n     responsibility--increasing family self-sufficiency, \n     decreasing public assistance use, reducing out-of-wedlock \n     births and discouraging divorces.\n\n  That is what the Center for Law and Social Policy said on November 17 \nof this year. And we have a bill before us that cuts child support.\n  One has to wonder, What are they thinking? What are the priorities \nthat are contained here, priorities that cut the spending $40 billion \nby targeting those who are the least fortunate among us--$40 billion \nover 5 years. It is only $8 billion a year. The first year it is only \n$5 billion of savings in a $2.5 trillion budget. That is one five-\nhundredth of the budget, and then they cut the taxes, especially for \nthe wealthiest among us, much more. So, when you put the two together, \nthey have increased the deficit, not reduced it; they have increased \nthe debt, not reduced it at the very time the debt is exploding before \nthe baby boomers even retire, which will put even more pressure on our \nbudget.\n  This is a budget that makes no sense. It makes no sense. I have never \nseen this town more disconnected from reality than we are with this \nbudget.\n  This bill hurts companies, farmers, and workers, repeals the \nantidumping provision, eliminating assistance that benefits U.S. \ncompanies, farmers, and workers who have been targets of unfair and \npredatory trade practices.\n  I conclude as I began. This package does not make sense. When you put \ntogether all of the elements of reconciliation, it increases the \ndeficit, it increases the debt at the very time the debt has already \nbeen dramatically increased, at the very time we are borrowing more and \nmore money from abroad to float this boat, and this budget and this \nbudget plan pushes us down the road to more deficits and more debt, and \nthey have labeled it deficit reduction, but nothing could be more \nmisleading.\n  This is a package, when you put it all together, that increases \ndeficits and increases debt and at the worst possible time--before the \nbaby boomers retire--and puts even further pressure on these fiscal \nimbalances that are leading us to borrow more and more money from all \naround the world.\n  At some point, we have to stop and we have to get on a firmer fiscal \ncourse. We have to restore fiscal discipline to our country.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask the Senator from Maryland how much time he wishes to \nspeak?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Five minutes, at most.\n  Mr. President, I first thank and commend the very able Senator from \nNorth Dakota for a very powerful presentation and also for his work, \nday in and day out, as the ranking member on the Democratic side on the \nBudget Committee. I don't think there is anyone in the Senate who \nunderstands the fiscal situation better or has a more perceptive \nanalysis of what has happened than the very distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota. I thank him for his leadership on this issue.\n  I will be very brief. I simply want to say that this conference \nreport before us is worse than what the Senate passed, significantly \nworse. It will cut crucial assistance to working families, to students, \nand to the elderly, amongst others. I think these cuts will move the \nNation in the wrong direction. I particularly disagree with imposing \nthese cuts on low- and moderate-income Americans, supposedly to bring \nour budget deficit under control but actually to make room to give tax \ncuts to very wealthy people.\n  The budget resolution provides for reconciliation protection for both \nthe spending bill and a tax bill. So to see the impact of the \nreconciliation process, one has to take the two together. Although we \nonly have the spending bill now, the tax bill will follow along as \nsurely as the night follows the day.\n  The budget resolution requires almost $40 billion in spending cuts. \nThe same budget resolution tells the committees to report tax cuts of \n$70 billion. So we have a reconciliation process supposedly intended to \nreduce the deficit--in fact, they call it the Deficit Reduction Act; \nwhere is George Orwell when we need him?--which, when both the spending \nbill and the tax bill are considered, is going to increase the deficit, \nnot reduce the deficit.\n  So these spending cuts are being made not to address our budget \ndeficit, they are being made to make room for tax cuts--the quote from \nthe chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee was absolutely on \npoint. This legislation is a clear example of a fiscal policy that \nplaces a higher priority on tax cuts than on funding needed services \nand reducing the deficit. This is clearly a misplaced priority, \nregrettably one that has characterized this administration.\n  We have seen this incredible swing in our fiscal position over the \nlast 5 years. When President Bush came into office, we were projecting, \nover the next 10-year period, a surplus in the Federal budget of $5.6 \ntrillion. Today, after a series of excessive tax cuts, we are \nprojecting a deficit over 10 years of $4.5 trillion. This is a swing in \nour fiscal position of $10 trillion in the wrong direction, from a $5.6 \ntrillion projected surplus to a $4.5 trillion projected deficit.\n  We are risking our fiscal future. We are targeting tax cuts to those \nwho need them the least and we are cutting programs for those who need \nthem the most.\n  This is an incredibly wrong set of priorities. I am very much opposed \nto this conference report, and I very much urge my colleagues to reject \nthis conference report when it comes to a vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to respond briefly to a couple of \nthe comments that were made, and then I think what we will do--I have \ntalked with the Senator from North Dakota and he has been very \naccommodating--I think we will deem 2 hours off the bill equally \ndivided as of this evening, which means he gives up 15 minutes and I \ngive up 45 minutes. That is how negotiations are almost every time we \nget together.\n  A couple points were made. First, that the antidumping language was \ntaken out. Actually, the antidumping language is still in the bill.\n  So that item of concern by the Senator from North Dakota has been \naddressed, and I would think that that would cause him to vote for the \nbill.\n  The second item was the issue of child support enforcement. Now, the \nHouse bill did have some initiatives in there which the Senate spoke on \nrelative to a motion to instruct, and the final language came very \nclose to the Senate position on child enforcement. In fact, essentially \nwhat the bill says is that we are not going to reduce the effort on \nchild support again. What we are not going to allow States to do,\n\n[[Page S14021]]\n\nhowever, is game the system where they take Federal funds, use those \nFederal funds, claim them to be State funds and then ask for a Federal \nmatch to Federal funds when they should be using State funds. That \nsounds a little confusing but the way it works is this: The State has \nto match $100 to get $1,000 from the Federal Government. What they will \ndo is take $100 from the Federal Government--instead of coming up with \n$100 from the State, they will say they got their $100 from the Federal \nGovernment and they are going to claim it is a State $100 and then they \nare going to match and then they ask for another $1,000. Well, that is \ngaming the system and it is not appropriate. I think there is general \nagreement that that is bad policy.\n  In fact, what the bill does in the area of child support is increase \nchild support under the current TANF laws. There is welfare reform in \nthis bill, and it is pretty positive in the area of child support, in \nexpanding child support. So I think that, again, there is positive \nchild support language in here. Some of the language which was referred \nto is reflective of the way the original House bill was but is not \nreflective of the conference. The same is true for the foster care \narea. To the extent foster care is addressed, it is addressed in a very \nreasonable way, dealing with Federal-eligible children who are living \nwith unlicensed relatives in another ineligible setting or who have not \nyet entered foster care. So basically, again, there is an issue of \ngaming the system by the States, but it does not impact--and in fact, \nagain, this bill specifically addresses, in a positive way, the foster \ncare issue.\n  So those three items were raised. There were a lot more which were \nraised, but those three items need to be addressed. More importantly, \non a broader scale, this bill, rather than, in my opinion, impacting \nlow-income individuals in a negative way, actually has a pretty \npositive impact on a lot of low-income accounts. As was mentioned \nearlier, there is a very large expansion of the Pell grant program for \nlow-income students. There is a very large expansion of something \ncalled the SMART Program for low-income students who are going to \nparticipate in math and science. There is a significant expansion of \nMedicaid assistance. Over a million children will be picked up under \nthis bill. The Medicaid proposals which are in this bill will basically \nprotect the integrity of the system so that it can be expanded rather \nthan be gamed by people who spend down inappropriately and basically \npass their burdens on to the Federal taxpayer when they can actually \nafford some of the costs of their nursing home care, and it will give \nthe State Governors much more flexibility.\n  That is why I believe it was the Governor of Virginia, Governor \nWarner, who came out strongly for the flexibility language and the \nspend-down language because, and I believe I am representing this \ncorrectly, he saw this as a positive step to be able to deliver more \nchild care to more kids who are low income by having more flexibility \nand doing it with less of an increase in dollars.\n  Remember, we are not talking about cutting anything in Medicaid. \nMedicaid will spend $1.2 trillion during this 5-year window. It will \ngrow at 40 percent. We are talking about a $5 billion cut on a $1.2 \ntrillion base. Essentially, it does not even show up if one does a \nchart--because the lines are so close together--as being a significant \nreduction in the Medicaid accounts.\n  What is important about Medicaid is the policy that comes with that \nproposal, which policy specifically will give the Governors what they \nhave asked for in a bipartisan way. They came to the Congress and said: \nThis is what we would like to deliver this program more effectively to \nmore people. This bill carries that type of language with it and that \nis the way we should approach this. So it is a good bill relative to \nlow-income individuals, especially those on Medicaid and those wanting \nto go to college.\n  There are initiatives in here which will benefit those people and be \npositive. But it is also a good bill for all Americans. The idea that \nwe are going to actually, if we pass this bill, reduce the debt by $40 \nbillion is a pretty good idea. Most Americans would like to see the \nFederal debt go down, and they would like to see us do something to \ndiscipline Federal spending in some way, and this is not a dramatic \nway.\n  The Senator from North Dakota held up a chart to point out that it \nwas not dramatic. He made our case for us. One cannot say all of these \nthings are egregious and then hold up a chart that says there is $14 \ntrillion of spending that is going to occur in the next 5 years and \nonly $40 billion of cuts and look how small that cut is--it is not a \ncut but a reduction in rate of growth--compared to all the spending \nthat is going on, so it is not relevant, and then turn around and say \nbut the $40 billion is inappropriate because it does too much.\n\n  Well, it does not do too much. It is a step forward. It has some \npolicy which will hopefully drive the outyears in a very positive way, \ngive the Governors more flexibility in the Medicare area, do a number \nof things in a number of other accounts which will be positive. As a \nresult, most importantly, we will have for the first time put not our \ntoes but at least up to our ankles in the waters of trying to put some \nfiscal responsibility into the area of mandatory and entitlement \nspending, which is the single largest driver of our deficits and our \noutyear problems relative to being able to pay the cost of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  So I certainly hope we will pass this bill because it is the \nresponsible thing to do in my view.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we deem 2 hours have been used on the \nbill and that those 2 hours would be equally divided between the \nparties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like 1 minute to respond to two \npoints that were made and then I would be happy to agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will reserve until the Senator has used his 1 minute, \nwhich I hope the Chair will discipline very precisely.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on the question of foster care, the bill \nincludes $343 million in net cuts in foster care funding, including two \ncuts that will make it harder for some States to provide federally \nfunded foster care benefits to certain grandparents who are raising \ntheir grandchildren. That is not the right priority for the country.\n  On the question of child support enforcement, the Congressional \nBudget Office estimates show the conference report includes $1.5 \nbillion cut in Federal funding for child support enforcement efforts \nover the next 5 years. This is funding that States use to track down \nabsent parents, establish legally enforceable child support orders and \ncollect and distribute child support owed to families.\n  CBO has estimated that this loss in Federal child support funding \nwill result in $2.9 billion in child support going uncollected over the \nnext 5 years. These cuts are smaller than in the House bill. It will \nnevertheless take billions of dollars out of the pockets of mothers and \nchildren who are owed child support.\n  This report goes on to say the conference agreement also contains \nsome modest improvements in child support but the cuts in Federal \nsupport for the program and the associated loss of child support \ncollections far outweigh the very modest benefits that some families \nwould see as a result of a few improvements.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this report from the Center on Budget \nand Policy priorities be printed in the Record after my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I reserve the right to object for another 30 seconds. On \nthe Byrd antidumping proposal, the Senator is correct that the repeal \nis not immediate but the repeal is still in the bill. It is postponed \nby 2 years. So I say on these issues we have a difference of position. \nI think this goes in the wrong direction. I think it expresses the \nwrong priorities for the country. Most seriously to me the whole \nreconciliation package increases the deficit and increases the debt. We \nought to be doing precisely the opposite.\n\n[[Page S14022]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n    [From the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Dec. 18, 2005]\n\n  Budget Conference Agreement Contains Substantial Cuts Aimed at Low-\n                    Income Families and Individuals\n\n         (By Edwin Park, Sharon Parrott, and Robert Greenstein)\n\n       Some are claiming that the conference agreement on the \n     budget reconciliation bill is closer to the Senate-passed \n     bill in the low-income area than to the House bill and does \n     not harm low-income Americans to any significant degree. \n     While some low-income cuts in the House bill have been \n     dropped, the conference agreement contains numerous cuts in \n     various low-income areas--including Medicaid--that are much \n     closer to those in the House-passed bill than to the \n     provisions of the Senate bill.\n       Taken as a whole, the provisions in the conference \n     agreement would cause considerable hardship among low-income \n     families and people who are elderly or have disabilities. \n     This is due in no small part to action by the conferees to \n     shield certain powerful special interests--principally \n     pharmaceutical companies and the managed care industry--and \n     to extract deeper savings from low-income families instead.\n\n\n                                MEDICAID\n\n       The CBO estimates show that conference agreement retains \n     the majority of the Medicaid cuts contained in the House-\n     passed bill that directly affect low-income beneficiaries.\n       According to the preliminary estimates issued by the \n     Congressional Budget Office (no legislative language is yet \n     available), the reconciliation conference report achieves \n     much of its Medicaid savings by retaining a number of \n     provisions in the House-passed reconciliation bill that would \n     require low-income Medicaid beneficiaries to pay more out-of-\n     pocket for health care or reduce the health care services for \n     which many beneficiaries are covered. The conference report \n     forgoes the Senate reconciliation bill's more balanced \n     approach; the Senate had avoided changes that would harm low-\n     income beneficiaries by achieving larger savings in the area \n     of Medicaid prescription drug pricing and by reducing \n     excessive payments made to Medicare managed care plans. Key \n     aspects of the Medicaid component of the conference report \n     include the following:\n       Increases in co-payments and premiums. The conference \n     report leaves largely intact the House-passed cuts that would \n     allow states to increase substantially the co-payments that \n     many Medicaid beneficiaries are required to pay to access \n     health care services and medications, as well as the premiums \n     they can be charged to enroll in Medicaid in the first place. \n     The cuts in the cost-sharing area in the conference report \n     (i.e., the cuts resulting from increases in co-payments and \n     premiums) are 80 percent of the size of the House-passed cuts \n     in this area over five years, and 90 percent the size of the \n     House cuts over ten years. A large body of research has \n     found--and CBO has concluded--that such cost-sharing \n     increases are likely to lead many low-income Medicaid \n     patients to forgo various health care services and \n     medications or not to enroll in Medicaid at all.\n       Altogether, the conference report includes cuts related to \n     co-payments and premiums that total $1.9 billion over five \n     years and $10.1 billion over ten years (as compared to $2.4 \n     billion over five years and $11.2 billion over ten years in \n     the House-passed reconciliation bill). The Senate bill \n     included no increases in co-payments and premiums.\n       Benefit reductions. The conference report retains about \n     one-third of the House-passed cuts that, for many Medicaid \n     beneficiaries, would eliminate the federal standards which \n     assure that they receive comprehensive health care coverage. \n     Under the House bill, many beneficiaries could lose access to \n     various medically necessary services, possibly including \n     therapy services, personal care, eyeglasses, hearing aids, \n     and crutches. The conference agreement includes benefit cuts \n     of $1.3 billion over five years and $6.3 billion over ten \n     years from a scaling back of the health care benefits that \n     Medicaid covers. (The House bill contained $4 billion in \n     benefit cuts over five years and $18.5 billion over ten \n     years. The Senate included no reductions in benefit coverage \n     in its bill.)\n       Overly restrictive asset transfer rules for people who need \n     nursing home care. The conference report appears both to \n     adopt all of the provisions in the House-passed bill to \n     restrict eligibility for Medicaid long-term care services and \n     to contain additional provisions not included in the House \n     bill that would yield further savings in this area. Under the \n     conference agreement, the savings in this area would be 11 \n     percent larger than under the House bill, and seven times \n     larger than under the Senate bill.\n       Preventing more-affluent individuals from sheltering assets \n     that could be used to pay for their long-term care is a \n     laudable goal. The provisions in the conference agreement, \n     however, appear to go well beyond that. For example, one \n     provision of the House bill that appears to have been \n     retained in the conference report would penalize many non-\n     affluent individuals who make modest gifts to relatives or \n     contributions to charity, and then experience an unexpected \n     decline in their health several years later that causes them \n     to need long-term care. The conference agreement includes \n     Medicaid reductions in this area of $2.4 billion over five \n     years and $6.4 billion over ten years (higher than the $2.2 \n     billion over five years and $5.8 billion over ten years in \n     the House-passed bill). The Senate's more targeted and \n     carefully designed provisions in this area would have \n     produced savings of $335 million over five years and $890 \n     million over ten years.\n       The conference report's health care provisions also move \n     toward the House bill in another respect: they cater to \n     powerful special interests--in particular, the pharmaceutical \n     and managed care industries--at the expense of low-income \n     beneficiaries.\n       No increase in drug manufacturer rebates. The Senate bill \n     avoided harmful co-payment and premium increases and benefit \n     reductions in part because it achieved much of its Medicaid \n     savings by restraining the amounts that Medicaid pays for \n     prescription drugs. To ensure that Medicaid gets the best \n     prescription drug prices, the Senate bill increased the \n     minimum rebates that drug manufacturers are required to pay \n     the Medicaid program for drugs dispensed to Medicaid \n     beneficiaries. The Senate bill also applied the rebates to \n     drugs provided to Medicaid beneficiaries through managed care \n     plans. The Senate drug rebate provisions produced Medicaid \n     savings of $3.9 billion over five years and $10.5 billion \n     over ten years, which helped the Senate reach its savings \n     target without harming low-income beneficiaries.\n       In a victory for the powerful pharmaceutical industry, the \n     conference agreement fails to include the Senate's \n     significant rebate provisions. The conference agreement \n     includes only two minor provisions related to drug rebates \n     already included in both the House-passed and Senate-passed \n     bills; these provisions generate savings of only $220 million \n     over five years and $720 million over ten years.\n       No elimination of the Medicare stabilization fund. The \n     conference report also protects Medicare managed care plans. \n     It drops a Senate provision that would have eliminated a \n     wasteful $10 billion slush fund to encourage participation in \n     Medicare by regional Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs). \n     The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC)--\n     the official, independent advisory body to Congress on \n     Medicare payment policy--recommended this summer, in a \n     nearly unanimous vote, that this fund be eliminated \n     because it is unnecessary and unwarranted and provides an \n     unfair competitive advantage to PPOs over traditional \n     Medicare fee-for-service and other managed care plans such \n     as Medicare HMOs. Nevertheless, the conference agreement \n     leaves this fund fully intact, forgoing $5.4 billion in \n     savings over five years (and twice that over ten years) \n     that were contained in the Senate bill. The removal of \n     this Senate provision likely was done at the behest of the \n     managed care industry and the Administration, which \n     threatened to veto the budget bill if the Senate provision \n     was included in the final conference agreement.\n       Partially gutting another provision to curb overpayments to \n     managed care plans. There is near-universal agreement among \n     analysts that the current Medicare payment structure provides \n     excessive payments to managed care plans, and the \n     Administration announced earlier this year that it would act \n     administratively to eliminate a feature of the payment \n     formula that is responsible for a significant volume of \n     excessive payments. MedPAC endorsed the Administration's \n     action, and the Senate reconciliation bill wrote the \n     Administration's planned administrative action into law, for \n     a savings of $6.5 billion over five years and $26 billion \n     over ten years, according to CBO. Under the conference \n     agreement, however, the ten-year savings have been lowered \n     from $26 billion to $4.1 billion, according to the CBO \n     estimates. While the conference report language is not yet \n     available, it appears that the conference agreement is \n     written so the part of the Medicare payment formula that \n     would be reformed would revert to its current, problematic \n     status after five years, and after that time, managed care \n     plans would again receive the overpayments this provision is \n     supposed to curb.\n       In short, in place of the Senate's reasonable savings from \n     eliminating the wasteful Medicare stabilization fund and \n     lowering the prices that Medicaid pays pharmaceutical \n     companies for prescription drugs, the conference agreement \n     includes a hefty share of the House Medicaid provisions on \n     cost-sharing and benefits, which the research indicates are \n     likely to reduce the affordability and accessibility of \n     health care for large numbers of low-income patients.\n\n\n              LOW-INCOME PROGRAMS OUTSIDE THE HEALTH AREA\n\n       The Senate reconciliation bill did not include cuts in any \n     low-income program other than Medicaid, and did not seek to \n     rewrite the welfare rules in a reconciliation bill. The \n     conference agreement, by contrast, includes sizeable cuts in \n     child support enforcement, SSI, and foster care, as well as \n     highly controversial TANF provisions that would impose \n     expensive, unfunded work requirements on states and result in \n     the loss of child care for many low-income working families \n     not receiving TANF cash assistance.\n       1. Child Support Enforcement: The CBO estimates show that \n     the conference report includes a $1.5 billion cut in federal \n     funding for child support enforcement efforts over the next \n     five years and a $4.9 billion cut over the next ten years. \n     This is funding that states use to track down absent parents, \n     establish legally enforceable child support orders, and \n     collect and distribute child support owed to families, CBO \n     has estimated that this loss in federal child support funding \n     will result in\n\n[[Page S14023]]\n\n     $2.9 billion in child support going uncollected over the next \n     five years, and $8.4 billion going uncollected over the next \n     ten years. These cuts are smaller than those in the House \n     bill, but will nevertheless take billions of dollars out of \n     the pockets of mothers and children who are owed child \n     support. (The conference agreement also contains some modest \n     improvements in the child support program. The cuts in \n     federal support for the program and the associated loss of \n     child support collections, however, far outweigh the very \n     modest benefits that some families would see as a result of a \n     few improvements in other child support provisions.)\n       2. TANF: Despite representing the largest change in welfare \n     policy since 1996, the nature of the TANF provisions in the \n     conference report has been a closely guarded secret. CBO \n     analyses show, however, that the conference agreement would \n     impose very expensive new work requirements on states. \n     Moreover, in a major change in policy that goes well beyond \n     anything in any prior TANF bill, including the House budget \n     reconciliation bill, the conference agreement would remove \n     from states the flexibility they now have to apply \n     different types of work-related requirements to people \n     receiving assistance funded entirely with state \n     ``maintenance of effort'' funds. (These are state funds \n     that a state must expend to draw down federal TANF funds.)\n       CBO estimates that if states attempt to meet the work \n     requirements in the conference agreement by placing more \n     parents in welfare-to-work programs (rather than by reducing \n     the number of poor families receiving assistance at all), the \n     cost to states would be $8.4 billion over the next five \n     years, which is slightly more than the cost would have been \n     under the House reconciliation bill. CBO projects that some \n     states would not meet the new mandates and would face fiscal \n     penalties as a consequence.\n       It is widely known that there was a concerted effort in the \n     conference to redesign the House bill's work requirements so \n     that the Congressional Budget Office would conclude that some \n     states would not be able to meet the requirements and thus \n     would be subject to fiscal penalties. This was purposefully \n     done to get around the ``Byrd rule,'' a procedural rule that \n     generally prohibits the inclusion in a reconciliation bill of \n     changes in policy that do not significantly reduce or \n     increase federal costs or revenues. The goal here appears to \n     have been to secure an estimate from CBO that the changes in \n     the work requirements would, in fact, save money for the \n     federal Treasury and to do so by making the new requirements \n     sufficiently unrealistic that some states would not be able \n     to meet them. (It remains unclear whether the TANF work \n     provisions in the conference agreement succeed in meeting the \n     Byrd rule test.)\n       3. Child Care: The conference report includes $1 billion in \n     additional funding for child care, which is $7.4 billion less \n     than CBO estimates to be the cost to states of meeting the \n     new work requirements, and more than $11 billion less than \n     what states will need both to meet the new work requirements \n     and to ensure that their current child care programs for low-\n     income working families not on TANF do not have to be scaled \n     back as a result of the impact of inflation on child care \n     costs. This means the conference agreement includes no new \n     funding for states to help meet the intensified work \n     requirements that will be imposed upon them or to provide \n     child care for children whose parents will newly be placed in \n     work programs.\n       To come up with the funds to meet the new work requirements \n     and provide child care for the children of mothers placed in \n     these excluded work programs, many states will have little \n     alternative but to scale back child care slots for working \n     poor families not on welfare and shift those slots to TANF \n     families instead. As a result of the under-funding of child \n     care in the conference agreement, we estimate that by 2010, \n     some 255,000 fewer children in low-income working families \n     not on TANF will receive child care assistance than received \n     such assistance in 2004.\n       The $1 billion in child care funding in the conference \n     agreement is higher than the $500 million in the House-passed \n     bill. It is $5 billion lower, however, than the amount \n     included for child care in the bipartisan TANF legislation \n     approved by the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year.\n       4. SSI: Under the conference agreement, poor individuals \n     with disabilities who have waited months for the Social \n     Security Administration to review and approve their \n     applications for SSI (a common occurrence in SSI), and \n     consequently are owed more than three months of back \n     benefits, would have to receive these benefits in \n     installments that could stretch out over the course of a \n     year. The first installment would include no more than three \n     months of back benefits. By contrast, under current law, most \n     such disabled individuals receive their back benefits in a \n     single lump sum payment. Individuals owed more than 12 \n     months' worth of benefits receive benefits in installments, \n     but the first installment is equal to 12 months of benefits.\n       This provision of the conference agreement means many poor \n     SSI recipients with disabilities would have to wait longer \n     for benefits they are owed, making it more difficult for them \n     to pay off arrears in bills that have built up during the \n     period when they were unable to work due to their disability \n     and were not receiving monthly SSI benefits because SSA was \n     still processing their application. Under the conference \n     agreement, some poor individuals with disabilities could die \n     before receiving the full back benefits they are owed. (With \n     two minor exceptions, if a person dies before being paid SSI \n     benefits they are owed, the SSI benefits are not paid to the \n     person's relatives or estate. These back benefits are not \n     even available to help family members pay for funeral \n     costs.)\n       This SSI provision is largely a budget gimmick; it would \n     make most of the affected beneficiaries wait longer for the \n     benefits they are owed, thereby shifting costs from one year \n     to the next and providing savings in the five-year budget \n     ''window.'' (Some ``true'' savings apparently would be \n     achieved, as well, as a result of some individuals dying \n     before receiving the back benefits they are owed.) CBO \n     estimates the savings from this provision at $425 million \n     over five years. This is an example of a budget gimmick with \n     a real human cost, since many impoverished individuals with \n     disabilities will face a more difficult time making ends meet \n     as a result of the delays they will be forced to experience \n     in receiving SSI payments that they are owed.\n       5. Foster Care: The bill includes $343 million in net cuts \n     in foster care funding, including two cuts that will make it \n     harder for some states to provide federally funded foster \n     care benefits to certain grandparents who are raising their \n     grandchildren.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has the floor. \nHe repeats his unanimous consent request. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I express my concerns about the fiscal \nyear 2006 Budget Reconciliation Conference Report currently pending in \nthe Senate. I intend to vote against the conference report because I \nbelieve it sets the wrong budget priorities for our nation.\n  This omnibus spending reduction bill mandates a five-year spending \ncut of $39.7 billion. The vast majority of the cuts enacted as a \nconsequence of this conference report will impact poor and middle-class \nAmericans.\n  While the budget reconciliation pulls out all the stops to protect \nthe interests of insurance companies and drug manufacturers, the \npackage makes several changes to the Medicaid program that will have a \ndevastating impact on the health of the most vulnerable individuals in \nSouth Dakota. Low-income Medicaid recipients will see cuts in health \ncoverage while at the same time facing increased cost-sharing through \nthe program. Increased copayments and premiums for our poorest citizens \nwill likely mean that many individuals will forgo necessary care until \nemergency services are needed, costing our health system a great deal \nmore in the long run.\n  The bill also establishes very strict asset rules for seniors \napplying for Medicaid coverage for their nursing home care. While some \nadjustments to the asset tests are needed, this package goes too far \nand will negatively impact many average to low income earners in their \nfinal years. Finally, the payment methodology changes proposed for \npharmacies are shortsighted and will reduce access to Medicaid coverage \nin the future. The conference package reduces reimbursements paid to \npharmacies for generic drugs by approximately 40 percent by 2007. Under \nthose circumstances, community pharmacies will have a hard time making \nends meet and will lose the incentive to provide this service entirely.\n  I have recently received a letter signed by 142 national \norganizations expressing their concerns about the Medicaid provisions \nin this conference report. They understand the devastating impact these \nhealth care cuts will have on the poor and elderly.\n  The conference report also slashes funding for vital farm programs. \nIn fact, commodity programs face the brunt of the agriculture cuts in \nthe bill, and will be reduced by $1.7 billion over the next 5 years. In \naddition, the conference report cuts $934 million from conservation \nprograms, $620 million from research, and $400 million from rural \ndevelopment programs.\n  The farm bill that was signed into law by President Bush represented \na contract with rural America. Farmers have based their own financial \ndecisions on the provisions and funding\n\n[[Page S14024]]\n\nthat were promised in that bill. To now make changes to the farm bill \nby enacting steep cuts to commodity and conservation programs \nundermines our family farmers and ranchers and demonstrates the \nadministration's lack of commitment to rural economic development.\n  This conference report also contains $12.7 billion in cuts to the \nfederal student loan program. Unfortunately, this marks the largest cut \nto student financial aid programs in history. While the legislation \ndoes contain funding for the creation of the new Academic \nCompetitiveness Grants and the National Science and Mathematics Access \nto Retain Talent Grants, National SMART Grants, the Senate-passed \nbudget reconciliation legislation contained more than $8 billion in new \nneed-based assistance to supplement Pell Grants.\n  The Academic Competitiveness Grants Program would limit aid to a \nsmall subset of financially eligible students that completed a rigorous \nsecondary school program to be defined by the Secretary of Education. I \nsupport students taking a rigorous high school curriculum, but this \nwould be the first time the Federal Government links need-based \nfinancial aid to the academic curriculum available to a student.\n  The National SMART Grants Program would limit aid to only those \nstudents choosing to major in math, science, technology, engineering, \ncomputer science, or high-need foreign language. While we all want more \nstudents to study math and sciences, we also need to find additional \nneed-based aid for students that choose other important academic \nfields.\n  Finally, this will be the fourth year in a row that Congress has \nfailed to increase the maximum Pell Grant award from $4,050.\n  The Republican leadership has argued that these cuts are a necessary \nstep toward restoring fiscal discipline. However, when these cuts are \npaired with the tax reconciliation bill, they will actually cause an \nincrease in the national debt. Leaders in Congress have made it clear \nthat after the completion of the omnibus spending bill, Congress will \nconsider the extension of investment tax breaks geared \ndisproportionately toward the super rich with incomes in excess of \n$200,000 annually. Correspondingly, the estimated cost from these tax \ncuts to the Treasury and the American public far outweigh the savings \nforecast from the omnibus spending bill. A key intent of the \nreconciliation process is to reign in the governmental spending or to \nmove through the Congress changes to mandatory domestic programs.\n  The majority intends to pervert this process by using the omnibus \nspending bill as a device to free up room in the budget for costly tax \ncuts primarily geared toward the wealthiest two percent of taxpayers. \nThe end result is that future generations will be saddled with higher \nborrowing costs and lower economic growth in order to pay off the \nnational debt charges run up by the fiscally irresponsible tax cuts \npushed by this Congress. This vote is not for fiscal discipline and \nreduced deficits. Instead, those pushing through today's spending cut \nbill are doing so to make room for further tax cuts and billions more \nto the national debt.\n  Mr. President, I recognize we must get our fiscal house in order. \nHowever, I do not believe that budget cuts should come at the expense \nof ordinary people and struggling family farmers when huge \nagribusinesses continue to reap millions without effective payment caps \nin place, and tax cuts for multimillionaires are being preserved. The \npriorities set forth in this conference report are wrong; I will vote \nagainst the conference report and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14024-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          COLONEL NORM VAUGHAN\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I rise in tribute to COL Norm Vaughan who \naccompanied ADM Richard Byrd to Antarctica. He celebrates his 100th \nbirthday today. The Anchorage Daily News has printed an article by \nCarol Phillips talking about Vaughan as a great man and good friend. I \nask unanimous consent to print the article in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Anchorage Daily News, Dec. 19, 2005]\n\n                  Vaughan is a Great Man, Good Friend\n\n                         (By Carol A. Phillips)\n\n       On a February day in 1964, I hurried down to the main \n     street of my little town where the annual sled dog race was \n     about to start. Excited about this sporing event that had \n     always intrigued me, I lingered near the starting line as the \n     racers made last-minute preparations and the dogs leaped and \n     yelped their impatience to hit the trail.\n       Suddenly I head a voice in an accent that was music to my \n     ears--a Bostonian here in Interior Alaska. Having emigrated \n     recently from Maine, I was compelled to trace the source of \n     that unmistakable accent. That was the day I met Col. Norman \n     Vaughan, then a young 58, who was working as a handler for a \n     New Hampshire racer. That meeting was the beginning of a \n     beautiful friendship.\n       The achievements of Vaughan's extraordinary career are \n     familiar to his legion of friends. He returned in the mid-\n     1970s to make his home here and became such a legend in his \n     own time that it's hard to realize he has not always been an \n     Alaskan.\n       His adventures and accomplishments are diverse. He played \n     an essential role as dog handler on the 1927 Byrd Antarctic \n     expedition; served with distinction in the military; \n     airlifted supplies to Dr. Wilfred Grenfell's Labrador \n     mission; coordinated the rescue of 25 airmen stranded on the \n     Greenland icecap; retrieved the top-secret Norden bombsight \n     so critical-to the United States during World War II; ran in \n     several Iditarod races; spearheaded the effort to resurrect \n     World War II P-38s interred in Greenland's ice; drove a team \n     of huskies in President Reagan's inaugural parade in \n     Washington, D.C.; gave Pope John Paul II a lesson in dog \n     mushing during the pontiff's 1981 visit to Anchorage; \n     initiated the annual re-enactment of the 1925 Nenana-to-Nome \n     serum run; wrote a couple of books; and ascended 10,302-foot \n     Mount Vaughan, named for him by Adm. Richard Byrd.\n       Even more memorable to me are some personal experiences \n     involving Vaughan. When my family was vacationing on a Maine \n     island in 1966, Norman drove up from his Massachusetts home \n     to visit us, enthralling my children with a fascinating \n     repertoire of stories and a supply of his famous homemade \n     root beer. When he first lived in Anchorage he walked from \n     his tiny downtown apartment to and from his night-shift \n     janitorial job at the university, with never a complaint.\n       Through his friendship with the Dr. Schultz band, I came to \n     know those talented musicians who brightened the Anchorage \n     scene in the late 1970s. When Joe Redington Sr. sold one-\n     square-foot parcels of his Knik land to raise money for the \n     creation of the now world-famous Iditarod race, Norman \n     presented each of my four children with a landowner's deed, \n     prompting my youngest to observe that if they pooled the \n     deeds, ``we could build a very small but very tall house.''\n       Recently, one of my young grandsons, having seen Norman in \n     a TV ad, was awestruck to learn that I knew Norman \n     personally. He was further awed when I took him to visit the \n     Vaughan home, where Norman talked with him not about his own \n     accomplishments but about the child's interests, experiences \n     and ambitions, encouraging him to pursue his special dreams.\n       Today, Col. Vaughan attains another remarkable goal--his \n     100th birthday. During that century he has enjoyed more \n     spectacular adventures and significant achievements than the \n     average person can imagine or aspire to. He had hoped to \n     spend his 100th birthday atop his eponymous mountain in \n     Antarctica, a lofty goal which could not be realized. It is \n     said that when he was advised that the trip was not going to \n     happen, his typically positive response was, ``Oh well, just \n     not this year.''\n       It is a privilege to call this great, good man my friend. \n     Happy birthday, Norman!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14024-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14024-S14025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CLIMATE CHANGE NEGOTIATIONS AND IMPACTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with a sense of continued disappointment and \ndismay I read accounts of the administration's performance at the \nrecent international climate change meetings in Montreal, Canada.\n   The President has been crystal clear in his complete rejection of \nthe Kyoto Protocol treaty that all other major industrialized nations \nhave signed, except the United States and Australia. Yet he has \nregularly failed to put forward a constructive alternative that will \never result in stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the \natmosphere. Worse, his negotiators have disrupted other nations' \nefforts to begin binding discussions for the post-Kyoto Protocol \nperiod.\n  This is not and cannot be a partisan issue. But the President's \nstubborn insistence on ignoring credible science and his \nadministration's efforts to water down clear scientific evidence of \nmanmade global warming has hobbled many Republicans' ability to act \nsensibly on this matter.\n  We have a moral obligation to take on our enormous share of \nresponsibility for this global problem before it\n\n[[Page S14025]]\n\nis too late. Ignoring the problem is madness and a luxury we do not \nhave the time for. The scientific data continues to flow in and none of \nit is good.\n  I urge my colleagues not to fall for the temptation of the \nadministration's voluntary ``technology-only'' strategy. That will fail \nto produce any significant reductions in the timeframe necessary. There \nis abundant cause for concern and for faster action.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record some of the most \nrecent scientific information on the potential impacts of global \nwarming on Nevada and the West, as well as the rest of the country and \nthe world.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Potential Climate Changes Impact on Nevada:\n       The Scripps Institution of Oceanography found, and their \n     findings were subsequently published in Nature that, ``The \n     warming trend already is showing effects in California's \n     Sierra Nevada snow pack, the region's main water source. \n     Climate models suggest average temperatures in the West will \n     be about 1 to 3 degrees warmer by 2050 than at present. Even \n     though total precipitation isn't expected to change by much, \n     because of the higher temperatures more of it will come as \n     rain rather than snow. At the same time, the spring runoff \n     will come about one month earlier in the year.'' (San \n     Francisco Chronicle, November 17, 2005--Global warming study \n     forecasts more water shortages: Climate change already \n     affecting Sierra snowpack.)\n       The National Weather Service ominously reported that ``in a \n     year of record highs across northern Nevada, conditions are \n     on pace for this October (2005) to be the hottest on record, \n     said Gary Barbato of the National Weather Service. During \n     2003, average temperatures for the months of January, June \n     and July were all the hottest since records began in 1888, \n     with September 2003 and September 2001 tied for the warmest \n     average.'' (Reno Gazette Journal, October 21, 2003--Climate \n     experts study global warming's impact on water supplies.)\n       Nevada has been blessed with a rich natural heritage. \n     ``Nevada is home to an incredible diversity of native \n     wildlife species, including 299 birds, 123 mammals, 48 fish, \n     52 reptiles and 13 amphibians. Rising temperatures in the \n     state though will likely change the makeup of entire \n     ecosystems, forcing wildlife to shift their ranges or adapt. \n     Loss of wildlife and habitat could mean a loss of tourism \n     dollars. In 2001 alone, more than 657,000 people spent more \n     than $680 million on hunting, fishing and wildlife viewing in \n     Nevada, which in turn created more than 9,400 jobs in the \n     state.'' (ESPN Outdoors, March 15, 2005--Hunters give big \n     bucks to local economies: Pursuers of game big and small can \n     tip the financial scale from red to black in small \n     communities, and it underscores the fact that the sport is \n     expensive.)\n       One animal that is already being impacted by climate change \n     in Nevada is the pika. According to researchers, between the \n     1940s and the 1990s, six of 25 pika populations throughout \n     the Western states disappeared, largely because of rising \n     temperatures. When the same sites were visited again between \n     2003 and 2005, a research biologist found that two more pika \n     populations had winked out of existence in that ten year \n     period.

Initial results show that elevated \n     CO2 has the potential to increase the productivity \n     of invasive grasses (e.g., cheat grass) and thereby \n     accelerate the fire cycle and reduce biodiversity in the \n     Great Basin.\n       Potential Climate Change Impacts on the West:\n       The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory released a \n     scientific report last February which showed ``from 1950 to \n     1997, in Oregon, western Washington and northern California, \n     snow pack shrank by 50 to 75 percent. Decreases in the \n     northern Rockies during that period ranged between 15 and 30 \n     percent. The reduction in Western mountain snow cover, from \n     the Sierra Nevada range that feeds California in the south to \n     the snowcapped volcanic peaks of the Cascades in the Pacific \n     Northwest, will lead to increased fall and winter flooding, \n     severe spring and summer drought that will play havoc with \n     the West's agriculture, fisheries and hydropower industry.'' \n     (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, February 16, 2004--\n     Global warming to squeeze Western mountains dry by 2050.)\n       At a 2004 gathering by the American Association for the \n     Advancement of Science in Seattle, the University of \n     Washington's Climate Impacts Group detailed that ``Northwest \n     temperatures will increase by about 3 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit \n     by the 2040s, and the Cascades snowpack will decline by 59 \n     percent by 2050.'' (AP, February 17, 2004--Warmer weather \n     spells trouble for Northwest.)\n       The United States Environmental Protection Agency's website \n     has documented how global warming and climate change are \n     diminishing the beauty of Glacier National Park. ``Today, the \n     park's largest glaciers are only about a third of the size \n     they were in 1850, and many small mountain glaciers have \n     disappeared completely during the past 150 years. The area of \n     the park covered by glaciers declined by 73 percent from \n     1850-1993.'' (United States Environmental Protection Agency, \n     August 13, 2001--Global Warming Impacts: Western Mountains.)\n       In 2004, a study was published in the magazine titled \n     Conservation Biology about the severe impacts that climate \n     change could have on the wildfire season in Montana. ``Of all \n     the Western states, Montana's wildfire season could be most \n     affected by the warmer temperatures associated with global \n     climate change'', according to a new report. Published in \n     Conservation Biology magazine, the research suggests the \n     acreage burned each summer in Montana could increase five-\n     fold by the end of the century. Overall, the area burned by \n     wildfires in 11 Western states could double by 2100 if the \n     summertime climate warms by 1.6 degrees, the scientists said. \n     (The Missoulian, September 1, 2004--Report details global \n     warming's role in wildfire risk.)\n       Potential Climate Change Impacts on the Nation and the \n     World:\n       The Division of Geological and Planetary Science at the \n     California Institute of Technology, the Department of \n     Geological Sciences at the University of Michigan, and the \n     Department of Geology at the Occidental College recently \n     collaborated to publish an article about Glacial Erosion. The \n     article, which was published in the December issue of \n     Science, found that ``levels of carbon dioxide \n     (CO2), the principal gas that drives global \n     warming, are now 27 pct higher than at any point in the last \n     650,000 years, according to research into Antarctic ice \n     cores.''

(Associated Press, November 29, 2005--Global warming \n     set to hit Europe badly: environment agency.)\n       At a recent meeting (2005) of the American Geophysical \n     Union, scientists described how ``climate warming is most \n     likely to blame for the alarmingly fast retreat of two of \n     Greenland's largest glaciers. One of the Greenland glaciers, \n     Kangerdlugssuaq, is currently moving at about nine miles a \n     year compared to three miles a year in 2001, said Gordon \n     Hamilton of the University of Maine's Climate Change \n     Institute. The other glacier, Helheim, is speeding at about \n     seven miles a year--up from four miles a year during the same \n     period.'' In addition, ``Alaska's Columbia Glacier--about the \n     size of Los Angeles--has shrunk nine miles since the 1980s. \n     It is expected to lose an additional nine miles in the next \n     15 to 20 years. (The San Jose Mercury News, December 8, \n     2005--Scientists: Greenland glaciers pick up speed because of \n     warming.)\n       The academic journal Nature has published a scientific \n     study indicating that the ``system of circulating water \n     currents that moderates northern Europe's weather is 30 \n     percent slower than it was nearly 50 years ago. The slowdown \n     is due in part to the water's declining salinity caused by \n     the addition of less dense freshwater from melting Arctic sea \n     ice and glaciers.'' Harry Bryden, an oceanography professor \n     at Britain's University of Southampton and the paper's lead \n     author said that ``the slowing is in line with computer \n     models that suggest that Earth's warming climate could weaken \n     and eventually halt the conveyor belt circulation altogether, \n     causing northern Europe to become as much as 11 degrees \n     Fahrenheit cooler in a matter of decades.''

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of our \nmost remarkable members, Senator Jon Corzine, who leaves us this year \nto continue his work on behalf of the people of New Jersey in a new \ncapacity. Experience and leadership qualities like his are rare, and \nwith them, he has set himself apart as a champion of the environment, a \nsafe homeland, affordable health care, and working men and women \neverywhere.\n  After managing one of the most successful businesses in the world, \nJon arrived in the Senate five years ago with the negotiating skills \nand leadership experience that allowed him to succeed so admirably \nhere. Most notably, Jon came to Washington with an unusual and \nimportant perspective. He understands the bottom line. He understands \nthat it is not right for our children to inherit our unpaid bills and \nthat we have a responsibility to ensure that we leave them a safer, \nmore secure and more compassionate America.\n  In pursuit of these goals and never shying from a challenge, Jon \nCorzine was a leader in the fight to protect Social Security from \nprivatization and helped lead the charge to secure our chemical \nfacilities from terrorist attacks.\n  However, while tackling those critical national challenges, it was \nobvious that his heart was with New Jersey. Over the past 6 years, Jon \nfought hard to improve the quality of life for all of the people of his \nState by investing in the local economy and protecting New Jersey's \nnatural resources.\n  Last month, New Jersey residents showed their gratitude and \nadmiration for Jon's service and elected him Governor of their State. \nWith their votes, they showed that they believed in Jon's quest to make \nNew Jersey one of the best places to live, work and raise a family. As \na former Governor, I know the challenges and the rewards of running a \nState. And from working with Jon in the Senate, I know that he will \nhelp move New Jersey forward and will make sure that the State \ngovernment provides people with value for their hard-earned tax \ndollars, while respecting the values that unite us all.\n  Today, the Senate loses a valued colleague. However, today, New \nJersey gains a great Governor.\n  Jon, we will miss you. Susan joins me in wishing you all the best in \nthe future. New Jersey is lucky to have you.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my \ngood friend, Senator Jon Corzine, on his election to the governorship \nof New Jersey. The Senator from New Jersey and I joined this body in \nthe same year, 2001, and in that time, he has worked for New Jersey and \nthe country with skill and determination.\n  He is a man who believes in security, whether it is securing our \nhomeland, securing our financial future or securing our world from \ngenocide.\n  Senator Corzine recognized the deadly risk posed by lackluster \nprotection of our Nation's chemical plants. As we debated this year's \nHomeland Security appropriations bill, his amendment let everyone know \nthat we must take steps to protect against a terrorist attack on \nchemical facilities within the United States.\n  He has doggedly fought for retirement security for all Americans, \nhelping to protect Social Security from deep benefit cuts and \npreventing a substantial increase in the national debt. Senator Corzine \nknows that we made a promise to our seniors that they can retire with \nsafety and dignity, and he is helping to keep that promise.\n  By introducing the Sudan Accountability Act, Senator Corzine put this \nbody on record that we cannot allow the genocide in Darfur to continue. \nHundreds of thousands are already dead, and millions have been \ndisplaced by the atrocities in Sudan. He has helped push for sanctions \nagainst those committing these crimes and to put money into our efforts \nto stop them.\n  Over the past 5 years, I have had the pleasure of working closely \nwith Senator Corzine on important issues.\n  We recognized a gaping hole in benefits provided to widows of our \nservicemembers, and he joined me in introducing the Military Retiree \nSurvivor Benefit Equity Act. The bill has attracted bipartisan support \nbased on its fundamental fairness and because it is the right thing to \ndo for America's military retirees and their survivors.\n  Florida and New Jersey both have beautiful shorelines that serve \nimportant economic needs for our States, and Senator Corzine has helped \nme in the fight to protect these shorelines from the devastation of oil \ndrilling. I look forward to continuing this fight with his successor, \nCongressman Menendez.\n  I expect that as Governor of New Jersey, he will take with him to \nTrenton the same passion to protect our homeland, to protect our \nenvironment, and to protect our future that he had here in the Senate. \nI thank him for his service in Washington, DC, I congratulate him on \nhis victory, and I wish him well as he continues his service for the \npeople of New Jersey.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is my honor today to pay tribute and \nbid a fond farewell to my colleague and friend Senator Jon S. Corzine \nof New Jersey. Senator Corzine, as we know, will be leaving the Senate \nnext month to serve as New Jersey's Governor, and before he leaves us \nto begin what I can only be certain will be a wildly successful and \ninnovative tenure as New Jersey's chief executive, I thought it \nappropriate to take the time to celebrate not only Mr. Corzine's fine \nservice in the Senate, but his inspiring life story as well.\n  In many ways, Jon Corzine's life is an example of the American dream \nfulfilled. Mr. Corzine was born on New Year's Day, 1947, and grew up on \nhis family's farm in Willey's Station, IL. His father ran the farm and \nsold insurance; his mother was a public school teacher. Through his own \nhard work and that of his family, Mr. Corzine attended the University \nof Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in \n1969. After graduating college, Mr. Corzine served his country by \nenlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves, and he continued in the \nReserves until 1975, rising to the rank of sergeant in his infantry \nunit.\n  After Senator Corzine's active duty was up, he began what would \nbecome a long and successful career in the finance sector. His first \njob was with the Continental Illinois National Bank in Chicago, where \nhe worked as a portfolio analyst. At the same time, Mr. Corzine began \ntaking night classes at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of \nBusiness, where he received his MBA in 1973.\n  In 1975, after working briefly at a regional bank in Ohio, Mr. \nCorzine was recruited to go to work for the New York investment firm \nGoldman Sachs as a bond trader, beginning what would be a meteoritic \nrise through the company's ranks. After only 5 years, Mr. Corzine was \nnamed a partner in the firm. In 1994, Mr. Corzine became both the \nfirm's chairman and chief executive officer.\n  But the story doesn't end there for Mr. Corzine had a very successful \ntenure at the helm of Goldman Sachs. When he took over in 1994, the \nproud and respected firm was in a period of some decline. But Mr. \nCorzine and his team turned the company's fortunes upwards. During his \n5 years as chief executive, Mr. Corzine also oversaw the firm's \nsuccessful transition from a private partnership to a public company.\n  While serving as chief executive, Mr. Corzine also demonstrated a \npassion for public service. Under his leadership, Goldman Sachs was a \nstrong corporate citizen, expanding its community outreach and \nphilanthropic programs. Mr. Corzine also chaired a Presidential \ncommission that studied how capital budgeting could be used to increase \nFederal investment in education.\n  It is this commitment to public service that I saw Jon Corzine bring \nto his work in the Senate every day. Elected in 2000 by the people of \nNew Jersey, Senator Corzine has been a tireless advocate for corporate \naccountability, helping coauthor the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and has worked \nto protect our environment, where he has been a steadfast ally in the \nfights to prevent drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and \nto tackle climate change. On the international front, Senator Corzine \nhas sponsored the Darfur Accountability act, an act I am proud to\n\n[[Page S14027]]\n\ncosponsor, which seeks to address the terrible genocide currently \noccurring in the Darfur region of Sudan.\n  What I will remember most about Senator Corzine's tenure is his \ncommitment to strengthening our Nation's Homeland Security. Having \nworked with Senator Corzine on several homeland security issues, I know \nfirsthand that he was determined to do everything in his power to \nprotect the American people from another terrorist attack. Senator \nCorzine and I worked together in passing legislation that created the \n9/11 Commission, whose service to the American people we are all well \naware of. In addition, Senator Corzine has been a leader in legislative \nefforts to increase security at our Nation's chemical plants, which \nremain vulnerable to attack. Senator Corzine crafted strong legislation \naimed at protecting these facilities, and I remain hopeful that \nCongress will act on this area of great vulnerability. I will continue \nto be inspired by the dedication Senator Corzine applied to this \ncritical issue.\n  Let me end my statement by taking the time to thank Jon Corzine, for \nhis service in the Senate. I wish him, his daughter Jennifer, and his \ntwo sons, Josh and Jeffrey, nothing but the best for the future, and I \nlook forward to seeing the fine things I know he will continue to do \nfor the people of New Jersey, now as their Governor. Once again, thank \nyou, Jon Corzine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14027-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Thomas Stockwell is a 21-year-old gay man. On February 25, 2005, he \nwas walking near his home on the Chapel Hill Campus of the University \nof North Carolina. For no other reason than being gay, Stockwell was \nattacked and beaten by a group of six men.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \noutstanding work of antihunger leaders, volunteers, and organizations \nthroughout the gulf coast region and the Nation who have risen to the \noccasion and provided much needed food, support, and basic services to \nvictims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As we approach the holiday \nseason, I want to take the opportunity to help raise awareness about \nthe challenges the charitable food industry have met in the wake of the \nhurricanes as well as the increased demands on their services and food \nsupplies.\n  I want to focus my remarks on food rescue and food bank organizations \nand antihunger advocates operating in my home State of Arkansas. I also \nwant to highlight the amazing work done by America's Second Harvest, \nA2H, and its national network of food banks to bring food relief to the \nthousands of our fellow citizens suffering from the devastation wrought \nby the gulf region hurricanes.\n  Arkansas is fortunate to have a strong network of antihunger, food \nrescue, and food bank organizations that tirelessly work to feed hungry \nArkansans. This dynamic network includes six A2H affiliates located \nacross Arkansas which include the Foodbank of North Central Arkansas, \nHarvest Texarkana, Food Bank of Northeast Arkansas, River Valley \nRegional Food Bank, Arkansas Foodbank Network, and the Ozark Food Bank. \nOther essential partners in the network include the Arkansas Rice \nDepot, Potluck, Inc., Heifer International, Winrock International, \nlocal food pantries, homeless shelters, church soup kitchens, faith-\nbased antihunger programs and advocacy groups such as the Arkansas \nHunger Coalition, Arkansas Community Action Agencies, Arkansas Hunger \nRelief Alliance, Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families and the \nInterfaith Network.\n  I am proud of the many volunteers, employees, and financial \ncontributors of these organizations and programs. Their commitments to \nfeed the hungry and serve the poor is making a great difference in \nArkansas for our citizens and for the thousands of hurricane victims \nwho sought shelter in Arkansas after the hurricanes and for many that \nstill remain.\n  I am also proud of America's Second Harvest national leadership to \norganize its network of food banks to respond to the disaster area \nalong the gulf coast region. Within hours of Hurricane Katrina's \nlandfall in the gulf coast, A2H food banks from around the Nation began \nsending truckloads of food and water to the affected areas. Volunteers \nand staff from the network also were dispatched to the gulf region to \nhelp with relief efforts and provide support to the food banks and food \nrescue organizations trying to operate in areas where many of the local \nfood distribution agencies had been wiped out.\n  A2H immediately began to raise funds nationally for hurricane relief \nand dedicated all of these donations solely to food acquisition, \ntransportation, storage, and distribution to the disaster victims in \nthe gulf region. Undamaged food was rescued from the flooded New \nOrleans food banks and additional warehouse space was secured in other \nareas to ensure that the A2H network would be able to meet the dramatic \nincrease in demand for emergency food assistance that continues to this \nday in the gulf region.\n  Staff and volunteers worked tirelessly, night and day, for weeks on \nend to get food and distribute it to those in need. They collected, \ntransported, stored, and provided more than 59 million pounds of food, \naccounting for more than 46 million meals valued at an estimated $88 \nmillion to the gulf region. This effort is continuing as the need \nbroadens to reach those displaced persons in other areas where so many \nvictims have been relocated.\n  On Thursday, December 15, 2005, A2H released a report at a Capitol \nHill press conference documenting their study on the depth and breadth \nof the impact of the gulf region hurricane disasters on the charitable \nfood distribution system and the clients it serves. The study results \nreport that there are some 40 A2H food banks located in the hurricane-\nimpacted areas. Demands for emergency food assistance in these Gulf \nCoast states tripled immediately following Hurricane Katrina and \ncontinue to be more than 50 percent higher than prior to the disaster. \nIt is clear that much more is needed to secure the basic needs of those \nin the gulf region. Additionally, inventories donated to the gulf \nregion by many food banks have not been replaced and are now struggling \nto feed the clients and families they regularly serve.\n  A2H has helped shed the light on the severity of the situation that \nstill exists for thousands of families throughout the gulf coast \nregion. I hope that my colleagues in both the Senate and House will \ntake a close look at these findings to reinforce the need for \ncongressional support for our local grassroots antihunger organizations \nand for continued support of our vital Federal food assistance programs \nlike Food Stamps, WIC, School Breakfast and Lunch, and Child and Adult \nCare Food Program.\n  All of these important programs and activities are essential \ningredients in our Nation's battle to end hunger in America, whether it \ncomes from natural disasters or the everyday struggles of low-income \nAmericans to make ends meet. Thank you to America's Second Harvest and \nto the many antihunger volunteers and advocates throughout Arkansas and \nacross our Nation who are making a difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14027-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14027-S14028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  ANWR\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I have a question for the chairman and \nranking democrat of the Finance Committee with respect to one special \nkind of retirement plan that is defined in Internal Revenue Code \nsection 664(g) and involves qualified gratuitous transfers of employer \nsecurities. That section of the code was added in 1997 and later \namended in 2001. It provides certain rules and requirements for a \nbusiness owner who wants to bequeath his company to its employees \nthrough the company retirement plan.\n  One of the limitations in section 664(g) is that the maximum \nallocation that would be permitted to any participant each year is the \nlesser of $30,000 or 25 percent of compensation. That limitation, which \nis contained in code section 664(g)(7) was intended to ensure for an \norderly and fair allocation of shares received by a plan in a \ngratuitous transfer from a charitable remainder trust.\n  A question has been raised with me as to the appropriate timing of \nvaluation of the stock that is transferred to the accounts of \nparticipants for purposes of the unique section 664(g)(7) limitation. \nShould the stock be valued at the time the shares are transferred to \nthe plan or on the date the shares are allocated to the accounts of \nparticipants? It is my understanding, that the clear intent of the \nlimitation of section 664(g)(7) was to measure the value of the stock \non the date it is actually allocated to the account of the participant. \nAny other reading could result in potential circumvention of the \nstatutory limitation if the value of the stock were to increase during \nthe period between the actual transfer of the stock to the plan and the \nsubsequent allocation to the account of the participant. Put \ndifferently, when the statute says no participant shall receive more \nthan the lesser of $30,000 or 25 percent of compensation each year, \nthat is precisely what was intended. To be clear, this is a unique rule \nthat is specific to section 664(g). It has no bearing on any other \nrules involving plans, including employee stock ownership plans \n(ESOPs), that are not described in section 664(g).\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator for his careful explanation of the \nlaw. I agree completely that the intent of the Finance Committee in \nincluding the limitation of section 664(g)(7) was to provide for an \norderly and fair transfer of stock received in a gratuitous transfer \nand that we intended the value of the stock to be determined upon \nallocation to the participant's account and not upon some earlier date.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, I agree. In applying the unique limit of Internal \nRevenue Code section 664(g)(7), the valuation should be determined upon \nallocation to the participant's account.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14028-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14028-S14053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION FOR GULF OPPORTUNITY ZONE ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to submit for the record the \nJoint Committee's technical explanation of the Gulf Opportunity Zone \nAct of 2005. This explanation is of the Senate amendment to H.R. 4440. \nThis legislation was passed by the Senate on Friday, December 16, 2005. \nLet me make it clear that this technical explanation was actually \nsubmitted to the Senate at the time the bill was passed to be printed \nin the Congressional Record. Unfortunately, due to a clerical error \nthis did not happen. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntechnical explanation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              INTRODUCTION\n\n       The bill provides tax benefits for the Gulf Opportunity \n     Zone and certain areas affected by Hurricanes Rita and Wilma. \n     It also includes tax and trade technical corrections. \n     Finally, the bill provides that any of its provisions causing \n     an effect on receipts, budget authority, or outlays is \n     designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress).\n\n            TITLE I--ESTABLISHMENT OF GULF OPPORTUNITY ZONE\n\n               A. Tax Benefits for Gulf Opportunity Zone\n\n     1. Definitions of ``Gulf Opportunity Zone,'' ``Rita GO \n         Zone,'' ``Wilma GO Zone,'' and other definitions (new \n         sec. 1400M of the Code)\n\n\n                          General Definitions\n\n     Gulf Opportunity Zone\n       For purposes of the bill, the ``Gulf Opportunity Zone'' is \n     defined as that portion of the Hurricane Katrina Disaster \n     Area determined by the President to warrant individual or \n     individual and public assistance from the Federal Government \n     under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act by reason of Hurricane Katrina.\n     Hurricane Katrina disaster area\n       The term ``Hurricane Katrina disaster area'' means an area \n     with respect to which a major disaster has been declared by \n     the President before September 14, 2005, under section 401 of \n     the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act by reason of Hurricane Katrina.\n     Rita GO Zone\n       The term ``Rita GO Zone'' means that portion of the \n     Hurricane Rita disaster area determined by the President to \n     warrant individual or individual and public assistance from \n     the Federal Government under section 401 of the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act by \n     reason of Hurricane Rita.\n     Hurricane Rita disaster area\n       The term ``Hurricane Rita disaster area'' means an area \n     with respect to which a major disaster has been declared by \n     the President before October 6, 2005, under section 401 of \n     the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act, by reason of Hurricane Rita.\n     Wilma GO Zone\n       The term ``Wilma GO Zone'' means that portion of the \n     Hurricane Wilma disaster area determined by the President to \n     warrant individual or individual and public assistance from \n     the Federal Government under section 401 of the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act by \n     reason of Hurricane Wilma.\n     Hurricane Wilma disaster area\n       The term ``Hurricane Wilma disaster area'' means an area \n     with respect to which a major disaster has been declared by \n     the President before November 14, 2005, under section 401 of \n     the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act, by reason of Hurricane Wilma.\n     2. Tax-exempt bond financing for the Gulf Opportunity Zone \n         (new sec. 1400N(a) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     Rules governing issuance of tax-exempt bonds\n       In general\n       Under present law, gross income does not include interest \n     on State or local bonds (sec. 103). State and local bonds are \n     classified generally as either governmental bonds or private \n     activity bonds. Governmental bonds are bonds which are \n     primarily used to finance governmental functions or are \n     repaid with governmental funds. Private activity bonds are \n     bonds with respect to which the State or local government \n     serves as a conduit providing financing to nongovernmental \n     persons (e.g., private businesses or individuals). The \n     exclusion from income for State and local bonds does not \n     apply to private activity bonds, unless the bonds are issued \n     for certain permitted purposes (``qualified private activity \n     bonds'').\n       Private activities eligible for financing with tax-exempt \n           bonds\n       The definition of qualified private activity bonds includes \n     an exempt facility bond, or qualified mortgage, veterans' \n     mortgage, small issue, redevelopment, 501(c)(3), or student \n     loan bond (sec. 141(e)). The definition of exempt facility \n     bond includes bonds issued to finance certain transportation \n     facilities (airports, ports, mass commuting, and high-speed \n     intercity rail facilities); qualified residential rental \n     projects; privately owned and/or operated utility facilities \n     (sewage, water, solid waste disposal, and local district \n     heating and cooling facilities, certain private electric and \n     gas facilities, and hydroelectric dam enhancements); public/\n     private educational facilities; qualified green building and \n     sustainable design projects; and qualified highway or surface \n     freight transfer facilities (sec. 142(a)).\n\n[[Page S14029]]\n\n       As noted above, subject to certain requirements, qualified \n     private activity bonds may be issued to finance residential \n     rental property or owner-occupied housing. Residential rental \n     property may be financed with exempt facility bonds if the \n     financed project is a ``qualified residential rental \n     project.'' A project is a qualified residential rental \n     project if 20 percent or more of the residential units in \n     such project are occupied by individuals whose income is 50 \n     percent or less of area median gross income (the ``20-50 \n     test''). Alternatively, a project is a qualified residential \n     rental project if 40 percent or more of the residential units \n     in such project are occupied by individuals whose income is \n     60 percent or less of area median gross income (the ``40-60 \n     test'').\n       Owner-occupied housing may be financed with qualified \n     mortgage bonds. Qualified mortgage bonds are bonds issued to \n     make mortgage loans to qualified mortgagors for the purchase, \n     improvement, or rehabilitation of owner-occupied residences. \n     The Code imposes several limitations on qualified mortgage \n     bonds, including income limitations for homebuyers and \n     purchase price limitations for the home financed with bond \n     proceeds. The income limitations are satisfied if all \n     financing provided by an issue is provided for mortgagors \n     whose family income does not exceed 115 percent of the median \n     family income for the metropolitan area or State, whichever \n     is greater, in which the financed residences are located. The \n     purchase price limitations provide that a residence financed \n     with qualified mortgage bonds may not have a purchase price \n     in excess of 90 percent of the average area purchase price \n     for that residence. In addition to these limitations, \n     qualified mortgage bonds generally cannot be used to finance \n     a mortgage for a homebuyer who had an ownership interest in a \n     principal residence in the three years preceding the \n     execution of the mortgage (the ``first-time homebuyer'' \n     requirement).\n       Special income and purchase price limitations apply to \n     targeted area residences. A targeted area residence is one \n     located in either (1) a census tract in which at least 70 \n     percent of the families have an income which is 80 percent or \n     less of the state-wide median income or (2) an area of \n     chronic economic distress. For targeted area residences, the \n     income limitation is satisfied when no more than one-third of \n     the mortgages are made without regard to any income limits \n     and the remainder of the mortgages are made to mortgagors \n     whose family income is 140 percent or less of the applicable \n     median family income. The purchase price limitation is raised \n     from 90 percent to 110 percent of the average area purchase \n     price for targeted area residences. In addition, the first-\n     time homebuyer requirement does not apply to targeted area \n     residences.\n       Qualified mortgage bonds also may be used to finance \n     qualified home-improvement loans. Qualified home-improvement \n     loans are defined as loans to finance alterations, repairs, \n     and improvements on an existing residence, but only if such \n     alterations, repairs, and improvements substantially protect \n     or improve the basic livability or energy efficiency of the \n     property. Under present law, qualified home-improvement loans \n     may not exceed $15,000.\n       Issuance of most qualified private activity bonds is \n     subject (in whole or in part) to annual State volume \n     limitations (sec. 146)). Exceptions are provided for bonds \n     for certain governmentally owned facilities (e.g., airports, \n     ports, high-speed intercity rail, and solid waste disposal) \n     and bonds which are subject to separate local, State, or \n     national volume limits (e.g., public/private educational \n     facility bonds, enterprise zone facility bonds, qualified \n     green building bonds, and qualified highway or surface \n     freight transfer facility bonds).\n       In addition, qualified private activity bonds generally are \n     subject to restrictions on the use of proceeds for the \n     acquisition of land and existing property, use of proceeds to \n     finance certain specified facilities (e.g., airplanes, \n     skyboxes, other luxury boxes, health club facilities, \n     gambling facilities, and liquor stores), and use of proceeds \n     to pay costs of issuance (e.g., bond counsel and underwriter \n     fees). Small issue and redevelopment bonds also are subject \n     to additional restrictions on the use of proceeds for certain \n     facilities (e.g., golf courses and massage parlors).\n       Moreover, the term of qualified private activity bonds \n     generally may not exceed 120 percent of the economic life of \n     the property being financed and certain public \n     approval requirements (similar to requirements that \n     typically apply under State law to issuance of \n     governmental debt) apply under Federal law to issuance of \n     private activity bonds.\n       Liberty Zone Bonds\n       Present law permits an aggregate of $8 billion in exempt \n     facility bonds for the purpose of financing the construction \n     and rehabilitation of nonresidential real property and \n     residential rental real property in a designated ``Liberty \n     Zone'' (the ``Zone'') of New York City (``Liberty Zone \n     bonds''). The Zone consists of all business addresses located \n     on or south of Canal Street, East Broadway (east of its \n     intersection with Canal Street), or Grand Street (east of its \n     intersection with East Broadway) in the Borough of Manhattan. \n     No more than $800 million of the authorized bond amount may \n     be used to finance property used for retail sales of tangible \n     property (e.g., department stores, restaurants, etc.) and \n     functionally related and subordinate property. The $800 \n     million limit is divided equally between the Mayor of New \n     York City and the Governor of New York State. In addition, no \n     more than $1.6 billion of the authorized bond amount may be \n     used to finance residential rental property. The $1.6 billion \n     limit also is divided equally between the Mayor of New York \n     City and the Governor of New York State. Liberty Zone Bonds \n     must be issued before January 1, 2010.\n       Property eligible for financing with these bonds includes \n     buildings and their structural components, fixed tenant \n     improvements, and public utility property (e.g., gas, water, \n     electric and telecommunication lines). Fixtures and equipment \n     that could be removed from the designated zone for use \n     elsewhere are not eligible for financing with these bonds. \n     Issuance of these bonds is limited to projects approved by \n     the Mayor of New York City or the Governor of New York State, \n     each of whom may designate up to $4 billion of the aggregate \n     bond authority.\n       Arbitrage restrictions on tax-exempt bonds\n       To prevent States and local governments from issuing more \n     tax-exempt bonds than necessary for the activity being \n     financed or from issuing such bonds earlier than needed for \n     the purpose of the borrowing, the Code includes arbitrage \n     restrictions limiting the ability to profit from investment \n     of tax-exempt bond proceeds. In general, arbitrage profits \n     may be earned only during specified periods (e.g., defined \n     ``temporary periods'' before funds are needed for the purpose \n     of the borrowing) or on specified types of investments (e.g., \n     ``reasonably required reserve or replacement funds''). \n     Subject to limited exceptions, profits that are earned during \n     these periods or on such investments must be rebated to the \n     Federal Government. Governmental bonds are subject to less \n     restrictive arbitrage rules than most private activity bonds.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n     Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds\n       The provision authorizes the issuance of qualified private \n     activity bonds to finance the construction and rehabilitation \n     of residential and nonresidential property located in the \n     Gulf Opportunity Zone (``Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds''). Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone Bonds must be issued after the date of \n     enactment and before January 1, 2011.\n       Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds may be issued by the State of \n     Alabama, Louisiana, or Mississippi, or any political \n     subdivision thereof. Issuance of bonds authorized under the \n     provision is limited to projects approved by the Governor of \n     the State (or the State bond commission in the case of a bond \n     which is required under State law to be approved by such \n     commission) in which the financed project shall be located. \n     The maximum aggregate face amount of Gulf Opportunity Zone \n     Bonds that may be issued in any State is limited to $2,500 \n     multiplied by the population of the respective State within \n     the Gulf Opportunity Zone. Current refundings of outstanding \n     bonds issued under the provision do not count against the \n     aggregate volume limit to the extent that the principal \n     amount of the refunding bonds does not exceed the outstanding \n     principal amount of the bonds being refunded. Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone Bonds may not be advance refunded.\n       Depending on the purpose for which such bonds are issued, \n     Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds are treated as either exempt \n     facility bonds or qualified mortgage bonds. Gulf Opportunity \n     Zone Bonds are treated as exempt facility bonds if 95 percent \n     or more of the net proceeds of such bonds are to be used for \n     qualified project costs located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone. \n     Qualified project costs include the cost of acquisition, \n     construction, reconstruction, and renovation of \n     nonresidential real property (including buildings and their \n     structural components and fixed improvements associated with \n     such property), qualified residential rental projects (as \n     defined in section 142(d) with certain modifications), and \n     public utility property. For purposes of the provision, costs \n     associated with improving a facility (e.g., installing \n     equipment that enhances the pollution control of a \n     manufacturing facility) may be permitted project costs if \n     such costs are chargeable to the capital account of the \n     facility or would be so chargeable either with a proper \n     election by a taxpayer or but for a proper election by a \n     taxpayer to deduct the costs.\n       Bond proceeds may not be used to finance movable fixtures \n     and equipment. The purpose of this limitation is to ensure \n     that property financed with the bonds will remain in the Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone. ``Movable fixtures and equipment'' does not \n     include components that are assembled to construct an \n     industrial plant. Such term also does not include consumer \n     appliances installed in owner-occupied residences and \n     residential rental property financed with the proceeds of \n     Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds.\n       Rather than applying the 20-50 and 40-60 test under present \n     law, a project is a qualified residential rental project \n     under the provision if 20 percent or more of the residential \n     units in such project are occupied by individuals whose \n     income is 60 percent or less of area median gross income or \n     if 40 percent or more of the residential units in such \n     project are occupied by individuals whose income is 70 \n     percent or less of area median gross income.\n       Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds are treated as qualified \n     mortgage bonds if the bonds of such issue meet the \n     requirements of a qualified mortgage issue (as defined in \n     section 143 and modified by this provision) and the \n     residences financed with such bonds are located\n\n[[Page S14030]]\n\n     in the Gulf Opportunity Zone. For these purposes, residences \n     located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone are treated as targeted \n     area residences. Thus, the first-time homebuyer rule is \n     waived and purchase and income rules for targeted area \n     residences apply to residences financed with bonds issued \n     under the provision. Under the provision, 100 percent of the \n     mortgages must be made to mortgagors whose family income is \n     140 percent or less of the applicable median family income. \n     Thus, the present law rule allowing one-third of the \n     mortgages to be made without regard to any income limits does \n     not apply. In addition, the provision increases from \n     $15,000 to $150,000 the amount of a qualified home-\n     improvement loan that may be financed with bond proceeds.\n       Subject to the following exceptions and modifications, \n     issuance of Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds is subject to the \n     general rules applicable to issuance of qualified private \n     activity bonds:\n       (1) Except as otherwise permitted for a qualified mortgage \n     issue, repayments of bond-financed loans may not be used to \n     make additional loans;\n       (2) Issuance of the bonds is not subject to the aggregate \n     annual State private activity bond volume limits (sec. 146);\n       (3) The restriction on acquisition of existing property is \n     applied using a minimum requirement of 50 percent of the cost \n     of acquiring the building being devoted to rehabilitation \n     (sec. 147(d));\n       (4) The special arbitrage expenditure rules for certain \n     construction bond proceeds apply to available construction \n     proceeds of Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds issued to finance \n     qualified project costs, treating such bonds as a \n     construction issue (sec. 148(f)(4)(C));\n       (5) Interest on the bonds is not a preference item for \n     purposes of the alternative minimum tax preference for \n     private activity bond interest (sec. 57(a)(5)); and\n       (6) No portion of the proceeds of the bonds may be used to \n     provide any property described in section 144(c)(6)(B) (i.e., \n     any private or commercial golf course, country club, massage \n     parlor, hot tub facility, suntan facility, racetrack or other \n     facility used for gambling, or any store the principal \n     purpose of which is the sale alcoholic beverages for \n     consumption off premises).\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for bonds issued after the date \n     of enactment and before January 1, 2011.\n     3. Advance refunding of certain tax-exempt bonds (new sec. \n         1400N(b) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Interest on bonds issued by State and local governments \n     generally is excluded from gross income for Federal income \n     tax purposes if the proceeds of the bonds are used to finance \n     direct activities of these governmental units or if the bonds \n     are repaid with revenues of the governmental units \n     (``governmental bonds''). Interest on State or local bonds to \n     finance activities of private persons (``private activity \n     bonds'') is taxable unless a specific exception applies. \n     Bonds issued to finance the activities of charitable \n     organizations described in section 501(c)(3) (``qualified \n     501(c)(3) bonds'') are one type of tax-exempt private \n     activity bonds (``qualified private activity bonds''). \n     Qualified private activity bonds also include exempt facility \n     bonds. The definition of exempt facility bonds includes bonds \n     issued to finance certain transportation facilities (e.g., \n     airports, docks, and wharves).\n       Generally, qualified private activity bonds are subject to \n     restrictions on the use of proceeds for the acquisition of \n     land and existing property, use of proceeds to finance \n     certain specified facilities (e.g., airplanes, skyboxes, \n     other luxury boxes, health club facilities, gambling \n     facilities, and liquor stores), and use of proceeds to pay \n     costs of issuance (e.g., bond counsel and underwriter fees). \n     Certain types of qualified private activity bonds (e.g., \n     small issue and redevelopment bonds) also are subject to \n     additional restrictions on the use of proceeds for certain \n     facilities (e.g., golf courses and massage parlors). \n     Moreover, the term of qualified private activity bonds \n     generally may not exceed 120 percent of the economic life of \n     the property being financed and certain public approval \n     requirements (similar to requirements that typically apply \n     under State law to issuance of governmental debt) apply under \n     Federal law to issuance of private activity bonds.\n     Limitations on advance refundings\n       A refunding bond is defined as any bond used to pay \n     principal, interest, or redemption price on a prior bond \n     issue (the refunded bond). The Code contains different rules \n     for ``current'' as opposed to ``advance'' refunding bonds. A \n     current refunding occurs when the refunded bond is redeemed \n     within 90 days of issuance of the refunding bonds. \n     Conversely, a bond is classified as an advance refunding bond \n     if it is issued more than 90 days before the redemption of \n     the refunded bond (sec. 149(d)(5)). Proceeds of advance \n     refunding bonds are generally invested in an escrow account \n     and held until a future date when the refunded bond may be \n     redeemed. Thus, after issuance of an advance refunding bond, \n     there is a period of time when both the refunding bonds and \n     the refunded bonds remain outstanding.\n       There is no statutory limitation on the number of times \n     that tax-exempt bonds may be currently refunded. However, the \n     Code limits the number of advance refundings with tax-exempt \n     bonds. Generally, governmental bonds and qualified 501(c)(3) \n     bonds may be advance refunded one time (sec. 149(d)(3)). \n     Private activity bonds, other than qualified 501(c)(3) bonds, \n     may not be advance refunded.\n       Under present law, certain bonds used to fund facilities \n     located in New York City are permitted one additional advance \n     refunding if issued before January 1, 2006. In addition to \n     satisfying other requirements, the bond refunded must be (1) \n     a State or local bond that is a general obligation of New \n     York City, (2) a State or local bond issued by the New York \n     Municipal Water Finance Authority or Metropolitan \n     Transportation Authority of New York City, or (3) a qualified \n     501(c)(3) bond which is a qualified hospital bond issued by \n     or on behalf of the State of New York or New York City. The \n     maximum amount of additional advance refunding bonds that may \n     be issued is $9 billion.\n     Arbitrage restrictions on tax-exempt bonds\n       To prevent States and local governments from issuing more \n     tax-exempt bonds than is necessary for the activity being \n     financed or from issuing such bonds earlier than needed for \n     the purpose of the borrowing, the Code includes arbitrage \n     restrictions limiting the ability to profit from investment \n     of tax-exempt bond proceeds. In general, arbitrage profits \n     may be earned only during specified periods (e.g., defined \n     ``temporary periods'' before funds are needed for the purpose \n     of the borrowing) or on specified types of investments (e.g., \n     ``reasonably required reserve or replacement funds''). \n     Subject to limited exceptions, profits that are earned during \n     these periods or on such investments must be rebated to the \n     Federal Government. Governmental bonds are subject to less \n     restrictive arbitrage rules than most private activity bonds.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision permits an additional advance refunding of \n     certain governmental and qualified 501(c)(3) bonds issued by \n     the State of Alabama, Louisiana, or Mississippi, or any \n     political subdivision thereof. The provision also permits one \n     advance refunding of certain exempt facility bonds for \n     airports, docks, or wharves issued by the State of Alabama, \n     Louisiana, or Mississippi, or any political subdivision \n     thereof, notwithstanding the general prohibition on the \n     advance refunding of such bonds.\n       The advance refunding authority under this provision only \n     applies to bonds issued by the State of Alabama, Louisiana, \n     or Mississippi, or any political subdivision thereof, which \n     were outstanding on August 28, 2005, and could not be advance \n     refunded under Code restrictions in effect on that date. \n     (Although section 1400L(e)(4)(A) refers to restrictions on \n     advance refundings under ``any provision of law,'' rather \n     than under the ``Code,'' no inference should be drawn from \n     the use of different terms). Further, to be eligible for the \n     additional advance refunding, the advance refunding bond must \n     be the only other outstanding bond with respect to the \n     refunded bond. Thus, at no time after the advance refunding \n     authorized under the provision occurs may there be more than \n     two sets of bonds outstanding.\n       The maximum amount of advance refunding bonds that may be \n     issued pursuant to this provision is $4.5 billion in the case \n     of Louisiana, $2.250 billion in the case of Mississippi, and \n     $1.125 billion in the case of Alabama. Eligible advance \n     refunding bonds must be designated as such by the governor of \n     the respective State. Advance refunding bonds issued under \n     the provision must satisfy present-law arbitrage restrictions \n     and all requirements otherwise applicable to advance \n     refunding issues (e.g., redemption requirements and \n     prohibition on abusive transactions). Moreover, bonds may not \n     be advance refunded under this provision if any portion of \n     the proceeds of such bonds was used to provide any property \n     described in section 144(c)(6)(B) (i.e., any private or \n     commercial golf course, country club, massage parlor, hot tub \n     facility, suntan facility, racetrack or other facility used \n     for gambling, or any store the principal purpose of which is \n     the sale alcoholic beverages for consumption off premises).\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for advance refunding bonds \n     issued after the date of enactment and before January 1, \n     2011.\n     4. Increase the low-income housing credit cap and make other \n         modifications (new sec. 1400N(c) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       The low-income housing credit may be claimed over a 10-year \n     period for the cost of rental housing occupied by tenants \n     having incomes below specified levels. The amount of the \n     credit for any taxable year in the credit period is the \n     applicable percentage of the qualified basis of each \n     qualified low-income building. The qualified basis of any \n     qualified low-income building for any taxable year equals the \n     applicable fraction of the eligible basis of the building.\n       The credit percentage for newly constructed or \n     substantially rehabilitated housing that is not Federally \n     subsidized is adjusted monthly by the Internal Revenue \n     Service so that the 10 annual installments have a present \n     value of 70 percent of the total qualified basis. The credit \n     percentage for newly constructed or substantially \n     rehabilitated housing that is Federally subsidized and for \n     existing housing that is substantially\n\n[[Page S14031]]\n\n     rehabilitated is calculated to have a present value of 30 \n     percent of qualified basis. These are referred to as the 70 \n     percent credit and 30 percent credit, respectively.\n     Income targeting\n       In order to be eligible for the low-income housing credit, \n     a qualified low-income building must be part of a qualified \n     low-income housing project. In general, a qualified low-\n     income housing project is defined as a project which \n     satisfies one of two tests at the election of the taxpayer. \n     The first test is met if 20 percent or more of the \n     residential units in the project are both rent-restricted and \n     occupied by individuals whose income is 50 percent or less of \n     area median gross income (the ``20-50 test''). The second \n     test is met if 40 percent or more of the residential units in \n     such project are both rent-restricted and occupied by \n     individuals whose income is 60 percent or less of area median \n     gross income (the ``40-60 test'').\n     Credit cap\n       Generally, the aggregate credit authority provided annually \n     to each State for calendar year 2006 is $1.90 per resident \n     with a minimum annual cap of $2,180,000 for certain small \n     population States. These amounts are indexed for inflation. \n     These limits do not apply in the case of projects that also \n     receive financing with proceeds of tax-exempt bonds issued \n     subject to the private activity bond volume limit.\n     Basis of building eligible for the credit\n       Buildings located in high cost areas (i.e., qualified \n     census tracts and difficult development areas) are eligible \n     for an enhanced credit. Under the enhanced credit, the 70-\n     percent and 30 percent credit is increased to a 91 percent \n     and 39 percent credit, respectively. The mechanism for this \n     increase is an increase from 100 to 130 percent of the \n     otherwise applicable eligible basis of a new building or the \n     rehabilitation expenditures of an existing building. A \n     further requirement for the enhanced credit is that no more \n     than 20 percent of the population of each metropolitan \n     statistical area or nonmetropolitan statistical area may \n     be a difficult to develop area.\n     Stacking rule\n       Authority to allocate credits remains at the State (as \n     opposed to local) government level unless State law provides \n     otherwise. Generally, credits may be allocated only from \n     volume authority arising during the calendar year in which \n     the building is placed in service, except in the case of: (1) \n     credits claimed on additions to qualified basis; (2) credits \n     allocated in a later year pursuant to an earlier binding \n     commitment made no later than the year in which the building \n     is placed in service; and (3) carryover allocations.\n       Each State annually receives low-income housing credit \n     authority equal to $1.90 per State resident for allocation to \n     qualified low-income projects. In addition to this $1.90 per \n     resident amount, each State's ``housing credit ceiling'' \n     includes the following amounts: (1) the unused State housing \n     credit ceiling (if any) of such State for the preceding \n     calendar year; (2) the amount of the State housing credit \n     ceiling (if any) returned in the calendar year; and (3) the \n     amount of the national pool (if any) allocated to such State \n     by the Treasury Department.\n       The national pool consists of States' unused housing credit \n     carryovers. For each State, the unused housing credit \n     carryover for a calendar year consists of the excess (if any) \n     of the unused State housing credit ceiling for such year over \n     the excess (if any) of the aggregate housing credit dollar \n     amount allocated for such year over the sum of $1.90 per \n     resident and the credit returns for such year. The amounts in \n     the national pool are allocated only to States that allocated \n     their entire housing credit ceiling for the preceding \n     calendar year and requested a share in the national pool not \n     later than May 1 of the calendar year. The national pool \n     allocation to qualified States is made on a pro rata basis \n     equivalent to the fraction that a State's population enjoys \n     relative to the total population of all qualified States for \n     that year.\n       The present-law stacking rule provides that each State is \n     treated as using its allocation of the unused State housing \n     credit ceiling (if any) from the preceding calendar before \n     the current year's allocation of credit (including any \n     credits returned to the State) and then finally any national \n     pool allocations.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n     Income targeting\n       In the case of property placed in service during 2006, \n     2007, and 2008 in a nonmetropolitan area within the Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone, the income targeting rules of the low-\n     income housing credit are applied by replacing the area \n     median gross income standard with a national nonmetropolitan \n     median gross income standard. These new income targeting \n     rules apply to all such buildings in the Gulf Opportunity \n     Zone regardless of whether the building receives its credit \n     allocation under the otherwise applicable low-income housing \n     credit cap or the additional credit cap (described below). \n     The income targeting rules are not changed for buildings in \n     metropolitan areas in the Gulf Opportunity Zone.\n     Credit cap\n       Under the provision, the otherwise applicable housing \n     credit ceiling amount is increased for each of the States \n     within the Gulf Opportunity Zone. This increase applies to \n     calendar years 2006, 2007, and 2008. The additional credit \n     cap for each of the affected States equals $18.00 times the \n     number of such State's residents within the Gulf Opportunity \n     Zone. This amount is not adjusted for inflation. For purposes \n     of this additional credit cap amount, the determination of \n     population for any calendar year is made on the basis of the \n     most recent census estimate of the resident population of the \n     State in the Gulf Opportunity Zone released by the Bureau of \n     the Census before August 28, 2005.\n       In addition, the otherwise applicable housing credit \n     ceiling amount is increased for Florida and Texas by \n     $3,500,000 per State. This increase only applies to calendar \n     year 2006.\n     Basis of building eligible for the credit\n       Under the provision, the Gulf Opportunity Zone, the Rita Go \n     Zone, and the Wilma Go Zone are treated as high-cost areas \n     for purposes of the low-income housing credit for property \n     placed-in-service in calendar years 2006, 2007, and 2008. \n     Therefore, buildings located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone, \n     the Rita Go Zone, and the Wilma Go Zone are eligible for the \n     enhanced credit. Under the enhanced credit, the 70 percent \n     and 30 percent credits are increased to 91 percent and 39 \n     percent credits, respectively. The 20 percent of population \n     restriction is waived for this purpose. This enhanced credit \n     applies regardless of whether the building receives its \n     credit allocation under the otherwise applicable low-income \n     housing credit cap or the additional credit cap.\n     Carryover\n       The additional credit cap available for States within the \n     Gulf Opportunity Zone for calendar years 2006, 2007 and 2008 \n     may not be carried forward from any year to any other year. \n     The present-law rules apply for purposes of the Rita Go Zone \n     and the Wilma Go Zone.\n     Stacking rule\n       Within each calendar year, each applicable State within the \n     GO Zone must treat the additional credit cap allocable under \n     the provision to that State as allocated before any other \n     credit cap amounts. Therefore, under the provision each \n     applicable State within the GO Zone is treated as using \n     credits in the following order: (1) the additional credit cap \n     (including any such credits returned to the State) under the \n     Gulf Opportunity Zone, then (2) its allocation of the unused \n     State housing credit ceiling (if any) from the preceding \n     calendar, then (3) the current year's allocation of present-\n     law credit (including any credits returned to the State) and \n     then (4) any national pool allocations. This generally \n     maximizes the total amount of credit (under both otherwise \n     applicable low income housing credit cap and the additional \n     credit cap for the Gulf Opportunity Zone) which may be \n     carried forward.\n       The present-law rules apply for purposes of the Rita Go \n     Zone and the Wilma Go Zone.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provisions relating to the increased credit cap, \n     carryover and stacking rule applicable to the GO Zone are \n     generally effective for calendar years beginning after 2005 \n     and before 2009.\n       The provision relating to the increased credit cap \n     applicable to Florida and Texas is generally effective for \n     calendar years beginning after 2005 and before 2007.\n       The provision to treat the Gulf Opportunity Zone, Rita Go \n     Zone and the Wilma Go Zone as a high-cost area is generally \n     effective for calendar years beginning after 2005 and before \n     2009, and buildings placed in service during such period in \n     the case of projects that also receive financing with the \n     proceeds of tax-exempt bonds subject to the private activity \n     bond volume limit which are issued during that period.\n       The income targeting provision is effective for property \n     placed in service during 2006, 2007 and 2008. This provision \n     applies to property which receives a credit allocation in any \n     of those three years or a prior year. It also applies in the \n     case of credit projects that receive tax-exempt bond \n     financing subject to the private activity bond volume limit.\n     5. Additional first-year depreciation for Gulf Opportunity \n         Zone property (new sec. 1400N(d) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       A taxpayer is allowed to recover, through annual \n     depreciation deductions, the cost of certain property used in \n     a trade or business or for the production of income. The \n     amount of the depreciation deduction allowed with respect to \n     tangible property for a taxable year is determined under the \n     modified accelerated cost recovery system (``MACRS''). Under \n     MACRS, different types of property generally are assigned \n     applicable recovery periods and depreciation methods. The \n     recovery periods applicable to most tangible personal \n     property (generally tangible property other than residential \n     rental property and nonresidential real property) range from \n     3 to 25 years. The depreciation methods generally applicable \n     to tangible personal property are the 200-percent and 150-\n     percent declining balance methods, switching to the straight-\n     line method for the taxable year in which the depreciation \n     deduction would be maximized.\n       Section 280F limits the annual depreciation deductions with \n     respect to passenger automobiles to specified dollar amounts, \n     indexed for inflation.\n       Section 167(f)(1) provides that capitalized computer \n     software costs, other than computer software to which section \n     197 applies, are recovered ratably over 36 months.\n\n[[Page S14032]]\n\n       In lieu of depreciation, a taxpayer with a sufficiently \n     small amount of annual investment generally may elect to \n     deduct the cost of qualifying property placed in service for \n     the taxable year. (Sec. 179.) In general, qualifying property \n     is defined as depreciable tangible personal property that is \n     purchased for use in the active conduct of a trade or \n     business.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision allows an additional first-year depreciation \n     deduction equal to 50 percent of the adjusted basis of \n     qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone property. In order to \n     qualify, property 13 generally must be placed in service on \n     or before December 31, 2007 (December 31, 2008 in the case of \n     nonresidential real property and residential rental \n     property).\n       The additional first-year depreciation deduction is allowed \n     for both regular tax and alternative minimum tax purposes for \n     the taxable year in which the property is placed in service. \n     The additional first-year depreciation deduction is subject \n     to the general rules regarding whether an item is deductible \n     under section 162 or subject to capitalization under section \n     263 or section 263A. The basis of the property and the \n     depreciation allowances in the year of purchase and later \n     years are appropriately adjusted to reflect the additional \n     first-year depreciation deduction. In addition, the provision \n     provides that there is no adjustment to the allowable amount \n     of depreciation for purposes of computing a taxpayer's \n     alternative minimum taxable income with respect to property \n     to which the provision applies. A taxpayer is allowed to \n     elect out of the additional first-year depreciation for any \n     class of property for any taxable year.\n       In order for property to qualify for the additional first-\n     year depreciation deduction, it must meet all of the \n     following requirements. First, the property must be property \n     to which the general rules of the Modified Accelerated Cost \n     Recovery System (``MACRS'') apply with (1) an applicable \n     recovery period of 20 years or less, (2) computer software \n     other than computer software covered by section 197, (3) \n     water utility property (as defined in section 168(e)(5)), (4) \n     certain leasehold improvement property, or (5) certain \n     nonresidential real property and residential rental property. \n     Second, substantially all of the use of such property must be \n     in the Gulf Opportunity Zone and in the active conduct of a \n     trade or business by the taxpayer in the Gulf Opportunity \n     Zone. Third, the original use of the property in the Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone must commence with the taxpayer on or after \n     August 28, 2005. (Thus, used property may constitute \n     qualified property so long as it has not previously been used \n     within the Gulf Opportunity Zone. In addition, it is intended \n     that additional capital expenditures incurred to recondition \n     or rebuild property the original use of which in the Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone began with the taxpayer would satisfy the \n     ``original use'' requirement. See Treasury Regulation sec. \n     1.48-2 Example 5.) Finally, the property must be acquired by \n     purchase (as defined under section 179(d)) by the taxpayer on \n     or after August 28, 2005 and placed in service on or before \n     December 31, 2007. For qualifying nonresidential real \n     property and residential rental property, the property must \n     be placed in service on or before December 31, 2008, in lieu \n     of December 31, 2007. Property does not qualify if a binding \n     written contract for the acquisition of such property was in \n     effect before August 28, 2005. However, property is not \n     precluded from qualifying for the additional first-year \n     depreciation merely because a binding written contract to \n     acquire a component of the property is in effect prior to \n     August 28, 2005.\n       Property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced by \n     the taxpayer for use by the taxpayer qualifies if the \n     taxpayer begins the manufacture, construction, or production \n     of the property on or after August 28, 2005, and the property \n     is placed in service on or before December 31, 2007 (and all \n     other requirements are met). In the case of qualified \n     nonresidential real property and residential rental property, \n     the property must be placed in service on or before December \n     31, 2008. Property that is manufactured, constructed, or \n     produced for the taxpayer by another person under a contract \n     that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, \n     or production of the property is considered to be \n     manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer.\n       Under a special rule, property any portion of which is \n     financed with the proceeds of a tax-exempt obligation under \n     section 103 is not eligible for the additional first-year \n     depreciation deduction. Recapture rules apply under the \n     provision if the property ceases to be qualified Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone property.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision applies to property placed in service on or \n     after August 28, 2005, in taxable years ending on or after \n     such date.\n     6. Increase in expensing for Gulf Opportunity Zone property \n         (new sec. 1400N(e) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       In lieu of depreciation, a taxpayer with a sufficiently \n     small amount of annual investment may elect to deduct (or \n     ``expense'') such costs. Present law provides that the \n     maximum amount a taxpayer may expense, for taxable years \n     beginning in 2003 through 2007, is $100,000 of the cost of \n     qualifying property placed in service for the taxable year. \n     Additional section 179 incentives are provided with respect \n     to a qualified property used by a business in the New York \n     Liberty Zone (sec. 1400L(f)), an empowerment zone (sec. \n     1397A), or a renewal community (sec. 1400J). In general, \n     qualifying property is defined as depreciable tangible \n     personal property that is purchased for use in the active \n     conduct of a trade or business. Off-the-shelf computer \n     software placed in service in taxable years beginning before \n     2008 is treated as qualifying property. The $100,000 amount \n     is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount by which the \n     cost of qualifying property placed in service during the \n     taxable year exceeds $400,000. The $100,000 and $400,000 \n     amounts are indexed for inflation for taxable years beginning \n     after 2003 and before 2008.\n       For taxable years beginning in 2008 and thereafter, a \n     taxpayer with a sufficiently small amount of annual \n     investment may elect to deduct up to $25,000 of the cost of \n     qualifying property placed in service for the taxable year. \n     The $25,000 amount is reduced (but not below zero) by the \n     amount by which the cost of qualifying property placed in \n     service during the taxable year exceeds $200,000.\n       The amount eligible to be expensed for a taxable year may \n     not exceed the taxable income for a taxable year that is \n     derived from the active conduct of a trade or business \n     (determined without regard to this provision). Any amount \n     that is not allowed as a deduction because of the taxable \n     income limitation may be carried forward to succeeding \n     taxable years (subject to similar limitations). No general \n     business credit under section 38 is allowed with respect to \n     any amount for which a deduction is allowed under section \n     179.\n       An expensing election is made under rules prescribed by the \n     Secretary (sec. 179(c)(1)). Under Treas. Reg. sec. 179-5, \n     applicable to property placed in service in taxable years \n     beginning after 2002 and before 2008, a taxpayer is permitted \n     to make or revoke an election under section 179 without the \n     consent of the Commissioner on an amended Federal tax return \n     for that taxable year. This amended return must be filed \n     within the time prescribed by law for filing an amended \n     return for the taxable year. For taxable years beginning in \n     2008 and thereafter, an expensing election may be revoked \n     only with consent of the Commissioner (sec. 179(c)(2)).\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       Under the provision, the $100,000 maximum amount that a \n     taxpayer may elect to deduct under section 179 is increased \n     by the lesser of $100,000, or the cost of qualified section \n     179 Gulf Opportunity Zone property for the taxable year. The \n     provision applies with respect to qualified section 179 Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone property acquired on or after August 28, \n     2005, and placed in service on or before December 31, 2007. \n     Thus, in addition to the $100,000 maximum cost of any section \n     179 property (including property that also meets the \n     definition of qualified section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone \n     property) that may be deducted under present law, a taxpayer \n     may elect to deduct a maximum $100,000 additional amount of \n     the taxpayer's cost of qualified section 179 Gulf Opportunity \n     Zone property, resulting in a maximum deductible amount of \n     $200,000 of qualified section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone \n     property. (The $100,000 present-law portion of this amount is \n     indexed for taxable years beginning after 2003 and before \n     2008, so the total may be higher than $200,000 after \n     taking indexation of this portion into account.) The \n     $100,000 additional amount for the cost of qualified \n     section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone property is not indexed.\n       The provision provides a special rule for the reduction in \n     the $200,000 maximum deduction for the cost of qualified \n     section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone property. Under this rule, \n     the $200,000 amount is reduced (but not below zero) by the \n     amount by which the cost of qualified section 179 Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone property placed in service during the \n     taxable year exceeds a dollar cap of up to $1 million. (The \n     $400,000 present-law portion of this amount is indexed for \n     taxable years beginning after 2003 and before 2008, so the \n     total may be higher than $1 million after taking indexation \n     of this portion into account.) The dollar cap is computed by \n     increasing the $400,000 present-law amount by the lesser of \n     (1) $600,000, or (2) the cost of qualified section 179 Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone property placed in service during the \n     taxable year. The $600,000 amount is not indexed.\n       The operation of the reduction may be illustrated as \n     follows. In each of the following examples, assume that the \n     taxable income limitation of section 179(b)(3)(A) does not \n     cause a reduction in the amount that may be expensed for the \n     taxable year. For example, assume that in the taxable year, a \n     taxpayer's cost of section 179 property that is qualified \n     Gulf Opportunity Zone property is $800,000, and in that year \n     the taxpayer acquires no other section 179 property. Under \n     the provision, the taxpayer's deductible amount is increased \n     by $100,000 to $200,000 (the lesser of $100,000 and cost of \n     the taxpayer's qualified section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone \n     property). Under the provision, the $400,000 phase-out amount \n     in section 179(b)(2) is increased by $600,000 (i.e., the \n     lesser of $600,000 or the $800,000 cost of qualified section \n     179 Gulf Opportunity Zone property), so that the phase-out \n     amount is $1 million. The taxpayer's cost of section 179 \n     property is $800,000 in total (less than the $1 million \n     phase-out amount), so no reduction is made in the $200,000 \n     amount of qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone\n\n[[Page S14033]]\n\n     property that may be deducted under section 179 for the \n     taxable year. As another example, assume for the taxable year \n     that a taxpayer's cost of section 179 property that is \n     qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone property is $200,000, and its \n     cost of other section 179 property is $450,000. Under the \n     provision, the $400,000 phase-out amount in section 179(b)(2) \n     is increased to $600,000 by the $200,000 cost of qualified \n     section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone property. The taxpayer had \n     a total $650,000 cost of section 179 property for the taxable \n     year. The taxpayer's section 179 deduction is reduced by the \n     $50,000 difference between $650,000 and $600,000. Thus, under \n     the provision, the taxpayer may deduct $150,000 ($200,000 \n     less $50,000) under section 179 for the taxable year.\n       Qualified section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone property means \n     section 179 property (as defined in section 179(d) of present \n     law) that also meets the requirements to qualify for Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone bonus depreciation. Specifically, for \n     section 179 purposes, qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone \n     property is property (1) described in section \n     168(k)(2)(A)(i), (2) substantially all of the use of which is \n     in the Gulf Opportunity Zone and is in the active conduct of \n     a trade or business by the taxpayer in that Zone, (3) the \n     original use of which commences with the taxpayer on or after \n     August 28, 2005, (4) which is acquired by the taxpayer by \n     purchase on or after August 28, 2005, but only if no written \n     binding contract for the acquisition was in effect before \n     August 28, 2005, and (5) which is placed in service by the \n     taxpayer on or before December 31, 2007. Such property does \n     not include alternative depreciation property, tax-exempt \n     bond-financed property, or qualified revitalization \n     buildings.\n       The provision includes rules coordinating increased section \n     179 amounts provided under the bill with present-law \n     expensing rules with respect to enterprise zone businesses in \n     empowerment zones and with respect to renewal communities. \n     For purposes of those rules, qualified section 179 Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone property is not treated as qualified zone \n     property or qualified renewal property, unless the taxpayer \n     elects not to take such qualified section 179 Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone property into account for purposes of this \n     provision. Thus, a taxpayer acquiring property that could \n     qualify as either qualified section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone \n     property, or qualified zone property or qualified renewal \n     property, may elect the additional expensing provided either \n     under this provision, or under the empowerment zone or \n     renewal community rules, but not both, with respect to the \n     property.\n       Recapture rules apply under the provision if recapture \n     applies under section 179(d)(10) or if the property ceases to \n     be qualified section 179 Gulf Opportunity Zone property.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years ending on or \n     after August 28, 2005, for qualified section 179 Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone property acquired after August 27, 2005, and \n     placed in service on or before December 31, 2007.\n     7. Expensing for certain demolition and clean-up costs (new \n         sec. 1400N(f) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under present law, the cost of demolition of a structure is \n     capitalized into the taxpayer's basis in the land on which \n     the structure is located. (Sec. 280B). Land is not subject to \n     an allowance for depreciation or amortization.\n       The treatment of the cost of debris removal depends on the \n     nature of the costs incurred. For example, the cost of debris \n     removal after a storm may in some cases constitute an \n     ordinary and necessary business expense which is deductible \n     in the year paid or incurred. In other cases, debris removal \n     costs may be in the nature of replacement of part of the \n     property that was damaged. In such cases, the costs are \n     capitalized and added to the taxpayer's basis in the \n     property. For example, Revenue Ruling 71-161, 1971-1 C.B. 76, \n     permits the use of clean-up costs as a measure of casualty \n     loss but requires that such costs be added to the post-\n     casualty basis of the property.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       Under the provision, a taxpayer is permitted a deduction \n     for 50 percent of any qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone clean-\n     up cost paid or incurred on or after August 28, 2005, and \n     before January 1, 2008. The remaining 50 percent is \n     capitalized as under present law.\n       A qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone clean-up cost is an \n     amount paid or incurred for the removal of debris from, or \n     the demolition of structures on, real property located in the \n     Gulf Opportunity Zone to the extent that the amount would \n     otherwise be capitalized. In order to qualify, the \n     property must be held for use in a trade or business, for \n     the production of income, or as inventory.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision applies to costs paid or incurred on or after \n     August 28, 2005 in taxable years ending on or after such \n     date.\n     8. Extension of expensing for environmental remediation costs \n         (new sec. 1400N(g) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Taxpayers may elect to deduct (or ``expense'') certain \n     environmental remediation expenditures that would otherwise \n     be chargeable to capital account, in the year paid or \n     incurred (sec. 198). The deduction applies for both regular \n     and alternative minimum tax purposes. The expenditure must be \n     incurred in connection with the abatement or control of \n     hazardous substances at a qualified contaminated site.\n       A ``qualified contaminated site'' generally is any property \n     that (1) is held for use in a trade or business, for the \n     production of income, or as inventory and (2) is at a site on \n     which there has been a release (or threat of release) or \n     disposal of certain hazardous substances as certified by the \n     appropriate State environmental agency (so-called \n     ``brownfields'').\n       Section 198(d)(1) defines a ``hazardous substance'' as a \n     substance which is so defined in section 101(14) of the \n     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n     Liability Act of 1980 (``CERCLA''), and any substance which \n     is administratively designated as a hazardous substance under \n     section 102 of CERCLA. Under section 198(d)(2), however, the \n     term ``hazardous substance'' does not include any substance \n     with respect to which a removal or remediation is not \n     permitted under section 104 of CERCLA by reason of subsection \n     (a)(3) thereof, which exempts from the scope of such \n     provision ``the release or threat of release (A) of a \n     naturally occurring substance in its unaltered form, or \n     altered solely through naturally occurring processes or \n     phenomena, from a location where it is naturally found; (B) \n     from products which are part of the structure of, and result \n     in exposure within, residential buildings or business or \n     community structures; or (C) into public or private drinking \n     water supplies due to deterioration of the system through \n     ordinary use.'' However, sites which are identified on the \n     national priorities list under CERCLA cannot qualify for \n     expensing under section 198.\n       Petroleum products generally are not regarded as hazardous \n     substances for purposes of section 198. Section 101(14) of \n     CERCLA specifically excludes ``petroleum, including crude oil \n     or any fraction thereof which is not otherwise specifically \n     listed or designated as a hazardous substance under \n     subparagraphs (A) through (F) of this paragraph,'' from the \n     definition of ``hazardous substance.''\n       Under present law, eligible expenditures are those paid or \n     incurred before January 1, 2006.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision extends the present-law expensing provision \n     for two years (through December 31, 2007) for qualified \n     contaminated sites located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone.\n       In addition, under the provision, petroleum products are \n     treated as hazardous substances for purposes of applying the \n     expensing provision (as extended) within the Gulf Opportunity \n     Zone. Petroleum products are defined by reference to section \n     4612(a)(3), and include crude oil, crude oil condensates and \n     natural gasoline. Thus, for example, the release of crude oil \n     upon property held for use in a trade or business in the Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone results in such property being treated as a \n     qualified contaminated site. The present law exceptions for \n     sites on the national priorities list under CERCLA, and for \n     substances with respect to which a removal or remediation is \n     not permitted under section 104 of CERCLA by reason of \n     subsection (a)(3) thereof, would continue to apply to all \n     hazardous substances (including petroleum products).\n       Expenditures paid or incurred to abate the contamination on \n     or after August 28, 2005 and before December 31, 2007, would \n     be eligible for expensing.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years ending on or \n     after August 28, 2005.\n     9. Increase in rehabilitation tax credit with respect to \n         certain buildings located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone \n         (new sec. 1400N(h) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law provides a two-tier tax credit for \n     rehabilitation expenditures.\n       A 20-percent credit is provided for qualified \n     rehabilitation expenditures with respect to a certified \n     historic structure. For this purpose, a certified historic \n     structure means any building that is listed in the National \n     Register, or that is located in a registered historic \n     district and is certified by the Secretary of the Interior to \n     the Secretary of the Treasury as being of historic \n     significance to the district.\n       A 10-percent credit is provided for qualified \n     rehabilitation expenditures with respect to a qualified \n     rehabilitated building, which generally means a building that \n     was first placed in service before 1936. The pre-1936 \n     building must meet requirements with respect to retention of \n     existing external walls and internal structural framework of \n     the building in order for expenditures with respect to it to \n     qualify for the 10-percent credit. A building is treated as \n     having met the substantial rehabilitation requirement under \n     the 10-percent credit only if the rehabilitation expenditures \n     during the 24-month period selected by the taxpayer and \n     ending within the taxable year exceed the greater of (1) the \n     adjusted basis of the building (and its structural \n     components), or (2) $5,000.\n       The provision requires the use of straight-line \n     depreciation or the alternative depreciation system in order \n     for rehabilitation expenditures to be treated as qualified \n     under the provision.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision increases from 20 to 26 percent, and from 10 \n     to 13 percent, respectively,\n\n[[Page S14034]]\n\n     the credit under section 47 with respect to any certified \n     historic structure or qualified rehabilitated building \n     located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone, provided the qualified \n     rehabilitation expenditures with respect to such buildings or \n     structures are incurred on or after August 28, 2005, and \n     before January 1, 2009.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for expenditures incurred on or \n     after August 28, 2005, and before January 1, 2009, for \n     taxable years ending on or after August 28, 2005.\n     10. Increased expensing for reforestation expenditures of \n         small timber producers (new sec. 1400N(i)(1) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law permits a taxpayer to elect to deduct (or \n     ``expense'') a limited amount of certain reforestation \n     expenditures that would otherwise be required to be \n     capitalized, in the year paid or incurred (sec. 194(b)). No \n     more than $10,000 of reforestation expenditures made by a \n     taxpayer in any year can qualify for expensing with respect \n     to each qualified timber property. The limit is reduced to \n     $5,000 per qualified timber property for married taxpayers \n     filing separate returns.\n       All members of a controlled group of corporations are \n     treated as a single taxpayer for purposes of the $10,000 \n     limit. A controlled group of corporations for purposes of \n     section 194 is defined as under section 1563(a), except that \n     the 80-percent ownership requirement is reduced to a more \n     than 50-percent requirement. If a partnership or S \n     corporation incurs reforestation expenditures, the $10,000 \n     limit applies separately to the partnership or S corporation \n     and to each partner or shareholder. For an estate with \n     reforestation expenditures, the $10,000 limit is apportioned \n     between the estate and its beneficiaries. Section 194(b) does \n     not apply to trusts.\n       Reforestation expenditures include direct costs incurred in \n     connection with forestation or reforestation by planting or \n     artificial or natural seeding, including costs for site \n     preparation, seeds and seeding, labor and tools, and \n     depreciation on equipment used in planting or seeding. \n     Qualified timber property means a woodlot or other site \n     located in the United States which will contain trees in \n     significant commercial quantities and which is held by the \n     taxpayer for the planting, cultivating, caring for, and \n     cutting of trees for sale or use in the commercial production \n     of timber products (sec. 194(c)(1)).\n       If a taxpayer's otherwise qualifying reforestation \n     expenditures exceed the amount permitted to be expensed under \n     section 194, the remaining expenditures are amortized, and \n     the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction with respect to the \n     amortization of the amortizable basis (sec. 194(a)). \n     Reforestation expenditures qualifying for amortization are \n     deducted in 84 equal monthly installments starting with the \n     seventh month of the taxable year during which the \n     expenditures are paid or incurred. Only reforestation \n     expenditures that would otherwise be included in the basis of \n     qualified timber property qualify for expensing and, with \n     respect to amounts in excess of the $10,000 limit, for \n     amortization (however, costs that could be deducted in the \n     absence of section 194 are not required to be amortized).\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision doubles, for certain taxpayers, the present-\n     law expensing limit for reforestation expenditures paid or \n     incurred by such taxpayers (i) during the period after on or \n     August 28, 2005, and before January 1, 2008, with respect to \n     qualified timber property any portion of which is located in \n     the Gulf Opportunity Zone, (ii) during the period on or after \n     September 23, 2005, and before January 1, 2008, with respect \n     to qualified timber property any portion of which is located \n     in the Rita Zone and no portion of which is located in the \n     Gulf Opportunity Zone, and (iii) during the period on or \n     after October 23, 2005, and before January 1, 2008, with \n     respect to qualified timber property any portion of which is \n     located in the Wilma Zone. The amount by which the expensing \n     limit is increased, however, is limited to the amount of \n     reforestation expenditures paid or incurred during the \n     relevant portion of the taxable year.\n       For example, suppose an otherwise eligible calendar-year \n     taxpayer incurred $20,000 of reforestation expenditures in \n     June, 2005 (i.e., prior to the relevant period), and incurs \n     an additional $5,000 of reforestation expenditures in \n     October, 2005, in the Gulf Opportunity Zone; the taxpayer \n     would be permitted to expense $15,000 of the expenditures \n     (because the increase in the expensing limit is limited to \n     the $5,000 of expenditures paid or incurred during the \n     relevant period within the taxable year) and could amortize \n     the remaining $10,000 under section 194(a). By contrast, if \n     the taxpayer had incurred $5,000 of reforestation \n     expenditures in June, 2005, and incurs an additional $20,000 \n     of reforestation expenditures in October, 2005, then the \n     taxpayer would be permitted to expense $20,000 of the \n     expenditures, and could amortize the remaining $5,000 under \n     section 194(a).\n       The provision applies to taxpayers with aggregate holdings \n     of qualified timber property which do not exceed 500 acres at \n     any time during the taxable year. ``Qualified timber \n     property'' is defined by section 194(c)(1) as ``a woodlot or \n     other site located in the United States which will contain \n     trees in significant commercial quantities and which is held \n     by the taxpayer for the planting, cultivating, caring for, \n     and cutting of trees for sale or use in the commercial \n     production of timber products.''\n       The provision does not apply to any taxpayer which is a \n     corporation the stock of which is publicly traded on an \n     established securities market, or which is a real estate \n     investment trust.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal is effective for taxable years ending on or \n     after August 28, 2005, (i) for expenditures paid or incurred \n     on or after August 28, 2005, and before January 1, 2008, with \n     respect to qualified timber property any portion of which is \n     located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone, (ii) for expenditures \n     paid or incurred on or after September 23, 2005, and before \n     January 1, 2008, with respect to qualified timber property \n     any portion of which is located in the Rita Zone and no \n     portion of which located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone, and \n     (iii) for expenditures paid or incurred on or after October \n     23, 2005, and before January 1, 2008, with respect to \n     qualified timber property any portion of which is located in \n     the Wilma Zone.\n     11. Five-year NOL carryback of certain timber losses (new \n         sec. 1400N(i)(2) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       A net operating loss (``NOL'') is, generally, the amount by \n     which a taxpayer's business deductions exceed the taxpayer's \n     gross income. In general, an NOL may be carried back two \n     years and carried over 20 years to offset taxable income in \n     these years (sec. 172). NOLs generally are first applied to \n     the earliest of the taxable years to which the loss may be \n     carried (sec. 172(b)(2)).\n       In the case of an NOL arising from a farming loss, the NOL \n     can be carried back five years. A ``farming loss'' is defined \n     as the amount of any net operating loss attributable to a \n     farming business as defined in section 263A(e)(4). Under \n     section 263A(e)(4), a farming business includes the trade or \n     business of farming, as well as the trade or business of \n     operating a nursery or sod farm, or the raising or harvesting \n     of trees bearing fruit, nuts, or other crops, or ornamental \n     trees. It does not include the planting, cultivating, caring \n     for, holding or cutting of trees for sale or use in the \n     commercial production of timber products.\n       A farming loss cannot exceed the taxpayer's NOL for the \n     taxable year. In calculating the amount of a taxpayer's NOL \n     carrybacks, the portion of the NOL that is attributable to a \n     farming loss is treated as a separate NOL and is taken into \n     account after the remaining portion of the NOL for the \n     taxable year.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       Under the provision, for purposes of determining the \n     farming loss (if any) of certain taxpayers, income and loss \n     is treated as attributable to a farming business if such \n     income and loss is attributable to qualified timber property \n     any portion of which is located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone \n     or in the Rita GO Zone, and if such income and loss is \n     allocable to that portion of the taxpayer's taxable year \n     which is (i) on or after August 28, 2005 (for qualified \n     timber property any portion of which is located in the Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone), on or after September 23, 2005 (for \n     qualified timber property any portion of which is located in \n     the Rita GO Zone and no portion of which is located in the \n     Gulf Opportunity Zone), or on or after October 23, 2005 (for \n     qualified timber property any portion of which is located in \n     the Wilma Zone) and (ii) before January 1, 2007. ``Qualified \n     timber property'' is defined by section 194(c)(1) as ``a \n     woodlot or other site located in the United States which will \n     contain trees in significant commercial quantities and which \n     is held by the taxpayer for the planting, cultivating, caring \n     for, and cutting of trees for sale or use in the commercial \n     production of timber products.''\n       The provision applies to taxpayers with aggregate holdings \n     of qualified timber property which do not exceed 500 acres at \n     any time during the taxable year. Further, the provision only \n     applies (i) with respect to qualified timber property any \n     portion of which is located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone, if \n     the taxpayer held such property on August 28, 2005, (ii) with \n     respect to qualified timber property any portion of which is \n     located in the Rita GO Zone and no portion of which is \n     located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone, if the taxpayer held \n     such property on September 23, 2005, and (iii) with respect \n     to qualified timber property any portion of which is located \n     in the Wilma Zone, if the taxpayer held such property on \n     October 23, 2005.\n       The provision does not apply to any taxpayer which is a \n     corporation the stock of which is publicly traded on an \n     established securities market, or which is a real estate \n     investment trust.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal is effective for taxable years ending on or \n     after August 28, 2005, with respect to income and loss which \n     is allocable to that portion of the taxpayer's taxable year \n     which is (i) on or after August 28, 2005 (for qualified \n     timber property any portion of which is located in the Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone), on or after September 23, 2005 (for \n     qualified timber property any portion of which is located in \n     the Rita Zone and no portion of which is located in the Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone), or on or after October 23, 2005 (for \n     qualified timber property any portion of which is located in \n     the Wilma Zone) and (ii) before January 1, 2007.\n\n[[Page S14035]]\n\n     12. Special rule for Gulf Opportunity Zone public utility \n         casualty losses (new sec. 1400N(j) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       A net operating loss (``NOL'') is, generally, the amount by \n     which a taxpayer's allowable deductions exceed the taxpayer's \n     gross income. A carryback of an NOL generally results in the \n     refund of Federal income tax for the carryback year. A \n     carryover of an NOL reduces Federal income tax for the \n     carryover year.\n       In general, an NOL may be carried back two years and \n     carried over 20 years to offset taxable income in such years. \n     NOLs generally are first applied to the earliest of the \n     taxable years to which the loss may be carried.\n     Exceptions to the general rule\n       Different rules apply with respect to NOLs arising in \n     certain circumstances. For example, a three-year carryback \n     applies with respect to NOLs (1) arising from casualty or \n     theft losses of individuals, or (2) attributable to \n     Presidentially declared disasters for taxpayers engaged in a \n     farming business or a small business. A five-year carryback \n     period applies to NOLs from a farming loss (regardless of \n     whether the loss was incurred in a Presidentially declared \n     disaster area). Special rules also apply to real estate \n     investment trusts (no carryback), specified liability losses \n     (10-year carryback), and excess interest losses (no carryback \n     to any year preceding a corporate equity reduction \n     transaction).\n     Specified liability losses\n       The specified liability loss rules generally apply to \n     certain product liability losses and other liability losses. \n     The amount of the specified liability loss cannot exceed the \n     taxpayer's NOL for the taxable year. A specified liability \n     loss is treated as a separate NOL for the taxable year which \n     is eligible for a 10-year carryback period. Any remaining \n     portion of the taxpayer's NOL is subject to the general two-\n     year carryback period.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision provides an election for taxpayers to treat \n     any Gulf Opportunity Zone public utility casualty loss as a \n     specified liability loss to which the present-law 10-year \n     carryback period applies. A Gulf Opportunity Zone public \n     utility casualty loss is any casualty loss of public utility \n     property by reason of Hurricane Katrina which is allowed as a \n     deduction under section 165. The amount of the casualty loss \n     is reduced by the amount of any gain recognized by the \n     taxpayer from involuntary conversions of public utility \n     property located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone caused by \n     Hurricane Katrina. The total amount of specified liability \n     loss, including any amount of public utility casualty loss \n     treated as such, is limited to the amount of the taxpayer's \n     overall NOL for the taxable year as under present law. \n     Taxpayers who elect the applicability of the proposed \n     provision with respect to any loss are not eligible to also \n     treat the loss as having occurred in any prior taxable year \n     under section 165(i), nor may they include the casualty loss \n     as part of the five-year NOL carryback provided under another \n     provision of the bill.\n       For purposes of the proposed provision, public utility \n     property is defined as in section 168(i)(10) to mean, \n     generally, property used predominantly in a rate-regulated \n     trade or business of the furnishing or sale of electrical \n     energy, water, or sewage disposal services; gas or steam \n     through a local distribution system; telephone services or \n     certain other communication services; or transportation of \n     gas or steam by pipeline.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for losses arising in taxable \n     years ending on or after August 28, 2005.\n     13. Five-year NOL carryback for certain amounts related to \n         Hurricane Katrina or the Gulf Opportunity Zone (new sec. \n         1400N(k) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       A net operating loss (``NOL'') is, generally, the amount by \n     which a taxpayer's allowable deductions exceed the taxpayer's \n     gross income. A carryback of an NOL generally results in the \n     refund of Federal income tax for the carryback year. A \n     carryover of an NOL reduces Federal income tax for the \n     carryover year.\n       In general, an NOL may be carried back two years and \n     carried over 20 years to offset taxable income in such years. \n     NOLs generally are first applied to the earliest of the \n     taxable years to which the loss may be carried.\n       Different rules apply with respect to NOLs arising in \n     certain circumstances. For example, a three-year carryback \n     applies with respect to NOLs (1) arising from casualty or \n     theft losses of individuals, or (2) attributable to \n     Presidentially declared disasters for taxpayers engaged in a \n     farming business or a small business. A five-year carryback \n     period applies to NOLs from a farming loss (regardless of \n     whether the loss was incurred in a Presidentially declared \n     disaster area). Special rules also apply to real estate \n     investment trusts (no carryback), specified liability losses \n     (10-year carryback), and excess interest losses (no carryback \n     to any year preceding a corporate equity reduction \n     transaction).\n       Separately, under section 165(i), a taxpayer who incurs a \n     loss attributable to a Presidentially declared disaster may \n     elect to take such loss into account for the taxable year \n     immediately preceding the taxable year in which the disaster \n     occurred. This rule applies regardless of whether the \n     taxpayer has an overall net operating loss for the relevant \n     taxable years.\n       The alternative minimum tax rules provide that a taxpayer's \n     NOL deduction cannot reduce the taxpayer's alternative \n     minimum taxable income (``AMTI'') by more than 90 percent of \n     the AMTI. However, an NOL deduction attributable to NOL \n     carrybacks arising in taxable years ending in 2001 and 2002, \n     as well as NOL carryforwards to these taxable years, offset \n     100 percent of a taxpayer's AMTI.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n     In general\n       The provision provides a special five-year carryback period \n     for NOLs to the extent of certain specified amounts related \n     to Hurricane Katrina or the Gulf Opportunity Zone. The amount \n     of the NOL which is eligible for the five year carryback \n     (``eligible NOL'') is limited to the aggregate amount of the \n     following deductions: (i) qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone \n     casualty losses; (ii) certain moving expenses; (iii) certain \n     temporary housing expenses; (iv) depreciation deductions with \n     respect to qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone property for the \n     taxable year the property is placed in service; and (v) \n     deductions for certain repair expenses resulting from \n     Hurricane Katrina. The provision applies for losses paid or \n     incurred after August 27, 2005, and before January 1, 2008; \n     however, an irrevocable election not to apply the five-year \n     carryback under the provision may be made with respect to any \n     taxable year.\n     Qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone casualty losses\n       The amount of qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone casualty \n     losses which may be included in the eligible NOL is the \n     amount of the taxpayer's casualty losses with respect to (1) \n     property used in a trade or business, and (2) capital assets \n     held for more than one year in connection with either a trade \n     or business or a transaction entered into for profit. In \n     order for a casualty loss to qualify, the property must be \n     located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone and the loss must be \n     attributable to Hurricane Katrina. As under present law, the \n     amount of any casualty loss includes only the amount not \n     compensated for by insurance or otherwise. In addition, the \n     total amount of the casualty loss which may be included in \n     the eligible NOL is reduced by the amount of any gain \n     recognized by the taxpayer from involuntary conversions of \n     property located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone caused by \n     Hurricane Katrina.\n       To the extent that a casualty loss is included in the \n     eligible NOL and carried back under the provision, the \n     taxpayer is not eligible to also treat the loss as having \n     occurred in the prior taxable year under section 165(i). \n     Similarly, the five year carryback under the provision does \n     not apply to any loss taken into account for purposes of the \n     ten-year carryback of public utility casualty losses which is \n     provided under another provision in the bill.\n     Moving expenses\n       Certain employee moving expenses of an employer may be \n     included in the eligible NOL. In order to qualify, an amount \n     must be paid or incurred after August 27, 2005, and before \n     January 1, 2008 with respect to an employee who (i) lived in \n     the Gulf Opportunity Zone before August 28, 2005, (ii) was \n     displaced from their home either temporarily or permanently \n     as a result of Hurricane Katrina, and (iii) is employed in \n     the Gulf Opportunity Zone by the taxpayer after the expense \n     is paid or incurred.\n       For this purpose, moving expenses are defined as under \n     present law to include only the reasonable expenses of moving \n     household goods and personal effects from the former \n     residence to the new residence, and of traveling (including \n     lodging) from the former residence to the new place of \n     residence. However, for purposes of the provision, the former \n     residence and the new residence may be the same residence if \n     the employee initially vacated the residence as a result of \n     Hurricane Katrina. It is not necessary for the individual \n     with respect to whom the moving expenses are incurred to have \n     been an employee of the taxpayer at the time the expenses \n     were incurred. Thus, assuming the other requirements are met, \n     a taxpayer who pays the moving expenses of a prospective \n     employee and subsequently employs the individual in the Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone may include such expenses in the eligible \n     NOL.\n     Temporary housing expenses\n       Any deduction for expenses of an employer to temporarily \n     house employees who are employed in the Gulf Opportunity Zone \n     may be included in the eligible NOL. It is not necessary for \n     the temporary housing to be located in the Gulf Opportunity \n     Zone in order for such expenses to be included in the \n     eligible NOL; however, the employee's principal place of \n     employment with the taxpayer must be in Gulf Opportunity \n     Zone. So, for example, if a taxpayer temporarily houses an \n     employee at a location outside of the Gulf Opportunity Zone, \n     and the employee commutes into the Gulf Opportunity Zone to \n     the employee's principal place of employment, such temporary \n     housing costs will be included in the eligible NOL (assuming \n     all other requirements are met).\n     Depreciation of Gulf Opportunity Zone property\n       The eligible NOL includes the depreciation deduction (or \n     amortization deduction in lieu\n\n[[Page S14036]]\n\n     of depreciation) with respect to qualified Gulf Opportunity \n     Zone property placed in service during the year. The special \n     carryback period applies to the entire allowable depreciation \n     deduction for such property for the year in which it is \n     placed in service, including both the regular depreciation \n     deduction and the additional first-year depreciation \n     deduction, if any. An election out of the additional first-\n     year depreciation deduction for Gulf Opportunity Zone \n     property does not preclude eligibility for the five-year \n     carryback.\n     Repair expenses\n       The eligible NOL includes deductions for repair expenses \n     (including the cost of removal of debris) with respect to \n     damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. For example, expenses \n     relating to the removal of mold and other contaminants from \n     property located in the Gulf Opportunity Zone will be \n     included in the eligible NOL. In order to qualify, the amount \n     must be paid or incurred after August 27, 2005 and before \n     January 1, 2008, and the property must be located in the Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone.\n     Other rules\n       The amount of the NOL to which the five-year carryback \n     period applies is limited to the amount of the corporation's \n     overall NOL for the taxable year. Any remaining portion of \n     the taxpayer's NOL is subject to the general two-year \n     carryback period. Ordering rules similar to those for \n     specified liability losses apply to losses carried back under \n     the provision.\n       In addition, the general rule which limits a taxpayer's NOL \n     deduction to 90 percent of AMTI will not apply to any NOL to \n     which the five-year carryback period applies under the \n     provision. Instead, a taxpayer may apply such NOL carrybacks \n     to offset up to 100 percent of AMTI.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for losses arising in taxable \n     years ending on or after August 28, 2005.\n     14. Gulf Tax credit bonds (new sec. 1400N(l) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Under present law, gross income does not include interest \n     on State or local bonds (sec. 103). State and local bonds are \n     classified generally as either governmental bonds or private \n     activity bonds. Governmental bonds are bonds which are \n     primarily used to finance governmental functions or are \n     repaid with governmental funds. Private activity bonds are \n     bonds with respect to which the State or local government \n     serves as a conduit providing financing to nongovernmental \n     persons (e.g., private businesses or individuals). The \n     exclusion from income for State and local bonds does not \n     apply to private activity bonds, unless the bonds are issued \n     for certain permitted purposes (``qualified private activity \n     bonds'').\n       Generally, qualified private activity bonds are subject to \n     restrictions on the use of proceeds for the acquisition of \n     land and existing property, use of proceeds to finance \n     certain specified facilities (e.g., airplanes, skyboxes, \n     other luxury boxes, health club facilities, gambling \n     facilities, and liquor stores), and use of proceeds to pay \n     costs of issuance (e.g., bond counsel and underwriter fees). \n     Certain types of qualified private activity bonds (e.g., \n     small issue and redevelopment bonds) also are subject to \n     additional restrictions on the use of proceeds for certain \n     facilities (e.g., golf courses and massage parlors). \n     Moreover, the term of qualified private activity bonds \n     generally may not exceed 120 percent of the economic life of \n     the property being financed and certain public approval \n     requirements (similar to requirements that typically apply \n     under State law to issuance of governmental debt) apply under \n     Federal law to issuance of private activity bonds.\n     Tax-credit bonds\n       As an alternative to traditional tax-exempt bonds, States \n     and local governments may issue tax-credit bonds for limited \n     purposes. Rather than receiving interest payments, a taxpayer \n     holding a tax-credit bond on an allowance date is entitled to \n     a credit. Generally, the credit amount is includible in gross \n     income (as if it were a taxable interest payment on the \n     bond), and the credit may be claimed against regular income \n     tax and alternative minimum tax liability. Two types of tax-\n     credit bonds may be issued under present law, ``qualified \n     zone academy bonds,'' which are bonds issued for the purpose \n     of renovating, providing equipment to, developing course \n     materials for use at, or training teachers and other \n     personnel at certain school facilities, and ``clean renewable \n     energy bonds,'' which are bonds issued to finance facilities \n     that would qualify for the tax credit under section 45 \n     without regard to the placed in service date requirements of \n     that section.\n     Arbitrage restrictions on tax-exempt bonds\n       To prevent States and local governments from issuing more \n     tax-exempt bonds than is necessary for the activity being \n     financed or from issuing such bonds earlier than needed for \n     the purpose of the borrowing, the Code includes arbitrage \n     restrictions limiting the ability to profit from investment \n     of tax-exempt bond proceeds. In general, arbitrage profits \n     may be earned only during specified periods (e.g., defined \n     ``temporary periods'' before funds are needed for the purpose \n     of the borrowing) or on specified types of investments (e.g., \n     ``reasonably required reserve or replacement funds''). \n     Subject to limited exceptions, profits that are earned during \n     these periods or on such investments must be rebated to the \n     Federal Government. Governmental bonds are subject to less \n     restrictive arbitrage rules than most private activity bonds.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision creates a new category of tax-credit bonds \n     that may be issued in calendar year 2006 by the States of \n     Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama (``Gulf Tax Credit \n     Bonds''). As with present law tax-credit bonds, the taxpayer \n     holding Gulf Tax Credit Bonds on the allowance date would be \n     entitled to a tax credit. The amount of the credit would be \n     determined by multiplying the bond's credit rate by the face \n     amount on the holder's bond. The credit would be includible \n     in gross income (as if it were an interest payment on the \n     bond) and could be claimed against regular income tax \n     liability and alternative minimum tax liability.\n       Under the provision, 95 percent or more of the proceeds of \n     Gulf Tax Credit Bonds must be used to (i) pay principal, \n     interest, or premium on a bond (other than a private activity \n     bond) that was outstanding on August 28, 2005, and was issued \n     by the State issuing the Gulf Tax Credit Bonds, or any \n     political subdivision thereof, or (ii) make a loan to any \n     political subdivision of such State to pay principal, \n     interest, or premium on a bond (other than a private activity \n     bond) issued by such political subdivision. In addition, the \n     issuer of Gulf Tax Credit Bonds must provide additional funds \n     to pay principal, interest, or premium on outstanding bonds \n     equal to the amount of Gulf Tax Credit Bonds issued to repay \n     such outstanding bonds. Gulf Tax Credit Bonds must be a \n     general obligation of the issuing State and must be \n     designated by the Governor of such issuing State. The maximum \n     maturity on Gulf Tax Credit Bonds is two years. In addition, \n     present-law arbitrage rules that restrict the ability of \n     State and local governments to invest bond proceeds apply to \n     Gulf Tax Credit Bonds.\n       The maximum amount of Gulf Tax Credit Bonds that may be \n     issued pursuant to this provision is $200 million in the case \n     of Louisiana, $100 million in the case of Mississippi, and \n     $50 million in the case of Alabama. Gulf Tax Credit Bonds may \n     not be used to pay principal, interest, or premium on any \n     bond with respect to which there is any outstanding refunded \n     or refunding bond. Moreover, Gulf Tax Credit Bonds may not be \n     used to pay principal, interest, or premium on any prior bond \n     if the proceeds of such prior bond were used to provide any \n     property described in section 144(c)(6)(B) (i.e., any private \n     or commercial golf course, country club, massage parlor, hot \n     tub facility, suntan facility, racetrack or other facility \n     used for gambling, or any store the principal purpose of \n     which is the sale alcoholic beverages for consumption off \n     premises).\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for bonds issued after December \n     31, 2005 and before January 1, 2007.\n     15. Additional allocation of new markets tax credit for \n         investments that serve the Gulf Opportunity Zone (new \n         sec. 1400N(m) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Section 45D provides a new markets tax credit for qualified \n     equity investments made to acquire stock in a corporation, or \n     a capital interest in a partnership, that is a qualified \n     community development entity (``CDE''). The amount of the \n     credit allowable to the investor (either the original \n     purchaser or a subsequent holder) is (1) a five-percent \n     credit for the year in which the equity interest is purchased \n     from the CDE and for each of the following two years, and (2) \n     a six-percent credit for each of the following four years. \n     The credit is determined by applying the applicable \n     percentage (five or six percent) to the amount paid to the \n     CDE for the investment at its original issue, and is \n     available for a taxable year to the taxpayer who holds the \n     qualified equity investment on the date of the initial \n     investment or on the respective anniversary date that occurs \n     during the taxable year. The credit is recaptured if at any \n     time during the seven-year period that begins on the date of \n     the original issue of the investment the entity ceases to be \n     a qualified CDE, the proceeds of the investment cease to be \n     used as required, or the equity investment is redeemed.\n       A qualified CDE is any domestic corporation or partnership: \n     (1) whose primary mission is serving or providing investment \n     capital for low-income communities or low-income persons; (2) \n     that maintains accountability to residents of low-income \n     communities by their representation on any governing board of \n     or any advisory board to the CDE; and (3) that is certified \n     by the Secretary as being a qualified CDE. A qualified equity \n     investment means stock (other than nonqualified preferred \n     stock) in a corporation or a capital interest in a \n     partnership that is acquired directly from a CDE for cash, \n     and includes an investment of a subsequent purchaser if such \n     investment was a qualified equity investment in the hands of \n     the prior holder. Substantially all of the investment \n     proceeds must be used by the CDE to make qualified low-income \n     community investments. For this purpose, qualified low-income \n     community investments include: (1) capital or equity \n     investments in, or loans to, qualified active low-income \n     community businesses; (2) certain financial counseling and\n\n[[Page S14037]]\n\n     other services to businesses and residents in low-\n     income communities; (3) the purchase from another CDE of \n     any loan made by such entity that is a qualified low-\n     income community investment; or (4) an equity investment \n     in, or loan to, another CDE.\n       A ``low-income community'' is a population census tract \n     with either (1) a poverty rate of at least 20 percent or (2) \n     median family income which does not exceed 80 percent of the \n     greater of metropolitan area median family income or \n     statewide median family income (for a non-metropolitan census \n     tract, does not exceed 80 percent of statewide median family \n     income). In the case of a population census tract located \n     within a high migration rural county, low-income is defined \n     by reference to 85 percent (rather than 80 percent) of \n     statewide median family income. For this purpose, a high \n     migration rural county is any county that, during the 20-year \n     period ending with the year in which the most recent census \n     was conducted, has a net out-migration of inhabitants from \n     the county of at least 10 percent of the population of the \n     county at the beginning of such period.\n       The Secretary has the authority to designate ``targeted \n     populations'' as low-income communities for purposes of the \n     new markets tax credit. For this purpose, a ``targeted \n     population'' is defined by reference to section 103(20) of \n     the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement \n     Act of 1994 (12 U.S.C. 4702(20)) to mean individuals, or an \n     identifiable group of individuals, including an Indian tribe, \n     who (A) are low-income persons; or (B) otherwise lack \n     adequate access to loans or equity investments. Under such \n     Act, ``low-income'' means (1) for a targeted population \n     within a metropolitan area, less than 80 percent of the area \n     median family income; and (2) for a targeted population \n     within a non-metropolitan area, less than the greater of 80 \n     percent of the area median family income or 80 percent of the \n     statewide non-metropolitan area median family income (12 \n     U.S.C. 4702(17)). Under such Act, a targeted population is \n     not required to be within any census tract. In addition, a \n     population census tract with a population of less than 2,000 \n     is treated as a low-income community for purposes of the \n     credit if such tract is within an empowerment zone, the \n     designation of which is in effect under section 1391, and is \n     contiguous to one or more low-income communities.\n       A qualified active low-income community business is defined \n     as a business that satisfies, with respect to a taxable year, \n     the following requirements: (1) at least 50 percent of the \n     total gross income of the business is derived from the active \n     conduct of trade or business activities in any low-income \n     community; (2) a substantial portion of the tangible property \n     of such business is used in a low-income community; (3) a \n     substantial portion of the services performed for such \n     business by its employees is performed in a low-income \n     community; and (4) less than five percent of the average of \n     the aggregate unadjusted bases of the property of such \n     business is attributable to certain financial property or to \n     certain collectibles.\n       The maximum annual amount of qualified equity investments \n     is capped at $2.0 billion per year for calendar years 2004 \n     and 2005, and at $3.5 billion per year for calendar years \n     2006 and 2007.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision allows an additional allocation of the new \n     markets tax credit in an amount equal to $300,000,000 for \n     2005 and 2006, and $400,000,000 for 2007, to be allocated \n     among qualified CDEs to make qualified low-income community \n     investments within the Gulf Opportunity Zone. To qualify for \n     any such allocation, a qualified CDE must have as a \n     significant mission the recovery and redevelopment of the \n     Gulf Opportunity Zone. The carryover of any unused additional \n     allocation is applied separately from the carryover with \n     respect to allocations made under present law.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal is effective on the date of enactment.\n     16. Representations regarding income eligibility for purposes \n         of qualified residential rental project requirements (new \n         sec. 1400N(n) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Under present law, gross income does not include interest \n     on State or local bonds (sec. 103). State and local bonds are \n     classified generally as either governmental bonds or private \n     activity bonds. Governmental bonds are bonds which are \n     primarily used to finance governmental functions or are \n     repaid with governmental funds. Private activity bonds are \n     bonds with respect to which the State or local government \n     serves as a conduit providing financing to nongovernmental \n     persons (e.g., private businesses or individuals). The \n     exclusion from income for State and local bonds does not \n     apply to private activity bonds, unless the bonds are issued \n     for certain permitted purposes (``qualified private activity \n     bonds'').\n     Qualified private activity bonds\n       The definition of a qualified private activity bond \n     includes an exempt facility bond, or qualified mortgage, \n     veterans' mortgage, small issue, redevelopment, 501(c)(3), or \n     student loan bond. The definition of exempt facility bond \n     includes bonds issued to finance certain transportation \n     facilities (airports, ports, mass commuting, and high-speed \n     intercity rail facilities); qualified residential rental \n     projects; privately owned and/or operated utility facilities \n     (sewage, water, solid waste disposal, and local district \n     heating and cooling facilities, certain private electric and \n     gas facilities, and hydroelectric dam enhancements); public/\n     private educational facilities; qualified green building and \n     sustainable design projects; and qualified highway or surface \n     freight transfer facilities.\n       Subject to certain requirements, qualified private activity \n     bonds may be issued to finance residential rental property or \n     owner-occupied housing. Residential rental property may be \n     financed with exempt facility bonds if the financed project \n     is a ``qualified residential rental project.'' A project is a \n     qualified residential rental project if 20 percent or more of \n     the residential units in such project are occupied by \n     individuals whose income is 50 percent or less of area median \n     gross income (the ``20-50 test''). Alternatively, a project \n     is a qualified residential rental project if 40 percent or \n     more of the residential units in such project are occupied by \n     individuals whose income is 60 percent or less of area median \n     gross income (the ``40-60 test''). The issuer must elect to \n     apply either the 20-50 test or the 40-60 test. Operators of \n     qualified residential rental projects must annually certify \n     that such project meets the requirements for \n     qualification, including meeting the 20-50 test or the 40-\n     60 test.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       Under the provision, the operator of a qualified \n     residential rental project may rely on the representations of \n     prospective tenants displaced by reason of Hurricane Katrina \n     for purposes of determining whether such individual satisfies \n     the income limitations for qualified residential rental \n     projects and, thus, the project is in compliance with the 20-\n     50 test or the 40-60 test. (For a description of \n     modifications to the 20-50 test and the 40-60 test for \n     qualified residential rental projects financed in the GO \n     Zone, see I.A.2. Tax-exempt financing for the Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone, above).\n       This rule only applies if the individual's tenancy begins \n     during the six-month period beginning on the date when such \n     individual was displaced by Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.\n     17. Treatment of public utility disaster losses (new sec. \n         1400N(o) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under section 165(i), certain losses attributable to a \n     disaster occurring in a Presidentially declared disaster area \n     may, at the election of the taxpayer, be taken into account \n     for the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year \n     in which the disaster occurred.\n       Section 6411 provides a procedure under which taxpayers may \n     apply for tentative carryback and refund adjustments with \n     respect to net operating losses, net capital losses, and \n     unused business credits.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision provides an election for taxpayers who \n     incurred casualty losses attributable to Hurricane Katrina \n     with respect to public utility property located in the Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone. Under the election, such losses may be \n     taken into account in the fifth taxable year (rather than the \n     1st taxable year) immediately preceding the taxable year in \n     which the loss occurred. If the application of this provision \n     results in the creation or increase of a net operating loss \n     for the year in which the casualty loss is taken into \n     account, the net operating loss may be carried back or \n     carried over as under present law applicable to net operating \n     losses for such year.\n       For this purpose, public utility property is property used \n     predominantly in the trade or business of the furnishing or \n     sale of electrical energy, water, or sewage disposal \n     services; gas or steam through a local distribution system; \n     telephone services, or other communication services if \n     furnished or sold by the Communications Satellite Corporation \n     for purposes authorized by the Communications Satellite Act \n     of 1962; or transportation of gas or steam by pipeline. Such \n     property is eligible regardless of whether the taxpayer's \n     rates are established or approved by any regulatory body.\n       A taxpayer making the election under the provision is \n     eligible to file an application for a tentative carryback \n     adjustment of the tax for any prior taxable year affected by \n     the election. As under present law with respect to tentative \n     carryback and refund adjustments, the IRS generally has 90 \n     days to act on the refund claim. Under the provision, the \n     statute of limitations with respect to such a claim can not \n     expire earlier than one year after the date of enactment. \n     Also, a taxpayer making the election with respect to a loss \n     is not entitled to interest with respect to any overpayment \n     attributable to the loss.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years ending on or \n     after August 28, 2005.\n     18. Tax benefits not available with respect to certain \n         property (new sec. 1400N of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under present law, specific tax benefits do not apply with \n     respect to certain types of property. For example, private \n     activity bonds are subject to restrictions on the use of \n     proceeds for the acquisition of land and existing property, \n     use of proceeds to finance\n\n[[Page S14038]]\n\n     certain specified facilities (e.g., airplanes, skyboxes, \n     other luxury boxes, health club facilities, gambling \n     facilities, and liquor stores), and use of proceeds to pay \n     costs of issuance (e.g., bond counsel and underwriter fees). \n     Small issue and redevelopment bonds also are subject to \n     additional restrictions on the use of proceeds for certain \n     facilities (e.g., golf courses and massage parlors).\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provisions relating to additional first-year \n     depreciation, increased expensing under section 179, and the \n     five-year carryback of NOLs attributable to casualty losses, \n     depreciation, or amortization otherwise provided under new \n     Code section 1400N do not apply with respect to certain \n     property. Specifically, the provisions do not apply with \n     respect to any private or commercial golf course, country \n     club, massage parlor, hot tub facility, suntan facility, or \n     any store the principal business of which is the sale of \n     alcoholic beverages for consumption off premises. The \n     provisions also do not apply with respect to any gambling or \n     animal racing property.\n       For this purpose, gambling or animal racing property \n     includes certain personal property and certain real property. \n     Personal property treated as gambling or animal racing \n     property is any equipment, furniture, software, or other \n     property used directly in connection with gambling, the \n     racing of animals, or the on-site (i.e., at the racetrack) \n     viewing of such racing. Real property treated as gambling or \n     animal racing property is the portion of any real property \n     (determined by square footage) that is dedicated to gambling, \n     the racing of animals, or the on-site viewing of such racing \n     (except if the portion so dedicated is less than 100 square \n     feet). For example, the additional first-year depreciation \n     for a building which is used as both a casino and a hotel \n     (and which otherwise qualifies for additional first-year \n     depreciation under the bill) is determined without regard to \n     the portion of the building's basis which bears the same \n     percentage to the total basis as the percentage of square \n     footage dedicated to gambling (i.e., the casino floor) \n     bears to total square footage of the building.\n       No apportionment calculation is required with respect to \n     real property which meets the 100-square-foot de minimis \n     exception. Thus, for example, no apportionment calculation is \n     required in the case of a retail store that sells lottery \n     tickets in a less-than-100-square-foot area, nor in the case \n     of an establishment that, while not a casino, contains a \n     small number of gaming machines and devices in an area or \n     areas whose aggregate size is less than 100 square feet.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years ending on or \n     after August 28, 2005, except that the inapplicability of the \n     five-year carryback of NOLs attributable to casualty losses, \n     depreciation, or amortization, is effective for losses \n     arising in such years.\n     19. Expansion of Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning \n         Credit for students in the Gulf Opportunity Zone (new \n         sec. 1400O of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     Hope credit\n       The Hope credit (sec. 25A) is a nonrefundable credit of up \n     to $1,500 per student per year for qualified tuition and \n     related expenses paid for the first two years of the \n     student's post-secondary education in a degree or certificate \n     program. The Hope credit rate is 100 percent on the first \n     $1,000 of qualified tuition and related expenses, and 50 \n     percent on the next $1,000 of qualified tuition and related \n     expenses. The Hope credit that a taxpayer may otherwise claim \n     is phased out ratably for taxpayers with modified adjusted \n     gross income between $43,000 and $53,000 ($87,000 and \n     $107,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return) for \n     2005. These adjusted gross income phase-out ranges are \n     indexed for inflation. Also, each of the $1,000 amounts of \n     qualified tuition and related expenses to which the 100-\n     percent credit rate and 50 percent credit rate apply are \n     indexed for inflation, with the amount rounded down to the \n     next lowest multiple of $100. The first adjustment to these \n     qualified expense amounts as a result of inflation is \n     expected in 2006. The Hope credit generally may not be \n     claimed against a taxpayer's alternative minimum tax \n     liability. However, the credit may be claimed against a \n     taxpayer's alternative minimum tax liability for taxable \n     years beginning prior to January 1, 2006.\n       The qualified tuition and related expenses must be incurred \n     on behalf of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or a \n     dependent of the taxpayer. The Hope credit is available with \n     respect to an individual student for two taxable years, \n     provided that the student has not completed the first two \n     years of post-secondary education before the beginning of the \n     second taxable year.\n       In addition, for each taxable year, a taxpayer may elect \n     either the Hope credit, the Lifetime Learning credit \n     (described below), or the deduction for qualified tuition and \n     related expenses (sec. 222) with respect to an eligible \n     student.\n       The Hope credit is available for ``qualified tuition and \n     related expenses,'' which include tuition and fees (excluding \n     nonacademic fees) required to be paid to an eligible \n     educational institution as a condition of enrollment or \n     attendance of an eligible student at the institution. Charges \n     and fees associated with meals, lodging, insurance, \n     transportation, and similar personal, living, or family \n     expenses are not eligible for the credit. The expenses of \n     education involving sports, games, or hobbies are not \n     qualified tuition and related expenses unless this education \n     is part of the student's degree program. Total qualified \n     tuition and related expenses are reduced by any scholarship \n     or fellowship grants excludable from gross income under \n     section 117 and any other tax-free educational benefits \n     received by the student (or the taxpayer claiming the credit) \n     during the taxable year. The Hope credit is not allowed with \n     respect to any education expense for which a deduction is \n     claimed under section 162 or any other section of the Code.\n       An eligible student for purposes of the Hope credit is an \n     individual who is enrolled in a degree, certificate, or other \n     program (including a program of study abroad approved for \n     credit by the institution at which such student is enrolled) \n     leading to a recognized educational credential at an eligible \n     educational institution. The student must pursue a course of \n     study on at least a half-time basis. A student is considered \n     to pursue a course of study on at least a half-time basis \n     if the student carries at least one half the normal full-\n     time work load for the course of study the student is \n     pursuing for at least one academic period that begins \n     during the taxable year. To be eligible for the Hope \n     credit, a student must not have been convicted of a \n     Federal or State felony consisting of the possession or \n     distribution of a controlled substance.\n       For taxable years beginning in 2004 and 2005, the Hope \n     credit offsets the alternative minimum tax. For taxable years \n     thereafter, the Hope credit does not offset the alternative \n     minimum tax.\n       Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2010, the changes to the Hope credit made by EGTRRA no longer \n     apply. The EGTRRA change scheduled to expire is the change \n     that permitted a taxpayer to claim a Hope credit in the same \n     year that he or she claimed an exclusion from an education \n     savings account. Thus, after 2010, a taxpayer cannot claim a \n     Hope credit in the same year he or she claims an exclusion \n     from an education savings account.\n     Lifetime Learning credit\n       Individual taxpayers are allowed to claim a nonrefundable \n     credit, the Lifetime Learning credit, equal to 20 percent of \n     qualified tuition and related expenses incurred during the \n     taxable year on behalf of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's \n     spouse, or any dependents (Sec. 25A). Up to $10,000 of \n     qualified tuition and related expenses per taxpayer return \n     are eligible for the Lifetime Learning credit (i.e., the \n     maximum credit per taxpayer return is $2,000). In contrast \n     with the Hope credit, the maximum credit amount is not \n     indexed for inflation. The Lifetime Learning credit generally \n     may not be claimed against a taxpayer's alternative minimum \n     tax liability. However, the credit may be claimed against a \n     taxpayer's alternative minimum tax liability for taxable \n     years beginning prior to January 1, 2006.\n       In contrast to the Hope credit, a taxpayer may claim the \n     Lifetime Learning credit for an unlimited number of taxable \n     years. Also in contrast to the Hope credit, the maximum \n     amount of the Lifetime Learning credit that may be claimed on \n     a taxpayer's return will not vary based on the number of \n     students in the taxpayer's family--that is, the Hope credit \n     is computed on a per student basis, while the Lifetime \n     Learning credit is computed on a family-wide basis. The \n     Lifetime Learning credit amount that a taxpayer may otherwise \n     claim is phased out ratably for taxpayers with modified \n     adjusted gross income between $43,000 and $53,000 ($87,000 \n     and $107,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return) for \n     2005. These phaseout ranges are the same as those for the \n     Hope credit, and are similarly indexed for inflation.\n       A taxpayer may claim the Lifetime Learning credit for a \n     taxable year with respect to one or more students, even \n     though the taxpayer also claims a Hope credit for that same \n     taxable year with respect to other students. If, for a \n     taxable year, a taxpayer claims a Hope credit with respect to \n     a student, then the Lifetime Learning credit is not available \n     with respect to that same student for that year (although the \n     Lifetime Learning credit may be available with respect to \n     that same student for other taxable years). As with the Hope \n     credit, a taxpayer may not claim the Lifetime Learning credit \n     and also claim the section 222 deduction for qualified \n     tuition and related expenses (described below).\n       As with the Hope credit, the Lifetime Learning credit is \n     available for ``qualified tuition and related expenses,'' \n     which include tuition and fees (excluding nonacademic fees) \n     required to be paid to an eligible educational institution as \n     a condition of enrollment or attendance of a student at the \n     institution. Eligible higher education institutions are \n     defined in the same manner for purposes of both the Hope and \n     Lifetime Learning credits. Charges and fees associated with \n     meals, lodging, insurance, transportation, and similar \n     personal, living or family expenses are not eligible for the \n     credit. The expenses of education involving sports, games, or \n     hobbies are not qualified tuition expenses unless this \n     education is part of the student's degree program, or the \n     education is undertaken to acquire or improve the job skills \n     of the student.\n       In contrast to the Hope credit, qualified tuition and \n     related expenses for purposes of the Lifetime Learning credit \n     include tuition and fees incurred with respect to \n     undergraduate or graduate-level courses (as explained above, \n     the Hope credit is available\n\n[[Page S14039]]\n\n     only with respect to the first two years of a student's \n     undergraduate education). Additionally, in contrast to the \n     Hope credit, the eligibility of a student for the Lifetime \n     Learning credit does not depend on whether the student has \n     been convicted of a Federal or State felony consisting of the \n     possession or distribution of a controlled substance.\n       As under the Hope credit, total qualified tuition and fees \n     are reduced by any scholarship or fellowship grants \n     excludable from gross income under section 117 and any other \n     tax-free educational benefits received by the student during \n     the taxable year (such as employer-provided educational \n     assistance excludable under section 127). The Lifetime \n     Learning credit is not allowed with respect to any education \n     expense for which a deduction is claimed under section 162 or \n     any other section of the Code.\n       For taxable years beginning in 2004 and 2005, the Lifetime \n     Learning credit offsets the alternative minimum tax. For \n     taxable years thereafter, the credit does not offset the \n     alternative minimum tax.\n       Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2010, the changes to the Lifetime Learning credit made by \n     EGTRRA no longer apply. The EGTRRA change scheduled to expire \n     is the change that permitted a taxpayer to claim a Lifetime \n     Learning credit in the same year that he or she claimed an \n     exclusion from an education savings account. Thus, after \n     2010, taxpayers cannot claim a Lifetime Learning credit in \n     the same year he or she claims an exclusion from an education \n     savings account.\n     Definition of qualified higher education expenses for \n         purposes of qualified tuition programs\n       Present law provides favorable tax treatment for qualified \n     tuition programs that meet the requirements of section 529 of \n     the Code. For purposes of the rules relating to qualified \n     tuition programs, ``qualified higher education expenses'' \n     means tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment required \n     for the enrollment or attendance at an eligible educational \n     institution and expenses for special needs services in the \n     case of a special needs beneficiary which are incurred in \n     connection with such enrollment or attendance. In addition, \n     in the case of at least half-time students, qualified higher \n     education expenses include certain room and board expenses.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision temporarily expands the Hope and Lifetime \n     Learning credits for students attending (i.e., enrolled and \n     paying tuition at) an eligible education institution located \n     in the Gulf Opportunity Zone.\n       Under the provision, the Hope credit is increased to 100 \n     percent of the first $2,000 in qualified tuition and related \n     expenses and 50 percent of the next $2,000 of qualified \n     tuition and related expenses for a maximum credit of $3,000 \n     per student. The Lifetime Learning credit rate is increased \n     from 20 percent to 40 percent. The provision expands the \n     definition of qualified expenses to mean qualified higher \n     education expenses as defined under the rules relating to \n     qualified tuition programs, including certain room and board \n     expenses for at least half-time students.\n       The provision applies to taxable years beginning in 2005 or \n     2006.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.\n     20. Housing relief for individuals affected by Hurricane \n         Katrina (new sec. 1400P of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under present law, employer-provided housing is generally \n     includible in income as compensation and is wages for \n     purposes of social security and Medicare taxes and \n     unemployment tax (secs. 61, 3121(a), 3306(b)). Present law \n     provides an income and wage exclusion for the value of \n     lodging furnished to an employee, the employee's spouse, or \n     the employee's dependents by or on behalf of the employee's \n     employer, but generally only if the employee is required to \n     accept the lodging on the business premises of the employer \n     as a condition of employment (secs. 119, 3121(a)(19), and \n     3306(b)(14)). Reasonable expenses for employee compensation \n     are deductible by the employer (sec. 162(a)).\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision provides a temporary income exclusion for the \n     value of in-kind lodging provided for a month to a qualified \n     employee (and the employee's spouse or dependents) by or on \n     behalf of a qualified employer. The amount of the exclusion \n     for any month for which lodging is furnished cannot exceed \n     $600. The exclusion does not apply for purposes of social \n     security and Medicare taxes or unemployment tax.\n       The provision also provides a temporary credit to a \n     qualified employer of 30 percent of the value of lodging \n     excluded from the income of a qualified employee under the \n     provision. The amount taken as a credit is not deductible by \n     the employer.\n       Qualified employee means, with respect to a month, an \n     individual who: (1) on August 28, 2005, had a principal \n     residence in the Gulf Opportunity (``GO'') Zone; and (2) \n     performs substantially all of his or her employment services \n     in the GO Zone for the qualified employer furnishing the \n     lodging. Qualified employer means any employer with a trade \n     or business located in the GO Zone.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision applies to lodging provided during the period \n     beginning on the first day of the first month beginning after \n     the date of enactment and ending on the date that is six \n     months after such first day.\n     21. Special rules for mortgage revenue bonds (sec. 404 of the \n         Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Under present law, gross income does not include interest \n     on State or local bonds (sec. 103). State and local bonds are \n     classified generally as either governmental bonds or private \n     activity bonds. Governmental bonds are bonds which are \n     primarily used to finance governmental functions or are \n     repaid with governmental funds. Private activity bonds are \n     bonds with respect to which the State or local government \n     serves as a conduit providing financing to nongovernmental \n     persons (e.g., private businesses or individuals). The \n     exclusion from income for State and local bonds does not \n     apply to private activity bonds, unless the bonds are issued \n     for certain permitted purposes (``qualified private activity \n     bonds'') (secs. 103(b)(1) and 141).\n     Qualified mortgage bonds\n       The definition of a qualified private activity bond \n     includes a qualified mortgage bond (sec. 143). Qualified \n     mortgage bonds are issued to make mortgage loans to qualified \n     mortgagors for the purchase, improvement, or rehabilitation \n     of owner-occupied residences. The Code imposes several \n     limitations on qualified mortgage bonds, including income \n     limitations for eligible mortgagors, purchase price \n     limitations on the home financed with bond proceeds, and a \n     ``first-time homebuyer'' requirement. The income limitations \n     are satisfied if all financing provided by an issue is \n     provided for mortgagors whose family income does not exceed \n     115 percent of the median family income for the metropolitan \n     area or State, whichever is greater, in which the financed \n     residences are located. The purchase price limitations \n     provide that a residence financed with qualified mortgage \n     bonds may not have a purchase price in excess of 90 percent \n     of the average area purchase price for that residence. The \n     first-time homebuyer requirement provides qualified mortgage \n     bonds generally cannot be used to finance a mortgage for a \n     homebuyer who had an ownership interest in a principal \n     residence in the three years preceding the execution of the \n     mortgage (the ``first-time homebuyer'' requirement).\n       Special income and purchase price limitations apply to \n     targeted area residences. A targeted area residence is one \n     located in either (1) a census tract in which at least 70 \n     percent of the families have an income which is 80 percent or \n     less of the state-wide median income or (2) an area of \n     chronic economic distress. For targeted area residences, the \n     income limitation is satisfied when no more than one-third of \n     the mortgages are made without regard to any income limits \n     and the remainder of the mortgages are made to mortgagors \n     whose family income is 140 percent or less of the \n     applicable median family income. The purchase price \n     limitation is raised from 90 percent to 110 percent of the \n     average area purchase price for targeted area residences. \n     In addition, the first-time homebuyer requirement does not \n     apply to targeted area residences.\n       Qualified mortgage bonds also may be used to finance \n     qualified home-improvement loans. Qualified home-improvement \n     loans are defined as loans to finance alterations, repairs, \n     and improvements on an existing residence, but only if such \n     alterations, repairs, and improvements substantially protect \n     or improve the basic livability or energy efficiency of the \n     property. Qualified home-improvement loans may not exceed \n     $15,000.\n       A temporary provision waived the first-time homebuyer \n     requirement for residences located in certain Presidentially \n     declared disaster areas (sec. 143(k)(11)). In addition, \n     residences located in such areas were treated as targeted \n     area residences for purposes of the income and purchase price \n     limitations. The special rule for residences located in \n     Presidentially declared disaster areas does not apply to \n     bonds issued after January 1, 1999.\n       The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act (``KETRA'') waives the \n     first-time homebuyer requirement with respect to certain \n     residences located in an area with respect to which a major \n     disaster has been declared by the President before September \n     14, 2005, under section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford \n     Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act by reason of \n     Hurricane Katrina (see sec. 404 of Pub. L. No. 109-73). The \n     waiver of the first-time homebuyer requirement does not apply \n     to financing provided after December 31, 2007. KETRA also \n     increases to $150,000 the permitted amount of a qualified \n     home-improvement loan with respect to residences located in \n     the Hurricane Katrina disaster area to the extent such loan \n     is for the repair of damage caused by Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The proposal extends the waiver of the first-time homebuyer \n     requirement provided by KETRA to financing provided through \n     December 31, 2010.\n       (For a description of additional mortgage revenue bond \n     rules applicable to the GO Zone, the Rita GO Zone and the \n     Wilma GO Zone, see II.H--Special Rules for Mortgage Revenue \n     Bonds, below)\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.\n\n[[Page S14040]]\n\n     22. Treasury authority to grant bonus depreciation placed-in-\n         service date relief (sec. 168(k) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       A taxpayer is allowed to recover, through annual \n     depreciation deductions, the cost of certain property used in \n     a trade or business or for the production of income. The \n     amount of the depreciation deduction allowed with respect to \n     tangible property for a taxable year is determined under the \n     modified accelerated cost recovery system (``MACRS''). Under \n     MACRS, different types of property generally are assigned \n     applicable recovery periods and depreciation methods. The \n     recovery periods applicable to most tangible personal \n     property range from three to 25 years. The depreciation \n     methods generally applicable to tangible personal property \n     are the 200-percent and 150-percent declining balance \n     methods, switching to the straight-line method for the \n     taxable year in which the depreciation deduction would be \n     maximized.\n     Additional first year depreciation deduction\n       Sec. 168(k) allows an additional first-year depreciation \n     deduction equal to 30 percent or 50 percent of the adjusted \n     basis of qualified property. In order for property to qualify \n     for the additional first-year depreciation deduction, it must \n     meet all of the following requirements. First, the property \n     must be (1) property to which MACRS applies with an \n     applicable recovery period of 20 years or less, (2) water \n     utility property (as defined in section 168(e)(5)), (3) \n     computer software other than computer software covered by \n     section 197, or (4) qualified leasehold improvement property \n     (as defined in section 168(k)(3)). Second, the original use \n     (the first use to which the property is put, whether or not \n     such use corresponds to the use of such property by the \n     taxpayer) of the property must commence with the taxpayer on \n     or after September 11, 2001. Third, the taxpayer must acquire \n     the property within the applicable time period. Finally, the \n     property must be placed in service before January 1, 2005.\n       An extension of the placed-in-service date of one year \n     (i.e., January 1, 2006) is provided for certain property with \n     a recovery period of ten years or longer and certain \n     transportation property. In order for property to qualify for \n     the extended placed-in-service date, the property must be \n     subject to section 263A and have an estimated production \n     period exceeding two years or an estimated production period \n     exceeding one year and a cost exceeding $1 million. \n     Transportation property is defined as tangible personal \n     property used in the trade or business of transporting \n     persons or property.\n       The applicable time period for acquired property is (1) \n     after September 10, 2001, and before January 1, 2005, but \n     only if no binding written contract for the acquisition is in \n     effect before September 11, 2001, or (2) pursuant to a \n     binding written contract which was entered into after \n     September 10, 2001, and before January 1, 2005. With respect \n     to property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced by \n     the taxpayer for use by the taxpayer, the taxpayer must begin \n     the manufacture, construction, or production of the property \n     after September 10, 2001. For property eligible for the \n     extended placed-in-service date, a special rule limits the \n     amount of costs eligible for the additional first year \n     depreciation. With respect to such property, only the portion \n     of the basis that is properly attributable to the costs \n     incurred before January 1, 2005 (``progress \n     expenditures'') is eligible for the additional first-year \n     depreciation. For purposes of determining the amount of \n     eligible progress expenditures, rules similar to sec. \n     46(d)(3) as in effect prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 \n     apply.\n       In addition, certain non-commercial aircraft can qualify \n     for the extended placed-inservice date. Qualifying aircraft \n     are eligible for the additional first-year depreciation \n     deduction if placed in service before January 1, 2006. In \n     order to qualify, the aircraft must:\n       1. be acquired by the taxpayer during the applicable time \n     period as under present law;\n       2. meet the appropriate placed-in-service date \n     requirements;\n       3. not be tangible personal property used in the trade or \n     business of transporting persons or property (except for \n     agricultural or firefighting purposes);\n       4. be purchased by a purchaser who, at the time of the \n     contract for purchase, has made a nonrefundable deposit of \n     the lesser of ten percent of the cost or $100,000; and\n       5. have an estimated production period exceeding four \n     months and a cost exceeding $200,000.\n       Aircraft qualifying under these rules are not subject to \n     the progress expenditures limitation.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision provides the Secretary with authority to \n     further extend the placed-inservice date (beyond December 31, \n     2005), on a case-by-case basis, for certain property eligible \n     for the December 31, 2005 placed-in-service date under \n     present law. The authority extends only to property placed in \n     service or manufactured in the Gulf Opportunity Zone, the \n     Rita GO Zone, or the Wilma GO Zone. In addition, the \n     authority extends only to circumstances in which the taxpayer \n     was unable to meet the December 31, 2005 deadline as a result \n     of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and/or Wilma. The extension \n     should be only for such additional time as is required as a \n     result of the hurricane(s) and in no case should extend the \n     deadline beyond December 31, 2006.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision applies to property placed in service on or \n     after August 28, 2005, in taxable years ending on or after \n     such date.\n\n      TITLE II--TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO HURRICANES RITA AND WILMA\n\n   A. Special Rules for Use of Retirement Funds (new Code sec. 1400Q)\n\n     1. Tax-favored withdrawals from retirement plans relating to \n         Hurricanes Rita and Wilma\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Under present law, a distribution from a qualified \n     retirement plan under section 401(a), a qualified annuity \n     plan under section 403(a), a tax-sheltered annuity under \n     section 403(b) (a ``403(b) annuity''), an eligible deferred \n     compensation plan maintained by a State or local government \n     under section 457 (a ``governmental 457 plan''), or an \n     individual retirement arrangement under section 408 (an \n     ``IRA'') generally is included in income for the year \n     distributed (secs. 402(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408(d), and \n     457(a)). (These plans are referred to collectively as \n     ``eligible retirement plans''.) In addition, a distribution \n     from a qualified retirement or annuity plan, a 403(b) \n     annuity, or an IRA received before age 59\\1/2\\, death, or \n     disability generally is subject to a 10-percent early \n     withdrawal tax on the amount includible in income, unless an \n     exception applies (sec. 72(t)).\n       An eligible rollover distribution from a qualified \n     retirement or annuity plan, a 403(b) annuity, or a \n     governmental 457 plan, or a distribution from an IRA, \n     generally can be rolled over within 60 days to another plan, \n     annuity, or IRA. The IRS has the authority to waive the 60-\n     day requirement if failure to waive the requirement would be \n     against equity or good conscience, including cases of \n     casualty, disaster, or other events beyond the reasonable \n     control of the individual. Any amount rolled over is not \n     includible in income (and thus also not subject to the 10-\n     percent early withdrawal tax).\n       Distributions from a qualified retirement or annuity plan, \n     403(b) annuity, a governmental 457 plan, or an IRA are \n     generally subject to income tax withholding unless the \n     recipient elects otherwise. An eligible rollover distribution \n     from a qualified retirement or annuity plan, 403(b) annuity, \n     or governmental 457 plan is subject to income tax withholding \n     at a 20-percent rate unless the distribution is rolled over \n     to another plan, annuity or IRA by means of a direct \n     transfer.\n       Certain amounts held in a qualified retirement plan that \n     includes a qualified cash-or-deferred arrangement (a ``401(k) \n     plan'') or in a 403(b) annuity may not be distributed before \n     severance from employment, age 59\\1/2\\, death, disability, or \n     financial hardship of the employee. Amounts deferred under a \n     governmental 457 plan may not be distributed before severance \n     from employment, age 70\\1/2\\, or an unforeseeable emergency \n     of the employee.\n     Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005\n       The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 (Public Law \n     109-73) provides an exception to the 10-percent early \n     withdrawal tax in the case of a qualified Hurricane \n     Katrina distribution from a qualified retirement or \n     annuity plan, a 403(b) annuity, or an IRA. In addition, as \n     discussed more fully below, income attributable to a \n     qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution may be included \n     in income ratably over three years, and the amount of a \n     qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution may be \n     recontributed to an eligible retirement plan within three \n     years.\n       A qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution is a \n     distribution from an eligible retirement plan made on or \n     after August 25, 2005, and before January 1, 2007, to an \n     individual whose principal place of abode on August 28, 2005, \n     is located in the Hurricane Katrina disaster area and who has \n     sustained an economic loss by reason of Hurricane Katrina. \n     The total amount of qualified Hurricane Katrina distributions \n     that an individual can receive from all plans, annuities, or \n     IRAs is $100,000. Thus, any distributions in excess of \n     $100,000 during the applicable period are not qualified \n     Hurricane Katrina distributions.\n       Any amount required to be included in income as a result of \n     a qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution is included in \n     income ratably over the three-year period beginning with the \n     year of distribution unless the individual elects not to have \n     ratable inclusion apply. Certain rules apply for purposes of \n     the ratable inclusion provision. For example, the amount \n     required to be included in income for any taxable year in the \n     three-year period cannot exceed the total amount to be \n     included in income with respect to the qualified Hurricane \n     Katrina distribution, reduced by amounts included in income \n     for preceding years in the period.\n       Any portion of a qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution \n     may, at any time during the three-year period beginning the \n     day after the date on which the distribution was received, be \n     recontributed to an eligible retirement plan to which a \n     rollover can be made. Any amount recontributed within the \n     three-year period is treated as a rollover and thus is not \n     includible in income. For example, if an individual receives \n     a qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution in 2005, that \n     amount is included in income, generally ratably over the year \n     of the distribution and the following two years, but is not \n     subject to the 10-percent early withdrawal tax. If, in 2007, \n     the amount of the qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution is \n     recontributed to an eligible retirement plan, the individual \n     may\n\n[[Page S14041]]\n\n     file an amended return (or returns) to claim a refund of the \n     tax attributable to the amount previously included in income. \n     In addition, if, under the ratable inclusion provision, a \n     portion of the distribution has not yet been included in \n     income at the time of the contribution, the remaining amount \n     is not includible in income.\n       A qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution is a permissible \n     distribution from a 401(k) plan, 403(b) annuity, or \n     governmental 457 plan, regardless of whether a distribution \n     would otherwise be permissible. A plan is not treated as \n     violating any Code requirement merely because it treats a \n     distribution as a qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution, \n     provided that the aggregate amount of such distributions from \n     plans maintained by the employer and members of the \n     employer's controlled group does not exceed $100,000. Thus, a \n     plan is not treated as violating any Code requirement merely \n     because an individual might receive total distributions in \n     excess of $100,000, taking into account distributions from \n     plans of other employers or IRAs.\n       Qualified Hurricane Katrina distributions are subject to \n     the income tax withholding rules applicable to distributions \n     other than eligible rollover distributions. Thus, 20-percent \n     mandatory withholding does not apply.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision codifies and expands the relief provided \n     under the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 in the \n     case of qualified Hurricane Katrina distributions to any \n     ``qualified hurricane distribution,'' which is defined to \n     include distributions relating to Hurricanes Rita and Wilma. \n     Under the provision, a qualified hurricane distribution \n     includes distributions that meet the definition of qualified \n     Hurricane Katrina distribution under the Katrina Emergency \n     Tax Relief Act of 2005, as well as any other distribution \n     from an eligible retirement plan made on or after September \n     23, 2005, and before January 1, 2007, to an individual whose \n     principal place of abode on September 23, 2005, is located in \n     the Hurricane Rita disaster area and who has sustained an \n     economic loss by reason of Hurricane Rita. A qualified \n     hurricane distribution also includes a distribution from an \n     eligible retirement plan made on or after October 23, 2005, \n     and before January 1, 2007, to an individual whose principal \n     place of abode on October 23, 2005, is located in the \n     Hurricane Wilma disaster area and who has sustained an \n     economic loss by reason of Hurricane Wilma.\n       The total amount of qualified hurricane distributions that \n     an individual can receive from all plans, annuities, or IRAs \n     is $100,000.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.\n     2. Recontributions of withdrawals for home purchases \n         cancelled due to Hurricanes Rita and Wilma\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Under present law, a distribution from a qualified \n     retirement plan, a tax-sheltered annuity (a ``403(b) \n     annuity''), or an individual retirement arrangement (an \n     ``IRA'') generally is included in income for the year \n     distributed (secs. 402(a), 403(b), and 408(d)). In addition, \n     a distribution from a qualified retirement plan, a 403(b) \n     annuity, or an IRA received before age 59\\1/2\\, death, or \n     disability generally is subject to a 10-percent early \n     withdrawal tax on the amount includible in income, unless an \n     exception applies (sec. 72(t)). An exception to the 10-\n     percent tax applies in the case of a qualified first-time \n     homebuyer distribution from an IRA, i.e., a distribution (not \n     to exceed $10,000) used within 120 days for the purchase or \n     construction of a principal residence of a first-time \n     homebuyer.\n       An eligible rollover distribution from a qualified \n     retirement plan or a 403(b) annuity or a distribution from an \n     IRA generally can be rolled over within 60 days to another \n     plan, annuity, or IRA. The IRS has the authority to waive the \n     60-day requirement if failure to waive the requirement would \n     be against equity or good conscience, including cases of \n     casualty, disaster, or other events beyond the reasonable \n     control of the individual. Any amount rolled over is not \n     includible in income (and thus also not subject to the 10-\n     percent early withdrawal tax).\n       Certain amounts held in a qualified retirement plan that \n     includes a qualified cash-or-deferred arrangement (a ``401(k) \n     plan'') or a 403(b) annuity may not be distributed before \n     severance from employment, age 59\\1/2\\, death, disability, or \n     financial hardship of the employee. For this purpose, subject \n     to certain conditions, distributions for costs directly \n     related to the purchase of a principal residence by an \n     employee (excluding mortgage payments) are deemed to be \n     distributions on account of financial hardship.\n     Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005\n       The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 generally \n     provides that a distribution received from a 401(k) plan, \n     403(b) annuity, or IRA in order to purchase a home in the \n     Hurricane Katrina disaster area may be recontributed to such \n     a plan, annuity, or IRA in certain circumstances.\n       The ability to recontribute applies to an individual who \n     receives a qualified distribution. A qualified distribution \n     is a hardship distribution from a 401(k) plan or 403(b) \n     annuity, or a qualified first-time homebuyer distribution \n     from an IRA: (1) that is received after February 28, 2005, \n     and before August 29, 2005; and (2) that was to be used to \n     purchase or construct a principal residence in the Hurricane \n     Katrina disaster area, but the residence is not purchased or \n     constructed on account of Hurricane Katrina.\n       Any portion of a qualified distribution may, during the \n     period beginning on August 25, 2005, and ending on February \n     28, 2006, be recontributed to a plan, annuity or IRA to which \n     a rollover is permitted. Any amount recontributed is treated \n     as a rollover. Thus, that portion of the qualified \n     distribution is not includible in income (and also is not \n     subject to the 10-percent early withdrawal tax).\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision codifies and expands the provision under the \n     Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 allowing \n     recontribution of certain distributions from a 401(k) plan, \n     403(b) annuity, or IRA to qualified Hurricane Rita \n     distributions and to qualified Hurricane Wilma distributions.\n       A qualified Hurricane Rita distribution is a hardship \n     distribution from a 401(k) plan or 403(b) annuity, or a \n     qualified first-time homebuyer distribution from an IRA: (1) \n     that is received after February 28, 2005, and before \n     September 24, 2005; and (2) that was to be used to purchase \n     or construct a principal residence in the Hurricane Rita \n     disaster area, but the residence is not purchased or \n     constructed on account of Hurricane Rita. Any portion of a \n     qualified Hurricane Rita distribution may, during the period \n     beginning on September 23, 2005, and ending on February 28, \n     2006, be recontributed to a plan, annuity or IRA to which a \n     rollover is permitted.\n       A qualified Hurricane Wilma distribution is a hardship \n     distribution from a 401(k) plan or 403(b) annuity, or a \n     qualified first-time homebuyer distribution from an IRA: (1) \n     that is received after February 28, 2005, and before October \n     24, 2005; and (2) that was to be used to purchase or \n     construct a principal residence in the Hurricane Wilma \n     disaster area, but the residence is not purchased or \n     constructed on account of Hurricane Wilma. Any portion of a \n     qualified Hurricane Wilma distribution may, during the period \n     beginning on October 23, 2005, and ending on February 28, \n     2006, be recontributed to a plan, annuity or IRA to which a \n     rollover is permitted.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.\n     3. Loans from qualified plans to individuals sustaining an \n         economic loss due to Hurricane Rita or Wilma\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       An individual is permitted to borrow from a qualified plan \n     in which the individual participates (and to use his or her \n     accrued benefit as security for the loan) provided the loan \n     bears a reasonable rate of interest, is adequately secured, \n     provides a reasonable repayment schedule, and is not made \n     available on a basis that discriminates in favor of employees \n     who are officers, shareholders, or highly compensated.\n       Subject to certain exceptions, a loan from a qualified \n     employer plan to a plan participant is treated as a taxable \n     distribution of plan benefits. A qualified employer plan \n     includes a qualified retirement plan under section 401(a), a \n     qualified annuity plan under section 403(a), a tax-deferred \n     annuity under section 403(b), and any plan that was (or was \n     determined to be) a qualified employer plan or a governmental \n     plan.\n       An exception to this general rule of income inclusion is \n     provided to the extent that the loan (when added to the \n     outstanding balance of all other loans to the participant \n     from all plans maintained by the employer) does not exceed \n     the lesser of (1) $50,000 reduced by the excess of the \n     highest outstanding balance of loans from such plans during \n     the one-year period ending on the day before the date the \n     loan is made over the outstanding balance of loans from the \n     plan on the date the loan is made or (2) the greater of \n     $10,000 or one half of the participant's accrued benefit \n     under the plan (sec. 72(p)). This exception applies only if \n     the loan is required, by its terms, to be repaid within five \n     years. An extended repayment period is permitted for the \n     purchase of the principal residence of the participant. Plan \n     loan repayments (principal and interest) must be amortized in \n     level payments and made not less frequently than quarterly, \n     over the term of the loan.\n     Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005\n       The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 provides \n     special rules in the case of a loan from a qualified employer \n     plan to a qualified individual made after September 23, 2005, \n     and before January 1, 2007. A qualified individual is an \n     individual whose principal place of abode on August 28, 2005, \n     is located in the Hurricane Katrina disaster area and who has \n     sustained an economic loss by reason of Hurricane Katrina.\n       The exception to the general rule of income inclusion is \n     provided to the extent that the loan (when added to the \n     outstanding balance of all other loans to the participant \n     from all plans maintained by the employer) does not exceed \n     the lesser of (1) $100,000 reduced by the excess of the \n     highest outstanding balance of loans from such plans \n     during the one-year period ending on the day before the \n     date the loan is made over the outstanding balance of \n     loans from the plan on the date the loan is made or (2) \n     the greater of $10,000 or the participant's accrued \n     benefit under the plan.\n       In the case of a qualified individual with an outstanding \n     loan on or after August 25,\n\n[[Page S14042]]\n\n     2005, from a qualified employer plan, if the due date for any \n     repayment with respect to such loan occurs during the period \n     beginning on August 25, 2005, and ending on December 31, \n     2006, such due date is delayed for one year. Any subsequent \n     repayments with respect to such loan shall be appropriately \n     adjusted to reflect the delay in the due date and any \n     interest accruing during such delay. The period during which \n     required repayment is delayed is disregarded in complying \n     with the requirements that the loan be repaid within five \n     years and that level amortization payments be made.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision codifies and expands the special rules for \n     loans from a qualified employer plan provided under the \n     Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 to loans from a \n     qualified employer plan to a qualified Hurricane Rita or \n     Hurricane Wilma individual made on or after the date of \n     enactment and before January 1, 2007.\n       A qualified Hurricane Rita individual includes an \n     individual whose principal place of abode on September 23, \n     2005, is located in a Hurricane Rita disaster area and who \n     has sustained an economic loss by reason of Hurricane Rita. \n     In the case of a qualified Hurricane Rita individual with an \n     outstanding loan on or after September 23, 2005, from a \n     qualified employer plan, if the due date for any repayment \n     with respect to such loan occurs during the period beginning \n     on September 23, 2005, and ending on December 31, 2006, such \n     due date is delayed for one year.\n       A qualified Hurricane Wilma individual includes an \n     individual whose principal place of abode on October 23, \n     2005, is located in a Hurricane Wilma disaster area and who \n     has sustained an economic loss by reason of Hurricane Wilma. \n     In the case of a qualified Hurricane Wilma individual with an \n     outstanding loan on or after October 23, 2005, from a \n     qualified employer plan, if the due date for any repayment \n     with respect to such loan occurs during the period beginning \n     on October 23, 2005, and ending on December 31, 2006, such \n     due date is delayed for one year.\n       An individual cannot be a qualified individual with respect \n     to more than one hurricane.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.\n     4. Plan amendments relating to Hurricane Rita and Hurricane \n         Wilma relief\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Present law provides a remedial amendment period during \n     which, under certain circumstances, a plan may be amended \n     retroactively in order to comply with the qualification \n     requirements (sec. 401(b)). In general, plan amendments to \n     reflect changes in the law generally must be made by the time \n     prescribed by law for filing the income tax return of the \n     employer for the employer's taxable year in which the change \n     in law occurs. The Secretary of the Treasury may extend the \n     time by which plan amendments need to be made.\n     Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005\n       The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 permits \n     certain plan amendments made pursuant to the changes made by \n     the provisions of Title I of the Act, or regulations issued \n     thereunder, to be retroactively effective. If the plan \n     amendment meets the requirements of the Act, then the plan \n     will be treated as being operated in accordance with its \n     terms. In order for this treatment to apply, the plan \n     amendment is required to be made on or before the last day of \n     the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2007, or \n     such later date as provided by the Secretary of the Treasury. \n     Governmental plans are given an additional two years in which \n     to make required plan amendments. If the amendment is \n     required to be made to retain qualified status as a result of \n     the changes made by Title I of the Act (or regulations), the \n     amendment is required to be made retroactively effective as \n     of the date on which the change became effective with respect \n     to the plan, and the plan is required to be operated in \n     compliance until the amendment is made. Amendments that are \n     not required to retain qualified status but that are made \n     pursuant to the changes made by Title I of the Act (or \n     regulations) may be made retroactively effective as of the \n     first day the plan is operated in accordance with the \n     amendment. A plan amendment will not be considered to be \n     pursuant to changes made by Title I of the Act (or \n     regulations) if it has an effective date before the effective \n     date of the provision under the Act (or regulations) to which \n     it relates.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision codifies and expands the ability to make \n     retroactive plan amendments under the Katrina Emergency Tax \n     Relief Act of 2005 to apply to changes made pursuant to new \n     section 1400Q of the Code, or regulations issued thereunder.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.\n\n   B. Employee Retention Credit for Employers Affected by Hurricanes \n          Katrina, Rita and Wilma (New sec. 1400R of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 provides a \n     credit of 40 percent of the qualified wages (up to a maximum \n     of $6,000 in qualified wages per employee) paid by an \n     eligible employer to an eligible employee.\n       An eligible employer is any employer (1) that conducted an \n     active trade or business on August 28, 2005, in the core \n     disaster area and (2) with respect to which the trade or \n     business described in (1) is inoperable on any day after \n     August 28, 2005, and before January 1, 2006, as a result of \n     damage sustained by reason of Hurricane Katrina. An eligible \n     employer shall not include any trade or business for any \n     taxable year if such trade or business employed an average of \n     more than 200 employees on business days during the taxable \n     year.\n       The term ``core disaster area'' means that portion of the \n     Hurricane Katrina disaster area determined by the President \n     to warrant individual or individual and public assistance \n     from the Federal Government under such Act. The term \n     ``Hurricane Katrina disaster area'' means an area with \n     respect to which a major disaster has been declared by the \n     President before September 14, 2005, under section 401 of the \n     Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance \n     Act by reason of Hurricane Katrina.\n       An eligible employee is, with respect to an eligible \n     employer, an employee whose principal place of employment on \n     August 28, 2005, with such eligible employer was in a core \n     disaster area. An employee may not be treated as an eligible \n     employee for any period with respect to an employer if such \n     employer is allowed a credit under section 51 with respect to \n     the employee for the period.\n       Qualified wages are wages (as defined in section 51(c)(1) \n     of the Code, but without regard to section 3306(b)(2)(B) of \n     the Code) paid or incurred by an eligible employer with \n     respect to an eligible employee on any day after August 28, \n     2005, and before January 1, 2006, during the period (1) \n     beginning on the date on which the trade or business first \n     became inoperable at the principal place of employment of the \n     employee immediately before Hurricane Katrina, and (2) ending \n     on the date on which such trade or business has resumed \n     significant operations at such principal place of employment. \n     Qualified wages include wages paid without regard to whether \n     the employee performs no services, performs services at a \n     different place of employment than such principal place of \n     employment, or performs services at such principal place of \n     employment before significant operations have resumed.\n       The credit is a part of the current year business credit \n     under section 38(b) and therefore is subject to the tax \n     liability limitations of section 38(c). Rules similar to \n     sections 280C(a), 51(i)(1) and 52 apply to the credit.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision codifies the employee retention credit \n     provisions that were enacted in the Katrina Emergency Tax \n     Relief Act of 2005, and eliminates the provision that \n     restricted the credit to employers of not more than 200 \n     employees.\n       The provision extends the retention credit, as modified to \n     eliminate the employer size limitation, to employers affected \n     by Hurricanes Rita and Wilma and located in the Rita GO Zone \n     and Wilma GO Zone, respectively. The reference dates for \n     employers affected by Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Wilma, \n     comparable to the August 28, 2005 date of present law for \n     employers affected by Hurricane Katrina, are September 23, \n     2005, and October 23, 2005, respectively.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The codification of the provision in the Katrina Emergency \n     Tax Relief Act of 2005 takes effect on the date of enactment. \n     The provision that repeals the employer size limitation is, \n     with respect to the Hurricane Katrina retention credit, \n     effective as if included in the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief \n     Act of 2005. The retention credit is effective for wages paid \n     after September 23, 2005 in the case of Hurricane Rita and \n     after October 23, 2005 in the case of Hurricane Wilma.\n\nC. Temporary Suspension of Limitations on Charitable Contributions (New \n                       sec. 1400S(a) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       In general, an income tax deduction is permitted for \n     charitable contributions, subject to certain limitations that \n     depend on the type of taxpayer, the property contributed, and \n     the donee organization (sec. 170).\n       Charitable contributions of cash are deductible in the \n     amount contributed. In general, contributions of capital gain \n     property to a qualified charity are deductible at fair market \n     value with certain exceptions. Capital gain property means \n     any capital asset or property used in the taxpayer's trade or \n     business the sale of which at its fair market value, at the \n     time of contribution, would have resulted in gain that would \n     have been long-term capital gain. Contributions of other \n     appreciated property generally are deductible at the donor's \n     basis in the property. Contributions of depreciated property \n     generally are deductible at the fair market value of the \n     property.\n     Percentage limitations\n       Contributions by individuals\n       For individuals, in any taxable year, the amount deductible \n     as a charitable contribution is limited to a percentage of \n     the taxpayer's contribution base. The applicable percentage \n     of the contribution base varies depending on the type of \n     donee organization and property contributed. The contribution \n     base is defined as the taxpayer's adjusted\n\n[[Page S14043]]\n\n     gross income computed without regard to any net operating \n     loss carryback.\n       Contributions by an individual taxpayer of property (other \n     than appreciated capital gain property) to a charitable \n     organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A) (e.g., public \n     charities, private foundations other than private non-\n     operating foundations, and certain governmental units) may \n     not exceed 50 percent of the taxpayer's contribution base. \n     Contributions of this type of property to nonoperating \n     private foundations and certain other organizations generally \n     may be deducted up to 30 percent of the taxpayer's \n     contribution base.\n       Contributions of appreciated capital gain property to \n     charitable organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(A) \n     generally are deductible up to 30 percent of the taxpayer's \n     contribution base. An individual may elect, however, to bring \n     all these contributions of appreciated capital gain property \n     for a taxable year within the 50-percent limitation category \n     by reducing the amount of the contribution deduction by the \n     amount of the appreciation in the capital gain property. \n     Contributions of appreciated capital gain property to \n     charitable organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(B) \n     (e.g., private nonoperating foundations) are deductible up to \n     20 percent of the taxpayer's contribution base.\n       Contributions by corporations\n       For corporations, in any taxable year, charitable \n     contributions are not deductible to the extent the aggregate \n     contributions exceed 10 percent of the corporation's taxable \n     income computed without regard to net operating loss or \n     capital loss carrybacks.\n       For purposes of determining whether a corporation's \n     aggregate charitable contributions in a taxable year exceed \n     the applicable percentage limitation, contributions of \n     capital gain property are taken into account after other \n     charitable contributions.\n       Carryforward of excess contributions\n       Charitable contributions that exceed the applicable \n     percentage limitation may be carried forward for up to five \n     years (sec. 170(d)). The amount that may be carried forward \n     from a taxable year (``contribution year'') to a succeeding \n     taxable year may not exceed the applicable percentage of the \n     contribution base for the succeeding taxable year less the \n     sum of contributions made in the succeeding taxable year plus \n     contributions made in taxable years prior to the contribution \n     year and treated as paid in the succeeding taxable year under \n     this provision.\n     Overall limitation on itemized deductions (``Pease'' \n         limitation)\n       Under present law, the total amount of otherwise allowable \n     itemized deductions (other than medical expenses, investment \n     interest, and casualty, theft, or wagering losses) is reduced \n     by three percent of the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted \n     gross income in excess of a certain threshold. The otherwise \n     allowable itemized deductions may not be reduced by more than \n     80 percent. For 2005, the adjusted gross income threshold is \n     $145,950 ($72,975 for a married taxpayer filing a joint \n     return). These dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation.\n       The otherwise applicable overall limitation on itemized \n     deductions is reduced by one-third in taxable years beginning \n     in 2006 and 2007, and by two-thirds in taxable years \n     beginning in 2008 and 2009. The overall limitation is \n     repealed for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009, \n     and reinstated for taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2010.\n     Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005--Increase in \n         percentage limitations\n       Under section 301 of the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act \n     of 2005, in the case of an individual, the deduction for \n     qualified contributions is allowed up to the amount by which \n     the taxpayer's contribution base exceeds the deduction for \n     other charitable contributions. Contributions in excess of \n     this amount are carried over to succeeding taxable years as \n     contributions described in 170(b)(1)(A), subject to the \n     limitations of section 170(d)(1)(A)(i) and (ii).\n       In the case of a corporation, the deduction for qualified \n     contributions is allowed up to the amount by which the \n     corporation's taxable income (as computed under section \n     170(b)(2)) exceeds the deduction for other charitable \n     contributions. Contributions in excess of this amount are \n     carried over to succeeding taxable years, subject to the \n     limitations of section 170(d)(2).\n       In applying subsections (b) and (d) of section 170 to \n     determine the deduction for other contributions, qualified \n     contributions are not taken into account (except to the \n     extent qualified contributions are carried over to succeeding \n     taxable years under the rules described above).\n       Qualified contributions are cash contributions made during \n     the period beginning on August 28, 2005, and ending on \n     December 31, 2005, to a charitable organization described in \n     section 170(b)(1)(A) (other than a supporting organization \n     described in section 509(a)(3)). Contributions of noncash \n     property, such as securities, are not qualified \n     contributions. Under the provision, qualified contributions \n     must be to an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A); \n     thus, contributions to, for example, a charitable remainder \n     trust generally are not qualified contributions, unless the \n     charitable remainder interest is paid in cash to an eligible \n     charity during the applicable time period. In the case of a \n     corporation, qualified contributions must be for relief \n     efforts related to Hurricane Katrina. A taxpayer must elect \n     to have the contributions treated as qualified contributions.\n       Qualified contributions do not include a contribution if \n     the contribution is for establishment of a new, or \n     maintenance in an existing, segregated fund or account with \n     respect to which the donor (or any person appointed or \n     designated by such donor) has, or reasonably expects to have, \n     advisory privileges with respect to distributions or \n     investments by reason of the donor's status as a donor. For \n     example, a segregated fund or account exists if a donor makes \n     a charitable contribution and the donee separately identifies \n     the donor's contribution on its books. The donor has advisory \n     privileges with respect to such segregated fund or account if \n     the donor, by written agreement or otherwise, reasonably \n     expects to provide advice to the donee as to the investment \n     or distribution of amounts from such fund or account. In \n     addition, a segregated fund or account also includes, but is \n     not limited to, a separate bank account or trust established \n     or maintained by a donee; however, in order for a \n     contribution to such account or fund necessarily to be not a \n     qualified contribution, the donor (or a person appointed or \n     designated by the donor) must have or reasonably expect to \n     have advisory privileges as to the investment or distribution \n     of amounts in such account or fund. For instance, a donor \n     reasonably expects to have advisory privileges with respect \n     to contributions made by the donor if the donor understands \n     that the donee will consider advice provided by the donor (or \n     a person appointed or designated by the donor) in making \n     investments or distributions. It is intended that a person \n     shall not be treated as having advisory privileges by virtue \n     of having a legal or contractual right or obligation, or a \n     fiduciary duty, with respect to a segregated fund or account. \n     If a donor makes a contribution for establishment of a new, \n     or maintenance in an existing segregated account or fund, and \n     the donor also provides advice with respect to amounts in \n     such account or fund by reason of the donor's position as an \n     officer, employee, or director of the donee, and not by \n     reason of the donor's status as a donor, then, under the \n     provision, the donor is not treated as having or reasonably \n     expecting to have advisory privileges with respect to such \n     fund or account. However, if by reason of a donor's \n     charitable contribution to a segregated account or fund, the \n     donor secured an appointment on a committee of the donee \n     organization that advised how to distribute or invest amounts \n     in such account or fund, the contribution would not be a \n     qualified contribution notwithstanding that the donor is an \n     officer, employee, or director of the donee organization.\n       The Act requires that qualified contributions by a \n     corporation be made for relief efforts related to Hurricane \n     Katrina. Corporate taxpayers must substantiate that the \n     contribution is made for this purpose.\n     Limitation on overall itemized deductions\n       Under the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005, the \n     charitable contribution deduction up to the amount of \n     qualified contributions (as defined above) paid during the \n     year is not treated as an itemized deduction for purposes of \n     the overall limitation on itemized deductions.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision codifies the provisions in the Katrina \n     Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005, and extends the definition \n     of qualified contributions (as described above), in the case \n     of corporations, to include contributions for relief efforts \n     related to Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Wilma.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The codification of the provision in the Katrina Emergency \n     Tax Relief Act of 2005 takes effect on date of enactment. The \n     expansion of the provision applies to contributions made on \n     or after September 23, 2005.\n\n D. Suspension of Certain Limitations on Personal Casualty Losses (New \n                       sec. 1400S(b) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Under present law, a taxpayer may generally claim a \n     deduction for any loss sustained during the taxable year and \n     not compensated by insurance or otherwise (sec. 165). For \n     individual taxpayers, deductible losses must be incurred in a \n     trade or business or other profit-seeking activity or consist \n     of property losses arising from fire, storm, shipwreck, or \n     other casualty, or from theft. Personal casualty or theft \n     losses are deductible only if they exceed $100 per casualty \n     or theft. In addition, aggregate net casualty and theft \n     losses are deductible only to the extent they exceed 10 \n     percent of an individual taxpayer's adjusted gross income.\n     Hurricane Katrina\n       Under the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005, the two \n     limitations on personal casualty or theft losses do not apply \n     to the extent those losses arise in the Hurricane Katrina \n     disaster area on or after August 25, 2005, and are \n     attributable to Hurricane Katrina (``Katrina casualty \n     losses''). Specifically, Katrina casualty losses meeting the \n     above requirements need not exceed $100 per casualty or \n     theft. In addition, such losses are deductible without regard \n     to whether aggregate net losses exceed 10 percent of a \n     taxpayer's adjusted gross income. For purposes of applying \n     the 10 percent threshold to other personal casualty or theft \n     losses, Katrina casualty losses are disregarded. Thus, such \n     losses are effectively treated as a deduction separate from \n     all other casualty losses.\n\n[[Page S14044]]\n\n       For purposes of determining whether a loss is a Katrina \n     casualty loss, the term ``Hurricane Katrina disaster area'' \n     means an area with respect to which a major disaster had been \n     declared by the President before September 14, 2005, under \n     section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \n     Emergency Assistance Act by reason of Hurricane Katrina. The \n     States for which such a disaster had been declared are \n     Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision codifies the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act \n     of 2005 rule for Katrina casualty losses and expands it to \n     include losses that arise in the Hurricane Rita disaster area \n     and are attributable to Hurricane Rita and losses that arise \n     in the Hurricane Wilma disaster area and are attributable to \n     Hurricane Wilma.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The codification of the provision in the Katrina Emergency \n     Tax Relief Act of 2005 takes effect on date of enactment. The \n     expansion of the provision applies to losses related to \n     Hurricane Rita arising on or after September 23, 2005, and to \n     losses related to Hurricane Wilma arising on or after October \n     23, 2005.\n\nE. Required Exercise of IRS Administrative Authority (New sec. 1400S(c) \n                              of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     General time limits for filing tax returns\n       Individuals generally must file their Federal income tax \n     returns by April 15 of the year following the close of a \n     taxable year. The Secretary may grant reasonable extensions \n     of time for filing such returns. Treasury regulations provide \n     an additional automatic two-month extension (until June 15 \n     for calendar-year individuals) for United States citizens and \n     residents in military or naval service on duty on April 15 of \n     the following year (the otherwise applicable due date of the \n     return) outside the United States. No action is necessary to \n     apply for this extension, but taxpayers must indicate on \n     their returns (when filed) that they are claiming this \n     extension. Unlike most extensions of time to file, this \n     extension applies to both filing returns and paying the tax \n     due.\n       Treasury regulations also provide, upon application on the \n     proper form, an automatic four-month extension (until August \n     15 for calendar-year individuals) for any individual timely \n     filing that form and paying the amount of tax estimated to be \n     due.\n       In general, individuals must make quarterly estimated tax \n     payments by April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15 \n     of the following taxable year. Wage withholding is considered \n     to be a payment of estimated taxes\n     Suspension of time periods\n       In general, the period of time for performing various acts \n     under the Code, such as filing tax returns, paying taxes, or \n     filing a claim for credit or refund of tax, is suspended for \n     any individual serving in the Armed Forces of the United \n     States in an area designated as a ``combat zone'' or when \n     deployed outside the United States away from the individual's \n     permanent duty station while participating in an operation \n     designated by the Secretary of Defense as a ``contingency \n     operation'' or that becomes a contingency operation. The \n     suspension of time also applies to an individual serving in \n     support of such Armed Forces in the combat zone or \n     contingency operation, such as Red Cross personnel, \n     accredited correspondents, and civilian personnel acting \n     under the direction of the Armed Forces in support of those \n     Forces. The designation of a combat zone must be made by the \n     President in an Executive Order. A contingency operation is \n     defined as a military operation that is designated by the \n     Secretary of Defense as an operation in which members of the \n     Armed Forces are or may become involved in military actions, \n     operations, or hostilities against an enemy of the United \n     States or against an opposing military force, or results in \n     the call or order to (or retention of) active duty of members \n     of the uniformed services during a war or a national \n     emergency declared by the President or Congress.\n       The suspension of time encompasses the period of service in \n     the combat zone during the period of combatant activities in \n     the zone or while participating in a contingency operation, \n     as well as (1) any time of continuous qualified \n     hospitalization resulting from injury received in the combat \n     zone or contingency operation or (2) time in missing in \n     action status, plus the next 180 days.\n       The suspension of time applies to the following acts:\n       1. Filing any return of income, estate, gift, employment or \n     excise taxes;\n       2. Payment of any income, estate, gift, employment or \n     excise taxes;\n       3. Filing a petition with the Tax Court for redetermination \n     of a deficiency, or for review of a decision rendered by the \n     Tax Court;\n       4. Allowance of a credit or refund of any tax;\n       5. Filing a claim for credit or refund of any tax;\n       6. Bringing suit upon any such claim for credit or refund;\n       7. Assessment of any tax;\n       8. Giving or making any notice or demand for the payment of \n     any tax, or with respect to any liability to the United \n     States in respect of any tax;\n       9. Collection of the amount of any liability in respect of \n     any tax;\n       10. Bringing suit by the United States in respect of any \n     liability in respect of any tax; and\n       11. Any other act required or permitted under the internal \n     revenue laws specified by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n       In the case of a Presidentially declared disaster or a \n     terroristic or military action, the Secretary of the Treasury \n     also has authority to prescribe a period of up to one year \n     that may be disregarded for performing any of the acts listed \n     above. The Secretary also may suspend the accrual of any \n     interest, penalty, additional amount, or addition to tax for \n     taxpayers in the affected areas.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       Under the provision, for taxpayers determined to be \n     affected by the Presidentially declared disaster relating to \n     Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, any administrative \n     relief from required acts, such as filing tax returns, paying \n     taxes, or filing a claim for credit or refund of tax, shall \n     be for a period ending not earlier than February 28, 2006.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.\n\n  F. Special Look-Back Rule for Determining Earned Income Credit and \n        Refundable Child Credit (New sec. 1400S(d) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Present law provides eligible taxpayers with an earned \n     income credit and a child credit. In general, the earned \n     income credit is a refundable credit for low-income workers \n     (sec. 32). The amount of the credit depends on the earned \n     income of the taxpayer and whether the taxpayer has one, more \n     than one, or no qualifying children. Earned income generally \n     includes wages, salaries, tips, and other employee \n     compensation, plus net earnings from self-employment.\n       Taxpayers with incomes below certain threshold amounts are \n     eligible for a $1,000 credit for each qualifying child (sec. \n     24). The child credit is refundable to the extent of 15 \n     percent of the taxpayer's earned income in excess of $10,000. \n     (The $10,000 income threshold is indexed for inflation and is \n     currently $11,000 for 2005.) Families with three or more \n     children are allowed a refundable credit for the amount by \n     which the taxpayer's social security taxes exceed the \n     taxpayer's earned income credit, if that amount is greater \n     than the refundable credit based on the taxpayer's earned \n     income in excess of $10,000 (indexed for inflation).\n     Hurricane Katrina\n       Certain qualified individuals affected by Hurricane Katrina \n     may elect to calculate their earned income credit and \n     refundable child credit for the taxable year which includes \n     August 25, 2005, using their earned income from the prior \n     taxable year (a ``Katrina election''). Such qualified \n     individuals are permitted to make the election only if their \n     earned income for the taxable year which includes August 25, \n     2005, is less than their earned income for the preceding \n     taxable year.\n       Individuals qualified to make a Katrina election are (1) \n     individuals who on August 25, 2005, had their principal place \n     of abode in the Hurricane Katrina ``core disaster area'' or \n     (2) individuals who on such date were not in the core \n     disaster area but lived in the Hurricane Katrina disaster \n     area and were displaced from their homes. For purposes of \n     this election, the term ``core disaster area'' means that \n     portion of the Hurricane Katrina disaster area determined by \n     the President to warrant individual or individual and public \n     assistance from the Federal Government under such Act. The \n     term ``Hurricane Katrina disaster area'' means an area with \n     respect to which a major disaster had been declared by the \n     President before September 14, 2005, under section 401 of the \n     Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance \n     Act by reason of Hurricane Katrina. The States for which such \n     a disaster had been declared are Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, \n     and Mississippi.\n       In the case of a joint return for a taxable year which \n     includes August 25, 2005, a Katrina election may be made if \n     either spouse is a qualified individual. In such cases, the \n     earned income for the preceding taxable year which is \n     attributable to the taxpayer filing the joint return is the \n     sum of the earned income which is attributable to each spouse \n     for such preceding taxable year.\n       Any Katrina election applies with respect to both the \n     earned income credit and refundable child credit. For \n     administrative purposes, the incorrect use on a return of \n     earned income pursuant to a Katrina election is treated as a \n     mathematical or clerical error. A Katrina election is \n     disregarded for purposes of calculating gross income in the \n     election year.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision codifies the Katrina election. It also \n     expands the rule governing Katrina elections to permit \n     certain qualified individuals affected by Hurricane Rita and \n     Hurricane Wilma to make similar elections.\n       In the case of Hurricane Rita certain qualified individuals \n     may elect to calculate their earned income credit and \n     refundable child credit for the taxable year which includes \n     September 23, 2005, using their earned income from the prior \n     taxable year (a ``Rita election''). Qualified individuals for \n     purposes of a Rita election are (1) individuals who on \n     September 23, 2005, had their principal place\n\n[[Page S14045]]\n\n     of abode in the Rita GO Zone or (2) individuals who on such \n     date had their principal place of abode in the Hurricane Rita \n     disaster area but outside the Rita GO Zone and were displaced \n     from that residence.\n       In the case of Hurricane Wilma certain qualified \n     individuals may elect to calculate their earned income credit \n     and refundable child credit for the taxable year which \n     includes October 23, 2005, using their earned income from the \n     prior taxable year (a ``Wilma election''). Qualified \n     individuals for purposes of a Wilma election are (1) \n     individuals who on October 23, 2005, had their principal \n     place of abode in the Wilma GO Zone or (2) individuals who on \n     such date had their principal place of abode in the Hurricane \n     Wilma disaster area but outside the Wilma GO Zone and were \n     displaced from that residence.\n       Qualified individuals are permitted to make a Rita election \n     or Wilma election only if their earned income for the taxable \n     year which includes September 23, 2005 or October 23, 2005, \n     respectively, is less than their earned income for the \n     preceding taxable year.\n       In other respects, a Rita election or Wilma election is the \n     same as a Katrina election under present law, except that the \n     reference dates are September 23, 2005 for Rita and October \n     23, 2005 for Wilma and not August 25, 2005.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The codification of the provision in the Katrina Emergency \n     Tax Relief Act of 2005 takes effect on date of enactment. The \n     expansion of the provision applies to taxable years that \n     include September 23, 2005 in the case of Hurricane Rita and \n     October 23, 2005 in the case of Hurricane Wilma.\n\n  G. Secretarial Authority to Make Adjustments Regarding Taxpayer and \n           Dependency Status (New sec. 1400S(e) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       In order to determine taxable income, an individual reduces \n     adjusted gross income (``AGI'') by any personal exemptions \n     and either the standard deduction or itemized deductions. \n     Personal exemptions generally are allowed for the taxpayer, \n     his or her spouse, and any dependents (as defined in sec. \n     151). Personal exemptions are not allowed for purposes of \n     determining a taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable income.\n       For 2005, the amount deductible for each personal exemption \n     is $3,200. This amount is indexed annually for inflation. The \n     deduction for personal exemptions is phased out ratably for \n     taxpayers with AGI over certain thresholds. These thresholds \n     are indexed annually for inflation. Specifically, the total \n     amount of exemptions that may be claimed by a taxpayer is \n     reduced by two percent for each $2,500 (or portion thereof) \n     by which the taxpayer's AGI exceeds the applicable threshold. \n     (The phaseout rate is two percent for each $1,250 for married \n     taxpayers filing separate returns.) Thus, the personal \n     exemptions claimed are phased out over a $122,500 range \n     (which is not indexed for inflation), beginning at the \n     applicable threshold. The applicable thresholds for 2005 are \n     $145,900 for single individuals, $218,950 for married \n     individuals filing a joint return, $182,450 for heads of \n     households, and $109,475 for married individuals filing \n     separate returns. For 2005, the point at which a taxpayer's \n     personal exemptions are completely phased out is $268,450 for \n     single individuals, $341,450 for married individuals filing a \n     joint return, $304,950 for heads of households, and $170,725 \n     for married individuals filing separate returns.\n       Present law provides eligible taxpayers with an earned \n     income credit and a child credit. In general, the earned \n     income credit is a refundable credit for low-income workers. \n     The amount of the credit depends on the earned income of the \n     taxpayer and whether the taxpayer has one, more than one, or \n     no qualifying children. Earned income generally includes \n     wages, salaries, tips, and other employee compensation, plus \n     net earnings from self-employment.\n       Taxpayers with incomes below certain threshold amounts are \n     eligible for a $1,000 credit for each qualifying child. The \n     child credit is refundable to the extent of 15 percent of the \n     taxpayer's earned income in excess of $10,000. (The $10,000 \n     income threshold is indexed for inflation and is currently \n     $11,000 for 2005.) Families with three or more children are \n     allowed a refundable credit for the amount by which the \n     taxpayer's social security taxes exceed the taxpayer's earned \n     income credit, if that amount is greater than the refundable \n     credit based on the taxpayer's earned income in excess of \n     $10,000 (indexed for inflation).\n     Hurricane Katrina\n       With respect to taxable years beginning in 2005 and 2006, \n     the Secretary has authority to make such adjustments in the \n     application of the Federal tax laws as may be necessary to \n     ensure that taxpayers do not lose any deduction or credit or \n     experience a change of filing status by 62 reason of \n     temporary relocations caused by Hurricane Katrina. Such \n     adjustments may include, for example, addressing the \n     application of the residency requirements relating to \n     dependency exemptions in the case of relocations due to \n     Hurricane Katrina. Any adjustments made using this authority \n     must insure that an individual is not taken into account by \n     more than one taxpayer with respect to the same tax benefit.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision codifies the Secretarial authority with \n     respect to Hurricane Katrina. The provision also expands the \n     Secretary's authority to make adjustments in the application \n     of the Federal tax laws with respect to Hurricane Katrina to \n     include taxpayers affected by Hurricane Rita and Hurricane \n     Wilma.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective with respect to taxable years \n     beginning in 2005 or 2006.\n\n  H. Special Rules for Mortgage Revenue Bonds (New sec. 1400T of the \n                                 Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Under present law, gross income does not include interest \n     on State or local bonds (sec. 103). State and local bonds are \n     classified generally as either governmental bonds or private \n     activity bonds. Governmental bonds are bonds which are \n     primarily used to finance governmental functions or are \n     repaid with governmental funds. Private activity bonds are \n     bonds with respect to which the State or local government \n     serves as a conduit providing financing to nongovernmental \n     persons (e.g., private businesses or individuals). The \n     exclusion from income for State and local bonds does not \n     apply to private activity bonds, unless the bonds are issued \n     for certain permitted purposes (``qualified private activity \n     bonds'') (secs. 103(b)(1) and 141).\n     Qualified mortgage bonds\n       The definition of a qualified private activity bond \n     includes a qualified mortgage bond (sec. 143). Qualified \n     mortgage bonds are issued to make mortgage loans to qualified \n     mortgagors for the purchase, improvement, or rehabilitation \n     of owner-occupied residences. The Code imposes several \n     limitations on qualified mortgage bonds, including income \n     limitations for eligible mortgagors, purchase price \n     limitations on the home financed with bond proceeds, and a \n     ``first-time homebuyer'' requirement. The income limitations \n     are satisfied if all financing provided by an issue is \n     provided for mortgagors whose family income does not exceed \n     115 percent of the median family income for the metropolitan \n     area or State, whichever is greater, in which the financed \n     residences are located. The purchase price limitations \n     provide that a residence financed with qualified mortgage \n     bonds may not have a purchase price in excess of 90 percent \n     of the average area purchase price for that residence. The \n     first-time homebuyer requirement provides qualified mortgage \n     bonds generally cannot be used to finance a mortgage for a \n     homebuyer who had an ownership interest in a principal \n     residence in the three years preceding the execution of the \n     mortgage (the ``first-time homebuyer'' requirement).\n       Special income and purchase price limitations apply to \n     targeted area residences. A targeted area residence is one \n     located in either (1) a census tract in which at least 70 \n     percent of the families have an income which is 80 percent or \n     less of the state-wide median income or (2) an area of \n     chronic economic distress. For targeted area residences, the \n     income limitation is satisfied when no more than one-third of \n     the mortgages are made without regard to any income limits \n     and the remainder of the mortgages are made to mortgagors \n     whose family income is 140 percent or less of the applicable \n     median family income. The purchase price limitation is raised \n     from 90 percent to 110 percent of the average area purchase \n     price for targeted area residences. In addition, the first-\n     time homebuyer requirement does not apply to targeted area \n     residences.\n       Qualified mortgage bonds also may be used to finance \n     qualified home-improvement loans. Qualified home-improvement \n     loans are defined as loans to finance alterations, repairs, \n     and improvements on an existing residence, but only if such \n     alterations, repairs, and improvements substantially protect \n     or improve the basic livability or energy efficiency of the \n     property. Qualified home-improvement loans may not exceed \n     $15,000.\n       A temporary provision waived the first-time homebuyer \n     requirement for residences located in certain Presidentially \n     declared disaster areas (sec. 143(k)(11)). In addition, \n     residences located in such areas were treated as targeted \n     area residences for purposes of the income and purchase price \n     limitations. The special rule for residences located in \n     Presidentially declared disaster areas does not apply to \n     bonds issued after January 1, 1999.\n       The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act (``KETRA'') waives the \n     first-time homebuyer requirement with respect to certain \n     residences located in an area with respect to which a major \n     disaster has been declared by the President before September \n     14, 2005, under section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford \n     Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act by reason of \n     Hurricane Katrina (see sec. 404 of Pub. L. 109-73). KETRA \n     also increases to $150,000 the permitted amount of a \n     qualified home-improvement loans with respect to residences \n     located in the Hurricane Katrina disaster area to the extent \n     such loan is for the repair of damage caused by Hurricane \n     Katrina.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       Under the provision, residences located in the GO Zone, the \n     Rita GO Zone, or the Wilma GO Zone are treated as targeted \n     area residences for purposes of section 143, with the \n     modifications described below. Thus, the first-time homebuyer \n     rule is waived and purchase and income rules for targeted \n     area residences apply to residences located in the\n\n[[Page S14046]]\n\n     specified areas that are financed with qualified mortgage \n     bonds. For these purposes, 100 percent of the mortgages must \n     be made to mortgagors whose family income is 140 percent or \n     less of the applicable median family income. Thus, the \n     present law rule allowing one-third of the mortgages to be \n     made without regard to any income limits does not apply. In \n     addition, the proposal increases from $15,000 to $150,000 the \n     amount of a qualified home-improvement loan with respect to \n     residences located in the specified disaster areas.\n       The provision applies to residences financed before January \n     1, 2011.\n       (For a description of the extension of KETRA mortgage \n     revenue bond rules, see I.A.20,--Special Rules for Mortgage \n     Revenue Bonds, above.)\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective on the date of enactment with \n     respect to financing provided before January 1, 2011.\n\n                      TITLE III--OTHER PROVISIONS\n\n                      A. Gulf Coast Recovery Bonds\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under Title 31, the Secretary, with the approval of the \n     President, may issue savings bonds and savings certificates \n     of the United States Government (31 U.S.C. sec. 3105). \n     Proceeds from the bonds and certificates are used for \n     expenditures authorized by law. Savings bonds and \n     certificates may be issued on an interest-bearing basis, on a \n     discount basis, or on an interest-bearing and discount basis. \n     The difference between the price paid and the amount received \n     on redeeming a savings bond or certificate is interest under \n     the Code.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision expresses the sense of Congress that the \n     Secretary designate one or more series of obligations issued \n     under Title 31 as ``Gulf Coast Recovery Bonds'' in response \n     to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.\n\n B. Election To Treat Combat Pay as Earned Income for Purposes of the \n               Earned Income Credit (Sec. 32 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     Child credit\n       Combat pay that is otherwise excluded from gross income \n     under section 112 is treated as earned income which is taken \n     into account in computing taxable income for purposes of \n     calculating the refundable portion of the child credit.\n     Earned income credit\n       Any taxpayer may elect to treat combat pay that is \n     otherwise excluded from gross income under section 112 as \n     earned income for purposes of the earned income credit. This \n     election is available with respect to any taxable year ending \n     after the date of enactment and before January 1, 2006.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision extends the present-law rule relating to the \n     earned income credit for one year (through December 31, \n     2006).\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 2005.\n\nC. Modifications of Suspension of Interest and Penalties Where Internal \n  Revenue Service Fails to Contact Taxpayer (Sec. 6404(g) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       In general, interest and penalties accrue during periods \n     for which taxes were unpaid without regard to whether the \n     taxpayer was aware that there was tax due. The Code suspends \n     the accrual of certain penalties and interest starting 18 \n     months after the filing of the tax return if the IRS has not \n     sent the taxpayer a notice specifically stating the \n     taxpayer's liability and the basis for the liability within \n     the specified period. If the return is filed before the due \n     date, for this purpose it is considered to have been filed on \n     the due date. Interest and penalties resume 21 days after the \n     IRS sends the required notice to the taxpayer. The provision \n     is applied separately with respect to each item or \n     adjustment. The provision does not apply where a taxpayer has \n     self-assessed the tax. The suspension only applies to \n     taxpayers who file a timely tax return. The provision applies \n     only to individuals and does not apply to the failure to pay \n     penalty, in the case of fraud, or with respect to criminal \n     penalties.\n       The suspension of interest does not apply to interest \n     accruing after October 3, 2004 with respect to underpayments \n     resulting from listed transactions or undisclosed reportable \n     transactions.\n       On October 27, 2005, the IRS announced a settlement \n     initiative for 21 identified transactions. (See Internal \n     Revenue Service Announcement 2005-80.) Under the terms of the \n     settlement initiative, participants will be required to pay \n     100 percent of the taxes owed, interest and, depending on the \n     transaction, either a quarter or a half of the penalty the \n     IRS will otherwise seek. The IRS will grant penalty relief \n     for transactions disclosed to the IRS or where the taxpayer \n     got a tax opinion from an independent tax advisor. \n     Transaction costs paid by the taxpayer, including \n     professional and promoter fees, will be allowed. The \n     application deadline for the settlement initiative is January \n     23, 2006.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       Under the provision, the exception for listed transactions \n     and undisclosed reportable transactions also applies to \n     interest accruing on or before October 3, 2004. However, \n     taxpayers remain eligible for the present-law suspension of \n     interest if the year in which the underpayment occurred is \n     barred by the statute of limitations (or a closing agreement) \n     as of December 14, 2005. Taxpayers may also remain eligible \n     with respect to any transactions if the Secretary determines \n     that the taxpayers have acted reasonably and in good faith \n     with respect to that transactions.\n       In addition, under a special rule, taxpayers may remain \n     eligible for the present-law suspension of interest by \n     participating in the IRS settlement initiative described \n     above with respect to that transaction. In order to be \n     eligible under the special rule, the taxpayer must be \n     participating in the settlement initiative (or have entered \n     into a settlement agreement pursuant to the initiative) as of \n     January 23, 2006. Furthermore, a taxpayer's eligibility under \n     the special rule is revoked if the taxpayer ceases to \n     participate in the settlement initiative or the Treasury \n     determines that a settlement agreement will not be reached \n     within a reasonable period of time.\n       The special rule applies on a transaction-by-transaction \n     basis. Thus, participation in the settlement initiative with \n     respect to an individual transaction qualifies the taxpayer \n     for the present-law suspension of interest only with respect \n     to interest and penalties on underpayments resulting from \n     that transaction. If the taxpayer has entered into other \n     listed or nondisclosed reportable transactions and is not \n     participating in the settlement initiative with respect to \n     those transactions, the special rule does not apply to \n     interest and penalties resulting from those transactions.\n       The provision also provides that, if a taxpayer files an \n     amended return or other signed written document showing that \n     the taxpayer owes an additional amount of tax for the taxable \n     year, the relevant 18-month period is measured from the \n     latest date on which such documents were provided.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective as if included in the provisions \n     of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 to which it \n     relates, except that the rule relating to the restart of the \n     18-month period is effective for documents provided on or \n     after the date of enactment.\n\n     D. Authority for Undercover Operations (Sec. 7608 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       IRS undercover operations are exempt from the otherwise \n     applicable statutory restrictions controlling the use of \n     Government funds (which generally provide that all receipts \n     must be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury and all \n     expenses paid out of appropriated funds). In general, the \n     exemption permits the IRS to use proceeds from an undercover \n     operation to pay additional expenses incurred in the \n     undercover operation. The IRS is required to conduct a \n     detailed financial audit of large undercover operations in \n     which the IRS is using proceeds from such operations and to \n     provide an annual audit report to the Congress on all such \n     large undercover operations.\n       The provision was originally enacted in The Anti-Drug Abuse \n     Act of 1988. The exemption originally expired on December 31, \n     1989, and was extended by the Comprehensive Crime Control Act \n     of 1990 to December 31, 1991. There followed a gap of \n     approximately four and a half years during which the \n     provision had lapsed. In the Taxpayer Bill of Rights II, the \n     authority to use proceeds from undercover operations was \n     extended for five years, through 2000. The Community Renewal \n     Tax Relief Act of 2000 extended the authority of the IRS to \n     use proceeds from undercover operations for an additional \n     five years, through 2005.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision extends for one year the present-law \n     authority of the IRS to use proceeds from undercover \n     operations to pay additional expenses incurred in conducting \n     undercover operations (through December 31, 2006).\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective on the date of enactment.\n\n            E. Disclosures of Certain Tax Return Information\n\n     1. Disclosure of tax information to facilitate combined \n         employment tax reporting (sec. 6103(d)(5) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Traditionally, Federal tax forms are filed with the Federal \n     government and State tax forms are filed with individual \n     States. This necessitates duplication of items common to both \n     returns. The Code permits the IRS to disclose taxpayer \n     identity information and signatures to any agency, body, or \n     commission of any State for the purpose of carrying out with \n     such agency, body or commission a combined Federal and State \n     employment tax reporting program approved by the Secretary. \n     The Federal disclosure restrictions, safeguard requirements, \n     and criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure and \n     unauthorized inspection do not apply with respect to \n     disclosures or inspections made pursuant to this authority.\n       The authority for this program expires December 31, 2005.\n       Under section 6103(c), the IRS may disclose a taxpayer's \n     return or return information to\n\n[[Page S14047]]\n\n     such person or persons as the taxpayer may designate in a \n     request for or consent to such disclosure. Pursuant to \n     Treasury regulations, a taxpayer's participation in a \n     combined return filing program between the IRS and a State \n     agency, body or commission constitutes a consent to the \n     disclosure by the IRS to the State agency of taxpayer \n     identity information, signature and items of common data \n     contained on the return. No disclosures may be made under \n     this authority unless there are provisions of State law \n     protecting the confidentiality of such items of common data.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision extends for one year the present-law \n     authority for the combined employment tax reporting program \n     (through December 31, 2006).\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision applies to disclosures after December 31, \n     2005.\n     2. Disclosure of return information regarding terrorist \n         activities (sec. 6103(i)(3) and (i)(7) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Section 6103 provides that returns and return information \n     may not be disclosed by the IRS, other Federal employees, \n     State employees, and certain others having access to the \n     information except as provided in the Internal Revenue Code. \n     Section 6103 contains a number of exceptions to this general \n     rule of nondisclosure that authorize disclosure in \n     specifically 71 identified circumstances (including nontax \n     criminal investigations) when certain conditions are \n     satisfied.\n       Among the disclosures permitted under the Code is \n     disclosure of returns and return information for purposes of \n     investigating terrorist incidents, threats, or activities, \n     and for analyzing intelligence concerning terrorist \n     incidents, threats, or activities. The term ``terrorist \n     incident, threat, or activity'' is statutorily defined to \n     mean an incident, threat, or activity involving an act of \n     domestic terrorism or international terrorism, as both of \n     those terms are defined in the USA PATRIOT Act (see sec. \n     6103(b)(11) and 18 U.S.C. secs. 2331(1) and 2331(5)). In \n     general, returns and taxpayer return information must be \n     obtained pursuant to an ex parte court order. Return \n     information, other than taxpayer return information, \n     generally is available upon a written request meeting \n     specific requirements. The IRS also is permitted to make \n     limited disclosures of such information on its own initiative \n     to the appropriate Federal law enforcement agency.\n       No disclosures may be made under these provisions after \n     December 31, 2005.\n     Disclosure of returns and return information--by ex parte \n         court order\n       Ex parte court orders sought by Federal law enforcement and \n           Federal intelligence agencies\n       The Code permits, pursuant to an ex parte court order, the \n     disclosure of returns and return information (including \n     taxpayer return information) to certain officers and \n     employees of a Federal law enforcement agency or Federal \n     intelligence agency. These officers and employees are \n     required to be personally and directly engaged in any \n     investigation of, response to, or analysis of intelligence \n     and counterintelligence information concerning any terrorist \n     incident, threat, or activity. These officers and employees \n     are permitted to use this information solely for their use in \n     the investigation, response, or analysis, and in any \n     judicial, administrative, or grand jury proceeding, \n     pertaining to any such terrorist incident, threat, or \n     activity.\n       The Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Associate \n     Attorney General, an Assistant Attorney General, or a United \n     States attorney, may authorize the application for the ex \n     parte court order to be submitted to a Federal district court \n     judge or magistrate. The Federal district court judge or \n     magistrate would grant the order if based on the facts \n     submitted he or she determines that: (1) there is reasonable \n     cause to believe, based upon information believed to be \n     reliable, that the return or return information may be \n     relevant to a matter relating to such terrorist incident, \n     threat, or activity; and (2) the return or return information \n     is sought exclusively for the use in a Federal investigation, \n     analysis, or proceeding concerning any terrorist incident, \n     threat, or activity.\n       Special rule for ex parte court ordered disclosure \n           initiated by the IRS\n       If the Secretary of Treasury possesses returns or return \n     information that may be related to a terrorist incident, \n     threat, or activity, the Secretary of the Treasury (or his \n     delegate), may on his own initiative, authorize an \n     application for an ex parte court order to permit disclosure \n     to Federal law enforcement. In order to grant the order, the \n     Federal district court judge or magistrate must determine \n     that there is reasonable cause to believe, based upon \n     information believed to be reliable, that the return or \n     return information may be relevant to a matter relating to \n     such terrorist incident, threat, or activity. The \n     information may be disclosed only to the extent necessary \n     to apprise the appropriate Federal law enforcement agency \n     responsible for investigating or responding to a terrorist \n     incident, threat, or activity and for officers and \n     employees of that agency to investigate or respond to such \n     terrorist incident, threat, or activity. Further, use of \n     the information is limited to use in a Federal \n     investigation, analysis, or proceeding concerning a \n     terrorist incident, threat, or activity. Because the \n     Department of Justice represents the Secretary of the \n     Treasury in Federal district court, the Secretary is \n     permitted to disclose returns and return information to \n     the Department of Justice as necessary and solely for the \n     purpose of obtaining the special IRS ex parte court order.\n     Disclosure of return information other than by ex parte court \n         order\n       Disclosure by the IRS without a request\n       The Code permits the IRS to disclose return information, \n     other than taxpayer return information, related to a \n     terrorist incident, threat, or activity to the extent \n     necessary to apprise the head of the appropriate Federal law \n     enforcement agency responsible for investigating or \n     responding to such terrorist incident, threat, or activity. \n     The IRS on its own initiative and without a written request \n     may make this disclosure. The head of the Federal law \n     enforcement agency may disclose information to officers and \n     employees of such agency to the extent necessary to \n     investigate or respond to such terrorist incident, threat, or \n     activity. A taxpayer's identity is not treated as return \n     information supplied by the taxpayer or his or her \n     representative.\n       Disclosure upon written request of a Federal law \n           enforcement agency\n       The Code permits the IRS to disclose return information, \n     other than taxpayer return information, to officers and \n     employees of Federal law enforcement upon a written request \n     satisfying certain requirements. The request must: (1) be \n     made by the head of the Federal law enforcement agency (or \n     his delegate) involved in the response to or investigation of \n     terrorist incidents, threats, or activities, and (2) set \n     forth the specific reason or reasons why such disclosure may \n     be relevant to a terrorist incident, threat, or activity. The \n     information is to be disclosed to officers and employees of \n     the Federal law enforcement agency who would be personally \n     and directly involved in the response to or investigation of \n     terrorist incidents, threats, or activities. The information \n     is to be used by such officers and employees solely for such \n     response or investigation.\n       The Code permits the redisclosure by a Federal law \n     enforcement agency to officers and employees of State and \n     local law enforcement personally and directly engaged in the \n     response to or investigation of the terrorist incident, \n     threat, or activity. The State or local law enforcement \n     agency must be part of an investigative or response team with \n     the Federal law enforcement agency for these disclosures to \n     be made.\n       Disclosure upon request from the Departments of Justice or \n           Treasury for intelligence analysis of terrorist \n           activity\n       Upon written request satisfying certain requirements \n     discussed below, the IRS is to disclose return information \n     (other than taxpayer return information) to officers and \n     employees of the Department of Justice, Department of \n     Treasury, and other Federal intelligence agencies, who are \n     personally and directly engaged in the collection or analysis \n     of intelligence and counterintelligence or investigation \n     concerning terrorist incidents, threats, or activities. Use \n     of the information is limited to use by such officers and \n     employees in such investigation, collection, or analysis.\n       The written request is to set forth the specific reasons \n     why the information to be disclosed is relevant to a \n     terrorist incident, threat, or activity. The request is to be \n     made by an individual who is: (1) an officer or employee of \n     the Department of Justice or the Department of Treasury, (2) \n     appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the \n     Senate, and (3) responsible for the collection, and analysis \n     of intelligence and counterintelligence information \n     concerning terrorist incidents, threats, or activities. The \n     Director of the United States Secret Service also is an \n     authorized requester under the Act.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision extends for one year the present-law \n     terrorist activity disclosure provisions (through December \n     31, 2006).\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision applies to disclosures after December 31, \n     2005.\n     3. Disclosure of return information to carry out income \n         contingent repayment of student loans (sec. 6103(l)(13) \n         of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law prohibits the disclosure of returns and return \n     information, except to the extent specifically authorized by \n     the Code. An exception is provided for disclosure to the \n     Department of Education (but not to contractors thereof) of a \n     taxpayer's filing status, adjusted gross income and identity \n     information (i.e., name, mailing address, taxpayer \n     identifying number) to establish an appropriate repayment \n     amount for an applicable student loan. The disclosure \n     authority for the income-contingent loan repayment program is \n     scheduled to expire after December 31, 2005.\n       The Department of Education utilizes contractors for the \n     income-contingent loan verification program. The specific \n     disclosure exception for the program does not permit \n     disclosure of return information to contractors. As a result, \n     the Department of Education obtains return information from \n     the Internal Revenue Service by taxpayer consent (under \n     section 6103(c)), rather than under the specific exception \n     for the income-contingent loan verification program (sec. \n     6103(l)(13)).\n\n[[Page S14048]]\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision extends for one year the present law \n     authority to disclose return information for purposes of the \n     income-contingent loan repayment program (through December \n     31, 2006).\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision applies to requests made after December 31, \n     2005.\n\n                  TITLE IV--TAX TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS\n\n       The bill includes technical corrections and other \n     corrections to recently enacted tax legislation. Except as \n     otherwise provided, the amendments made by the technical \n     corrections and other corrections contained in the bill take \n     effect as if included in the original legislation to which \n     each amendment relates.\n\n\n                        A. Technical Corrections\n\n     Amendments Related to the Energy Policy Act of 2005\n       Repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 \n     (Act sec. 1263).--The provision repeals sections 1081-1083 of \n     the Code (relating to exchanges in obedience to SEC orders) \n     to conform to the repeal of the Public Utility Holding \n     Company Act of 1935. The repeal does not apply to any \n     exchange, expenditure, investment, distribution, or sale made \n     in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission.\n       Extension and modification of renewable electricity \n     production credit (Act sec. 1301).--The provision makes a \n     technical amendment to Code section 45(c)(3)(A)(ii) to change \n     the wording of the reference to ``nonhazardous lignin waste \n     material'' to ``lignin material'' so as not to infer that \n     lignin is hazardous or waste.\n       Clean renewable energy bonds (Act sec. 1303).--Section \n     54(1)(5) treats the credits received by a holder of clean \n     renewable energy bonds as payments of estimated tax for \n     purposes of sections 6654 and 6655. Under the provision, \n     section 54(1)(5) is repealed, as it may provide a double \n     benefit when computing the estimated tax penalty in the \n     manner prescribed under sections 6654(f) and 6655(g). The \n     conforming amendments to the Act section are made for taxable \n     years beginning after 2005.\n       Credit for production from advanced nuclear power \n     facilities (Act sec. 1306).--The provision clarifies the \n     production credit for advanced nuclear power (sec. 45J) to \n     carry out the intent that the phase-out is indexed for \n     inflation but the credit rate is not. Specifically, it is not \n     intended that the inflation adjustment rule referred to in \n     section 45J(e) be interpreted to apply to the credit rate in \n     section 45J(a)(1) as well as the phase-out referred to in \n     section 45J(c)(2). The provision clarifies that the phase-out \n     is indexed but the credit rate is not.\n       Expansion of amortization for certain atmospheric pollution \n     control facilities in connection with plants first placed in \n     service after 1975 (Act sec. 1309).--The provision clarifies \n     that the 84-month amortization period only applies to \n     facilities used in connection with a plant or other property \n     placed in service after December 31, 1975.\n       Five-year net operating loss carryover for certain losses \n     (Act sec. 1311).--A number of clerical amendments are made to \n     section 172(b)(1)(I).\n       Modification of credit for producing fuel from a \n     nonconventional source (Act sec. 1322).--The provision \n     clarifies that the credit is allowable without the \n     requirement to make an election.\n       Energy efficient commercial buildings deduction (Act sec. \n     1331).--The provision repeals as deadwood certain language in \n     section 1250.\n       Credit for residential energy efficient property (Act sec. \n     1335).--The provision clarifies that the dollar limitations \n     are applied without regard to carryovers of the credit from \n     prior taxable years.\n       Under the provision, the joint occupancy rule is redrafted \n     to apply to expenditures with respect to a dwelling unit \n     rather than the credit allowed with respect to the unit.\n       The rules relating to the carryover of unused personal \n     credits (including the new credit for residential energy \n     efficient property) are redrafted so as to include in the \n     Code rules for both the taxable years in which the credits \n     are allowed against the alternative minimum tax, and the \n     taxable years in which the credits are not so allowed. The \n     provision is effective for taxable years beginning after \n     2005.\n       Alternative motor vehicle credit and credit for \n     installation of alternative fueling stations (Act secs. 1341 \n     and 1342).--Sections 30B(h)(6) and 30C(e)(2) separate \n     business and personal credits for purposes of applying \n     limitations on the credits. Credit property is treated as \n     subject to the business credit limitations if it is \n     depreciable property. Each of these rules provides that the \n     seller of property to a tax-exempt entity can claim the \n     credit. The provision provides that the credits for property \n     sold to a tax-exempt entity are subject to the business \n     credit limitations.\n       Expansion of research credit (Act sec. 1351).--The research \n     credit has an explicit rule preventing amounts from being \n     taken into account more than once under the credit (i.e., \n     preventing double benefits). The provision clarifies that the \n     rule preventing amounts from being taken into account more \n     than once also applies to the provisions of the research \n     credit relating to energy research consortia.\n       The provision clarifies that qualified research with \n     respect to energy research consortia must be conducted in the \n     United States or Puerto Rico. This conforms the treatment of \n     such qualified research to the treatment of other qualified \n     research under the research credit in this respect.\n     Amendments Related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004\n       Deduction relating to income attributable to domestic \n     production activities (manufacturing deduction) (Act sec. \n     102).--With respect to the W-2 wage limitation on the \n     allowable amount of the domestic production activities \n     deduction, the Act does not require Forms W-2 actually to be \n     filed, and does not specify whether the employees must be the \n     common law employees of the taxpayer. The provision clarifies \n     that a taxpayer may take into account only wages that are \n     paid to the common law employees of the taxpayer and that are \n     reported on a Form W-2 filed with the Social Security \n     Administration no later than 60 days after the extended due \n     date for the Form W-2. Thus, the taxpayer may not take into \n     account wages that were not actually reported. The provision \n     also addresses situations in which the employer uses an agent \n     to report its wages.\n       The provision clarifies that, in computing qualified \n     production activities income, the domestic production \n     activities deduction itself is not an allocable deduction. \n     The provision also clarifies that no inference is intended \n     with regard to the interpretive relationship between the cost \n     allocation rules provided with respect to the domestic \n     production activities deduction and the cost allocation rules \n     provided with respect to provisions elsewhere in the Act \n     (e.g., incentives to reinvest foreign earnings in the United \n     States). The provision also corrects a reference to ``income \n     attributable to domestic production activities'' to refer to \n     the defined term ``qualified production activities income.''\n       With regard to the definition of ``domestic production \n     gross receipts'' as it relates to construction performed in \n     the United States and engineering or architectural services \n     performed in the United States for construction projects in \n     the United States, the provision clarifies that the term \n     refers only to gross receipts derived from the construction \n     of real property by a taxpayer engaged in the active conduct \n     of a construction trade or business, or from engineering or \n     architectural services performed with respect to real \n     property by a taxpayer engaged in the active conduct of an \n     engineering or architectural services trade or business.\n       The provision clarifies that the term does not include \n     gross receipts derived from the lease, rental, license, sale, \n     exchange or other disposition of land.\n       The provision provides that gross receipts derived from \n     certain contracts (or subcontracts) to manufacture or produce \n     property for the Federal government are derived from the sale \n     of such property and, therefore, are domestic production \n     gross receipts. (Another section of the provision clarifies \n     the authority of the Secretary to prescribe rules to prevent \n     the domestic production activities deduction from being \n     claimed by more than one taxpayer with respect to the same \n     economic activity described in section 199(c)(4)(A)(i).)\n       The provision provides that, for purposes of determining \n     the domestic production gross receipts of a partnership and \n     its partners, provided all of the interests in the capital \n     and profits of the partnership are owned by members of the \n     same expanded affiliated group at all times during the \n     taxable year of the partnership, then the partnership and all \n     members of that expanded affiliated group are treated as a \n     single taxpayer during such period. Thus, for example, assume \n     such a partnership engages in an activity with respect to \n     property manufactured by the partners that are members of the \n     same expanded affiliated group, and the activity would be \n     treated as a manufacturing activity, but for the fact that \n     the partnership (rather than the partner) conducts the \n     activity. Under this provision, then, the gross receipts \n     derived from the activity are treated as domestic production \n     gross receipts of the partnership for such taxable year. Once \n     the partnership has determined its domestic production gross \n     receipts in this manner, such receipts and the expenses, \n     losses or deductions that are properly allocable to such \n     receipts, and any other items that are allocated to partners, \n     are allocated among the partners in accordance with the \n     requirements of section 199(d)(1) (as amended). Similarly, if \n     a partner engages in such an activity with respect to \n     property manufactured by the partnership, then the gross \n     receipts derived from the activity are treated as domestic \n     production gross receipts of the partner. The treatment of \n     the partners and the partnership as a single taxpayer under \n     this rule is only for the purpose of determining domestic \n     production gross receipts.\n       The provision clarifies that, with respect to the domestic \n     production activities of a partnership or S corporation, the \n     deduction under the Act is determined at the partner or \n     shareholder level. In performing the calculation, each \n     partner or shareholder generally will take into account such \n     person's allocable share of the components of the calculation \n     (including domestic production gross receipts; the cost of \n     goods sold allocable to such receipts; and other expenses, \n     losses, or deductions allocable to such receipts) from the \n     partnership or S corporation as well as any items relating to \n     the partner\n\n[[Page S14049]]\n\n     or shareholder's own qualified production activities, if any.\n       The provision clarifies the treatment provided under the \n     Act of cooperatives and patrons with respect to the deduction \n     under section 199. The provision clarifies that a patron who \n     receives certain payments from an agricultural or \n     horticultural cooperative that are attributable to qualified \n     production activities income is allowed a deduction equal to \n     the portion of the deduction allowed to the cooperative that \n     is attributable to such income. The provision also clarifies \n     that the patron's deduction is allowed in the year that the \n     payment attributable to qualified production activities \n     income is received. The cooperative's taxable income is not \n     reduced under section 1382 by the portion of the payment that \n     does not exceed the portion so deductible by the patron. For \n     purposes of the deduction under section 199, the provision \n     clarifies that agricultural or horticultural marketing \n     cooperatives are treated as having manufactured, produced, \n     grown, or extracted any qualifying production property \n     marketed by the organization which its patrons have so \n     manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted. For purposes of \n     the deduction under section 199, an agricultural or \n     horticultural cooperative is a cooperative engaged in the \n     manufacturing, production, growth, or extraction in whole or \n     significant part of any agricultural or horticultural \n     products, or in the marketing of agricultural or \n     horticultural products.\n       The provision clarifies the definition of an expanded \n     affiliated group, so that a corporation eligible for the \n     deduction with respect to income of a subsidiary must own \n     more than 50 percent, rather than 50 percent or more, of the \n     subsidiary's stock by vote and value.\n       The provision rewrites the rule that the deduction under \n     section 199 in computing alternative minimum taxable income \n     (``AMTI'') is the same as in computing the regular tax, \n     except that, in the case of a corporation, the taxable income \n     limitation is the corporation's AMTI.\n       The provision clarifies that unrelated business taxable \n     income, rather than taxable income, applies for purposes of \n     section 199(a)(1)(B) in computing the unrelated business \n     income tax under section 511. (In computing AMTI of an \n     organization which is a corporation subject to tax under \n     section 511(a), AMTI applies for purposes of section \n     199(a)(1)(B). In computing AMTI of an organization other than \n     a corporation, the section 199 deduction is the same as for \n     the regular tax. See sec. 199(d)(6).)\n       The provision clarifies that the manufacturing deduction is \n     not taken into account in computing any net operating loss or \n     the amount of any net operating loss carryback or carryover. \n     Thus, the deduction under section 199 cannot create, or \n     increase, the amount of a net operating loss deduction.\n       The provision clarifies the authority of the Secretary to \n     prescribe rules to prevent the domestic production activities \n     deduction from being claimed by more than one taxpayer with \n     respect to the same economic activity described in section \n     199(c)(4)(A)(i).\n       The provision clarifies that the manufacturing deduction is \n     not taken into account in determining the amount of the \n     alternative tax net operating loss deduction. For example, \n     assume that for the calendar year 2005, a corporation has \n     AMTI (before the NOL deduction and before the manufacturing \n     deduction) and qualified production activities income of $1 \n     million, and has an alternative tax net operating loss \n     (``ATNOL'') carryover to 2005 of $5 million. Assume that the \n     taxpayer has sufficient W-2 wages so as not to be limited \n     under that rule. The ATNOL deduction for 2005 is $900,000 (90 \n     percent of $1 million), reducing AMTI to $100,000. The \n     taxpayer must then further reduce the AMTI by a manufacturing \n     deduction of $3,000 (three percent of the lesser of $1 \n     million or $100,000) to $97,000. The ATNOL carryover to 2006 \n     is $4,100,000.\n       The provision coordinates the computation of adjusted \n     taxable income of a corporation for purposes of computing a \n     corporation's limitation on the deduction for interest on \n     certain indebtedness with the deduction under section 199. \n     The provision also coordinates the computation of taxable \n     income for purposes of computing a corporation's charitable \n     contribution deduction and a taxpayer's deduction for \n     percentage depletion with respect to oil and gas wells with \n     the deduction under section 199.\n       The provision clarifies that, in applying the effective \n     date of the deduction under section 199, items arising from a \n     taxable year of a partnership, S corporation, estate, or \n     trust beginning before 2005 are not taken into account for \n     purposes of the rules providing that the deduction is \n     determined at the shareholder, partner or similar level and \n     the application of the wage limitation with respect to such \n     entities.\n       Family members treated as one shareholder of an S \n     corporation election (Act sec. 231).--The provision repeals \n     the requirement that a family must elect to be treated as one \n     shareholder for purposes of determining the number of \n     shareholders for purposes of subchapter S. The provision also \n     provides that the determination of whether a common ancestor \n     is more that six generations removed from the youngest \n     generation of shareholders is made at the latest of (i) the \n     date the subchapter S election is made; (ii) the date a \n     family member first holds stock in the S corporation; or \n     (iii) October 22, 2004.\n       The provision treats the estate of a family member as a \n     member of the family for purposes of determining the number \n     of shareholders.\n       The provision also conforms the provision relating to \n     certain adopted individuals and foster children with the \n     amendments made by title II of the Working Families Tax \n     Relief Act of 2004.\n       Transfer of suspended losses incident to divorce (Act sec. \n     235).--The effective date of section 235 of the Act is \n     corrected to provide that it is effective for transfers after \n     December 31, 2004.\n       REIT provisions (Act sec. 243).--The provision clarifies \n     that a REIT may cure de minimis failures of asset \n     requirements (other than the requirement that the REIT may \n     not hold more than 10 percent (five percent for certain prior \n     years) of the value of securities of a single issuer, for \n     which failure-specific procedures are provided) by using the \n     same procedures as the REIT may use for larger failures of \n     asset tests.\n       The provision clarifies that the new rules that permit the \n     curing of certain REIT failures apply to failures with \n     respect to which the requirements of the new rules are \n     satisfied in taxable years of the REIT beginning after the \n     date of enactment. Similarly, the provision clarifies that \n     the new rules governing deficiency dividends that allow the \n     taxpayer to make a determination by filing a statement with \n     the IRS apply to statements filed in taxable years of the \n     REIT beginning after the date of enactment.\n       It is intended that the provisions of the Act that allow a \n     REIT to correct failures of REIT qualification without losing \n     its REIT status apply to corrections of failures for which \n     the requirements for correction are satisfied after the date \n     of enactment, regardless of whether such failures occurred in \n     taxable years beginning on, before, or after the date of \n     enactment. Similarly, it is intended that the provisions of \n     the Act that allow deficiency dividends under section 860 to \n     correct distribution failures, provided the deficiency is \n     identified in a statement filed after the date of enactment \n     in accordance with the provisions of the Act, apply to \n     failures occurring in taxable years beginning on, before, or \n     after the date of enactment.\n       The provision clarifies that the new hedging rules apply to \n     transactions entered into in taxable years beginning after \n     the date of enactment.\n       The provision clarifies that securities of a partnership \n     held by a REIT prior to the date of enactment of the Act, \n     that would have qualified as straight debt securities if the \n     Act had never been enacted by virtue of the prior law \n     requirement that the REIT hold at least 20 percent of the \n     partnership equity, will continue to qualify (regardless of \n     whether they were disposed of before the date of enactment or \n     whether the REIT has disposed of its interest in the \n     partnership equity to the 1-percent-or-less interest required \n     by the Act) while held by the REIT (or its successor) until \n     the earlier of the disposition or the original maturity date \n     of such securities.\n       Expensing of certain films and television production costs \n     (Act sec. 244).--The provision clarifies that the $15 million \n     production cost limitation and the 75 percent qualified \n     compensation requirement are determined on an episode-by-\n     episode basis (not an aggregate basis).\n       The provision adds rules for recapture as ordinary income \n     of the deduction for expensing of certain films and \n     television production costs in a manner similar to the \n     recapture rules applicable to expensing under Code section \n     179.\n       Railroad track maintenance credit (Act sec. 245).--For \n     purposes of the rule that prevents the claiming of the credit \n     by more than one eligible taxpayer with respect to the same \n     mile of track, the provision clarifies that Class II and \n     Class III railroads that operate track under a lease are not \n     required to obtain assignment from the track owner in order \n     to utilize or assign the credit. Under the provision, the \n     credit is limited in respect of the total number of miles of \n     track (1) owned or leased by the Class II or Class III \n     railroad and (2) assigned by the Class II or Class III \n     railroad for purposes of the credit.\n       The provision clarifies that a Class I railroad is not \n     treated as a Class II or III railroad for purposes of the \n     credit (and it is not eligible to claim the credit with \n     respect to track it owns) by reason of performing track \n     maintenance services (on the same or different track) for a \n     Class II or III railroad.\n       The provision also clarifies the rules governing the \n     assignment of track by Class II or III railroads. A track \n     mile may be assigned only once per tax year, effective at the \n     close of the tax year, and any track mile assigned may not \n     also be taken into account by the assignor taxpayer for the \n     tax year. An assigned track mile is taken into account by the \n     assignee in the tax year which includes the effective date of \n     the assignment.\n       Election to determine corporate tax on certain \n     international shipping activities using per ton rate (Act \n     sec. 248).--The provision strikes as deadwood the rule added \n     by the Act regarding the operation of a qualifying vessel by \n     a non-electing corporation that is a member of an electing \n     group.\n       The provision clarifies section 1354(b) to provide that an \n     election to determine income tax on certain international \n     shipping activities using a per ton rate is timely if made on \n     or before the due date (including extensions) for filing the \n     tax return for the relevant taxable year.\n       The provision clarifies the treatment of operating \n     agreements under the tonnage tax rules. An operating \n     agreement is not a charter, but is instead an agreement with \n     an\n\n[[Page S14050]]\n\n     owner or charterer of a qualifying vessel to provide \n     operating or management services in respect of a qualifying \n     vessel, for example, crew, technical, or commercial services. \n     The provision makes clear that a person providing services \n     for a vessel under an operating agreement is treated as \n     operating the vessel and may elect tonnage tax treatment, \n     assuming the other requirements for such treatment are met. \n     However, a subcontractor to a person providing services under \n     an operating agreement is neither treated as providing \n     services under an operating agreement nor as operating a \n     vessel for purposes of the tonnage tax. The provision of \n     equipment, tools, provisions, or supplies would not be \n     considered an operating agreement or part of an operating \n     agreement unless such equipment, tools, provisions, or \n     supplies are provided by the person providing the services \n     under the operating agreement, and such equipment, tools, \n     provisions, or supplies are provided in connection with such \n     services.\n       Present law provides that in order to elect tonnage tax \n     treatment, a person must meet a shipping activity requirement \n     as well as ``operate'' a qualifying vessel. In general, the \n     shipping activity requirement is met for a taxable year if, \n     on average during such year, at least 25 percent of the \n     aggregate tonnage of qualifying vessels ``used'' by the \n     corporation (or controlled group) are owned by such \n     corporation (or controlled group) or are chartered to such \n     corporation (or controlled group) on bareboat charter terms. \n     It is intended that a person providing services under an \n     operating agreement is deemed to be ``using'' tonnage of \n     qualifying vessels, and the appropriate amount of such \n     tonnage is taken into account for purposes of this test. For \n     example, if a corporation (not a member of a controlled \n     group) meets the shipping activity requirement by owning or \n     bareboat chartering sufficient tonnage of other qualifying \n     vessels, it will qualify for 82 the tonnage tax provisions in \n     respect of any qualifying vessel that it is treated as \n     operating by reason of providing services under an operating \n     agreement.\n       The provision clarifies that interests in operating \n     agreements are taken into account for purposes of allocating \n     the notional shipping income from the operation of qualifying \n     vessels among respective ownership, charter, and operating \n     agreement interests. In addition, in the case of a \n     partnership operating a vessel, the extent of a partner's \n     ownership, charter, or operating agreement interest is \n     determined on the basis of the partner's interest in the \n     partnership.\n       The provision makes a clerical amendment by eliminating \n     subparagraph (B) of section 1355(c)(3) of the Code, because \n     the rule of subparagraph (B) is encompassed in subparagraph \n     (A).\n       Computation of foreign tax credit in determining \n     alternative minimum tax by farmers and fisherman using income \n     averaging (Act sec. 314).--The provision clarifies that in \n     computing the regular tax for purposes of determining the \n     alternative minimum tax of a farmer or fisherman using income \n     averaging, the foreign tax credit does not need to be \n     recomputed.\n       Reforestation expensing recapture (Act sec. 322).--The \n     provision clarifies that the amortization provision applies \n     to trusts and estates, but the deduction applies to estates \n     (and not to trusts).\n       The provision provides that Code section 1245 is expanded \n     to provide recapture rules for the new expensing provisions \n     of Code section 194(b) (reforestation).\n       Depreciation allowance for aircraft (Act sec. 336).--\n     Present-law rules for additional first-year depreciation \n     provide criteria under which certain noncommercial aircraft, \n     and certain property having longer production periods (as \n     described in Code section 168(k)(2)(B)), can qualify for the \n     extended placed-in-service date. The provision clarifies that \n     either noncommercial aircraft or property having a longer \n     production period can qualify.\n       Recharacterization of overall domestic loss (Act sec. \n     402)--The provision clarifies that, in a case in which an \n     overall domestic loss is used as a carryback, the requirement \n     in Code section 904(g)(2) that the taxpayer have elected the \n     benefits of the foreign tax credit applies to the taxable \n     year in which the loss is used.\n       Look-through rules to apply to dividends from noncontrolled \n     section 902 corporations (Act sec. 403).--The provision adds \n     a transition rule under which a taxpayer may elect not to \n     apply the Act's look-through rules to taxable years beginning \n     before January 1, 2005.\n       Look-through treatment for sales of partnership interests \n     (Act sec. 412).--The provision clarifies that constructive \n     ownership is taken into account in determining whether a \n     controlled foreign corporation is a 25-percent owner of a \n     partnership for purposes of the rule treating a sale of a \n     partnership interest as a sale of a proportionate share of \n     the assets of the partnership. This provision conforms the \n     statutory language to the legislative history of the Act.\n       Repeal of foreign personal holding company rules and \n     foreign investment company rules (Act sec. 413).--The \n     provision repeals as deadwood Code section 532(b)(2), \n     which coordinated the foreign personal holding company and \n     accumulated earnings tax regimes, and instead provides \n     that in computing a corporation's accumulated taxable \n     income, a deduction is allowed in the amount of any income \n     of the corporation that resulted in an inclusion for a \n     U.S. shareholder under Code section 951(a). In the case of \n     a corporation that is otherwise subject to the accumulated \n     earnings tax on a gross basis (under Treas. Reg. sec. \n     1.535-1(b)), appropriate adjustments are made to this \n     deductible amount to take into account deductions that may \n     have reduced the inclusion under Code section 951(a), but \n     which would not otherwise have been allowable in computing \n     accumulated taxable income. For example, in the case of a \n     corporation that is generally subject to the accumulated \n     earnings tax on a gross basis, if Code section 954(b)(5) \n     has had the effect of reducing the amount of a subpart F \n     inclusion, it would be appropriate to reduce accumulated \n     taxable income by the amount that would have been included \n     under Code section 951(a) without applying Code section \n     954(b)(5).\n       The provision also repeals as deadwood Code section 6683, \n     which addresses the failure of a foreign corporation to file \n     a required personal holding company return, a rule that is no \n     longer needed in light of the provision of the Act exempting \n     foreign corporations from the personal holding company rules.\n       Modifications to treatment of aircraft leasing and shipping \n     (Act. sec. 415).--The provision clarifies that, for purposes \n     of the foreign tax credit limitation as in effect for taxable \n     years beginning before January 1, 2007, shipping income was \n     defined to include income that meets the definition of \n     foreign base company shipping income as in effect before the \n     definition was repealed under section 415 of the Act. The \n     repeal is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations \n     beginning after December 31, 2004, and taxable years of \n     United States shareholders with or within which such taxable \n     years of foreign corporations end.\n       Application of FIRPTA to distributions from REITS (Act sec. \n     418).--The provision clarifies that the new rules providing \n     an exception from FIRPTA do not apply to regulated investment \n     companies (``RICs''), but only to real estate investment \n     trusts (``REITs'').\n       The provision clarifies that the period of time during \n     which a foreign shareholder may not have held more than five \n     percent of the class of stock with respect to which the \n     distribution is made is the one-year period ending on the \n     date of the distribution.\n       The provision clarifies that the new rules apply to any \n     distribution of a REIT that is treated as a deduction for a \n     taxable year of the REIT beginning after the date of \n     enactment.\n       The provision clarifies that the new rules also apply to \n     deficiency dividends under section 860 that are paid after \n     the date of enactment but that are treated as deductible in \n     taxable years beginning on or prior to the date of enactment. \n     Such dividends qualify for the exclusion from FIRPTA \n     treatment under the Act if the other requirements of the Act \n     are met.\n       Incentives to reinvest foreign earnings in the United \n     States (Act sec. 422).--The provision amends Code section \n     965(a)(2)(B) to clarify that distributions made indirectly \n     through tiers of controlled foreign corporations are eligible \n     for the benefits of Code section 965 only if they originate \n     with a dividend received by one controlled foreign \n     corporation from another controlled foreign corporation in \n     the same chain of ownership described in Code section 958(a). \n     Thus, the first dividend in the sequence cannot be a \n     portfolio dividend received by a controlled foreign \n     corporation, for example.\n       The provision clarifies that for purposes of determining \n     the amount of excess dividends eligible for the deduction, \n     only cash dividends received during the elected taxable year \n     are taken into account under Code section 965(b)(2)(A). (The \n     base-period amounts described in Code section 965(b)(2)(B) \n     include non-cash dividends, as well as cash dividends and \n     certain other amounts.)\n       The provision also provides the Treasury Secretary with \n     explicit regulatory authority to prevent the avoidance of the \n     purposes of Code section 965(b)(3), which reduces the amount \n     of eligible dividends in certain cases in which an increase \n     in related-party indebtedness has occurred after October 3, \n     2004. Regulations issued pursuant to this authority may \n     include rules to provide that cash dividends are not taken \n     into account under Code section 965(a) to the extent \n     attributable to the direct or indirect transfer of cash or \n     other property from a related person to a controlled foreign \n     corporation (including through the use of intervening \n     entities or capital contributions). It is expected that this \n     authority, which supplements existing principles relating to \n     the treatment of circular flows of cash, would be used to \n     prevent the application of the deduction in the case of a \n     dividend that is effectively funded by the U.S. shareholder \n     or its affiliates that are not controlled foreign \n     corporations. It is anticipated that dividends would be \n     treated as attributable to a related-party transfer of cash \n     or other property under this authority only in cases in which \n     the transfer is part of an arrangement undertaken with a \n     principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of the related-\n     party debt rule of Code section 965(b)(3).\n       For example, if a U.S. shareholder, as part of a plan to \n     avoid the purposes of Code section 965(b)(3), contributes \n     cash or other property to a controlled foreign corporation \n     and then has the controlled foreign corporation pay a \n     dividend to the U.S. shareholder (either to meet the base \n     period repatriation level or as a dividend described in Code \n     section 965(a)), or has the controlled foreign corporation \n     lend the cash or other property to another controlled foreign \n     corporation which\n\n[[Page S14051]]\n\n     then pays a dividend to the U.S. shareholder, regulations \n     issued under this authority may require the U.S. shareholder \n     to reduce its Code section 965(a) qualifying dividends by the \n     amount of cash or other property contributed. In addition, if \n     as part of a plan to avoid the purposes of Code section \n     965(b)(3), a U.S. shareholder makes a loan to a controlled \n     foreign corporation after October 3, 2004, such controlled \n     foreign corporation pays a dividend to the U.S. shareholder, \n     and then the U.S. shareholder disposes of the stock of the \n     controlled foreign corporation, such that the U.S. \n     shareholder is not related to the controlled foreign \n     corporation on the last day of the U.S. shareholder's \n     election year, regulations issued under this authority may \n     require the U.S. shareholder to reduce its Code section \n     965(a) qualifying dividends by the amount of the loan.\n       It is anticipated that many other transfers of cash or \n     other property will not be regarded as effectively funding \n     dividend repatriations for purposes of this regulatory \n     authority. For example, if a U.S. shareholder, in the \n     ordinary course of its trade or business, transfers cash or \n     other property to a controlled foreign corporation in \n     exchange for property or the provision of services, such a \n     transfer will not be considered to have a principal purpose \n     of avoiding the purposes of Code section 965(b)(3). Likewise, \n     if a related person transfers cash to a controlled foreign \n     corporation in a sale of assets by the controlled foreign \n     corporation to the related person for non- tax business \n     purposes, such a transfer will not be considered to have a \n     principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of Code section \n     965(b)(3). Similarly, a transfer of cash or other property \n     to a controlled foreign corporation for purposes of \n     providing initial or ongoing working capital to the \n     controlled foreign corporation or expanding the controlled \n     foreign corporation's operations will not be considered to \n     have a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of Code \n     section 965(b)(3). In addition, a transfer by a U.S. \n     shareholder in repayment of an obligation owed to a \n     controlled foreign corporation will not be considered to \n     have a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of Code \n     section 965(b)(3), absent special circumstances indicating \n     that the U.S. shareholder is using the repayment \n     effectively to fund the dividend repatriation. It is \n     expected that these special circumstances would not be \n     found to exist in cases involving the repayment of short-\n     term debt (i.e., debt with a term of no more than three \n     years).\n       In light of the timing of this bill and the fact that Code \n     section 965 will expire for many affected taxpayers at the \n     end of 2005, it is understood that the Treasury Department in \n     all likelihood will not issue regulations under this \n     authority. If no such regulations are issued, it would be \n     expected that generally applicable tax principles would be \n     invoked to reach results consistent with the principles and \n     examples described above.\n       The provision also clarifies the definition of ``applicable \n     financial statement'' under Code section 965(c)(1). In the \n     case of a U.S. shareholder that is required to file a \n     financial statement with the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission (or is included in such a statement filed by \n     another person), the provision clarifies that the applicable \n     financial statement is the most recent audited annual \n     statement that was so filed and certified on or before June \n     30, 2003. For purposes of this rule, a restatement of a \n     previously filed and certified financial statement that \n     occurs after June 30, 2003 does not alter the statement's \n     status as having been filed and certified on or before June \n     30, 2003. In addition, the provision clarifies that the term \n     ``applicable financial statement'' includes the notes that \n     form an integral part of the financial statement; other \n     materials, including work papers or materials that may be \n     filed for some purposes with a financial statement but that \n     do not form an integral part of such statement, may not be \n     relied upon for purposes of producing an earnings or tax \n     number under the provision. For example, if a note that is an \n     integral part of an applicable financial statement states \n     that the U.S. shareholder has not provided for deferred taxes \n     on $1 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign \n     subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be \n     reinvested permanently (or indefinitely) abroad, the U.S. \n     shareholder's limit under Code section 965(b)(1) is $1 \n     billion. If an applicable financial statement does not show a \n     specific earnings or tax amount described in Code section \n     965(b)(1)(B) or (C), a taxpayer cannot rely on underlying \n     work papers or other materials that are not a part of the \n     financial statement to derive such an amount. If an \n     applicable financial statement states that an earnings or tax \n     amount is indeterminate (or that determination of a specific \n     amount of earnings or taxes is not feasible), then the \n     earnings or tax amount so described is treated as being zero. \n     A specific earnings or tax amount can be relied upon for \n     purposes of Code section 965(b)(1) as long as such amount is \n     presented on the applicable financial statement as satisfying \n     the indefinite reversal criterion of Accounting Principles \n     Board Opinion 23 (``APB 23'') relating to deferred taxes on \n     undistributed foreign earnings, and is disclosed as required \n     under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 109 \n     (``FAS 109''), regardless of whether the exact words \n     ``permanently reinvested'' are used, and regardless of \n     whether APB 23 or FAS 109 is cited by name.\n       The provision also clarifies that the expense disallowance \n     rule of Code section 965(d)(2) applies only to deductions for \n     expenses that are directly allocable to the deductible \n     portion of the dividend. For these purposes, an expense is \n     ``directly allocable'' if it relates directly to generating \n     the dividend income in question. Thus, deductions for direct \n     expenses such as certain legal and accounting fees and \n     stewardship costs are disallowed under this provision. \n     Deductions for indirect expenses such as interest, research \n     and experimentation costs, sales and marketing costs, state \n     and local taxes, general and administrative costs, and \n     depreciation and amortization are not disallowed under this \n     provision.\n       In addition, the provision clarifies that foreign taxes \n     that are not allowed as foreign tax credits by reason of Code \n     section 965(d) do not give rise to income inclusions under \n     Code section 78.\n       The provision also clarifies that under Code section \n     965(e)(1), the only foreign tax credits that may be used to \n     reduce the tax on the nondeductible portion of a dividend are \n     credits for foreign taxes that are attributable to the \n     nondeductible portion of the dividend. Credits for other \n     foreign taxes cannot be used to reduce the tax on the \n     nondeductible portion of the dividend.\n       The provision also clarifies Code section 965(f) to provide \n     that an election to apply Code section 965 is timely if made \n     on or before the due date (including extensions) for filing \n     the tax return for the relevant taxable year.\n       Treatment of deduction for State and local sales taxes \n     under the alternative minimum tax (Act sec. 501).--The \n     provision clarifies that the itemized deduction for State and \n     local sales taxes does not apply in calculating alternative \n     minimum taxable income.\n       Naval shipbuilding (Act sec. 708).--The provision provides \n     that the five-taxable year period for use of the 40/60 \n     percentage-of-completion/capitalized cost method is \n     determined with respect to the construction commencement \n     date, not the contract commencement date. The provision \n     further provides that any change of accounting method \n     required by the provision is not subject to section 481.\n       Credit for production of refined coal (Act sec. 710).--The \n     provision strikes the word ``synthetic'' from the definition \n     of refined coal to carry out the intent that qualifying solid \n     fuels produced from coal (including lignite) meet two new \n     primary standards, an emissions reduction test and a value \n     enhancement test, and not also be subject to a ``chemical \n     change'' test promulgated under Treasury guidance for certain \n     fuels from coal to qualify for credit under Code sec. 29.\n       Tax treatment of expatriated entities and their foreign \n     parents (Act sec. 801).--The provision clarifies that the \n     inversion gain rule of Code section 7874(a)(1) does not apply \n     to an entity that is an expatriated entity with respect to an \n     entity that is treated as a domestic corporation under Code \n     section 7874(b).\n       Expatriation of individuals (Act sec. 804).--The provision \n     clarifies that the exception to the requirement of minimal \n     prior physical presence in the United States is both for (i) \n     teachers, students, athletes, and foreign government \n     individuals, and (ii) individuals receiving medical \n     attention.\n       The provision clarifies that the Act does not create an \n     additional requirement that an individual file a statement \n     under section 6039G if such a filing was not already required \n     under present law.\n       The provision clarifies that taxpayers who lose citizenship \n     or terminate long-term resident status will continue to be \n     treated for Federal tax purposes as citizens or long-term \n     residents until they meet the notice and information \n     reporting requirements of section 7701(n).\n       Penalty for failure to disclose reportable transactions \n     (Act sec. 811).--The provision clarifies that the penalty for \n     failing to disclose participation in a reportable transaction \n     applies to returns and statements that are filed after the \n     date of enactment, without regard to the original or extended \n     due date for such return or statement.\n       Accuracy-related penalties for listed transactions and \n     reportable transactions with a significant tax avoidance \n     purpose (Act sec. 812).--The provision clarifies that \n     underpayments attributable to an understatement resulting \n     from participation in a listed transaction or a reportable \n     transaction with a significant tax avoidance purpose are not \n     subject to accuracy-related penalties under section 6662 to \n     the extent that an accuracy-related penalty under section \n     6662A is imposed upon such underpayment. (However, in the \n     case of underpayments resulting from substantial valuation \n     misstatements, the accuracy-related penalty under section \n     6662A does not apply to the extent that the accuracy-related \n     penalty under section 6662 is applied to such underpayments \n     (i.e., the section 6662 penalty amount is increased under \n     section 6662(h) because the substantial valuation \n     misstatement is determined to be a gross valuation \n     misstatement).) The provision clarifies that accuracy-related \n     penalties under section 6662A do not apply to underpayments \n     to which a fraud penalty under section 6663 is applied.\n       The provision clarifies that, with respect to disqualified \n     opinions, the strengthened reasonable cause exception to \n     section 6662A penalties does not apply to the opinion of a \n     tax advisor if (1) the opinion was provided to the taxpayer \n     before the date of enactment, (2) the opinion relates to a \n     transaction entered into before the date of enactment, and \n     (3) the tax treatment of items relating to the transaction \n     was included on a return or\n\n[[Page S14052]]\n\n     statement filed by the taxpayer before the date enactment.\n       Statute of limitations for unreported listed transactions \n     (Act sec. 814).--The Act provides that the statute of \n     limitations with respect to an undisclosed listed transaction \n     does not expire until one year after the earlier of (1) the \n     date on which the Secretary is furnished the required \n     information, or (2) the date on which a material advisor \n     satisfies the list maintenance requirements with respect to a \n     request by the Secretary. The provision clarifies that a \n     ``material advisor'' for this purpose includes either a \n     material advisor as defined in section 6111(b)(1) or, in the \n     case of material aid, assistance, or advice rendered on or \n     before the date of enactment, a material advisor as defined \n     in Treasury regulations under section 6112. (See Treas. Reg. \n     sec. 301.6112-1(c)(2).)\n       Material advisor list maintenance requirement and penalty \n     (Act sec. 815).--The provision clarifies that the penalty \n     under section 6708 for failing to comply with the section \n     6112 list maintenance requirements applies to both (1) \n     material advisors with respect to reportable transactions \n     under present-law section 6112, and (2) organizers and \n     sellers of potentially abusive 88 tax shelters under prior-\n     law section 6112. (This provision also would clarify the \n     determination of the date on which a material advisor \n     satisfies the list maintenance requirements for purposes of \n     the extended statute of limitations for undisclosed listed \n     transactions under section 814 of the Act.)\n       Minimum holding period for withholding taxes on gain and \n     income other than dividends (Act sec. 832).--The provision \n     clarifies that the exception from the minimum holding period \n     for certain withholding taxes paid by registered or licensed \n     brokers and dealers on income and gain from securities also \n     apply to gain from the sale of stock.\n       Disallowance of certain partnership loss transfers (Act \n     sec. 833).--The provision redrafts the wording of the \n     provision relating to basis adjustments to undistributed \n     partnership property in Code section 734(b) to clarify that \n     it applies in the case of a distribution of property to a \n     partner by a partnership with respect to which there is a \n     substantial basis reduction.\n       Repeal of special rules for FASITs and modifications to \n     rules for REMICs (Act sec. 835).--The provision clarifies \n     that, if more than 50 percent of the obligations transferred \n     to, or purchased by, a REMIC are originated by a government \n     entity and are principally secured by an interest in real \n     property, then each obligation originated by a government \n     entity and transferred to, or purposed by, the REMIC is \n     treated as principally secured by an interest in real \n     property. Thus, the provision more closely aligns this rule \n     with the ``principally secured'' standard that generally is \n     provided by the definition of a qualified mortgage, and the \n     provision clarifies that the treatment of obligations as \n     principally secured by an interest in real property under \n     this rule does not extend to obligations that are not \n     originated by a government entity.\n       Importation or transfer of built-in losses (Act sec. \n     836).--The provision provides that on the tax-free \n     liquidation of a corporation, the fair market value basis \n     rule applies only to property described in section \n     362(e)(1)(B), i.e., property which became subject to U.S. \n     income tax on the liquidation. The provision is drafted to \n     conform the scope of the liquidation rule to the rule \n     applicable to transfers of property by shareholders to \n     corporations.\n       The provision provides that the election under section \n     362(e)(2)(C) to apply the basis limitation to the \n     transferor's stock basis is made at such time and in such \n     form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe, and, once \n     made, is irrevocable.\n       Sale of principal residence following section 1031 exchange \n     (Act sec. 840).--The provision clarifies that the exclusion \n     under section 121 is denied on the sale or exchange of a \n     principal residence by a taxpayer who did not recognize gain \n     under section 1031 on the exchange in which the residence was \n     acquired (or a by person whose basis in the residence is \n     determined in whole or in part with reference to the basis of \n     the residence in the hands of that taxpayer). The provision \n     also makes a clerical change to the numbering of paragraphs.\n       Limitation on deductions allocable to property used by tax-\n     exempt entities (Act sec. 849).--The Act establishes rules to \n     limit deductions that are allocable to tax-exempt use \n     property. For this purpose, the Act generally defines ``tax-\n     exempt use property'' by reference to the definition provided \n     in section 168(h). Section 168(h) generally provides that \n     tax-exempt use property includes tangible property that is \n     leased to a tax-exempt entity, as well as certain property \n     owned by a partnership that has a tax-exempt partner and \n     provides for certain special allocations. The provision \n     clarifies that the deduction limitation rules established \n     by the Act apply without regard to whether the tax-exempt \n     use property is treated as such by reason of a lease or \n     otherwise (e.g., because the property is owned by a \n     partnership that has a tax-exempt partner and provides for \n     certain special allocations). In the case of property \n     treated as tax-exempt use property other than by reason of \n     a lease, the provision clarifies that the deduction \n     limitation rules generally are effective for property \n     acquired after March 12, 2004.\n       Reporting with respect to donations of motor vehicles, \n     boats and airplanes (Act sec. 884).--The provision clarifies \n     that the acknowledgement by the donee organization is to \n     include whether the donee organization provided any goods or \n     services in consideration of the vehicle, and a description \n     and good faith estimate of the value of any such goods or \n     services, or, if the goods or services consist solely of \n     intangible religious benefits, a statement to that effect.\n       Nonqualified deferred compensation plans (Act sec. 885).--\n     The provision clarifies that the additional tax and interest \n     under the nonqualified deferred compensation provision of the \n     Act are not treated as payments of regular tax for \n     alternative minimum tax purposes. The provision also \n     clarifies that the application of the rule providing that \n     certain additional deferrals must be for a period of not less \n     than five years is not limited to the first payment for which \n     deferral is made. The provision also clarifies that Treasury \n     Department guidance providing a limited period during which \n     plans can conform to the requirements applies to plans \n     adopted before January 1, 2005. The provision also clarifies \n     that the effective date of the funding provisions relating to \n     offshore trusts and financial triggers is January 1, 2005. \n     Thus, for example, amounts set aside in an offshore trust \n     before such date for the purpose of paying deferred \n     compensation and plans providing for the restriction of \n     assets in connection with a change in the employer's \n     financial health are subject to the funding provisions on \n     January 1, 2005. Under the provision, not later than 90 days \n     after the date of enactment of this provision, the Secretary \n     of the Treasury shall issue guidance under which a \n     nonqualified deferred compensation plan which is in violation \n     of the requirements of the funding provisions relating to \n     offshore trusts and financial triggers will be treated as not \n     violating such requirements if the plan comes into \n     conformance with such requirements during a limited period as \n     specified by the Secretary in guidance. For example, trusts \n     or assets set aside outside of the United States that would \n     otherwise result in income inclusion and interest under the \n     provision as of January 1, 2005, may be modified to come into \n     conformance with the provision during the limited period of \n     time as specified by the Secretary.\n       Identified straddles (Act sec. 888).--The provision \n     clarifies that taxpayers are permitted to identify a straddle \n     as an identified straddle under section 1092(a)(2)(B) (by \n     making a clear and unambiguous identification on their books \n     and records) without regard to whether the Secretary has \n     prescribed regulations under the mandate in that section. The \n     provision provides that the Secretary's mandate under the \n     provision is to issue guidance in the form of regulations or \n     in another form.\n       Modification of treatment of transfers to creditors in \n     divisive reorganizations (Act sec. 898).--The provision \n     clarifies that the amount of the adjusted basis of property \n     that is taken into account for purposes of Code section \n     361(b)(3) is reduced by the liabilities assumed (within the \n     meaning of Code section 357(c)).\n       Nonqualified preferred stock (Act sec. 899).--The provision \n     clarifies that the ``real and meaningful likelihood'' \n     requirement under the Act (which applies so that stock shall \n     not be treated as participating in corporate growth to any \n     significant extent unless there is a ``real and meaningful \n     likelihood'' of the shareholder actually participating in the \n     earnings and growth of the corporation) applies also for \n     purposes of determining whether stock is not stock that is \n     ``limited and preferred as to dividends.''\n       Consistent amortization period for intangibles and \n     treatment of partnership organizational expenses (Act sec. \n     902).--The provision corrects the reference to ``taxpayers'' \n     to refer to ``partnerships'' in the rules relating to \n     deduction or amortization of partnership organizational \n     expenses.\n       Limitation of employer deduction for certain entertainment \n     expenses (Act sec. 907).--Section 907 of the Act limits the \n     deduction for certain entertainment expenses with respect to \n     specified individuals. A specified individual is defined as \n     any individual subject to the requirements of section 16(a) \n     of the Securities Act of 1934 with respect to the taxpayer or \n     who would be subject to such requirements if the taxpayer \n     were an issuer of equity securities. The provision clarifies \n     that a specified individual includes an individual who is \n     subject to the requirements of section 16(a) of the \n     Securities Act of 1934 with respect to a related entity of \n     the taxpayer or who would be subject to such requirements if \n     the related entity were an issuer of equity securities.\n     Amendment Related to the Working Families Tax Relief Act of \n         2004\n       Uniform definition of child (Act secs. 201, 203 and 207).--\n     The provision makes conforming amendments, consistent with \n     those enacted with respect to various other provisions, for \n     purposes of health savings accounts, the dependent care \n     credit, and dependent care assistance programs. Under the \n     conforming amendments, an individual may qualify as a \n     dependent for these limited purposes without regard to \n     whether the individual has gross income that exceeds an \n     otherwise applicable gross income limitation or is married \n     and files a joint return. In addition, such an individual who \n     is treated as a dependent under these conforming amendment \n     provisions is not subject to the general rule that a \n     dependent of a taxpayer shall be treated as having no \n     dependents for the taxable year of such individual beginning \n     in such calendar year.\n\n[[Page S14053]]\n\n       The provision clarifies Code section 152(e) to permit a \n     divorced or legally separated custodial parent to waive, by \n     written declaration, his or her right to claim a child as a \n     dependent for purposes of the dependency exemption and child \n     credit (but not with respect to other child-related tax \n     benefits). By means of the waiver, the noncustodial parent is \n     granted the right to claim the child as a dependent for these \n     purposes. The provision clarifies that the waiver rules under \n     the uniform definition of qualifying child operate as under \n     prior law.\n     Amendment Related to the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief \n         Reconciliation Act of 2003\n       Bonus depreciation (Act sec. 201).--Present-law rules for \n     additional first-year depreciation provide criteria under \n     which certain noncommercial aircraft, and certain property \n     having longer production periods (as described in Code \n     section 168(k)(2)(B)), can qualify for the extended placed-\n     in-service date. The provision clarifies that property \n     acquired and placed in service during 2005 pursuant to a \n     written binding contract which was entered into after May \n     5, 2003, and before January 1, 2005, is eligible for 50-\n     percent additional first-year depreciation deduction.\n       The provision corrects the reference to a date in the rules \n     applicable to qualified New York Liberty Zone property so \n     that it refers to the January 1, 2005, date in the \n     corresponding rule for additional first-year depreciation in \n     Code section 168(k).\n     Amendments Related to the Victims of Terrorism Tax Relief Act \n         of 2001\n       Rules relating to disclosure of taxpayer return information \n     (Act sec. 201).--The provision corrects cross references \n     within the disclosure rules (Code section 6103) relating to \n     disclosure to the National Archives and Records \n     Administration.\n     Amendments Related to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \n         Reconciliation Act of 2001\n       Option to treat elective deferral as after-tax Roth \n     contributions (Act sec. 617).--A special rule allows \n     employees with at least 15 years of service with certain \n     organizations to make additional elective deferrals to a tax-\n     deferred annuity, subject to an annual and cumulative limit. \n     The cumulative limit is $15,000, reduced by any additional \n     pretax elective deferrals made for preceding years. For \n     taxable years beginning after 2005, plans may allow employees \n     to designate pretax elective deferrals as Roth contributions. \n     Under the provision, the $15,000 cumulative limit is reduced \n     also by designated Roth contributions made for preceding \n     years.\n       Equitable treatment for contributions to defined \n     contribution plans (Act sec. 632).--Under the law as in \n     effect before the Act, a special limit applied to \n     contributions to tax-sheltered annuities for foreign \n     missionaries with adjusted gross income not exceeding \n     $17,000. The special limit was inadvertently dropped by the \n     Act. The special limit was restored in a technical correction \n     in the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, but \n     did not accurately reflect the pre-Act rule. The provision \n     revises the special limit to reflect the pre-Act rule.\n     Amendments Related to the Internal Revenue Service \n         Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998\n       Special procedures for third-party summons (Act sec. \n     3415).--Code section 7609(c)(2)(F) provides that section 7609 \n     does not apply to a summons described in subsection (f) or \n     (g), which refers to a John Doe summons and certain emergency \n     summonses, respectively. The provision corrects this \n     reference, so as to make only the notice procedures of \n     section 7609(a) inapplicable to a John Doe summons or an \n     emergency summons, rather than making the entire section 7609 \n     inapplicable.\n     Amendments Related to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997\n       Tentative carryback and refund adjustments and treatment of \n     carrybacks or adjustments for certain unused deductions (Act \n     sec. 1055).--The provision corrects a reference in rules \n     relating to tentative carryback and refund adjustments to \n     refer to coordination rules in Code section 6611(f)(4)(B). \n     The provision also corrects a reference in rules relating to \n     92 carrybacks or adjustments of certain unused deductions to \n     refer to the filing date within the meaning of Code section \n     6611(f)(4)(B).\n       Adjustments to basis of stock in controlled foreign \n     corporations (Act sec. 1112(b)).--The provision clarifies \n     that the basis adjustments of Code section 961(c) apply not \n     only with respect to the stock of the controlled foreign \n     corporation that earns the subpart F income that gives rise \n     to the basis adjustments, but also with respect to the stock \n     of higher-tier controlled foreign corporations in the same \n     chain of ownership.\n       Notice of certain transfers to foreign persons (Act sec. \n     1144).--The provision corrects the omission of a conjunction \n     in the description of transfers that are generally subject to \n     certain information reporting requirements.\n     Amendment Related to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n         1990\n       Depreciation of certain solar- or wind-powered equipment \n     (Act sec. 11813).--The provision clarifies that 5-year \n     property includes certain heating, cooling, and other \n     equipment using solar or wind (rather than solar and wind) \n     energy.\n     Amendment Related to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n         1987\n       Clarification of earnings and profits and stock basis where \n     LIFO recapture tax applies (Act sec. 10227).--Under present \n     law, the LIFO recapture amount is included in the income of a \n     C corporation that becomes an S corporation for its last \n     taxable year that it was a C corporation (sec. 1363(d)). Any \n     increase in tax by reason of this inclusion is payable in \n     four equal annual installments. The provision provides that \n     the rules relating to (1) the prohibition on adjustments of \n     earnings and profits of an S corporation and (2) the \n     requirement to reduce the basis of stock of the S corporation \n     by reason of nondeductible expenses do not apply to any \n     corporate tax imposed by reason of section 1363(d). No \n     inference is intended as to the treatment of other corporate \n     taxes.\n     Clerical amendments\n       The provisions include clerical and typographical \n     amendments to the Code, which are effective upon enactment.\n\n\n                          B. Other Corrections\n\n     Amendments Related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004\n       Expansion of bank S corporation eligible shareholders to \n     include IRAs (Act sec. 233).--The provision expands the \n     provision in the Act allowing certain bank stock to be held \n     by an IRA (or to be sold by an IRA to the beneficiary) to \n     include stock in a depository holding company (as defined in \n     section 3(w)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act). A \n     depository holding company includes a bank holding company \n     and a thrift holding company.\n       Exclusion of investment securities income from passive \n     income test for bank S corporations (Act sec. 237).--The \n     provision expands the rule in the Act which provides that, in \n     the case of a bank, bank holding company, or financial \n     holding company, certain interest and dividend income is not \n     treated as passive under the S corporation passive investment \n     income rules. Under the provision, this rule applies to a \n     bank and to a depository holding company (as defined in \n     section 3(w)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act). A \n     depository holding company includes a bank holding company \n     and a thrift holding company.\n       Information returns for qualified subchapter S subsidiaries \n     (Act sec. 239).--The provision provides that an S corporation \n     and a qualified subchapter S subsidiary are recognized as \n     separate entities for purposes of making information returns, \n     except as otherwise provided by the Treasury Department.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14053-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14053-S14054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               NORTHWEST RESEARCH AND EDUCATION INSTITUTE\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the long \noverdue establishment of a continuing medical education program in \nMontana. The Northwest Research and Education Institute is a joint \nventure of St. Vincent Healthcare and Rocky Mountain Health Network, \nformed to serve the research and education needs of both the Montana \nRegion of the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth Health System which \nstretches from Butte to Miles City and the nearly 500 physicians and 7 \nhospitals associated with Rocky Mountain Health Network in Montana and \nWyoming.\n  As many know, for too long, Montana was the only state in the US \nwithout a continuing medical education accrediting entity. The other 49 \nStates have been able to provide immediate continuing education \nprograms. Montana's medical community had to go hundreds of miles out \nof State to further their education. The people of my great State \ndeserve the best health care possible, and it is imperative that \nmedical practitioners are able to continue their education. Our \nphysicians, nurses, and pharmacists have been asking for more effective \nmedical education services, and I am pleased to say that now they have \nit.\n  I am proud to have secured the initial $250,000 to assist the \nNorthwest Research and Education Institute to complete the \naccreditation process. Securing this funding for me was a top priority \nas Montanans medical practioners shouldn't have to travel hundreds, if \nnot thousands, of miles to receive their required training.\n  Continuing medical education programs provide education to \nphysicians, nurses, pharmacists, therapists, and other health care \nprofessionals to keep them up to date with the latest in medicine. \nThis, of course, translates to better health care for patients. Rural \nhealthcare providers have special needs for continuing education \nbecause they practice so far from each other and from centers of \neducation. Now that education can be obtained by a health care provider \nin Montana.\n\n[[Page S14054]]\n\n  I am particularly proud that the Northwest Research and Education \nInstitute recently completed their application and received their \naccreditation. The accreditation is a stamp of quality approval that \nputs the Northwest Research and Education Institute in a league with \nmedical schools, professional societies and other organizations which \noffer the highest standards of continuing medical education.\n  I am proud of the accomplishments of the Institute already and I am \nconfident that the Institute will continue to accomplish its goals of \nproviding quality continuing medical education programs to Montana's \nmedical community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14054-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF ROBBIE CALLAWAY\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, after 23 years of extraordinary \nservice to America's young people, Robbie Callaway, senior vice \npresident of government relations at the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, \nis moving on. Robbie's dedication to positive change and helping others \nhas been truly inspiring. He has been a magnificent advocate for \nchildren and for the Boys & Girls Clubs in Utah and all over the \ncountry.\n  Robbie's untiring commitment to youth and disadvantaged communities \ngoes back much further and encompasses much more than just his time \nwith the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Beginning as a juvenile justice \nadvocate at the National Youth Work Alliance, Robbie rose to be the \nexecutive director of that coalition of community based youth service \nagencies. In 1982, he cofounded the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children and continues to serve on its board of directors. He \nalso recently assisted the Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation in bringing \nbaseball, America's pastime, to underprivileged children. In all of \nthese endeavors, Robbie has left an ongoing legacy of hope and \ninspiration.\n  Today, there are probably only a handful of people in Congress who do \nnot know Robbie Callaway. He played a pivotal role in the passage of \nnational Amber Alert legislation. He has been instrumental in expanding \nboth the resources and reach of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, \nincluding increasing the number of clubs in public housing facilities \nand onto Indian reservations. Robbie Callaway's character, built on \nhonesty and integrity, has earned him and the organizations he has \nserved the trust of Congress.\n  Although Robbie is leaving his position with the Boys & Girls Clubs, \nhis passion for helping others remains. In his new career, he will join \nwith a dedicated group of individuals pursuing a cure for cancer. \nHaving witnessed Robbie's determination, I believe he can succeed.\n  It was a pleasure to work with Robbie Callaway and to help the Boys & \nGirls Clubs of America. We will miss Robbie's passion for children and \nfor the Boys & Girls Clubs movement. I hope to work with him in his new \npursuits, and I wish him great success and happiness, now and in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14054-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO MR.

Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to Mr. \nAlan Newman, Forest Supervisor of the Ouachita National Forest, who \nwill retire on January 3, 2006, after more than 32 years with the U.S. \nForest Service. Prior to his 10 years of service to Ouachita National \nForest, Alan worked as the Forest Supervisor and Deputy Forest \nSupervisor of the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas and has also \nserved with the U.S. Forest Service in Wisconsin, Michigan, Tennessee, \nand Kentucky. He also served as a C-130 pilot in the Air Force for 5 \nyears including 2 years of active duty in Vietnam.\n  Alan has been an asset to the Ouachita National Forest throughout his \ntenure as Forest Supervisor. He successfully led an effort to finalize \nthe largest land exchange in the history of the U.S. Forest Service--\nthe Arkansas/Oklahoma land exchange of 1996. Alan has also been \nextremely instrumental in the restoration of historic Camp Ouachita, a \nformer Girl Scout Camp built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, CCC, \nand the Works Progress Administration, WPA, and listed on the National \nHistoric Register. It is only through his strong commitment and \nleadership that Camp Ouachita is now available for public use. \nRestoration included restoring the Camp Ouachita lodge and facilities \nto usable condition, while adhering to national historic standards. \nAlan leaves a lasting legacy with the restoration of these structures.\n  In 2001, the Ouachita National Forest suffered tremendous damage due \nto an unprecedented ice storm. Alan led the forest through a major \nsalvage sale program designed to restore ecological health to the \nforest. He has fostered strong, positive working relationships with a \nvariety of partners across Arkansas and Oklahoma. Recently, the \nOuachita National Forest Plan was successfully completed in record time \nand with significant public involvement.\n  Alan's work is testament to his commitment to natural resource \nmanagement. He leaves the 1.8 million acres of the Ouachita National \nForest in extremely good condition. I appreciate Alan's commitment and \ndedication and wish him and his family well in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14054-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      UNO MAVS WIN NCAA DIVISION II NATIONAL WOMEN'S SOCCER TITLE\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

Mr. President, I rise to honor and celebrate the \nremarkable life and legacy of Vine Deloria, one of the most influential \nAmerican Indian people of our time, who through his writings and \nactivism reframed the social debate about the identity of Native \nAmerican people.\n  Deloria was born in South Dakota in 1933 to a distinguished Yankton \nSioux family. He served in the Marines and graduated from Iowa State \nUniversity. He earned a master's degree from the Lutheran School of \nTheology in Chicago, initially planning to become a minister. He then \nwent on to earn a law degree from CU in 1970. He is survived by his \nwife of 47 years, Barbara; two sons, Philip and Daniel; a daughter, \nJeanne Deloria; a brother, Philip; a sister, Barbara Sanchez; and seven \ngrandchildren.\n  Deloria began his writing and advocacy work as executive director of \nthe National Congress of American Indians, NCAI, in 1964. The 1960s \nwere a crucial era for American Indians, as their community leaders \nworked together to combat the cumulative legacy of desperate economic \nconditions, political disenfranchisement, and religious repression on \nthe reservations. While at NCAI, he challenged the century-old Federal \nassimilation policies of termination and relocation, and helped set the \nfoundation for the American Indian civil rights movement in the late \n1960s and early 1970s. His leadership at NCAI marked a turning point in \nAmerican Indian policy.\n  Mr. Deloria opened the Nation's eyes both to wrongs it had wrought on \nAmerican Indian people and to the solutions available to mend the \ndisparities. Among the many areas of American Indian policy issues that \nhe influenced, he helped to craft the American Indian Religious Freedom \nAct, the Indian Self-Governance Act, and the Native American Graves \nProtection and Repatriation Act.\n  His political passion also drove him to write the transformative 1969 \nbook ``Custer Died for Your Sins,'' which helped frame the modern \ndebate about\n\n[[Page S14055]]\n\nthe boundaries of sovereignty for modern Indian nations. The book also \nchallenged the Federal Government's unjust treatment of our Nation's \ntribal governments. When academic critics challenged his intellect and \nsophistication, he responded by writing ``The Metaphysics of Modern \nExistence.'' A lively discussion with Vine was an invigorating and \nthought-provoking sport enriched by his extraordinary and pointed sense \nof humor.\n  Deloria taught history at the University of Arizona from 1978 to 1990 \nand then at the University of Colorado, where he taught until his \nretirement in 2000.\n  In 2002, Deloria received the Wallace Stegner Award, the highest \nhonor presented by CU-Boulder's Center for the American West. The \ninscription on Deloria's award, given to people who have made a \nsustained contribution to the cultural identity of the West, reads as \nfollows:\n  Always grounded in the stories told by plains and ridges of your \nSioux homeland, and guided by your vision of tribal sovereignty, you \nhave become a hero for the ages in Indian country and far beyond, you \nhave changed the West and the world through your activism during the \ntermination crisis, your spirited leadership ever since, your vast and \ninfluential writings, and your encompassing mind and matchless courage.\n  I rise today on the floor of the Senate to honor and celebrate the \nlife's work of Vine Deloria, Jr. We are a better, stronger people for \nhaving been blessed with his wisdom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14055-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14055-S14056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO DR. PHILLIP A. SINGERMAN\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Dr. \nPhillip A Singerman on his very successful tenure as executive director \nof the Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO). Dr. \nSingerman recently announced his intention to step down from this \nposition at the end of the year.\n  The Maryland General Assembly created TEDCO in 1999 as a quasi-State \ninvestment corporation to facilitate business growth and foster \ntechnology transfer. When Dr. Singerman came from the U.S. Department \nof Commerce to lead TEDCO in 1999, its budget was approximately \n$650,000. Since Dr. Singerman began, TEDCO's assets have increased \nnearly ten fold. Through Dr. Singerman's leadership and drive, TEDCO \ncreated innovative partnerships between Maryland's large and growing \nhigh-tech Federal sector and start-up businesses that allowed the \nprivate sector to harness and grow applications for the cutting-edge \ntechnologies developed by the Federal Government. This work has also \nallowed Maryland businesses to work with the Federal Government to \n``spin-in'' technology--connecting the best of the private sector's \ntechnology expertise to our Federal sector on behalf of our national \ninterest.\n  Through these and other efforts, TEDCO has gained a national \nreputation. For the last 2 years, it has been recognized by \nEntrepreneur Magazine as the leading backer of seed and early stage \ncompanies in the country. In fact, TEDCO's investments have been so \nsuccessful that a company receiving its seed funding now typically \nreceives 25 times that initial amount from other venture capital firms \nand the Federal Government over the following 3 years. In short, Dr. \nSingerman has done a tremendous amount to bolster Maryland's preeminent \nrole as a national center of excellence for high technology innovation. \nAs Richard C. ``Mike'' Lewin, former head of the Maryland Department of \nBusiness and Economic Development put it in a recent Baltimore Sun \narticle: ``[h]e made TEDCO from scratch what it is today, the most \neffective technology development operation in the country.''\n  Mr. President, I am proud to have worked with Dr. Singerman over the \nlast 6 years. His contribution to the State of Maryland and to our \nNation cannot be overstated, and I wish him the very best in all of his \nfuture endeavors. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe entire Baltimore Sun article about Dr. Singerman's tenure as \nexecutive director of TEDCO quoted above.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Dec. 14, 2005]\n\n                   Md. Tech Agency's Director Resigns\n\n                  (By Tricia Bishop and David Nitkin)\n\n       Phillip A. Singerman, who guided a quasi-state technology \n     development agency from the dot-com bust into the era of \n     homeland security-related startups, has resigned as its \n     executive director.\n       In his six years leading the Maryland Technology \n     Development Corp., the former assistant secretary of the U.S. \n     Commerce Department in the Clinton administration helped \n     TEDCO support tech companies with everything from promotion \n     to venture capital. TEDCO is considered one of the top early-\n     stage investors in the country.\n       ``TEDCO's programs have now proven their effectiveness, the \n     organization has achieved a new level of stability, and a \n     competent and energetic staff has been put in place,'' \n     Singerman wrote in a letter he submitted Monday to the \n     agency's board of directors.\n       ``The organizational tasks now facing TEDCO are more \n     administrative and less, entrepreneurial. Therefore,'' he \n     said, ``I believe the time is now appropriate for me to seek \n     new professional challenges.''\n       Singerman, who was appointed to his post in August 1999 by \n     Democratic Gov. Parris N. Glendening, did not return phone \n     calls yesterday. His last day as executive director will be \n     Dec. 31.\n       Renee M. Winsky, the group's deputy executive director, \n     will likely step in to fill the position on an interim basis \n     after that, although a formal announcement has yet to be \n     made.\n       Because Singerman was well-respected, some of those \n     disappointed by the resignation saw it as the result of \n     political pressure. However, unlike, other recent turnovers \n     at state agencies, the immediate reaction was muted.\n       The Maryland General Assembly created the organization in \n     1998, with the dot-com boom in full flower and bright kids \n     with big ideas becoming instant millionaires. TEDCO was given \n     the job of moving technology being developed within the \n     state's universities and federal laboratories into the \n     commercial world.\n       ``It doesn't happen through osmosis. There has to be an \n     organization that is intensely focused on making it happen,'' \n     said Penny Lewandowski, an executive with the Edward Lowe \n     Foundation in Michigan and a former executive director of the \n     Greater Baltimore Technology Council. She was among the first \n     people Singerman met when he took the TEDCO post.\n       ``He had a real understanding of the mission and what they \n     set out to do,'' Lewandowski said. ``For somebody, to be able \n     to pull out these companies and give them the help that they \n     needed and really put them on the map something that we \n     hadn't seen before.''\n       Several TEDCO board members expressed, surprise at \n     Singerman's resignation, although talks had been going on as \n     to how the seven-year-old group could best progress.\n       ``I think [TEDCO] has done an excellent job of getting us \n     to what I will call the first phase of this commercialization \n     effort,'' said Aris Melissaratos, secretary of the Department \n     of Business and Economic Development, which oversees TEDCO. \n     ``The challenge is to take it to the next level. I've been \n     having strategic discussions with the board over the last \n     couple of years of how do we do that.''\n       Part of those discussions centered on whether Singerman's \n     contract would be renewed.\n       ``I'm always looking for the next superstar to pop in. I \n     don't think these government jobs should be forever,'' said \n     Melissaratos, who is a member of TEDCO's board of directors. \n     ``I like Phil because he's a good guy. He did a super job. \n     Again, even though he did a super job, I wouldn't mind \n     finding a way to get the organization to the next level, and \n     I've been talking to Phillip about that continuously.''\n       Del. Kumar P. Barve, a Montgomery County Democrat who was a \n     lead sponsor of the legislation that created the technology \n     investment agency, said Singerman was expecting to be \n     replaced by Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.'s administration.\n       State Board of Elections records show that Singerman \n     contributed $950 in donations to former Lt. Gov. Kathleen \n     Kennedy Townsend between December 2000 and July 2002, months \n     before she lost the election for governor to Ehrlich. \n     Singerman gave, $250 to Ehrlich last year.\n       Singerman ``has pretty uniformly gotten positive reviews. \n     But the governor wants to put his guy in charge, which is \n     technically his right to do,'' said Barve, who is the House \n     Democratic leader and a frequent critic of Ehrlich. ``Phil \n     was expecting to be replaced, and I'm sure that was part of \n     his motivation for leaving. Who wants to get fired?''\n       Melissaratos and other board members, however, said, \n     politics didn't push out Singerman.\n       ``In no sense, in my view, should it be implied that \n     Phillip was somehow forced out. He resigned his position in \n     his own volition. People were trying to convince him--[board \n     chairman] Frank [Adams] was trying to convince him--to \n     stay,'' said Theodore O. Poehler, vice provost of research at \n     the Johns Hopkins University and vice chairman of TEDCO's.\n       On Monday, Singerman gave his resignation to Adams, who \n     said he reluctantly accepted it.\n\n[[Page S14056]]\n\n       ``When he finally told me what his reasons were, my first \n     inclination was to talk him out of it. But as I listened \n     carefully, it became clear as one would expect of Phillip, \n     that he had thought this through very carefully,'' said \n     Adams, who is also president and chief executive of Grotech \n     Capital Group, a venture capital firm based in Timonium.\n       ``He likened himself to an entrepreneur with a startup \n     company. He'd gotten it off the ground, gotten it to the \n     point where it's very stable,'' said Adams, who believes \n     Singerman thought the time right to bring in more of a \n     manager-type executive director to ``free him up for another \n     endeavor.''\n       In 1999, Singerman was lured away from the U.S. Commerce \n     Department, where he directed the Economic Development \n     Administration and its $400 million budget, to become the, \n     first executive director of TEDCO, with its seed budget of \n     about $650,000. Last fiscal year, TEDCO's budget had grown to \n     about $5.5 million.\n       Landing Singerman was considered a coup at the time. He has \n     a bachelor's degree from Oberlin College and a master's and \n     doctorate from Yale University, experience in politics and \n     lobbying and was a former chief executive of a technology \n     center in Pennsylvania. He also had spent a couple of years \n     in the Peace Corps; teaching villagers in the Colombian Andes \n     about economic development.\n       ``He made TEDCO from scratch what it is today, the most \n     effective technology development operation in the country,'' \n     said Richard C. ``Mike'' Lewin, a former head of the \n     Department of Business and Economic Development and a member \n     of the TEDCO board. ``This resignation is a real, and in my \n     opinion, unnecessary, loss. It just didn't have to happen.''\n       Melissaratos said the board is trying to arrange a meeting \n     Monday to discuss how to best find a replacement for \n     Singerman and is likely to approve deputy executive director \n     Winsky as interim director.\n       ``Whenever you have an organizational upheaval like this, \n     the smart thing to do is step back and not rush into \n     anything,'' said Adams, the chairman. ``[I hope] to find a \n     person who can come in with fresh eyes and say, `You could be \n     this' or `You could be that' and excite the board with a new \n     sense of vitality. That's the [silver] lining in this dark \n     cloud.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14056-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, announced that the House has passed the following \nconcurrent resolutions, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to adopting \n     legislation that would provide funding through the Department \n     of Housing and Urban Development in the form of Community \n     Development Block Grants to investor owned utilities for the \n     restoration of electric and gas service damaged by Hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 13\n\n       Whereas, on August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina, a category \n     four storm with sustained winds of one hundred and forty \n     miles per hour came ashore in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, \n     near Buras, causing unprecedented flooding and devastation in \n     southeastern Louisiana, including the breach of the levee \n     system and floodwalls of the city of New Orleans, the death \n     of more than a thousand state residents, the displacement and \n     evacuation of hundreds of thousands more, and the widespread \n     loss and destruction of businesses and property; and\n       Whereas, on September 24, 2005, Hurricane Rita, a category \n     three storm with sustained winds of one hundred and twenty-\n     five miles per hour came ashore near the Louisiana/Texas \n     border, causing unprecedented flooding and devastation in \n     southwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas, and the \n     widespread loss and destruction of life and property; and\n       Whereas, Entergy Corporation (Entergy), through its \n     subsidiaries Entergy Louisiana (ELI), Entergy Gulf States \n     (EGS), and Entergy New Orleans (ENO), is Louisiana's largest \n     electric and gas utility, and the resulting wind and flooding \n     of Hurricane Katrina significantly damaged major portions of \n     Entergy's utility infrastructure; and\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of the disaster, Entergy and \n     others worked rapidly to provide emergency and temporary \n     services and is currently working to restore permanent \n     service to all customers in its service territory; and\n       Whereas, Entergy estimates that the total restoration costs \n     for the repair and/or replacement of Entergy's electric and \n     gas facilities damaged by hurricanes Katrina and Rita and \n     business continuity costs are estimated to be in the range of \n     $1.1 to $1.4 billion; with the costs to Entergy New Orleans \n     alone to repair its utility infrastructure exceeding four \n     hundred million dollars, not including potential incremental \n     losses; and\n       Whereas, safe and reliable electric and gas utility service \n     is vital to the state's post-hurricane recovery efforts, and \n     the state of Louisiana deems it essential to keep Entergy and \n     its subsidiaries as productive and financially viable \n     companies providing safe and reliable electric and gas \n     utility service to the residents and businesses of Louisiana; \n     and\n       Whereas, the legislature is committed to the protection of \n     Entergy's residential and business customers from the \n     tremendous costs associated with the necessary rebuilding \n     efforts and in assisting Entergy and its subsidiaries, \n     particularly Entergy New Orleans, in regaining their \n     financial strength and stability so that they will be able to \n     continue providing safe, and reliable service to their \n     customers; and\n       Whereas, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n     2001, which caused catastrophic destruction of life and \n     property, loss of an untold number of jobs, and the \n     displacement of many individuals and businesses, the \n     legislature notes that billions of dollars in funds and other \n     forms of essential assistance was provided to the state of \n     New York, and New York City by the federal government; and\n       Whereas, the state of Louisiana has suffered similar, if \n     not greater, human and economic losses as a result of \n     hurricanes Katrina and Rita, resulting in devastating loss of \n     life, damage to businesses and property, and destruction of \n     much of Entergy's utility infrastructure in Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, the legislature notes that Congress, in Public Law \n     107-206, passed on August 2, 2002, authorized the United \n     States Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide \n     seven hundred and eighty-three million dollars in disaster \n     assistance for damaged properties and businesses, including \n     the restoration of utility infrastructure, and for economic \n     revitalization directly related to the September 11 attacks. \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana hereby \n     memorializes the Congress of the\n\n[[Page S14058]]\n\n     United States to take all measures necessary to provide \n     federal financial assistance to aid in rebuilding the \n     investor-owned utility systems that are indispensable to the \n     recovery efforts of the state of Louisiana and the city of \n     New Orleans; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-223. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to increasing the coverage limit for a single-family \n     structure under the National Flood Insurance Program from two \n     hundred fifty thousand dollars to five hundred thousand \n     dollars; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 23\n\n       Whereas, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), \n     administered by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), \n     makes federally backed flood insurance available in \n     communities that adopt and enforce floodplain management \n     ordinances to reduce further flood losses; and\n       Whereas, flood damage, unlike wind damage, is not covered \n     by homeowners' insurance policies but must be purchased \n     separately; and\n       Whereas, flood insurance may be purchased through insurance \n     companies and licensed insurance agents; and\n       Whereas, the maximum coverage amount for a single-family \n     structure under NFIP is two hundred fifty thousand dollars; \n     and\n       Whereas, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck the state of \n     Louisiana causing unprecedented and severe flooding and \n     damage to the southern part of the state, devastating the \n     lives of many citizens of the state, and causing damage or \n     destruction of their property; and\n       Whereas, a substantial number of those single-family \n     structures which suffered damage or destruction from these \n     recent hurricanes are valued well in excess of two hundred \n     fifty thousand dollars, creating a severe gap between \n     coverage limits and the cost of repairing or replacing such \n     homes. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to increase the \n     coverage limit for a single-family structure under NFIP from \n     two hundred fifty thousand dollars to five hundred thousand \n     dollars; and be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-224. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to forgive \n     the 3.7 billion dollars that the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency (FEMA) estimates that Louisiana owes FEMA for \n     hurricane relief; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 49\n\n       Whereas, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has \n     estimated that the state's cost for Hurricanes Katrina and \n     Rita amount to 3.7 billion dollars; and\n       Whereas, Governor Kathleen Blanco has expressed her \n     intention to seek to have this amount reduced, as it far \n     exceeds any expectation of how much the state would be \n     required to pay for hurricane relief; and\n       Whereas, Hurricane Katrina has been called the most \n     destructive and costliest natural disaster in the history of \n     the nation, a burden no state has ever had to bear, \n     negatively impacting the state's economy and the earning \n     power of the state's citizens and businesses in countless \n     ways; and\n       Whereas, even as the state faces this almost insurmountable \n     challenge, FEMA has presented the state with a bill of \n     proportions such as no state has ever faced, and it is a \n     financial burden that Louisiana is not equipped to handle; \n     and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is already facing a tremendous budget \n     shortfall that renders it incapable of repaying this \n     staggering amount of debt; and\n       Whereas, the United States government has generously \n     provided a great deal of money to other countries, many of \n     whose debts have been forgiven, and it seems unjust to \n     forgive the debts of other countries but not the debt of \n     taxpaying American citizens; and\n       Whereas, in light of how this cost would greatly hinder the \n     state's efforts towards economic recovery, it is appropriate \n     that Congress enact legislation to forgive Louisiana's debt \n     incurred by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to forgive the 3.7 billion dollars that the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) estimates that \n     Louisiana owes to FEMA for hurricane relief; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-225. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to create a \n     national wind insurance program to be combined with the \n     National Flood Insurance Program in order to create a \n     national catastrophe insurance program; to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, Congress created the National Flood Insurance \n     Program (NFIP) in 1968 in response to the rising cost of \n     taxpayer-funded disaster relief for flood victims and the \n     increasing amount of damage caused by floods; and\n       Whereas, in the wake of the widespread damage and \n     devastation caused by recent hurricanes, it is only \n     appropriate that Congress consider a similar program that \n     would also provide wind insurance; and\n       Whereas, when claim issues are addressed following a \n     hurricane, the separation of damages between wind coverage \n     and flood coverage is potentially contentious and difficult \n     to resolve; and\n       Whereas, homeowners in areas that have been stricken by \n     hurricanes face the possibility of being dropped by their \n     homeowners' insurance companies and being unable to obtain \n     future coverage to protect them in the case of future \n     disasters; and\n       Whereas, it would be in the best interest of citizens \n     living in storm-prone areas to have the opportunity to \n     participate in a federal catastrophe insurance program. \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to create a national wind insurance program \n     to be combined with the National Flood Insurance Program in \n     order to create a national catastrophe insurance program; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-226. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to the \n     hydrogen shortage caused by Hurricane Katrina; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 169\n\n       Whereas, There are several factories located within the \n     area devastated by Hurricane Katrina that produce hydrogen; \n     and\n       Whereas, The aftermath of the hurricane has caused those \n     factories to shut down and has triggered a hydrogen shortage; \n     and\n       Whereas, The hydrogen shortage is having a substantial \n     negative impact on the metal industry in the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania and throughout the United States, which industry \n     relies on hydrogen for its manufacturing processes; and\n       Whereas, The hydrogen shortage in the United States needs \n     to be addressed by the Congress of the United States. \n     Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania urge the Congress of the United States to take \n     appropriate action to address the hydrogen shortage in the \n     United States due to factory shutdowns caused by the \n     devastation of Hurricane Katrina; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-227.

The Great Lakes have for thousands of \n     years supported native communities' culture and way of life; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Great Lakes fuel Michigan's tourism and \n     recreation industry. Recreational fishing alone adds $1.4 \n     billion annually to the state's economy; and\n       Whereas, The state of Michigan has historically been a \n     leader in protecting the Great Lakes, including efforts to \n     regulate ballast water discharges that could harbor invasive \n     species and to eliminate the disposal of dangerous \n     contaminants in the Great Lakes; and\n       Whereas, Despite Michigan's efforts, the Great Lakes are \n     ailing from a multitude of stressors, including aquatic \n     invasive species, toxic contamination of river and lake \n     sediments, partially or inadequately treated sewage \n     discharges, pollution from nonpoint sources, and coastal \n     habitat loss. Combined, these stressors will have long-\n     lasting effects on the Great Lakes, Michigan's economy, and \n     our way of life; and\n       Whereas, There has been an unprecedented collaborative \n     effort on the part of 1,500 people representing federal, \n     state, and local governments, Native American tribes, \n     nongovernmental entities, and private citizens\n\n[[Page S14059]]\n\n     to develop an Action Plan to Restore and Protect the Great \n     Lakes; and\n       Whereas, Implementation of the Action Plan can restore the \n     ecology of the Great Lakes and avert impending environmental \n     threats to the region; and\n       Whereas, A recent report by the federal Great Lakes \n     Interagency Task Force has, at the eleventh hour, attempted \n     to change the rules that the Regional Collaboration operated \n     under by recommending that the strategy be constrained by \n     current budget projections; and\n       Whereas, The action plan previously developed through the \n     Regional Collaboration includes recommendations that call on \n     the states and federal government to take substantial new \n     steps jointly in the restoration and protection of the Great \n     Lakes; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the Great Lakes \n     Regional Collaboration and the United States Congress to take \n     prompt action to finalize, endorse, implement, and invest in \n     the Action Plan to Restore and Protect the Great Lakes; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge the United States Congress to adopt \n     legislation to implement and fully invest in the Action Plan; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That we intend for the state of Michigan to \n     continue its proud tradition of Great Lakes stewardship and \n     fulfill its commitment to restoring the Great Lakes by taking \n     substantial steps and, whenever practical, match federal \n     funding to implement the Action Plan to Restore and Protect \n     the Great Lakes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation, the Great Lakes Commission, the Great Lakes \n     Legislative Caucus, the International Joint Commission, the \n     Great Lakes Fishery Commission, the Michigan Office of the \n     Great Lakes, the Michigan Department of Environmental \n     Quality, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-228. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to \n     extending Louisiana's seaward boundary in the Gulf of Mexico \n     to twelve geographical miles; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 8\n\n       Whereas, Louisiana's seaward boundary in the Gulf of Mexico \n     has been judicially determined to be three geographical miles \n     and the United States has jurisdiction past the three \n     geographical miles; and\n       Whereas, Congress has the power to amend the Submerged \n     Lands Act of 1953 to allow for the recognition that \n     Louisiana's seaward boundary extends twelve geographical \n     miles into the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana acts as a significant energy corridor \n     vital to the entire United States and provides intersections \n     of oil and natural gas intrastate and interstate pipeline \n     networks which serve as reference for futures markets, such \n     as the Henry Hub for natural gas, the St. James Louisiana \n     Light Sweet Crude Oil, and the Mars Sour Crude Oil contracts; \n     and\n       Whereas, Louisiana provides storage for the nation's \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve and is the home of the nation's \n     major import terminal for foreign oil, known as the Louisiana \n     Offshore Oil Port; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana and its coastal wetlands provide access \n     to nearly thirty-four percent of the U.S. natural gas supply \n     and nearly twenty-nine percent of the U.S. oil supply; and\n       Whereas, the United States' economic growth depends on \n     access to stable supplies of oil and natural gas; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana ranks first in crude oil production, \n     including the outer continental shelf production, and ranks \n     second in natural gas production, including the outer \n     continental shelf production; and\n       Whereas, in 2001, the state of Louisiana received only one-\n     half of one percent of the federal oil and gas revenues off \n     its coast; and\n       Whereas, hurricanes Katrina and Rita have shown that the \n     loss of vital oil and gas infrastructure in Louisiana and the \n     Gulf of Mexico has an immediate and direct impact upon the \n     economy and well-being of the entire country and its \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas, the hurricanes have shut-in approximately fifty-\n     three percent of the daily oil production in the Gulf of \n     Mexico, and shut-in approximately forty-seven percent of the \n     daily gas production in the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, for the time period of August 26, 2005, through \n     November 3, 2005, the cumulative shut-in of oil production is \n     approximately fourteen percent of the yearly oil production \n     in the Gulf of Mexico, and the cumulative shut-in of gas \n     production is approximately eleven percent of the yearly gas \n     production in the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, due to hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Louisiana has \n     suffered loss of life and tremendous devastation to its \n     economy, its citizens, infrastructure, and coastal landscape; \n     and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's Revenue Estimating Conference \n     estimates the budget shortfall to be approximately nine \n     hundred seventy million dollars, and the loss of fees and \n     self-generated revenue could increase the shortfall to one \n     billion five hundred million dollars; and\n       Whereas, the governor of Louisiana has reduced state agency \n     spending by five hundred million dollars; and\n       Whereas, the state has provided ten million dollars from \n     our Rapid Response Fund for short-term, interest-free loans \n     to struggling businesses, and granted the full Interim \n     Emergency Fund in the amount of sixteen million dollars to \n     local governments in order for the governments' vital \n     services to operate; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana has paid out approximately three hundred \n     million dollars in unemployment benefits to hurricane \n     affected employees; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana has established a Rainy Day Fund that is \n     worth approximately four hundred sixty million dollars, and \n     the state is in the process of using at least one-third of \n     this fund to balance the state budget; and\n       Whereas, in this special session the Louisiana legislature \n     along with the governor are considering other options for \n     balancing the budget, increasing revenues, and funding the \n     massive clean-up, rebuilding, and restoration of southern \n     Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, hurricanes Katrina and Rita turned approximately \n     one hundred square miles of southeast Louisiana coastal \n     wetlands into open water, and destroyed more wetlands east of \n     the Mississippi River in one month than experts estimated to \n     be lost in over forty-five years; and\n       Whereas, monies are desperately needed to fund the state's \n     clean-up, rebuilding, and restoration of southern Louisiana; \n     and\n       Whereas, the state of Louisiana and its citizens are in a \n     financial crisis; and\n       Whereas, in order to rebuild the state of Louisiana and \n     protect its citizens, the state needs a significant, \n     consistent and ongoing stream of revenue; and\n       Whereas, the extension of Louisiana's seaward boundary into \n     the Gulf of Mexico for twelve geographical miles will provide \n     such stream of revenue. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to extend Louisiana's \n     seaward boundary in the Gulf of Mexico to twelve geographical \n     miles; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-229.

Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as necessary whereby the Stafford Act will allow the payment \n     of regular pay to essential staff; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-230. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to directing the United States Army Corps of \n     Engineers not to engage in dredging activities on the \n     Mississippi River Gulf Outlet and to begin the necessary \n     process to return the waterway to wetlands marsh status; to \n     the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 34\n\n       Whereas, the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO), a \n     seventy-six-mile, manmade navigational channel which connects \n     the Gulf of Mexico to the Port of New Orleans along the \n     Mississippi River, was authorized by the United States \n     Congress under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1956 as a \n     channel with a surface width of six hundred fifty feet, a \n     bottom width of five hundred feet, and a depth of thirty-six \n     feet, and it opened in 1965; and\n       Whereas, MRGO, which bisects the coastal marshes of St. \n     Bernard Parish and the Chandeleur Sound, was constructed for \n     navigational and economic purposes as a shorter route than \n     the Mississippi River and as an\n\n[[Page S14060]]\n\n     engine of industrial development for St. Bernard Parish and \n     the city of New Orleans; and\n       Whereas, since MRGO was completed, the Army Corps of \n     Engineers estimates that the area has lost nearly three \n     thousand two hundred acres of fresh and intermediate marsh, \n     more than ten thousand three hundred acres of brackish marsh, \n     four thousand two hundred acres of saline marsh, and one \n     thousand five hundred acres of cypress swamps and levee \n     forests in addition to major habitat alterations due to \n     saltwater intrusion from the loss of the marshes, which has \n     resulted in dramatic declines in waterfowl and quadruped use \n     of the marshes; and\n       Whereas, although the tradeoff for St. Bernard Parish's \n     loss of marsh and habitat was anticipated to have been the \n     resultant economic development, that development has not \n     occurred in the forty years since MRGO opened for navigation; \n     MRGO traffic comprises only three percent of the river \n     traffic and is limited to only barge traffic and generally \n     involves only four passages per day; and\n       Whereas, in addition to less than anticipated use of the \n     channel, the costs of maintaining MRGO rises each year, with \n     the cost of dredging now over twenty-five million dollars per \n     year, or more than thirteen thousand dollars for each \n     passage, in addition to the expenditure of millions for \n     shoreline stabilization and marsh protection projects, with \n     an anticipated cost increase of fifty-two percent between \n     1995 and 2005; and\n       Whereas, concerns about the environmental impact of the \n     channel began prior to construction with other federal \n     agencies expressing concern about hydrologic models \n     predicting drastic salinity increases and associated loss of \n     interior marsh, and those concerns have continued through the \n     life of the project as indicated by the Louisiana Legislature \n     getting involved as long ago as Senate Concurrent Resolution \n     No. 207 of 1992 in which the legislature asked the Army Corps \n     of Engineers to evaluate the adverse environmental impacts \n     resulting from the operation of MRGO and to determine if \n     there was federal interest in continuing to maintain and \n     operate the channel; and\n       Whereas, concerns about the environmental impact increased \n     through the years as evidenced by the fact that in 1998 the \n     ``Coast 2050 Report'' contained closure of MRGO among the \n     consensus recommendations, and the technical committee of the \n     Coastal Wetland Planning, Preservation and Restoration Act \n     Task Force listed closure as one of the highest-ranked \n     strategies for coastal restoration; and\n       Whereas, with the waterway increasing from its original \n     authorized dimensions to a surface width of twenty-two \n     hundred feet and a depth of over forty feet, in 1998 the St. \n     Bernard Police Jury voted unanimously to request closure of \n     the waterway because of fears that the dramatic loss of \n     coastal wetlands and marshes caused by MRGO exposed the \n     parish and the communities in the parish to much more severe \n     impacts from the hurricanes and tropical storms that \n     regularly occur in the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, those concerns were echoed and amplified by \n     scientists, engineers, and citizens throughout the region as \n     reflected in requests from the Louisiana Legislature to \n     Congress in 1999 (SCR No. 266) and again in 2004 (HCR No. 35 \n     and HCR No. 68) to close the waterway, and indeed, those \n     concerns proved true in an extremely dramatic fashion on \n     August 29, 2005, when Hurricane Katrina, a strong Category 5 \n     hurricane, washed ashore on Louisiana's coast with a tidal \n     surge well in excess of twenty feet; and\n       Whereas, there is a growing consensus that the flooding \n     that occurred in St. Bernard Parish and the Lower Ninth Ward \n     of New Orleans was a result of storm surge that flowed up the \n     Mississippi River Gulf Outlet to the point where it converges \n     with the Intracoastal Waterway and that the confluence \n     created a funnel that directed the storm surges into the New \n     Orleans Industrial Canal, where it overtopped the levees \n     along MRGO and the Industrial Canal and eventually breached \n     the levees and flooded into the neighborhoods that lie close \n     to those three waterways, resulting in a yet uncounted number \n     of deaths and rendering sixty-seven thousand residents of St. \n     Bernard Parish and uncounted numbers in the Lower Ninth Ward \n     of New Orleans homeless, without possessions, and unemployed; \n     and\n       Whereas, only three weeks later, on September 24, 2005, \n     storm waters from Hurricane Rita surged up the Mississippi \n     River Gulf Outlet and caused additional flooding in St. \n     Bernard Parish and the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, \n     exacerbating the traumatic losses in that area; and\n       Whereas, almost immediately after the two storm events, the \n     United States Army Corps of Engineers indicated that it would \n     seek funding to begin dredging MRGO to reestablish the forty-\n     foot depth, which caused an enormous outcry of protest from \n     the citizens and public officials from St. Bernard Parish and \n     the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, causing the Corps to \n     postpone a decision as to what the next step would be for the \n     Mississippi River Gulf Outlet; and\n       Whereas, the United States Army Corps of Engineers has \n     stated that it has no authorization from congress to close \n     the waterway or to make any attempt to return the coastal \n     wetlands and marshes to their pre-waterway status or even to \n     fill the waterway to allow for the development of marshes and \n     wetlands. Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress and the Louisiana \n     congressional delegation to suspend any current \n     appropriations or authorizations for expenditure of funds to \n     dredge the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, to direct the \n     United States Army Corps of Engineers not to engage in any \n     dredging activities on the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, and \n     to begin the necessary process to return the waterway to \n     wetlands marsh status as close as possible to what it was \n     prior to establishment of the canal; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation and to the chairman of the Mississippi Valley \n     Division of the United States Army Corps of Engineers.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-231. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to waive the \n     nonfederal or local portion of any cost-sharing agreement for \n     the funding of a levee reconstruction and improvement \n     project; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 36\n\n       Whereas, on August 29, 2005, and on September 24, 2005, \n     Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, respectively, swept across \n     southeastern Louisiana, demolishing homes, schools, and \n     businesses, obliterating entire communities, and earning \n     their place in history amid the most destructive natural \n     disasters ever measured; and\n       Whereas, those charged with the mind-boggling task of \n     rebuilding this storm-ravaged region must essentially begin \n     from scratch, including reworking and improving the complex \n     levee system that will protect the region and its inhabitants \n     from future storms such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; and\n       Whereas, Hurricane Katrina, which measured as a Category 4 \n     storm upon landfall, made painfully clear that it is not \n     enough to rebuild and restore the battered levees to their \n     pre-storm Category 3 level of hurricane protection; the \n     economic recovery of this state depends upon the construction \n     of improved levees that will be able to withstand stronger \n     storms; and\n       Whereas, the building of a strong levee and flood \n     protection system will require an enormous investment in the \n     infrastructure of the region, but it will also entice \n     businesses back to the region, reassure insurers that such a \n     disaster will not happen again, and convince residents that \n     they will be safe; and\n       Whereas, the strengthening of the levees is critical to the \n     future economic development of the region, but the level of \n     devastation brought about by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita has \n     depleted local resources and has initiated a financial crisis \n     that is only expected to intensify; under these circumstances \n     the state and local governments are unable to meet their \n     portion of the cost-sharing agreement for the funding of the \n     levee improvement project; and\n       Whereas, in any cost-sharing agreement entered into for the \n     completion of certain projects, including flood control or \n     hurricane protection projects, 33 USC 2213 provides that \n     congress may reduce or offer some other form of financial \n     relief to the nonfederal interest relative to such cost-\n     sharing agreements, upon a determination that the nonfederal \n     interest is not financially able to render its portion of \n     cost-sharing responsibilities. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to waive the nonfederal or local portion of \n     any cost-sharing agreement relative to funding of projects \n     for the reconstruction and improvement of the levee system; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That a suitable copy of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States \n     of America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n       POM-232. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to review \n     and consideration of revising or eliminating provisions of \n     law which reduce social security benefits for those receiving \n     benefits from the federal, state, or local government \n     retirement systems; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 22\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has enacted both \n     the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reducing the spousal and \n     survivor social security benefit and the Windfall Elimination \n     Provision (WEP), reducing the earned social security benefit \n     for persons who also receive federal, state, or local \n     retirement; and\n       Whereas, the intent of Congress in enacting the GPO and the \n     WEP provisions was to address concerns that a public employee \n     who had worked primarily in federal, state, and local \n     government employment might receive a public pension in \n     addition to the same social security benefit as a worker who \n     had worked only in employment covered by social security \n     throughout his career; and\n       Whereas, the purpose of Congress in enacting these \n     reduction provisions was to provide a disincentive for public \n     employees to receive two pensions; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a spouse or survivor \n     receiving federal, state, or\n\n[[Page S14061]]\n\n     local government retirement benefits who would also be \n     entitled to a social security benefit earned by a spouse; and\n       Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or survivor \n     social security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the \n     federal, state, or local government retirement benefit \n     received by the spouse or survivor, in many cases completely \n     eliminating the social security benefit; and\n       Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned \n     federal, state, or local government retirement benefits, in \n     addition to working in covered employment and paying into the \n     social security system; and\n       Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned social security benefit \n     using an averaged indexed monthly earnings formula and may \n     reduce social security benefits for such persons by as much \n     as one-half of the uncovered public retirement benefits \n     earned; and\n       Whereas, because of these calculation characteristics, the \n     GPO and WEP have a disproportionately negative effect on \n     employees working in lower-wage government jobs, like \n     policemen, firefighters, teachers, and state employees; and\n       Whereas, these provisions also have a greater adverse \n     effect on women than on men because of the gender differences \n     in salary that continue to plague our Nation; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is facing a herculean recovery effort \n     which will likely require a reduction in the public \n     workforce, requiring employees of the state and her political \n     subdivisions to leave public service earlier than they \n     perhaps otherwise would, further reducing the amount of money \n     each will receive upon retirement; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort to improve the \n     quality of life of her citizens and to encourage them to live \n     here life-long as a part of the rebuilding and revitalization \n     of the state. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to review the \n     GPO and WEP social security benefit reductions, and to \n     consider amendments thereto that would lessen or eliminate \n     their effects; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-233. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to \n     providing financial assistance to the state necessary to \n     maintain essential public services to the people of Louisiana \n     following the devastation caused by Hurricanes Katrina and \n     Rita; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 38\n\n       Whereas, while these events contributed to an immense loss \n     of human life and property, the ramifications continue to \n     affect every citizen of the state; and\n       Whereas, the destruction of business, industry, and \n     infrastructure in these areas has severely reduced the \n     state's revenue stream by over one-third; and\n       Whereas, the Revenue Estimating Conference projects next \n     year's revenue forecast to show a deficit of nine hundred \n     seventy million dollars, requiring massive budget reductions \n     to comply with the state constitution that requires a \n     balanced budget; and\n       Whereas, through executive order and legislative action, \n     state government is making a coordinated effort to balance \n     the budget; and\n       Whereas, this deficit of nearly one billion dollars \n     severely curtails the ability of the state to provide \n     essential public services in the areas of health care, \n     education, and infrastructure; and\n       Whereas, the budget process demands debilitating cuts to \n     higher education with a total reduction of over sixty-six \n     million dollars of which sixty-one million dollars targets \n     individual colleges and universities; and\n       Whereas, health care services such as Medicaid will lose \n     four hundred million dollars in federal matching funds due to \n     reductions in the state's budget, causing a total reduction \n     in health care services for Medicaid eligibles and the \n     uninsured of six hundred thirty-eight million dollars; and\n       Whereas, rebuilding state facilities carries a hefty price \n     tag estimated at over two billion dollars; and\n       Whereas, the extent of the impact to self-generated revenue \n     sources remains unclear at this time; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana, faced with such monumental budget cuts \n     and slow economic recovery, may be unable to repay a \n     staggering debt currently owed to the federal government in \n     matching funds allegedly owed for certain FEMA assistance \n     payments. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to provide financial \n     assistance and extraordinary funding to Louisiana necessary \n     to maintain essential public services during these \n     unfortunate times of diminished revenues and staggering debt; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-234.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to grant for \n     distributions from DROP accounts to active state and local \n     government employees who are members of public retirement \n     systems similar tax relief as that provided to members of \n     qualified retirement plans by the Katrina Emergency Tax \n     Relief Act of 2005 and to permit such distributions from tax-\n     qualified plans; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 15\n\n       Whereas, in response to the devastation of Hurricane \n     Katrina and the terrible economic losses sustained by many \n     citizens on the Gulf Coast, the United States Congress \n     enacted the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act, referred to as \n     KETRA, which granted several kinds of tax relief to Hurricane \n     Katrina victims; and\n       Whereas, federal tax laws generally treat any distribution \n     from a qualified retirement plan, a tax-sheltered annuity \n     (403(b) annuity), an eligible deferred compensation plan \n     maintained by a state or local government (governmental 457 \n     plan), or an individual retirement arrangement (IRA) as \n     income for the year distributed and provide penalties for \n     early distributions from certain pension plans or funds in \n     the form of a ten percent early withdrawal tax; and\n       Whereas, provisions of KETRA legislation include an \n     exception to the ten percent early withdrawal tax in the case \n     of a qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution from certain \n     qualified retirement plans, a 403(b) annuity, or an IRA, and \n     KETRA provides for income attributable to a qualified \n     Hurricane Katrina distribution to be included in income \n     ratably over three years and permits the amount of a \n     qualified Hurricane Katrina distribution to be recontributed \n     to an eligible retirement plan within three years; and\n       Whereas, provisions of KETRA do not apply to tax-qualified \n     public retirement systems (401(a) plans) such as the state \n     and statewide retirement systems, under which an employee's \n     contributions are withheld from his pay and do not form a \n     part of his taxable income; and\n       Whereas, many active employees of state and local \n     governments in Louisiana are participating in or have \n     completed participation in the deferred retirement option \n     plan of their public retirement system, and such plans, \n     referred to simply as ``DROP'', permit an employee who has \n     reached employment eligibility to continue in employment but \n     to ``retire'' and, instead of receiving his retirement \n     benefit payments, to have such payments paid for up to three \n     years into a designated account which is invested for him \n     with a prohibition on receiving any payments from the account \n     until he terminates employment; and\n       Whereas, just like those Hurricane Katrina victims who are \n     permitted by KETRA to access pension funds without tax \n     penalties in this time of dire financial need, many employees \n     of Louisiana state and local governments who have accumulated \n     funds in their DROP accounts truly need to access those funds \n     to meet the costs of devastating economic losses;

and\n       Whereas, this tax relief legislation includes provisions to \n     allow nonrecognition of income from discharge of certain \n     indebtedness, to remove certain penalties for early \n     withdrawals from, certain pension plans, to provide certain \n     tax credits for employers, to provide special rules for \n     determining earned income when earned income for 2005 is less \n     than the prior year, to suspend limitations on casualty \n     losses, to extend the replacement period for nonrecognition \n     of gain with respect to property compulsorily or \n     involuntarily converted, to provide tax relief for persons \n     providing housing to hurricane victims, to ease restrictions \n     on mortgage revenue bonds, to ease restrictions on charitable \n     contributions for Hurricane Katrina relief efforts and to \n     give special treatment to donations of food or books, to \n     increase the mileage rate for charitable use and to exclude \n     certain mileage reimbursements to charitable volunteers, and \n     to grant automatic extension of filing deadlines;

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania relative to creating a task force, working \n     with State and local government, employers and the health \n     care industry, to develop solutions to rapidly increasing \n     health care cost; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n       Whereas, Rapidly increasing health care costs are resulting \n     6 in higher costs for government and other employers; and\n       Whereas, These increasing health care costs are resulting \n     in declines in the scope of individual coverage through \n     private plans and through programs such as Medicaid; and\n       Whereas, The House of Representatives of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania recognizes the significant increase in costs \n     to counties and employers in providing health care benefits \n     to their employees; and\n       Whereas, The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania recognizes the trend for many employers to \n     reduce from the level of benefits offered to their employees, \n     the decreasing availability of affordable health care to \n     American families and the increased vulnerability of parts of \n     our population as cuts are made to Medicaid budgets. \n     Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urge the Congress of the United \n     States to create a task force, working with State and local \n     government, employers and the health care industry, to \n     develop solutions to rapidly increasing health care costs; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-240.

Bush \n     offered a bold and breathtaking promise to rebuild this \n     devastated region; and\n       Whereas, in that speech, President George W. Bush proposed \n     that the Congress of the United States create a ``Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone'' which recognizes that the key to both \n     immediate and long-term economic recovery is to spur \n     Americans to invest in the affected area; and\n       Whereas, to date, the Congress of the United States of \n     America has committed billions of emergency spending to the \n     affected region, with an early estimate of $200 billion to be \n     spent in the recovery, rebuilding, and revitalization of the \n     entire Gulf Coast region; and\n       Whereas, the fruits of the recent recovery have accrued \n     disproportionately to out-of-state corporate profits; and\n       Whereas, it is vital that local small businesses be given \n     greater access to federal contracts in order to further \n     assist the area in its economic recovery efforts, Therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to mandate that federal \n     contracts awarded for reconstruction of the Gulf Coast region \n     give a preference to local contractors and workers; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-241. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to passing \n     the Family Education Reimbursement Act; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 46\n\n       Whereas, thousands of students were forced to abandon their \n     schools in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita; and\n       Whereas, public, private and charter schools all across the \n     state and nation enrolled these displaced students; and\n       Whereas, parents should be empowered to make the best \n     choices for their children and that the communities and \n     schools that have opened their doors to so many students \n     should not be financially punished for that generosity; and\n       Whereas, the Family Education Reimbursement Act (H.R. 4097) \n     would provide parents of children displaced by hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita an opportunity to register with the federal \n     government to create an account in which the federal \n     government would deposit $6,700; and\n       Whereas, these account numbers would be given to the school \n     enrolling the displaced child so that the schools could be \n     reimbursed for the child's education; and\n       Whereas, these accounts would be accessible to private and \n     charter schools, as well as public schools, that have \n     enrolled these displaced students, often at free or reduced \n     tuition; and\n       Whereas, the Family Education Reimbursement Act (H.R. 4097) \n     would allow schools, which welcomed these displaced students \n     to be reimbursed easily and quickly without being forced to \n     navigate complicated federal, state and local bureaucracies \n     to obtain reimbursement. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact the \n     Family Education Reimbursement Act (H.R. 4097); and \n     therefore, be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each member \n     of the Louisiana delegation of the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-242. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to voting \n     against the repealing of the ``Byrd Amendment''; to the \n     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 27\n\n       Whereas, the United States House Committee on Ways and \n     Means by a recorded vote of 22 to 17 reported the Budget, \n     Entitlement Reconciliation Recommendations for Fiscal Year \n     2006; and\n       Whereas, the committee recommended to repeal the provision \n     of the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act, commonly \n     known as the ``Byrd Amendment,'' that required collected \n     duties be distributed to eligible domestic producers; and\n       Whereas, these duties were collected under antidumping and \n     countervailing duty orders and are required to be paid to \n     eligible producers that initiated the petition which resulted \n     in the imposition of the duties; and\n       Whereas, in January, the International Trade Commission \n     ruled that the six countries of China, Ecuador, India, \n     Thailand, Vietnam and Brazil dumped shrimp in the U.S. market \n     at excessively low prices; and\n       Whereas, the duties collected from these countries ranged \n     from 2.48 percent to 112.81 percent; and\n       Whereas, shrimpers and shrimp processors had until August \n     1, 2005, to apply for payments from the duties imposed on the \n     six countries; and\n       Whereas, the shrimpers and shrimp processors will probably \n     not get paid this year, and unfortunately will probably have \n     to wait until next year for any payment; and\n       Whereas, due to hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the shrimp \n     industry along with other seafood industries have suffered \n     enormous economic and infrastructure losses; and\n       Whereas, a preliminary assessment estimates that for the \n     shrimp industry the potential production losses at retail \n     level due to Hurricane Katrina are approximately five hundred \n     thirty-nine million dollars, and due to Hurricane Rita the \n     losses are approximately three hundred eighty million \n     dollars; and\n       Whereas, the preliminary assessment estimates that for the \n     shrimp industry the total potential production losses at \n     retail level due to both hurricanes are approximately nine \n     hundred nineteen million dollars; and\n       Whereas, the repealing of the ``Byrd Amendment'' would \n     cause further economic loss on the shrimp industry because \n     the shrimpers and shrimp processors will not receive the \n     payments from the duties. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to vote against the \n     repealing of the ``Byrd Amendment;'' and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-243.

Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to require all federal jobs that have been \n     lost or relocated due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and \n     their associated funding to be restored as soon as possible, \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14064-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following executive reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. WARNER for the Committee on Armed Services.\n       *Andrew J.

A bill to enhance security and protect against terrorist \nattacks at chemical facilities; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my good friend \nand colleague, Senator Joe Lieberman, to introduce the Chemical \nFacility Antiterrorism Act of 2005.\n  This legislation addresses one of the Nation's greatest \nvulnerabilities, the threat of a terrorist attack against a chemical \nfacility.\n  My legislation would provide broad new authority to the Department of \nHomeland Security to ensure that the Nation's chemical facilities are \nbetter protected from terrorism.\n  This legislation would direct the Department of Homeland Security to \nestablish criteria for evaluating the vulnerability of our Nation's \nchemical facilities to terrorist attack and to establish risk-based \ntiers for those facilities deemed in need of protection.\n\n[[Page S14066]]\n\n  These regulations will require designated facilities to conduct \nvulnerability assessments and to create appropriate site security and \nemergency response plans. In addition, the Department would establish \nan office within the Infrastructure Protection Directorate responsible \nfor implementing and enforcing the statute.\n  The bill also contains robust measures to ensure both compliance by \nchemical plants and effective implementation by the Department.\n  This legislation is strong medicine, and I do not prescribe it \nlightly. But the potential devastation that an attack on a chemical \nfacility could cause, the sheer number of these facilities and the \ncurrent widespread lack of security, as well as the clearly stated \nintent of terrorists to cause maximum harm to the American people and \nto our economy make these measures necessary.\n  The Homeland Security Committee has invested substantial effort in \nexamining this threat and in deciding how best to respond to it. Our \ninvestigation included four hearings on this topic earlier this year.\n  From the horrifying chemical attacks of the First World War, and the \ntragic accident at Bhopal, India, in 1984, to the numerous and more \nrecent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals in this country, we \nwere reminded by expert after expert of the potential for useful \nproductive chemicals to kill, if released accidentally or \nintentionally.\n  We also know that al-Qaida has a keen interest in the American \nchemical industry. Indeed, at our first hearing, Steven Flynn of the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations testified that the chemical industry is \n``at the top of the list'' of al-Qaida and other terrorist groups. The \nchemical industry, said Commander Flynn, absolutely screams at you as \nessentially a weapon of mass destruction.\n  We should not wait until there is an attack on a chemical facility \nand then act after the fact. So often our security measures and our \nemergency legislation is passed after something horrible has already \noccurred and after lives have already been lost. Let us get ahead of \nthis curve. Let us act now to address what witness after witness \nidentified as being one of the greatest threats to our homeland.\n  The stakes are high and the vulnerability is widespread. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency has cataloged some 15,000 facilities in \nthe United States that manufacture, use, or store large quantities of \nhazardous chemicals for productive, legitimate purposes, but in amounts \nthat could cause extensive harm if turned against us as weapons. And we \nhave seen al-Qaida do this before. We have seen al-Qaida use commercial \naircraft as weapons of mass destruction.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has identified 3,400 facilities \nthat could affect more than 1,000 people if attacked.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, tens of millions \nof Americans live close enough to chemical facilities to be at risk in \nthe event of a terrorist attack. Yet despite this profound threat, only \na fraction of our Nation's chemical facilities are regulated for \nsecurity by the Federal Government under the Maritime Transportation \nSecurity Act of 2002, or subscribe to volunteer security standards.\n  While I applaud those companies that have taken voluntary measures, \nan unacceptable number have not. Moreover, given the severity of the \nthreat, I believe it is a mistake in this case to rely on voluntary \nmeasures alone. The overwhelming majority of experts at our hearing \ntestified that additional statutory authority is needed to effectively \naddress the threat of terrorism against a chemical facility.\n  Leading security experts, chemical safety professionals, industry \nrepresentatives, labor representatives, environmental groups, and the \nadministration, all have testified that Federal legislation in this \narea is necessary, although obviously they differ considerably on the \ndetails.\n  The legislation I am introducing today provides that critical \nauthority. While establishing the need for Federal legislation, our \nhearings stressed the importance of getting this right, of striking the \nright balance.\n  Chemical shipments in the United States approach $.5 trillion \nannually. The chemical industry represents our largest export sector, \ntotaling $91.4 billion in 2003.\n  More than 900,000 people work directly in the American chemical \nindustry with millions more in supplier and indirect jobs.\n  Chemicals are critical to our food and our water supply, our \npharmaceuticals, our electronics, our clothes; in fact, just about \neverything.\n  A consistent theme that sounded throughout our hearing was that we \ncannot afford to drive the chemical sector out of this country in the \nname of security. And that is why we spent so much time in carefully \ncrafting a bill that strikes the right balance.\n  Our hearings established a considerable consensus around two \nimportant concepts: First, that the legislation should be risk based. \nOur chemical industry is extremely diverse and any legislation must \ntake into account that diversity. A small plant using chemicals in \nrural Maine faces very different risks than a major chemical \nmanufacturing plant in the New York City area, and its security \nresponse should be structured appropriately. Security measures should \nbe tailored to each particular facility, taking into account its \nvulnerabilities, its location, impact on the population, and other risk \nfactors. High-risk facilities should undertake the strongest security \nprecautions while obviously fewer precautions are necessary at very \nlow-risk facilities.\n  Second, the legislation should be performance based. What do I mean \nby that? By that I mean our focus should be on having the Department \nestablish the standards, the results, rather than prescribing exactly \nhow a corporation should act to meet those standards, those results. \nFacilities should defend against particular threats. For example, the \nSecretary might specify that facilities should be able to protect \nagainst a hazardous release resulting from a truck bomb. Or the \nSecretary may mandate that every plant have a secure perimeter. Now, \nfacilities could choose to meet those standards by building fences, \nerecting barriers, moving the most hazardous chemicals to a more secure \narea, or even switching to a less hazardous chemical altogether. By \nspecifying the regulations should be performance based, facilities will \nhave the incentives to identify the most effective and cost-efficient \nmeans of increasing protection.\n  The legislation I am introducing today meets those fundamental \ncriteria. It is risk based and it is performance based. This \nlegislation is modeled, in part, on the Maritime Transportation \nSecurity Act, consequently referred to as MTSA.\n  During the course of our four hearings, we heard substantial \ntestimony from security industry experts, the administration and \nothers, that the results-based cooperative approach of MTSA is a major \nsuccess story. In fact, we heard so many positive things about the law \nthat we brought in the Coast Guard's director of port security, Admiral \nBone, to testify about their experience with the current law.\n  The first step in improving the security of our Nation's chemical \nfacilities is to determine which facilities should be covered by \nFederal regulations and to what degree. This legislation requires the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to issue within 1 year of enactment \nregulations establishing criteria for evaluating the types of \nfacilities that should be covered, as well as regulations establishing \nrisk-based tiers for the designated facilities.\n  Following the issuance of these regulations, the Department would \ndesignate covered facilities and place them into tiers. The \ndesignations would be based on risk factors including potential \nlikelihood of death or illness, proximity to population centers, and \nthe potential impact on national security, the economy, and critical \ninfrastructure. The tier would have increasingly strict security \nrequirements as the risk and consequences of a terrorist attack at a \ncovered facility increase.\n  The Department would then set security performance standards for each \ntier. Every facility would be required to conduct a vulnerability \nassessment, establish and implement a site security plan, and create an \nemergency response plan or update an existing plan to include \nprovisions for an intentional attack. Vulnerability assessments would \naddress the threats and consequences of a terrorist attack, including\n\n[[Page S14067]]\n\nvulnerabilities from the use of hazardous chemicals.\n  The site security plan would address the identified vulnerabilities \nand meet the performance standards set by the Department. The site \nsecurity plan would also identify how the facility is coordinating with \nFederal, State, and local officials for response to a terrorist attack. \nThe facilities would be required to drill their security plans and \nemergency response plans. Covered facilities would have 6 months \nfollowing promulgation of regulations to certify compliance and submit \ntheir assessments and plans to the Department for approval.\n  If a facility fails to comply, the legislation I am introducing \nprovides the strongest remedy to the Department. The bill gives the \nSecretary of Homeland Security the authority to shut down chemical \nfacilities that are at high risk and which the Secretary believes have \nnot adequately addressed the risk of a terrorist attack. For the \nhighest risk facilities, the Secretary could order an immediate \nclosure. For the other lower risk facilities, the Department could \norder closure but only after a process of written notification, \nconsultation, and further time for compliance.\n  Now, I recognize this shutdown authority concentrates considerable \npower into the Secretary's hands, but the dire consequences of a \nterrorist attack justify giving the Secretary the authority to shut \ndown a chemical facility that has failed to comply with the law. With \nhundreds of thousands of lives at stake, the Secretary must have the \nauthority to ensure our chemical facilities have adopted security \nmeasures sufficient to reduce the risk of a terrorist attack. If a \nfacility cannot, will not, or has not done so, it simply cannot be \nallowed to keep operating.\n\n  It was only after very careful consideration that I decided to \ninclude this power in my bill. I note that the Maritime Transportation \nSecurity Act provides similar authority to the Coast Guard. Admiral \nBone testified since 2004 the Coast Guard has used this authority to \nshut down 32 facilities--three of which were chemical facilities. He \ntestified it was imperative the Department of Homeland Security be \ngiven that closure authority.\n  Before closing, I will comment on a couple of very important and \ncontroversial issues. One is the issue of inherently safer technology \nwhich is often referred to as IST. My bill allows chemical facilities \nto choose whatever security measures best meet the performance \nstandards required by the Department. IST is one of the recognized \nmeans of meeting a performance standard. In addition, my legislation \nrequires the vulnerability assessment include an analysis of security \nmeasures, including vulnerabilities arising from the use, storage, and \nhandling of dangerous chemicals. However, I make clear our legislation \ndoes not mandate IST. Not only would doing so be at odds with the \nperformance-based approach we have endorsed in this bill, I also do not \nbelieve it is appropriate for a bill on security to dictate specific \nindustrial processes. Such uses are outside the scope of the \nlegislation, beyond the jurisdiction of this committee, and are not the \nonly way to address security issues.\n  I fully expect some facilities will adopt inherently safer \ntechnologies. I certainly encourage them to do so if that is the best \nmeans for them. However, that should be their decision.\n  This legislation does not tell facilities how high to build their \nfences or what chemicals to use or how they may use them. It is the \nresult that matters. I believe this bill will result in significantly \nenhanced security for the chemical sector. This is a Homeland Security \nbill. It is not an environmental regulation.\n  In summary, this legislation requires chemical facilities to conduct \nvulnerability assessments, create and implement security plans, \nestablish emergency response plans, and to submit these plans to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for approval or disapproval. It gives \nthe Department broad authority to ensure that chemical facilities are \naddressing the risks of terrorist attacks and giving the Department the \nauthority it needs. The legislation is risk based and performance \nbased, and I am confident it will provide long overdue standards that \nwill ensure stronger and more consistent security at our chemical \nfacilities.\n\n  Before closing, I once again thank my lead cosponsor and the ranking \nmember of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Lieberman. We have \nworked very hard with the members of our committee, including the \nPresiding Officer, all year long to explore this through a number of \nhearings, and we have engaged in many months of negotiations.\n  I also thank our cosponsors, Senator Coleman, Senator Carper, and \nSenator Levin, for their hard work on this bill.\n  I look forward to adding additional cosponsors and working with the \ncommittee to move this vital legislation forward.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Collins, in introducing the ``Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism \nAct of 2005. I am also delighted that Senators Coleman, Levin, and \nCarper will be joining us on this bill.\n  This bill is the product of extensive work in the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee to explore the risks of a possible \nterrorist attack on our chemical facilities, as well as the best means \nto guard against those risks.\n  Since 9/11 opened our eyes to the threats we face on U.S. soil from \nIslamist terrorist groups, we have moved to improve security for many \nof the critical elements of our society and economy. But somehow we \nhave not yet protected one of our greatest vulnerabilities the chemical \nsector.\n  Chemicals are vital to many of the processes that feed us, heal us, \nand power our economy. Yet the very pervasiveness of the chemical \nsector makes it vulnerable to terrorism. Thousands of facilities \nthroughout the country use or store lethal materials, often near large \npopulation centers.\n  We know that terrorists are interested in targeting these facilities. \nThe Congressional Research Service reports that during the 1990s, both \ninternational and domestic terrorists attempted to use explosives to \nrelease chemicals from manufacturing and storage facilities close to \npopulation centers. The Justice Department in 2002 described the threat \nposed by terrorists to chemical facilities as ``both real and \ncredible,'' for the foreseeable future.\n  Former White House Homeland Security Advisor Richard Falkenrath this \nspring told the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nthat although chemical facilities are a most serious homeland security \nvulnerability, the Federal Government has done almost nothing to secure \nthem. Homeland Security expert Steve Flynn likened the Nation's 15,000 \nchemical facilities to ``15,000 weapons of mass destruction littered \naround the United States.''\n  Fortunately, the responsible players in the chemical industry have \nnot waited for Federal legislation, and some of the leading trade \ngroups have begun their own security programs or participated in some \nvoluntary efforts led by DHS. Some chemical facilities are also subject \nto security regulation under the Maritime Transportation Security Act \nor the Bioterrorism Act of 2002. Yet these programs do not reach the \nfull range of security matters addressed at the committee's hearings \nand in this legislation. More significant, far too many facilities that \nuse extremely hazardous chemicals remain entirely outside the patchwork \nof laws, regulations, and self-protection now in place.\n  For several years, legislation to require security enhancements at \nthese chemical sites has foundered in Congress, bereft of true \nadministration support or Congressional consensus. But I am hopeful \nthat today marks a turning point that will culminate in successful \npassage of a robust chemical security bill.\n  First, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has \nworked on a bipartisan basis to build a foundation for this effort: \nthrough four hearings that explored the issues and possible solutions \nregarding chemical site security and through collaboration on this \nlegislation that has already won strong bipartisan support on our \nCommittee.\n  Second, DHS has now clearly stated--in testimony to our committee--\nthat the current voluntary efforts are\n\n[[Page S14068]]\n\nnot sufficient and that the Department needs new legislative authority \nto regulate chemical site security.\n  Third, responsible segments of the chemical industry--such as the \nAmerican Chemistry Council--have recognized the need for a \ncomprehensive national program to ensure adequate security across the \nentire chemical sector and called for Federal legislation. I welcome \nthis engagement by industry and believe we can work together with them, \nas well as the administration, and all who are concerned about \nsecurity, to forge an effective national program.\n  This legislation is a forceful but pragmatic response to the \nchallenge of chemical site security. It directs its greatest force and \nfocus to those facilities that pose the highest risk in terms of \npotential loss of human life or other catastrophic results.\n  It authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to initiate a \nthoroughgoing security program for thousands of critical chemical sites \naround the country.\n  The Secretary would identify which facilities pose a meaningful risk \ndue to terrorism concerns, and then require these facilities to conduct \na vulnerability assessment and prepare a security plan and emergency \nresponse plan to address the results of this vulnerability analysis.\n  Facilities within the program would submit these assessments and \nplans to DHS for review and approval. DHS would then work with the \nfacilities to ensure the plans, and implementation, are adequate. Under \na tiered system of requirements, those facilities that pose the \ngreatest risk would face the most stringent security requirements as \nwell as a speedier and more rigorous DHS review. The bill includes \ncivil and criminal penalties for noncompliance and, ultimately, \nfacilities may be ordered to shut down if they do not comply with DHS \norders.\n  This legislation recognizes that facilities will need flexibility to \nachieve security in the most efficient and effective manner. The bill \nalso recognizes the work of the responsible chemical companies within \nthe chemical sector and does not force those facilities to reinvent the \nwheel. Instead, the bill ensures that so long as an alternative \nsecurity program's assessments and plans meet the bill's core \nrequirements for vulnerability assessments and site security plans, \nfacilities operating under those alternative security programs can \nsubmit these assessments and plans under the DHS program. However, \nwhere the assessments and plans do not meet the bill's core \nrequirements, the Secretary will require appropriate modifications. \nFinally, the Secretary will judge all assessments and plans against the \nregulations promulgated under this bill.\n  This legislation also recognizes that sometimes the best security \nwill come not from adding guards and gates but from reexamining the way \nchemical operations are carried out in order to reduce the amount of \nhazardous substances on site, improve the way they are stored or \nprocessed or find safer substitutes for the chemicals themselves. These \nchanges serve to make a facility less inviting as a target for \nterrorists, as well as limiting the loss of life or other damage if an \nattack does take place. They also have the added benefit of limiting \nthe harm from an accidental release. This bill clearly requires \nfacilities to look at the risks and consequences related to the \ndangerous chemicals on site and address those specific vulnerabilities \nin their security plan. And it includes these process changes among the \nmenu of security measures that chemical facilities should examine when \ndesigning their security plans.\n  We know that many facilities, and many security experts, already look \nto these less dangerous technologies as a potent and cost-effective way \nto improve security against a possible terror attack. But we also know \nthat, for some facilities, there can be reluctance or structural \nimpediments to looking at these technological solutions. That is why I \nfeel this bill should go further and include more explicit requirements \nfor chemical facilities to consider less dangerous technologies when \nthey make the security enhancements required under this bill. In \nparticular, the riskier facilities--some of which could endanger tens \nor hundreds of thousands of lives if attacked--should have to \ndemonstrate that they have looked closely at options that would reduce \nthe catastrophic consequences of a possible terrorist attack. We had a \npowerful example of such an adjustment close by: after 9/11 focused our \nattention on potential targets in our midst, Washington DC's water \ntreatment facility ended the use of its potentially deadly liquid \nchlorine. This is not a question of forcing industry to conduct its \noperations off a Government-issued playbook. Companies would analyze \nfor themselves whether there are less dangerous ways to conduct their \nbusiness and would not be forced to implement any changes that were not \nfeasible. But given the extraordinary risks involved, it makes little \nsense not to require companies to at least take a long hard look at \nsome of the commonsense solutions that have been advocated or already \nadopted by others within the industry. Therefore, as this bill \nadvances, I will seek to strengthen the requirements for facilities to \ncarefully consider these safer technologies as a means to greater \nsecurity.\n  The bill creates structure within DHS to oversee this regulatory \nprogram and a regional network to help implement its provisions, \nparticularly to help ensure adequate emergency response capabilities in \nthe event of an attack on a chemical facility. There are also \nprovisions to safeguard sensitive information that DHS receives from \nthe chemical facilities, while at the same time requiring DHS to share \nand disclose information necessary for public safety and public \naccountability. The bill does not affect chemical facilities' \nobligations to make information available to the public under right-to-\nknow laws or other regulatory programs, and it establishes a secure \nchannel by which members of the public can submit information about \npotential problems regarding the security of chemical facilities.\n  This bill also recognizes that Congress is not the only body that can \nand should help ensure the safety and security of the Nation's chemical \nfacilities. States and localities have long regulated such facilities \nfor various safety and environmental concerns. Since 9/11, some States \nhave also moved to require security improvements at these facilities. \nThese State and local protections are critical adjuncts to our effort \nat the Federal level, and I am pleased that this bill states clearly \nthat it does not preempt State and local laws or regulations regarding \nthe safety and security of chemical facilities. States and localities \nare free to enact more stringent chemical security legislation. Only if \nthere is an absolute conflict, such that it is impossible for a \nfacility to comply with both the Federal law and a State or local law \nor regulation on chemical security, would the Federal provision take \nprecedence. The bill would not disrupt State and local safety and \nenvironmental law regarding chemical facilities, nor does it dislodge \nor alter the operation of State common law with respect to such \nfacilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/19/senate-section/article/S14068-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AUTHORITIES FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                          Committee on Finance\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
