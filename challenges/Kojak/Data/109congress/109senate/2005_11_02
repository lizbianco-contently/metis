Under the previous order, the time until 6 \np.m. shall be equally divided between the Senator from New Hampshire, \nMr. Gregg, and the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the majority leader is here to be \nrecognized. I ask through the Chair to the distinguished majority \nleader if I could be recognized for a minute or two prior to his \nrecognition. I know he has a right to do that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield.\n\n\n                          The Chaplain's Loss\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, simply what I want to say is we have our \nChaplain, whom I have grown to care a great deal about. He is part of \nthe Senate family. He counsels, he prays for us every day. He suffered \na loss in his family in recent hours; he lost his brother. I want him \non behalf of his Senate family to know our thoughts go out to him. I \nwish I had his ability to counsel and speak with him as he does with \nall of us. All I can say is my thoughts are with him and, recognizing \nhis strong faith, I know he will pull through, but I know it will be \ndifficult.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning we will be getting an earlier \nstart than normal in order to resume the deficit reduction bill. \nSenators Gregg and Conrad have agreed to an order for the next couple \nof amendments. We will continue to debate throughout the course of the \nday. At 6 p.m. all time is expired under the order. The Senate will \nthen debate the Agriculture appropriations conference report under the \n2-hour time limit reached last night. The vote on that conference \nreport will not occur this evening and we will set the time for that \nvote later.\n  On Thursday morning we expect to come in early and begin the voting \nsequence with respect to the pending amendments to the deficit \nreduction bill. When the pending amendments are disposed of, it is in \norder for Members to offer additional amendments. However, no debate is \nin order and we would immediately vote on those amendments. This is \nwhat we call affectionately--maybe not affectionately--the vote-arama. \nI urge my colleagues to show restraint throughout the course of both \ntoday and tomorrow with regard to the number of amendments we are going \nto be voting on. It is going to be an extremely long day tomorrow with \nconsecutive votes and Senators will not be able to wander far from the \nChamber. We want to stay within the time limits for those votes in \norder to expeditiously deal with\n\n[[Page S12150]]\n\neach and every one of them in an efficient way. We will be finishing \nthis bill either tomorrow around 6 o'clock or Friday morning, depending \non how many votes we have.\n  Mr. President, I think at this juncture I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, \nSenator Gregg and I entered into a unanimous consent agreement that the \nfirst amendment to be considered today will be the amendment on the \nAlaska National Wildlife Refuge. The time will be controlled by Senator \nCantwell on our side.\n  The second amendment will be an amendment by Senators Grassley and \nDorgan on payment limits. The third amendment today will be an \namendment by Senators Lott and Lautenberg on Amtrak.\n  I want to say to my colleagues, given the events of yesterday, our \nschedule has been somewhat altered. It is going to be exceedingly \ndifficult to get debate time on all of the remaining amendments, even \nthe significant amendments. We have previously agreed that we will end \ndebate at 6 p.m. today and then tomorrow go into a sequence of votes on \nthe remaining amendments. So I say this by way of urging colleagues to \nshow restraint with respect to the use of time so a maximum number of \namendments can be considered and debated.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we will be going to ANWR here in a second, \nand then we will go to the Grassley-Dorgan amendment, and then the \nDemocratic leader of the bill will, I presume, compose an amendment and \nthen we will go to the Lott amendment on Amtrak. Is that the \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. We have a unanimous consent agreement that is in \nplace with respect to Cantwell, Grassley, Lott.\n  Mr. GREGG. But the understanding is we should put somebody in----\n  Mr. CONRAD. With the understanding we will try to insert an amendment \nin between the second and third.\n  Mr. GREGG. As a matter of fairness, that is the only way to approach \nit.\n  At this time the Senator from Washington is ready to go and we can \nproceed.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2358\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell], for herself, \n     Mr. Feingold, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Kerry, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2358.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strike the title relating to the establishment of an oil \n             and gas leasing program in the Coastal Plain)\n\n       Beginning on page 96, strike line 16 and all that follows \n     through page 102, line 8.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of my amendment that I \nthink would reverse efforts to manipulate the budget resolution process \nto pass what I believe is a controversial energy policy. This policy is \nso controversial it doesn't even meet the bar for what I think is \nreasonable legislation. It couldn't even gain the 60 votes needed in \nthis body.\n  I think it is important that we have a continued debate on drilling \nin Alaska that meets the environmental and permit processes that any \ndrilling in America would have to meet. And that is not what we are \ndiscussing in the underlying bill.\n  My amendment is cosponsored by Senators Feingold, Dayton, Lieberman, \nKerry, and others, and would prevent oil and gas exploration and \ndrilling within the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  I appreciate that this debate over the Arctic Refuge coastal plain \nhas continued for more than 2 decades. I know the Presiding Officer and \nmy other colleague from Alaska have spent many hours on this \nlegislation. But this issue has continued to stir the passions of many \nand polarized communities across our country. That is because this \ndebate is more than just about the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. It is not \nsimply about protecting one of America's last remaining great \ntreasures. Rather, it is a debate that forces us to confront our \npriorities. It forces us to ask basic critical questions: Where do we \ngo from here on the future of our energy policy? What inheritance do we \nwant to leave our children from an environmental perspective?\n  We all must realize that God only granted the United States less than \n3 percent of the world's remaining oil reserves and we as Americans \nneed to do more with our own ingenuity to become less dependent on \nforeign oil.\n  Imagine a future where we don't turn a blind eye to oppressive \nregimes in the Middle East only because they happen to control the \nmajority of the world's remaining oil reserves, or a future where \nAmericans can drive hybrid or hydrogen-powered SUVs that get 40, 50, or \neven 100 miles per gallon. That is how we want to see our future. That \nis how we are going to save consumers who are being hurt at the gas \npump today by these unbelievably high prices.\n  In the future we want Americans to have the opportunity to enjoy and \nappreciate this unique part of Alaska. That is why I believe the \namendment I am offering today talks about our national priorities. That \nis why this is too important a question to slide into the budget bill. \nThis bill circumvents the processes for permitting and environmental \nsafeguards.\n  It is ironic that if this legislation passes we will actually be \nopening up drilling in a wildlife refuge with less protections than any \nother drilling in any other site in America. So instead of going to \ngreater extremes to protect a particular wildlife refuge, we are going \nto have the weakest standard. The American people expect more.\n  I hope my colleagues appreciate that there are many flawed \nassumptions inherent in this drilling proposal. The simple act of \nputting a policy on a budget bill itself, I believe, is disingenuous.\n  But that is not all because section 401 will almost certainly never \nraise the $2.4 billion that drilling proponents claim it will. That is \nbecause the measure presumes to generate these funds by splitting \nrevenues between Alaska and the Federal Government on an even 50-50 \nbasis. But I think my colleagues might be surprised to learn that this \n50-50 legislative language may not hold up in court. We just don't know \nright now. We do know the State of Alaska has long maintained it is due \n90 percent of all the natural resource development revenue generated \nfrom Federal land within its boundaries, and we know this remains a \ncontroversial issue. Some have suggested this proposed 50-50 split in \nthis legislation is merely a ploy to win passage. Some have suggested \nthat once it passes, it will be followed by a court battle from the \nState of Alaska to force the Federal Government into a 90-10 split of \nrevenue. So this $2.4 billion the United States might receive would be \na much different picture.\n  My colleagues may be interested to know that even in June of this \nyear, the Alaska legislature passed a joint resolution. It stated:\n\n       The Alaska legislature opposes any unilateral reduction in \n     royalty revenue from exploration and development of the \n     coastal plain of the Arctic Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and any \n     attempts that could coerce the State of Alaska into accepting \n     less than 90 percent of the oil, gas, and mineral royalties \n     from Federal lands in Alaska that was promised at statehood.\n\n  That is something that was passed by the Alaska legislature, showing \nus they have every intention to fight for a 90-10 split.\n  Later this week I will also offer an amendment that will get at this \nissue of trying to guarantee a 50-50 revenue split. I hope my \ncolleagues will be recorded on that amendment and show they truly \nintend to have a 50-50 split and that this not just a ploy in which \nlater the revenue scheme is changed.\n  I am also concerned that many Senators may not support my amendment \nbecause they believe drilling in the refuge can be done in an \nenvironmentally benign way. They actually believe we should move \nforward because they think drilling in ANWR can be done in a way that \nis environmentally sensitive.\n  I think they are wrong. There is no real way to sugarcoat the fact \nthat the oil company records on the adjacent\n\n[[Page S12151]]\n\nPrudhoe Bay have been shameful. The facts speak for themselves.\n  According to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, the \nPrudhoe Bay oilfields and Trans-Alaska Pipeline have caused an average \nof 504 spills annually--annually--on the North Slope since 1996. \nThrough last year, these spills included more than 1.9 million gallons \nof toxic substances, most commonly diesel, crude oil, and hydraulic \noil. It takes one spill to permanently destroy a section of this \nfragile arctic ecosystem. The people know this.\n  To quote an official from the North Slope city of Nuiqsut:\n\n       Development has increased the smog, haze, and is affecting \n     the health and the beauty of our land, sea, and air.\n\n  I can only imagine how devastating that must be for someone whose \nculture and experience is so invested in the vast open spaces and \nabundant wildlife.\n  The news media has reported widely on these issues of oil spills. 2 \nweeks ago, the Wall Street Journal, and many other papers, have \nreported on some serious allegations. They have uncovered evidence that \nindicates there has been intentional dumping of untreated toxic mud, a \ndangerous contaminated byproduct common to Arctic drilling.\n  We have seen reports that the owner of an alpine field was forced to \npay an $80,000 fine for releasing 215 tons of excess carbon monoxide \nannually. And, yes, this is the same field that some of my colleagues \nvisited last March, along with the Secretaries of Energy and the \nInterior. Yet it is not the pristine area. There is already evidence of \npollution in that area. This is the same field my visiting colleagues \ncharacterize as the cleanest in the world. And I note the Alpine field \nis just 8 miles from Nuiqsut.\n  I also want the American people to know that the tradeoff for \ndestroying our Nation's last great wild frontier will not be relief \nfrom skyrocketing gas prices. Our sacrifice will do little to decrease \nour reliance on foreign oils from countries that don't have our best \nintentions in mind. Here is why. The Energy Department's latest \nanalysis estimates that even when the refuge oil hits peak production \n20 years from now, it will lower gas prices by just one penny. A penny, \nMr. President. That is not an estimate that I have come up with, that \nis the Department of Energy's own estimate.\n  That is not very impressive considering the fact that the \nconstituents in my State of Washington are now paying twice as much for \na gallon of gas as they did just 3 years ago.\n  I also urge my colleagues to vote for an amendment that my colleague \nfrom Oregon plans to offer. This legislation would prevent any of this \noil from going to foreign markets, such as China. Senator Wyden has \npointed out to us and many others, including those in the State of \nOregon, that there is no guarantee that the Arctic Refuge oil would \never be used in the United States.\n  So if my colleagues think if we pass this legislation that somehow it \nis going to help the United States in the crisis we are in now, the \nDepartment of Energy analysis of the very little effect and the fact \nthat this oil will not be kept in the United States are two reasons to \nsupport my amendment instead.\n  Mr. President, the American people feel strongly about drilling in \nthe refuge and other protected areas of our country. They want to know \nthat the Senate is working to pass appropriate legislation that manages \nthese unique areas in a forthright and open manner. Our Nation must \ncontinue to preserve and protect the entire Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues believe it is appropriate to \nsacrifice this area for what will amount to about 6 months' oil supply, \nbut I think all Senators today agree that these are questions that are \nnot part of a budget policy. They are more fundamental about the \ndiscussions of what our national energy policy should be and the future \nof our country.\n  I hope my colleagues will also begin to finally start focusing on \nenergy policies to diversify off fossil fuel, to recognize that God \ngave us only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves and that the best \ninterest of the United States is to diversify off fossil and plan for a \nfuture that lowers gas prices, plan for a future that makes us more \nsecure on an international basis.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes, I will.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. May I inquire, has the amendment been \nsubmitted?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is currently pending.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The ANWR amendment has been submitted. Are we taking time \noff the amendment?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, we are.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We are taking time off the amendment. I thank the Chair. \nI excuse the interruption.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is the Senator finished? I notice she is still \nstanding.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator from Washington maintain \nthe floor?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I don't know what the agreed-upon order \nis this morning, whether we are supposed to use an entire hour or if we \nare going back and forth. I am happy to have the debate go back and \nforth and yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't think there is any agreed-upon order.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is correct, \nthere is no order pending.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is it correct that the Senator from New Mexico may \nproceed on the hour in opposition to the amendment at this point?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct, if the Senator \nfrom Washington yields the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I do.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a number of Senators on this side \nof the aisle who wish to speak, and they certainly are going to have \ntheir turn. I thank the occupant of the chair for being here this \nmorning.\n  Obviously, this is an issue that some people think is very important \nto the State of Alaska, and there is no question that it is. But this \nis an issue that is important to the American people. Every day \nAmericans are worried about our future. We just saw hurricanes in the \nStates of Alabama, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi shut down oil \nproduction in that part of the Nation. All of a sudden, America found \nout that when we have that much less oil--the amount that the \nhurricanes took off the market--everything happens for the worst for \nAmerica.\n  I want to start with a simple proposition. The minimal amount \nexpected to be received by the U.S. people from ANWR is about \nequivalent to all of the oil that was shut down by the hurricanes. Just \nthink of that. Everybody was listening to televisions were talking \nabout and, newspapers were printing all of the oil rigs onshore and \noffshore that produce energy for America that were shut down causing \nthis enormous problem for America. One estimate is that ANWR will yield \nthat much oil or more, which is a pretty good starting point.\n  I am not going to go into much detail about this ANWR language that \nwas produced by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in response \nto a budget request made by the full Senate, and I am not going to talk \nabout the $2.5 billion estimate, other than to say I do not believe \nanybody is going to challenge it successfully before the Senate. It has \nbeen arrived at by the Congressional Budget Office, the authenticator \nof numbers for the Senate. That number is not dreamt up. This is not \nthe White House, this is not the Energy Committee, this is not the \nAlaskan Senators; this is the Congressional Budget Office, an \nindependent entity that is supposed to do estimates that we assume \nshould be used by us.\n  They say the legislation, as drafted, will produce at least $2.5 \nbillion over the period of time recommended by the budget instructions.\n  That makes it relevant to the budget reduction bill that is before \nus. It will, when it happens, because of the bids that will be made, \nreduce the deficit by $2.4 billion. That makes it relevant to a big \ndeficit reduction package of all of the actions that exceeds $39 \nbillion.\n  Having said that, let me then say, since it is important and it is \nrelevant\n\n[[Page S12152]]\n\nand it will yield revenues to the Federal Government, the next point I \nwish to make is how many votes are going to be required to pass this \nANWR legislation. This is a majority-vote situation. Some say: Oh, this \nis not the right way to do it. We should leave it under what they call \nthe normal proceedings. Normal proceedings would, I say to the \nopposition, require 60 votes, and we have done something that will only \nrequire a majority vote.\n  I ask the American people who are listening and those who are \nconcerned about this, What do you as Americans expect the Senate to do \nwhen they are voting on a measure that affects the American people? \nSince your first and early days of being educated about the American \nsystem, did you not assume that a majority of Senators voting would \npass a measure in behalf of the American people? Isn't that what we \nthought was the rule, 51 votes wins? They say: No, you shouldn't let \nthis great reserve of oil that belongs to us, that we ought to use, you \nshouldn't let 51 votes pass it. You ought to use 60 votes under some \nfilibuster rule.\n\n  The rules of this Senate say you do not filibuster this kind of bill. \nYou go back to the old American way of voting, and 51 votes prevail.\n  I hope, finally, after decades of work, that we are rid of the 60-\nvote impediment to getting these assets, these reserves, these \nresources opened up for our people, and we are back to the old-\nfashioned 51-vote approach, and that finally America will say: These \nare our resources, they belong to us, and we ought to go up there and, \nunder as strict environmental laws as can ever apply, because they are \nthe American laws, produce oil there.\n  To put it in perspective as to how much property we are going to \naffect, if this bill, as propounded by the Committee on Energy, is \npassed by this Senate, we will use up to 2,000 acres. It will not be in \none place. It will be in various places, but it will be 2,000 acres.\n  Mr. President, that is 2,000 acres out of a refuge that is being \ntalked about regularly as something that we should preserve and keep \nfor posterity, and this Senator--and I believe everyone who favors \nANWR--says: Amen, preserve it.\n  How big is it? It is 19 million acres. And 2,000 acres, I say to the \nSenator from Illinois, are going to be used. The refuge is 19 million \nacres. I don't want to draw conclusions from that. People can see \nthemselves, 2,000 acres. Or can they? I guess you can't even see it. \nMr. President, 2,000 acres out of 19 million acres is hardly visible.\n  We can see the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on this chart. The \nANWR Coastal Plain is in green. The proposed development is that little \ntiny red square. I don't know if the TV cameras are good enough to see \nit, but that is the 2,000 acres, 3.13 square miles. It is on the green \npiece on the chart. That is the size of a piece of real estate out of \nthat entire area--the green, the yellow, and the orange--that will be \nused for the production of oil out of ANWR.\n  I cannot believe the American people--if they understand after this \ndebate is finished that that is what we are talking about--could \nconceivably believe that this vote should fail today and we should \ncontinue to say: Everything is wonderful in America. We can get our oil \nfrom Saudi Arabia. We can get it from Mexico. We can get it from around \nthe world. But don't bother to get it from America. It is just not what \nwe ought to do.\n  This country of ours has become dependent on our own States getting \n80 percent of our oil from four States: Texas, 22 percent; Louisiana, \n21 percent; California, 18 percent; and Alaska, 20 percent. That is \njust the way it is.\n\n  So, fellow Americans, our future, as far as American production, is \ntied to those States. We do have some new finds in the West, and they \nare exciting, but they are not going to be anywhere close to this.\n  Incidentally, mentioning Texas, some people say this is not very much \noil. I heard somebody mention that the 10 billion barrels that are \ngoing to be produced there is not very much. Let me tell you how much \nit is: It is equal to the reserves of Texas. So for those who think it \nis not very much, maybe we ought to say to the American people the \nentire production of Texas is not very much. Maybe we could say we \ndon't need the oil from Texas. If we go out there and find we don't \nlike the way it is produced, just shut it down. It isn't important. \nThere would be absolute turmoil in this country if somebody said, Take \nthe oil from Texas and close it down, we don't need it; it is just what \nTexas produces, and we don't need it.\n  So the American people understand, when this 2,000 acres is \nproducing, it is estimated by reliable estimators that it will cause \nthe reserves under the ground to be the equivalent of those in the \nState of Texas. That is a pretty big piece of the oil future of the \nUnited States.\n  Let me talk a minute about a couple of other things that happen when \nyou open ANWR. First, in the United States these days, we are all \nwondering what is happening to American jobs. How come everything is \ngoing overseas? How come the American working man, the American \nconstruction worker who used to make good money--how come there is not \nenough work in that field? How come big construction projects are not \nbeing done here anymore? How come it is just reported that out of the \nover 400 chemical plants that are worth more than $1 billion, each that \nis being built in the world, one of them is being built in the great \nUnited States of America and the rest of them all over the world? We \nare asking ourselves, What is happening to our country? What is \nhappening is we do not develop our own resources, and thus they are \ndeveloped elsewhere and there are no jobs in America to produce what we \nhave.\n  I have another chart here behind me, and then that will be all that I \nwill use. This is one prepared by the Wharton School. Some will say, \nand I will answer before they do, that this chart was produced a few \nyears ago. It was. But do you know what Wharton School did when they \nproduced it years ago? They used $55 a barrel. People on the floor of \nthe Senate said: Throw it way. At $55 a barrel, they have to be wrong. \nWe just asked them 2 years ago: Would you please bring it current? They \nsaid: Now we know we are right. We estimated $55, and I will tell you \ntoday it is $59-plus on the market in the United States. So the Wharton \nstudy is certainly as good as we can get.\n  Look what it says. If you develop ANWR, the United States of America, \nfor Americans, will produce 128,000 manufacturing jobs; mining, \nincluding oil--all high-paying jobs--84,000; trade, 225,000 in various \ntrade activities; the service industry, 145,000; construction per se, \n135,000; and then a combination of finance, real estate, and others, \nwhich is that FIRE, 19,500. The total is 736,000 jobs.\n  Has anybody produced such a bill on the floor of the Senate? We say \nlet's have a jobs bill. We introduce a bill to train people who are \nunemployed so they can go to another job. We introduce a bill that says \nwhen people are laid off, we will train them for another job, and this \nwill produce a big number of jobs. Has anybody ever introduced a bill, \nhad a proposal, made a suggestion, argued in favor of--anything on the \nfloor of the Senate that could produce 736,000 jobs, new jobs for the \npeople of the United States? Of course not, because we do not produce \njobs in the Senate. We don't produce them with bills, either, job \ntraining bills. We produce them when we do things or eliminate things \nthat cause entrepreneurial investment activity that produces wealth, \nand with wealth, jobs.\n  That is what we have here, no doubt about it. At $50 a barrel, which \nis the Wharton study, that is what it will yield. Anybody who thinks \nthat by the time we get to ANWR it will not be $50 a barrel and it will \nnot yield this I believe is hiding under their Senate desk as they vote \nno here in the Senate as far as ANWR is concerned.\n  Having said that, I want to take 3 minutes and tell the Senate about \nan experience I had. I went to Alaska, after many years. My friend, the \noccupant of the chair, and our new Senator from Alaska recently pushed \nme to do it. I went in about March of last year. It was awfully cold. I \nknow that. I have one great picture--I cannot believe I survived.\n  But what I saw, every Senator who is against this proposal ought to \nhonestly go see what is going on. There is one production pad called \nAlpine. In its completed stage, it is 60 acres of property. In its \ncompleted stage, it is 60\n\n[[Page S12153]]\n\nacres. On that 60 acres is the production capacity for 150,000 barrels \na day. Got it? That is 150,000 barrels a day. The 60 acres, when we saw \nit, was solid ice. It had oil wells on it that were drilled, many of \nthem, in less than 1 year, all close together, many of which were \nvertical and horizontal, meaning you drill a well down and then go out \nsideways and you go out for 3 or 4 miles, 5 miles. When we get around \nto ANWR, they are going to be drilling out 10, 15, 20 miles. So from \none piece of real estate which we are worried about we will get \nliterally scores of underground wells producing oil that is coming to \nthe surface, unified, and then put in a distribution facility and \ndelivered.\n\n  All of that work will be done in the dead of winter--the trucks, the \ntractors, the moving things, the supplies, all come on winter roads. We \nwere there, so we could see the winter roads.\n  When the summer comes, the ice melts, the roads disappear, the tundra \nis right back where it was, and Alpine, the 150,000-barrel production \nwells are there, covered by whatever covers them from the weather, and \nout comes a spout from which the oil goes on stakes that hold up the \npipeline, and there it is, delivered to a source to go to be used by \nAmericans as they need oil to live, survive, make a living, and keep up \ntheir standard of living.\n  Some say we should not be dependent upon crude oil and carbons in the \nfuture. I submit there is nobody suggesting that we know how to get off \nof the transportation system we are currently using, in the short term. \nWe are going to be on that for some time, even when we engage in the \nlargest program we can, in terms of new ways to get our mobility, \nwhatever it is--maybe hydrogen engines. It is going to take us many \nyears, during which time we are going to import oil from overseas in \nhuge quantities and send American bounty to foreign countries, greatly \nincreasing our foreign trade balance, by the billions of dollars, all \nbecause we send our money overseas to acquire oil.\n  I beg the Senate to once and for all do the right thing regarding our \nfuture. Say no to sending more of our resources overseas. Say no to \nfewer jobs for the American people for the future. Say yes to the \nunions of the United States that represent these workers who are here \nen masse, begging us to pass this so they will have jobs. Say yes to \nAmerican business that is frightened about our competitive future, and \nsay at least we are going to take one step forward, not another step \ntoward complacency, toward not caring about our future and standing on \nprinciples that are not applicable today.\n  We know how to drill for oil without damaging the tundra, without \ndamaging the surface to any significant degree. We ought to say yes, \ntoday, to a very good budget reduction bill which in its totality will \nreduce the budget $39 billion--not a little pittance--of which ANWR \nwill yield $2.5 billion. That is not too shabby a number.\n  It will require 51 votes for those who want to take this out. In the \nend, we will need 51 votes to pass the bill. I believe that is fair. It \nis such a huge resource for America. It should be passed or denied not \nby 60 votes but by 51 votes, the majority vote in the United States. \nArgue as you may in opposition to this. This is not the way to do it. \nThen what do you say the way to do it is? To require 60 votes? Who ever \nheard of that as an American principle? That is a procedure that does \nnot apply here. The Senate has said it doesn't apply here. The old \nAmerican way of 51 votes applies, and that is why we are here.\n  I want to close in one rebuttal. We are going to hear a lot that this \noil doesn't do much. Whenever the amount of oil produced is equated to \nthe total American picture, I want to answer it this way: Accepting a \nmean calculation of 10.4 billion barrels of oil in ANWR, it would \nsupply every drop of oil for the entire State of Florida for 29 years. \nHear that, the entire State of Florida for 29 years; the entire State \nof Arkansas for 146 years; Hawaii, 249 years. We will not be using oil \nthat long, but people should surely get an idea that this is a pretty \nsignificant resource for our country.\n  I thank all those who helped put this bill together in our committee. \nI hope sometime during the day we will have a vote and it will be a \nvote where we say, for a change, we believe in America's future and we \nare going to do something about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from \nWashington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am going to yield to my colleague, \nSenator Feingold. Before I do, I point out there is a misrepresentation \nthat somehow drilling in ANWR only covers a small area. Drilling in the \nrefuge will really create a spider web of industrial activities over \nthe entire 1.5 million acre coastal plain, so it is much larger than \njust a small footprint.\n  This legislation might also open up nearly 100,000 acres of native \nland on the Arctic coastal plain. So it is a much bigger impact than my \ncolleague might have commented on. I want to make sure that point is \nclear.\n  The other issue is, I don't think there is anybody in America who \nstill believes our future and the future security of America depends on \nfossil fuel. I have seen the television commercials from the oil \nindustry. Even they are always talking about the future, and \nalternative fuels, and what they are doing to diversify our nation's \nenergy supplies. I certainly hope they hurry up and do that because the \nhigh price we are paying at the pump and their exorbitant profits are \nnot leading us to a better economic situation in America.\n  But at the same time, I don't think Americans believe our investments \nin the future should be about fossil fuel, they should be about \ndiversifying to cleaner, more fuel free supplies. Instead we are now \nasking them to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for a very \nsmall amount of oil.\n  My colleague talked about a large number of jobs that may result from \nthis. However, we have all heard the expectations for an energy economy \nof the future that invests in alternative fuels and various renewable \nenergy sources. Some of those job investments can be more than 3 \nmillion jobs in America.\n  That is the energy economy that we want to see--not holding on to the \npast and exorbitant energy costs which the Department of Energy says is \nonly going to give us a 1-penny reduction in gasoline prices--to get \noff fossil fuel.\n  I yield to my colleague from Wisconsin 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized \nfor 7 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nCantwell's amendment to strike section 401 from the budget \nreconciliation bill. I thank her for her dedication to protecting the \nArctic Refuge, for her great deal of work over the years on this very \nimportant issue, and especially for her leadership today.\n  As I have said numerous times, I am deeply disappointed that the \nbudget process is being abused to open the Refuge to oil and gas \nactivities.\n  The Senator from New Mexico said he is going to hear Senators come \nout and say this isn't the way to do it. He is right. This isn't the \nway to do it. I have tried to make this point in the Budget Committee \nfor 2 years. This isn't the way to make policy relating to energy, and \nI deeply regret that we have to be out here on the floor dealing with \nthis. It should have been disposed of in the Budget Committee, as it is \na matter not appropriate for this setting.\n  Drilling in the Arctic Refuge is something that has been, and should \ncontinue to be, discussed in an open debate instead of as part a back-\ndoor maneuver. This is a debate about energy and environmental policy, \nas everybody knows. This is not about the Nation's budget. I believe \nthat this back-door tactic is an abuse of the reconciliation process. \nIt reflects poorly on this body, Mr. President, and invites greater \nmischief down the line.\n  Sadly, regardless of when or where we have this debate, we have it \nbecause of a failure, most recently encapsulated by this \nadministration's flawed Energy bill, to provide the American public \nwith an energy policy that actually looks to the future. There is no \ndoubt that we, as a nation, face tough questions about our energy \npolicy. However, it is clear that offering the Refuge as the solution \npoints us in the wrong direction. Drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge is a shortsighted sacrifice of one of America's \ngreatest natural treasures, all for a supply of oil that may not last \nmore than a year, would not be available for\n\n[[Page S12154]]\n\nmany years to come, and, as the Senator from Washington pointed out, \nwould decrease gas prices by only a penny at its highest production. \nInstead of such a backward plan, we need a forward-looking national \nenergy policy that responsibly moves away from our dependence on a \nfinite resource such as oil and toward greater energy independence. I \nregret that the administration's only answer to our energy crisis is to \nattempt to drill their way out of it.\n  Beyond my objection to the abuse of process and to the failure of our \nenergy policy, I have several concerns about the specific language \nincluded in this bill.\n  First, I have grave concerns that we are basing our revenue \nassumptions on false financial pretenses. To achieve the $2.4 billion \nrequired by the budget reconciliation, which, for comparison purposes, \nis equal to 3 weeks' worth of ExxonMobil's 2005 third quarter profits, \nwe are proceeding on the assumption that companies will bid an average \nof $3,333 for each and every acre of the 1.5 million acres of Coastal \nPlain of the Arctic Refuge. However, over the last 15 years, bonus bids \nfor acreage on Alaska's North Slope have averaged approximately $60 per \nacre, which is 98 percent less than what is required for purposes of \nthis budget reconciliation. Assuming the leases on areas with unknown \ndeposits will sell for more than 50 times the historical average is \njust plain fiscally irresponsible. Fundamentally, the reality of the \nleasing situation does not seem to coincide with the revenues we assume \ntoday.\n  Second, supposing that the revenues actually do reach the presumed \nlevel, the U.S. Treasury, and the U.S. taxpayer, may never see the \nmoney associated with opening the Refuge.\n  Both the State of Alaska and the Alaskan delegation have made it \nclear that the State is likely to sue to receive 90 percent of the \nleasing revenues instead of the 50 percent stated in this language. In \nfact, this spring, the Alaska legislature passed a resolution that said \nthey opposed ``any attempt to coerce the State of Alaska into accepting \nless than the 90 percent of the oil, gas, and mineral royalties from \nthe Federal land in Alaska that was promised to the State at \nstatehood.'' The Alaskan resolution makes it clear, as I have stated \nbefore, that the debate over the Refuge is about energy policy and not \nabout the budget, and it doesn't belong in the budget reconciliation \npackage which is before us today.\n  Finally, the language included in this bill fails to grant the same \nfundamental protections to the Arctic Refuge as we grant to every \nsquare inch of the other Federal lands on which drilling occurs. Why \ndoes the bill fail to provide the Arctic Refuge with fundamental \nenvironmental protections? Simply because the Energy Committee argues \nthat the Federal Government can meet the budgetary time constraints \nonly by ignoring the established laws of the land. By slashing \nenvironmental protections so that they are lower than on any other \nFederal land, we are all but guaranteeing that the Coastal Plain will \nsuffer unnecessary, preventable, and irreversible damage. This is no \nway to treat the crown jewel of our National Wildlife Refuge System.\n  Mr. President, the language of the underlying provision is based on \nrisky lease bid assumptions, it leaves the door open to diminished \nFederal revenues, and it gives the Refuge fewer environmental \nprotections than all other Federal lands that produce oil. It has no \nplace in this reconciliation bill, and I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport Senator Cantwell's amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Connecticut \n3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and my colleague from Washington. I \nrise to support her amendment.\n  Mr. President, once again we are here on the floor of the Senate \ndebating opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling--a \ndebate that began in 1985 and that has always been answered before now \nwith a definitive ``no'' on this Senate floor.\n  Today's debate is on a motion to strike language permitting drilling \nthat has been placed in the budget reconciliation bill--a back-door \nmaneuver to avoid true, unlimited debate on a decision whose \nconsequences will echo for generations with the fracturing of a unique \necosystem.\n  The language in the Budget Reconciliation Act fails its own two tests \nfor success. It will not raise significant revenue for the Treasury and \nit will not lead us to energy security.\n  This is both the wrong way to make this decision. And it is clearly \nthe wrong decision to make.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for the motion to strike. If \nthis vote fails--and drilling is approved--then for that reason alone, \nI will vote against the Reconciliation bill.\n  Let me begin by explaining why it is wrong to even be debating \ndrilling in the Arctic Refuge in the context of this reconciliation \nbill.\n  This past summer we debated and passed comprehensive energy \nlegislation. Drilling in the Arctic Refuge was not even brought up in \nthat thousand-page bill that we were told represented comprehensive \nenergy policy.\n  The fact that the Senate spent no time whatsoever debating drilling \nin the Arctic Refuge as part of energy legislation, but now deals with \nit in budget legislation, tells us everything we need to know about the \nmotive of its proponents.\n  They know they don't have the votes needed to authorize drilling if \nthis proposal came to us in a proper debate in the proper context and \nare using this device of the reconciliation bill to get around Senate \nrules.\n  Is there anyone in this Chamber who believes that the purpose of this \nprovision is to generate revenue for the budget? That in the context of \na $2.6 trillion budget, we must force the opening of a wildlife refuge \nto get $2 billion in new revenue over 10 years? Of course not.\n  The real purpose of this provision is to frustrate the rules of the \nSenate--rules that protect the minority and the process of judicious \ndeliberation--in order to jam through a provision through \nreconciliation that its proponents have been unable to pass for years.\n  Section 401--the Arctic Refuge Title of the reconciliation bill--\nflagrantly usurps the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, EPW.\n  EPW has sole jurisdiction over matters relating to the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service and the management of the National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem--as well as over the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, \nNEPA, and the National Wildlife Refuge Administration Act of 1966.\n  For example, the title would virtually preclude the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act's requirement that environmental impact \nassessments be performed before any leases can be granted.\n  Also, section 401 short circuits the all-important determination that \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service is required by the National Wildlife \nRefuge Administration Act to make that drilling is compatible with the \npurposes of the refuge.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider that if this procedural sleight-of-\nhand can be used to stymie open and unlimited debate on drilling in the \nArctic Refuge, what other areas now closed for drilling will be opened \nup under the pretext of generating Federal revenue?\n  The Great Lakes? Our coasts?\n  And what will we get in return for putting this fragile Arctic \nwilderness area at risk? Will we achieve energy independence?\n  No we certainly won't.\n  The Energy Information Agency tells us that peak production in the \nArctic Refuge will be fewer than 1 million barrels per day. And that \npeak will not be reached until 2025 at the earliest.\n  At that point, if we continue our current oil-consumption trends, the \nrefuge will be contributing no more than 4 percent of U.S. oil \nconsumption.\n  Meanwhile, 70 percent of our oil needs will be met by imports, with \nour national security and economy remaining every bit as vulnerable to \nthe economic dynamics and geopolitics of the global oil market as it is \ntoday.\n  If we were serious about facing up to the reality of our energy \nsecurity challenge, we would be committing ourselves to changing the \ntrend of ever-rising oil consumption.\n\n[[Page S12155]]\n\n  That is why I will shortly be introducing--with colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle--legislation that will lower our national dependence \non oil by reinventing our transportation system from the refinery to \nthe tailpipe by using hybrid vehicles and homegrown biofuels and \nelectricity to power our vehicles.\n  Destroying perhaps one of the greatest wilderness areas in the United \nStates under the twin but barren banners of energy security and Federal \nrevenue is unacceptable when you consider what is at stake.\n  On February 14 of this year, 1,000 leading U.S. and Canadian \nscientists called on President Bush to protect the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge from oil drilling and to ``support permanent protection \nof the coastal plain's significant wildlife and wilderness values.''\n  The signers categorically rejected the notion that the impacts of \ndrilling could be confined to a limited footprint, as pro-drilling \nforces claim.\n  The effects of oil wells, pipelines, roads, airports, housing, \nprocessing plants, gravel mines, air pollution, industrial noise, \nseismic exploration and exploratory drilling would radiate across the \nentire coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge.\n  Given those inevitable environmental intrusions, is it any wonder, \nthen, that the authors of this measure included provisions that would \nstymie the environmental protections that would normally apply under \nthe National Environmental Policy Act and the National Wildlife \nAdministration Act? And because they have all but eliminated these \nprotections, drilling will go forward with virtually none of the \nenvironmental protections that the public expects to be in place for \nsuch activity on other federal lands.\n  It just makes no sense to destroy the Arctic Refuge for oil that \nwon't lower prices to our consumers or give us true energy security.\n  The mark of greatness in a generation lies not just in what it builds \nfor itself, but also in what it preserves for the generations to come.\n  Drilling in the Arctic for some short-term convenience in our time, \nwill shortchange the legacy we should be building for the time of our \nchildren.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to adopt the motion to strike.\n  I believe this is both the wrong way to make this decision, and it is \nclearly the wrong decision to make.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the motion to strike.\n  I say for myself, if the vote fails, for that reason alone I will \nvote against the reconciliation bill.\n  I want to add this one procedural point to the very strong arguments \nI think my colleagues have made in support of the motion to strike and \nabout why this is an end run on the rules, and why this is not about a \nbudget matter. This will raise a few billion dollars over 10 years; \nwhereas, the annual budget of the United States projected for the next \nfiscal year is $2.6 trillion.\n  This is about drilling in the Arctic, not about the budget, and it \ndoesn't belong here.\n  I want to make this additional procedural point, which I think \nstrikes at the heart of some of the key provisions in this section.\n  Section 401--which is the Arctic Refuge title--flagrantly usurps the \njurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee in \ncontravention of the rules. The EPW Committee has sole jurisdiction \nover matters relating to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the \nmanagement of the National Wildlife Refuge System, as well as over the \nNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and National Wildlife Refuge \nAdministration Act of 1960.\n  For example, the title that would be struck would greatly limit to \nthe point of preclusion the National Environmental Policy Act \nrequirement that environmental impact assessments be performed before \nany leasing can be granted.\n  Also, section 401 shortcircuits the all-important determination that \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service is required by the National Wildlife \nRefuge Administration Act to make sure the drilling is compatible for \npurposes of the Refuge.\n  I intend, at the proper time, to raise these procedural questions.\n  I thank my colleagues for giving me these few minutes.\n  This is a critical debate that I have been involved in since I came \nin 1989. I regret that it is happening this way. It is happening this \nway because the votes are not there in a full debate and in the \nparliamentary-appropriate context of drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am pleased to be standing on the floor today about 8 months after \nthe last opportunity that we had to debate the issue of development of \na very small portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. During \nthat time--during that 8-month intervening time--we have seen the price \nof a barrel of oil rise to as high as $73--now about $63. The chairman \nof the Energy Committee indicates that this morning it is about $59.\n  That rise has come because of a number of factors--continuing strong \noil demand in China and India and other developing nations. It has come \nbecause of the effects of weather. We have seen the consequences of the \nhurricanes in the gulf. It comes also because the world fundamentally \nneeds more oil.\n  Goldman Sachs, in August, predicted that oil will average $68 again \nnext year.\n  Also, since the last time we debated the subject of ANWR, we passed \nan Energy bill. In that Energy bill, we addressed not only production, \nbut we addressed conservation. We addressed renewable energy sources, \nalternative energy sources. But in terms of doing anything significant \nto directly increase domestic oil and gas production, we didn't do much \nin that Energy bill. We delayed that action until now.\n  I would like to take some time this morning to talk about why \ndevelopment of the Coastal Plain is not just necessary in light of the \ncurrent events in the past few months, not just the price of energy but \nin light of what has happened up north in view of the technological \nchange, the new data that has been developed in the past decade to \nprove, to establish, that we can develop ANWR oil without harm to the \nenvironment and to the wildlife that live there.\n  My colleague from Washington, who has proffered this motion to strike \nthe ANWR provision, has said her amendment is really about national \npriority. I would suggest that the national priorities which are at \nstake with ANWR are priorities that relate to energy security, a \npriority that relates to environmental security, and a priority that \nrelates to National and economic security.\n  These are what the priorities are about and this is what ANWR can do \nfor us as a nation. It can help us with our reliance on foreign sources \nof oil, it can help us with jobs, it can help us build a stronger \neconomy, and it can help us in terms of meeting our environmental \nobligation to our land.\n  Let me talk about some of these issues. First, national security. \nWhen we talk about the reliance we have as a nation on foreign sources \nof oil, it is not just talk. The reality is, this hits us, it impacts \nus in an incredibly significant way. Right now we are about 58 percent \ndependent on foreign oil. This dependency is expected to pass the two-\nthirds mark within the next 20 years. It threatens our national \nsecurity. It threatens our economy.\n  When we see statements coming from Venezuela, for instance, one of \nour leading sources of imported oil, suggesting maybe they do not need \nto do business with the United States, and we recognize the competition \nfor oil on the global market, competition from China, from India, we \nrecognize we must do more domestically to meet our needs, to strike \nthis balance between our need and what we are able to supply.\n  Chairman Domenici spoke to the jobs factor, the economic side, as \nwell as what this means to our balance of payments. ANWR oil will help \nstabilize not only our national energy prices, but it will generate \nmore than $30 billion in Federal revenues within 15 years.\n  We talk about reducing our balance of payments deficit all the time. \nPeople need to appreciate one-quarter of this Nation's trade deficit \nrelates to what we pay other countries for our oil. Last year we paid \n$166 billion to buy oil overseas. We will pay even\n\n[[Page S12156]]\n\nmore than that this year. We have to do something to address that \nbalance of trade issue.\n  The jobs will be created. People associate jobs as drilling and \nexploration jobs. What they need to keep in mind is, when we have \ndevelopment of this size that we believe we can have on the Coastal \nPlain, this means jobs all over the country in terms of making the nuts \nand bolts, the pipes, the hauling, the shipping. This means increased \ncommerce, increased job activity all over the country.\n  We throw around a lot of numbers, but look what it could mean to \nindividual States: To my colleague from Washington, 12,000 jobs in \nWashington State; 80,000 jobs in California; 48,000 jobs in New York \nState; Pennsylvania gets 34,000; Florida, 34,000; Arkansas, 5,500. \nThese are jobs associated with the activity that will go on up north. \nThis is one of the reasons we have support across the country for \nopening ANWR, a small portion of the Coastal Plain, to oil exploration \nand development. People see the economic opportunity for them even in \nStates that are thousands of miles away.\n  Farmers recognize this will help them with stabilizing what they need \nto do when they are planting the crops in the spring. Think of those \nproducts made from oil. We get so fixated on the transportation sector, \nbut the reality is we derive much from petroleum. There are those that \nwill say if we park every car in this country today, we would not have \nthis incredible dependency on foreign sources of oil, we would not have \nthis dependency.\n  However, I suggest we are a nation that is dependent on petroleum for \nmany things. Transportation is incredibly important, but we have \ntoothpaste, footballs, ink, life jackets, antiseptic, dentures, glue, \nclothing, food preservatives. So much of what we consume as a nation \ncomes from petroleum products. We should not say, if we conserve a \nlittle bit more, we do not need to open ANWR. We need to face, as a \nnation, that we have a reliance on petroleum.\n  When we talk about the amount of oil available up north, again, we \nhear numbers floating all around. Some people say it is 6 months' \nsupply; it is an insignificant supply. The fact of the matter is, and \nthis is according to USGS estimates, ANWR's Coastal Plain has a 50-50 \nchance of containing the second largest oilfield in North America. As \nwas stated before, what we anticipate to get out of ANWR would be the \nequivalent of the Texas oilfields. To those suggesting Texas is \ninsignificant in terms of its contribution, we would say that is crazy.\n  Another example regarding what we anticipate to get from the reserves \nup North: the equivalent of what we have been receiving from Saudi \nArabia for the past 25 years. Again, these are not insignificant \namounts of oil.\n  What we anticipate we would receive from ANWR on a daily basis would \nhave offset the oil we lost when the Gulf of Mexico was hit by the \nhurricane damage and we had all of the oil shut in.\n  If we are to discount the potential of ANWR, it is as shortsighted a \nviewpoint or perspective as we could ever have when it comes to our \nenergy sources. This is akin to saying we should not open up Prudhoe \nBay because, based on the reserves we know or expect to see there, we \nthink it will only provide this country 3 years' worth of oil. That is \nwhat the estimates were. Prudhoe Bay has provided this Nation with up \nto a quarter of its domestic oil supply for the past 28 years.\n  We want to be given a chance on the Coastal Plain to demonstrate we \ncan do something actively to reduce this country's reliance on foreign \nsources of oil.\n  Again, back to the national priorities. Care for the environment: We \ntake that very personally in Alaska. I take it very personally. I was \nborn and raised there. I am raising my kids there. I want my grandkids \nto be raised there. I want them to have the quality of life we as \nAlaskans enjoy. We take the obligation to not only create jobs and \nrevenues for Alaskans, but we take the obligation to care for our land \nas one of our highest priorities. This is why it is significant. When \nAlaskans speak on this, 70 percent of Alaskans support developing ANWR. \nThe residents who live on the Coastal Plain, the people of Kaktovik \nsupport opening ANWR because they can see the benefits to them, but \nthey can also see they can have the benefits of jobs and revenues that \ncan help them with their schools and their health clinics, that they \ncan do that in balance with the environment, so their hunting, their \nsubsistence, their whaling, is not sacrificed.\n  We like to talk up North about the gains in technology that have been \nmade over the past 30 years. They are stunning. We are proud to speak \nof them. Earlier, Senator Domenici spoke to the trip we took up North \nwith several Members and the Secretary of Interior and Secretary of \nEnergy. We went to an exploration pad built up on an ice pad. They make \nan ice pad, and the ice pad is connected by an ice road. This road is \nalmost a Zamboni-type machine. They roll it out over the very frozen \ntundra and they create this road of ice. The ice buildup is probably a \nfoot or so thick, maybe higher in certain areas as you approach stream \ncrossings. The exploration pad is a pretty compact unit and very \nimpressive in terms of the size and scope of the equipment used. They \nhave Rollagons with tires that are 15 feet high. They are huge, immense \npieces of equipment. They go in, haul in the exploration equipment over \nthe ice roads in the middle of the winter. Keep in mind, the State, in \nconsultation with other agencies at the Federal and local level, make a \ndetermination for exploration. You cannot come in and explore at any \ntime. You have to do it during the season that is allowed. They make \nmeasurements as to the thickness of the freeze before they will allow \nany activity to begin construction of the ice roads or any activity on \nthe tundra.\n  This is an example. This is not the exploration unit we went to, this \nis in the National Petroleum Reserve. It is very similar in size. We \nhave the exploration rig standing taller in this photograph with a few \noutbuildings that allow those working out there to stay warm, get a \nlittle bit to eat. You can see the ice road going out there on the \ntundra. That is what it looks like in the winter. This rig probably is \nout there for 2 to 3 weeks. Then they pack up and move it to the next \nexploration area the company might be looking to. This is what it looks \nlike in the summer.\n  This photograph is the exact same area we saw, Rendezvous 2 well, \nNational Petroleum Reserve. This is exactly what it looks like during \nthe summer. The ice pad has melted. All of the equipment was removed \nduring the winter when the ice roads were there. What is left is this \nstub of that exploration well. It is tough to tell from this picture \nbecause it actually looks pretty tall, but that stub is only about as \ntall as I am. It might be about 6 feet, a little taller. That is what \nis left.\n  This is what we do up North. We do it for a couple of reasons. First, \nbecause we know it is the right thing to do. We need to make sure we \nare caring for the environment. Second, we have the toughest, the \nstrictest environmental standards for oil exploration and drilling \nanywhere in the country, and I would say probably anywhere in the \nworld. We are proud of it. We are proud of the results that come out of \nthis. We can do the exploration. We do it in a safe and sound manner. \nWe try to leave as little footprint as possible. We are doing that \nbecause it is the right thing to do, but we are doing it because we are \nworking with the Native people who live up there, who have lived up \nthere for generations, who want to be able to continue to hunt and fish \nand whale.\n  The caribou are free to room. The central caribou herd near Prudhoe \nBay in the 30 years since we have had oil development has grown 10 \ntimes. Some say we scare away the caribou and the Native communities \nwill not have the subsistence source. The fact of the matter is, the \nreality proves otherwise. We are doing what we should be doing when it \ncomes to care for the environment.\n  Polar bears have not been mentioned today, but they might later in \ndebate so I will address them. There are some who are concerned that \nman's activity there will be driving the polar bear from the Coastal \nPlain. The fact of the matter is we have very healthy polar bear stocks \nup North in the Coastal Plain area where we are talking about the \npotential for ANWR development.\n\n[[Page S12157]]\n\nWe have about 29 identified dens. We use infrared detection to \ndetermine where the polar bear are actually denning so we do not go \nnear them. We are taking the steps needed and necessary to care for the \nanimals and the environment.\n  Other things we are doing to recognize we need to work with the \nenvironment, with the animals, with those who would live there, include \ndrilling restrictions during the summer months to prevent noise \nactivity. There are prohibitions on any kind of seismic activity when \nthe whales are migrating through. We are using directional drilling so \nwe go into the ground and under the surface, and we are able to drill \nout 3 or 4 miles in every direction so there is no disturbance to the \nsurface.\n  We are talking about a 2,000-acre limitation. I will go back to the \nmap of the Coastal Plain to again put it in perspective. We are talking \nabout 2,000 acres. That is about the size of an average size ranch in \nSouth Dakota, according to what the Senator from South Dakota tells \nme--2,000 acres in an area. The Coastal Plain on this map is the green \narea. The Coastal Plain is 1.5 million acres. We are asking to drill \nand explore in an area the size of 2,000 acres out of 1.5 million. The \nother colored areas on the map indicate the wilderness area and the \nRefuge itself.\n  The orange shown on the map is the Refuge. The wilderness area is the \nyellow part of it. The whole Arctic National Wildlife Refuge itself is \nan area the size of South Carolina. It is 19.6 million acres. Of that \n19.6 million acres, we have 8 million that are dedicated wilderness. We \ncannot, will not, have no intention of going in and doing anything. \nThat is entirely protected.\n  The balance in the orange is all Refuge. We are not talking about any \nexploration activity or development in that area. The only area we are \nlooking at exploring is the green area, the 1.5 million acres. And \nwithin that we are talking about 2,000 acres.\n  For those of you who live and work in the Washington, DC, area, that \nis about the size of Dulles Airport. Actually Dulles Airport is a \nlittle bit bigger than that. So that kind of helps put in context what \nwe are talking about.\n  Now, the Senator from Washington mentioned this legislation would \nalso open up and allow the natives of Kaktovik to open up and be able \nto explore on their lands that are contained in the Refuge. The 2,000-\nacre limitation applies to the natives of Kaktovik, the Arctic Slope. \nIt applies to all lands within the Coastal Plain--all lands within the \nCoastal Plain.\n  If there is oil that is discovered and explored and produced on \nnative land, that part is part of the 2,000-acre limitation. So we are \nnot expanding this from 2,000, plus whatever might be found on the \nnative land itself.\n  Let me speak a minute to some of the other issues that were raised by \nsome of my colleagues. The point was made there is nothing in this \nlegislation that would prohibit Alaska oil from being exported. In \nfact, that is the case. But I should remind my colleagues that very \nlittle--very little--Alaskan North Slope crude has ever been exported. \nWe do not anticipate that it would be exported, given the demand on the \nwest coast, given the demand in this country. None is regularly \nexported now, and it has not been exported regularly in the past 6 \nyears.\n  Now, it is true that back in 1995 we had a glut of oil on the \nAmerican west coast, and Congress did, in fact, vote to permit the \nexport of Alaskan oil. So from 1996 to 1999 there was about 5.5 percent \nof Alaska production that was being exported over to the Asian \ncountries to relieve that glut.\n  We are now in a different time, a different place. There is no excess \noil on the west coast. At this point, even though we are allowed to do \nso, there is no oil that is being exported. So where is it going? Fifty \npercent of all of Alaska's gas, coming from Prudhoe Bay, goes to the \nCalifornia refineries. This is near San Francisco and LA. We have 42 \npercent going to Puget Sound up in Washington State, and 8 percent goes \nto the State of Hawaii. There is a very fractional amount that stays in \nAlaska for in-State refinery needs.\n  But what you also need to keep in mind is that it is cheaper for us \nto ship the oil to the lower 48 than to the Far East. It is a matter of \npure logistics. It is 2,056 miles to LA versus 3,401 miles to Yokohama, \nJapan. So the economics of it suggests that it does not make sense to \nship any oil from Alaska overseas at this point.\n  Now, another issue that was raised was the issue of oil spills. This \nis something that when you hear the debate, these issues raised, you \nkind of have to take a deep breath and say the statistics on a piece of \npaper do not tell the whole story, unless you have the facts, the \nfootnote, and the background that goes with it.\n  It has been suggested there have been all of these spills up North, \nand these spoil the Arctic tundra. But what they do not mention is, the \ncompanies that are operating up there have to report every spill--every \nspill--of any nonnaturally occurring substance. So if there is a spill \nof saltwater, it has to be reported--anything more than a gallon of oil \nor chemicals, such as lubricating oils, hydraulic fuels.\n  So when you go up North, you will see in the wintertime--and will in \nthe summertime because the vehicles during the cold winter months are \nkept running for a good portion of the time--each and every one of the \nvehicles has what they call a ``diaper'' underneath the transmission to \ncollect any leaking transmission fluid. Because if that were to get on \nthe road, if that would get on the surface, that could be a reportable \nincident.\n  The vast majority of the spills at Prudhoe Bay have been of \nsaltwater, saltwater used in water flooding to enhance oil recovery. \nThey have not been oil spills.\n  Now, the other thing you do not hear is that the average oil spill \nwas 89 gallons. This is the equivalent of about two barrels of oil, and \nthat of that, those two barrels of oil, 94 percent of that oil was \nabsolutely, totally cleaned up. According to DEC, which is the State \nDepartment of Environmental Conservation, 93 percent of all oil spills \nwere of less than 100 gallons in volume, two-thirds were of less than \n10 gallons, and less than a quarter barrel of oil.\n  So over the past decade, for the past 10 years, up North, there have \nonly been 11 crude oil spills of more than 1,000 gallons, and 97 \npercent of that oil was fully recovered.\n  We can talk about the spills and reportable spills, but if you look \nat a number, it is important to know: A, what was it that was spilled; \nB, how much; and, C, how the cleanup was handled.\n  Prudhoe Bay is actually one of America's cleanest areas. ANWR \ndevelopment, given the technology we have, we know is going to be even \nbetter.\n  Now, I have to address the issue of too little oil to even bother \nexploring. I mentioned it very briefly at the beginning.\n  The USGS has recently updated its estimates. In fact, it was just \nwithin the past week or 10 days or so that USGS released its updated \nestimates for the amount of economically recoverable oil that will be \nfound in ANWR. What they are now saying is that at the prices we are \nlooking at--they peg it as $55 a barrel--93 percent of all the \ntechnically recoverable oil will be economically worth producing. That \nis up from a previous estimate of 83 percent. It means we have a 50-50 \nchance the Coastal Plain is going to contain 9.7 billion barrels of \noil. Again, this would be the second largest oil field in North \nAmerica.\n  When we talk about the amount that is available to us, I think it is \nimportant to put that in perspective. We are talking about the second \nlargest field in North America. Currently, Prudhoe has been operating \nand supplying 20 percent of this country's domestic energy needs. It \nhas for 30 years. We want to be able to supplement that with ANWR.\n  There is one other point I do feel is important to address. Several \nof my colleagues on the other side have suggested that because ANWR is \ncontained in this budget reconciliation package, it is not the \nappropriate place, and that for a major policy decision such as this, \nit has not been given the time and the consideration and cannot be in \nthis process.\n  As the senior Senator from Alaska, the occupant of the Chair, knows, \nthis is something that has been debated and discussed for decades. ANWR \nhas been the subject of dozens of bills, literally many dozens of \ncongressional hearings. Legislation to open ANWR passed the Congress in \nthe 1996 Budget Reconciliation Act. It was vetoed by President Clinton. \nBut we have had several bills that have been introduced since then.\n\n[[Page S12158]]\n\n  In the 106th Congress, we had legislation. Six bills were introduced \nin the 107th Congress. Legislation to open ANWR was approved by the \nHouse in the 108th Congress. In the 109th, also, the House introduced \nlegislation. There have been countless tours of the Coastal Plain, \nwhere many Members of this body have had the opportunity to go up and \nsee it for themselves. ANWR has probably been one of the most \nthoroughly researched, debated, and discussed issues pending before the \nCongress for the past 18 years.\n  I do not think any of us can stand here with a straight face and say \nthat Congress is acting too quickly on this issue. It is something that \nhas been aired very publicly, and over a great deal of time, with a \ngreat deal of public input.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks by speaking very briefly about \nthose people who live in the Coastal Plain, the residents of Kaktovik. \nThese are a very hardy people who have lived there for generations and \ngenerations, and who want to remain. But they are in a community where \nenergy costs are extremely high. It is very difficult to find any kind \nof economic activity in the area. They are primarily a subsistence-\nbased village. But they want to make sure, like all the rest of us, \ntheir kids get a decent education. They want to make sure they have \nsome access to health care within their community. They want to have \ncertain protections, if you will--whether it be a fire truck to help \nthem when they have a house fire, as they had a couple years ago and \nhad no way to provide for the protection of the property in that home.\n  They view the opening of ANWR as an opportunity for them to be \nparticipants. But they are also looking at this from the very critical \nperspective of being the only Alaskans who live in this area who would \nbe affected by the development. They want a seat at the table. They \nwant to be consulted. They want to be heard. They want to make sure \nthat, in fact, the development that does take place is done in concert \nwith their needs as the residents of this area for generations and \ntheir needs as people who live off the land.\n  We are working with the people of Kaktovik. I have introduced stand-\nalone legislation, along with my colleague from Alaska, and along with \nmy colleagues from Hawaii, that would provide not only for \nenvironmental protections to be written into how we develop ANWR, but \nbasically we codify all of those items we have discussed over the \nyears, whether they are the environmental concerns, whether it is the \n2,000-acre limitation on development, but also a provision to provide \nfor economic impact aid to the residents of Kaktovik and any other \nAlaskans who may be impacted, to provide for a method of consultation \nwith the natives of Kaktovik and the region.\n  What we are trying to do through the stand-alone legislation is \nprovide for, I think it is fair to say, safeguards. For all those who \nmay be concerned that, well, this budget reconciliation says ``open up \nANWR, the only limitation is a 2,000-acre limitation,'' be aware that \nwhat we are providing for in the freestanding legislation, I think, is \na very comprehensive set of guidelines for how we move forward \npositively, as we look to achieve that balance between development and \ncare and concern for our environment up North.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Cantwell \namendment and in opposition to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. In 1960, under the leadership of President Eisenhower, we \ncreated this nearly 20-million-acre Refuge. President Eisenhower and \nCongress said to the American people: We are going to hold this piece \nof America in trust. It will be held for future generations because it \nis a special place. It is one of the few places in America where we are \ngoing to restrict development. We are going to protect it because we \nwant generations to come to know that the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge is a special place, a place deserving of our honor, our respect, \nand our protection.\n  With the provision in this bill before us today, we will turn our \nback on that promise made by President Eisenhower and by our Nation 45 \nyears ago. We will authorize, in this reconciliation bill, drilling in \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It is a sad day. It troubles me \nthat some have come to the Chamber and argued that this really is not \nthat big a deal. They are going to gingerly step into this Refuge, \ndrill, and gingerly step out, and you will never know they were there. \nYou might buy that argument if you hadn't been there.\n  Several years ago, during the course of debating the same issue, \nwhich has been debated here a long time, one of the Senators from \nAlaska said to me: What do you know about it? You have never been \nthere. You have never seen it. How would you know what the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge looks like?\n  It was a worthy challenge. I accepted it. I took off and spent 2\\1/2\\ \ndays camping out in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge so I could see \nit. We left Arctic Village, a remote village in Alaska, flew in a \nCanadian Beaver aircraft that was almost 50 years old over the Brooks \nRange, down the North Slope, along the Canning River.\n  As we looked to the west, we could see the State lands that had been \ndrilled for oil and gas, and then, to the east, the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge that had not been drilled. It was easy to tell the two \napart because the scars that were left on that State land that had been \ndrilled were still there years and years later. They didn't gingerly \nstep in and drill and leave; they cut scars across that land that will \nbe there forever. On the east side of the river, the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge was pristine. One might see the tracks of a little \nwildlife, and that was it. So to say that these oil and gas companies \nare going to go in there and discretely and innocently take out the oil \nand gas defies human experience.\n  How much is this worth to us? Why is it that we would turn our back \non a 45-year-old promise by America to future generations? Why would we \nsay now, for the first time, we are going to drill for oil and gas in \nthis wildlife refuge that we promised would never be explored in this \nway?\n  Some argue we just need the gas. Come on, don't you know what is \ngoing on at gasoline stations in Illinois and across the country? \nGasoline prices are going through the roof. We need more oil. If we \ndon't have more oil, it is going to mean calling for greater sacrifice. \nFamilies and businesses will continue to be dependent on foreign oil.\n  There are two things to consider. The Arctic Coastal Plain will yield \nless than 1 year's worth of oil for America, and it won't be available \nfor 10 years. This debate is about 1 year's worth of oil, not available \nfor 10 years, and it may take 20 years to extract it. So what impact \nwill that have, Mr. And Mrs. American Consumer? About 1 penny a gallon. \nThat is why we are going into ANWR.\n  There is a bigger issue. We have heard it said over and over on the \nother side. This is about America's energy security. You can argue it \nis a small amount of oil, but even accepting the fact that even a small \namount of oil will lessen our dependence on foreign oil somewhat, there \nis another interesting issue. Do you know there was an amendment before \nthe committee when the ANWR issue came up, and that amendment said: \nWhatever oil we take out of ANWR, we are going to use in America? That \noil will come down to be used in America, so it will benefit American \nconsumers and motorists. But that amendment by Senator Wyden from \nOregon was defeated. In fact, the Senator from Alaska voted against the \namendment which said the ANWR oil has to be used in America.\n  What are we really debating here? We are debating drilling in ANWR so \nthat oil can be exported from a wildlife refuge to China and Japan and \nother parts of the world. This isn't about the energy security of \nAmerica; it is about the energy security of China and Japan. We are \ngoing to defile this wildlife refuge to drill for oil that can be \nexported, that won't even benefit the United States. Why would we do \nthat? There is only one reason--because the oil companies will make a \nhuge profit off of it. Those struggling oil companies need our help \ntoday with this\n\n[[Page S12159]]\n\namendment. They have had a tough 6 months.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No, I won't.\n  They have had a tough 6 months. They have had recordbreaking profits \nof $40 billion over the last 6 months, and now they want the option to \ngo drilling for oil in a wildlife refuge we promised to protect 45 \nyears ago so they can drill and export oil to other countries for their \neconomy. Is that what this debate is all about? Sadly, I am afraid it \nis.\n  The argument that this is just going to affect 2,000 acres--I am \nsorry--having flown over this area, having seen what happens, I know \nand the Department of Interior knows it isn't just about the pad where \nyou drill. It is about roads and airstrips and pipelines and water and \ngravel sources and base camps and construction camps, storage pads, \npower lines, powerplants, support facilities, coastal marine \nfacilities--it is a huge undertaking. You may see that postage stamp of \ndrilling, but there is a lot more in support of it that is going to \nhave an impact on this environment.\n  This is an abdication of leadership. To say that we have no other \nplace to turn in America other than to drill in a wildlife refuge is an \nabdication of leadership and a concession to greed by the oil \ncompanies. How have we reached this moment where the leadership in \nAmerica cannot turn to the American people and say: We can't go this \nfar. We can't cross this line and drill in a wildlife refuge that we \npromised for 45 years to protect. We have to find other ways to reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil to make the cost of gasoline more \naffordable.\n  And there are other ways. If we improve the miles per gallon on the \ncars and trucks we are driving today by 2 miles a gallon, it would make \nup for all of the oil we are talking about drilling out of the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. This Senate, given a chance to vote for more \nfuel efficiency, refused so we can continue the habit of buying fuel-\ninefficient cars and trucks, driving gas guzzlers, saying we are going \nto drill our way out of our problems, that we will continue to be \ndependent on foreign oil. There has been no leadership from this \nadministration to talk about efficiency and conservation and making our \ncars and trucks more fuel efficient which would make this debate \nabsolutely unnecessary. America can do better when it comes to energy.\n  This White House argues that all we can do to get out of a problem is \nto drill our way out. Except the obvious, America has only 3 percent of \nthe known oil reserves in the world, and we consume 25 percent. We \ncannot drill our way out of this problem. Today, we will sacrifice a \nwildlife refuge. Tomorrow, the oil companies want to drill off our \ncoastlines. What comes next, the Great Lakes? Where will this end? It \nwill end with leadership and vision for an energy policy for America \nthat reduces our dependence on foreign oil with responsible \nenvironmental production, with conservation techniques, with energy \nefficiency, with renewable and sustainable fuels instead of drilling \naway in wildlife refuges we promised our children we would protect.\n  America can do better with leadership and with vision.\n  I urge my colleagues, support the Cantwell amendment. Understand that \nthis is not the answer. Drilling for oil in Alaska to export it to \nChina is no answer to America's energy security challenge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time in opposition is 3 minutes. The \nSenator from Washington has 26 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, you have 26. We have 3. I would yield the \nfloor, hoping that you all would speak, if you have more opposition. \nYou have plenty of time. We don't have but 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nCollins, Mikulski, and Jeffords be added as cosponsors of amendment No. \n2358.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher leadership on this issue and for yielding me some time.\n  I have long opposed the leasing and development in the Arctic Refuge \nfor several reasons related both to energy policy and to environmental \nconcerns. I have said many times that the most compelling reason for \nnot opening the Arctic Refuge is that it would do very little to \nfurther our national energy security and will do nothing to address \nshort-term energy prices or needs. There will not be any production \nfrom the Arctic Refuge for an estimated 10 years. The Energy \nInformation Agency estimates that production from the Arctic Refuge \nwould, at its peak, reduce our reliance on imports by only 4 percent, \nfrom 68 percent reliant to 64 percent. This would not happen until the \nyear 2025.\n  I have a chart that puts things in some perspective. It talks about \ntotal oil demand. This line is 2005, today, total oil demand. As we can \nsee, it is rising, has been rising, is expected to continue to rise. \nThe next line is transportation demand. You can see the biggest part of \nour total demand is transportation demand. Then domestic production has \nbeen declining in this country since the early 1970s. It is on the \ndecline now. It is expected to continue declining. If this provision \nbecomes law and we go ahead with leasing and development of ANWR, there \nwill be a slight uptick as we get into 2015 and that period. There will \nbe a slight uptick in domestic oil production. That is the red line. \nWhat we see is that there will be a slight increase due to the opening \nof ANWR but a very slight increase.\n  I am disappointed that this issue is being taken up as part of a \nbudget reconciliation bill. The policy issue is of great significance \nand complexity and cannot be adequately handled on a budget \nreconciliation bill. I also have concerns and questions about the \nlegislation that is included in the reconciliation bill. This bill \nwould open the refuge to oil drilling. It would do so with less \nprotection than for any other wildlife refuge or other Federal land \nthat is currently subject to oil and gas leasing. The only mention of \nthe environment is a vague directive that the leasing program be \n``environmentally sound.'' That is contradicted by other parts of the \nmark that contain broad waivers of environmental laws.\n\n  For example, the bill deems a 1987 environmental impact statement to \nbe adequate under the National Environmental Policy Act, an 18-year-old \nenvironmental impact statement. It is deemed adequate for purposes of \nissuing regulations to implement the leasing program and other \npreleasing activities. This is despite the fact that there has been \nsignificant new information that has become available over the last 18 \nyears related to the Refuge, related to its resources. The bill \ncontains no requirement for public participation. It does have \nambiguous new provisions that appear to limit judicial review. Even if \none decided to go ahead with leasing this area, in my opinion the bill \nprovides an inadequate framework and program within which to do that. \nThere is no minimum royalty rate to be paid by oil companies provided \nfor in this bill. There are no enforcement provisions. There are no \nrequired inspections. There is no limit on the size or the duration of \nthe leases, no requirement that operational plans or surface-disturbing \nactivities be approved, no requirement that oil companies post bond to \nensure compliance with lease requirements, and there is no requirement \nthat the land be reclaimed.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield to the Senator 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. And there is no requirement that the land be reclaimed \nor facilities removed.\n  Mr. President, these are fundamental components of a leasing statute. \nMembers of this body are speaking out today about how we ought to \nimpose windfall profits taxes on the oil and gas\n\n[[Page S12160]]\n\nindustry. At the same time we are doing that we are proposing a series \nof provisions that put virtually no requirements on them. Perhaps the \nproponents for opening the refuge have omitted some of these elements \nbecause they recognize that including them would cause this to run \nafoul of the Budget Act. That is a very good reason why this kind of \nimportant issue is not intended to be dealt with as part of a budget \nreconciliation bill.\n  Mr. President, for these reasons I support the amendment of the \nSenator from Washington. I commend her for her leadership on this \nissue. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of the \namendment. Opening the Arctic Refuge is not a necessary component of \nour national energy policy. We can do better in crafting a solution to \nthe current problems, and we need to do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have only 3 minutes remaining, but I \nwant to yield that 3 minutes to Senator Sununu, and then I will yield \nthe floor for the other side to continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I think our energy policy and our approach \nto its provision ought to be driven by a need for balance, for \nevenhandedness, for a thoughtful approach, and that means not stepping \nforward and offering a lot of rhetoric, being careful about statements \nthat might be misleading. And to that extent, earlier we heard a \ndescription about the Brooks Range and flying over the Brooks Range, \nand I think it is important for Members to understand the Brooks Range \nis not in the 1001 area, the 1.5 million acres that would be made \navailable to leasing. It is not in there, not contained, not part of \nit.\n  So we can talk about the beauty of the Brooks Range, but it has \nnothing to do with this provision. We make tradeoffs all the time. You \nbuild a road, you make tradeoffs. You have to take land to build that \nroad. You grow crops, you have to clear land and affect the environment \nfor growing crops and food, growing cotton for clothing. You drive your \ncar, you are using gasoline. You turn on your computer, you are using \nelectricity. You have to build the lines to shift electricity around \nthe country, build transmission. All of these choices in our modern \nsociety involve tradeoffs, and we should be balanced and thoughtful \nabout how we weigh these costs and benefits.\n  When you look at this provision, first you can't help but look at the \nsize--19 million acres in the Wildlife Refuge that we are talking \nabout, three times the size of the State of New Hampshire, and this \nprovision allows 2,000 acres to be used for production and exploration. \nThat is an area equivalent to the size of the Manchester Airport, the \nairport that serves much of my State of New Hampshire. It is three \ntimes the size of New Hampshire, and we are talking about 2,000 acres \nto take advantage of what is by all estimates the second or third \nlargest find of oil in our Nation's history--a million barrels per day \nas was pointed out, equal to all the production that was lost due to \nHurricane Katrina.\n  Some of the critics have said, Well, yes, but if we only used energy \nfrom this source it would only supply all of the needs of America for 1 \nyear. If you buy into that argument, then you would never support \ndrilling another gas well anywhere in the country because it would not \nsupply all of our energy needs for 10 or 20 or 30 years, or another oil \nwell in east Texas or anywhere else in the country. If you buy into \nthat argument, you basically are saying we want permanent energy \ndependence on imports, and that is the real goal of many of the \ninterest groups behind this.\n  We need to strike a reasonable balance. Setting aside 2,000 acres in \nthis part of the northernmost part of Alaska for the second or third \nlargest oil find in our country's history is a reasonable, thoughtful, \nbalanced approach. It is critical that we support this provision.\n  I did not support the Energy bill because I did not think it was \nfiscally responsible. But I think this is a rational and balanced \napproach, and one that I hope my colleagues will support. I yield back \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington controls all the time that remains.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Republican \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator seek?\n  Mr. TALENT. I can do it in about 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I make a unanimous consent request that we \ngive the Senator 5 minutes that will come off the Republican side when \nwe agree to extend the time for this debate momentarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We understand it, and there is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. I thank the Senator for his ingenuous unanimous consent \nrequest allowing me to go forward, and I will just take a few minutes \nto talk about ANWR in general.\n  I am going to offer an amendment relating to this portion of the bill \nlater, but right now I just want to tick this down for a minute as to \nwhat I see as the essentials of this issue.\n  With the greatest respect to those who oppose this operation, the \nexploration of oil, I don't understand what coherent philosophy--\nregardless of whether you are a liberal or a conservative, I don't \nunderstand what coherent philosophy would advocate cutting your own \nnation off from oil within its borders.\n  Now, I know I have heard the argument that we need an energy future \nthat is not anywhere near as dependent on traditional sources of \nenergy, and I agree with that. I am the last person in the world to \nargue with that. I led the fight on this side of the aisle for the \nrenewable fuels standard, which mandates that by the year 2001, 27.5 \nbillion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel be in the Nation's fuel supply \nto replace oil and gasoline.\n  I am a huge believer that within a few years we are going to be \nfilling up with fuel that we get from corn and from soybeans and other \nsources. I think that is the future of our country, but we are still \ngoing to need some oil, and certainly in the short term we are going to \nneed oil and, to me, it makes sense to be able to produce it ourselves.\n  Concerns have been raised about the environment, and if we were not \nrequiring that it be done in the environmentally most sensitive way, I \nwould not support it. But the same people who raise those concerns \nplace tremendous confidence in the ability of American technology to \ncreate alternative sources of energy, the technology of which is \nembryonic--hydrogen or wind. Now, I support those, as well, but if you \nbelieve that technology can get us to the point where we can do those \nthings and create a lot of energy in that fashion, and that is a long \nway down the read, you have to believe the technology is adequate to be \nable to explore for this oil in a way that will be sensitive to the \nenvironment. We are already using that technology here and around the \nworld. If we don't get the oil in the Arctic using the most \nenvironmentally sensitive means, we are going to have to import it from \ncountries where I have no confidence in what they are doing to the \nenvironment.\n  Concerns have been raised about the oil companies. Whatever you think \nwe should do with the oil companies, whatever restrictions we should \nput on them or other kinds of measures to make sure they don't gouge \nfor the price of oil, we still need the oil. Socialist countries \nexplore for oil within their own boundaries.\n  So I am down to the point of saying, Mr. President, I do not see why \nwe should not do this, and I do know it is going to create jobs. I did \nwant to rise and make that point because this makes a lot of difference \nto people in Missouri. The Senator from Alaska talked very compellingly \nabout the difference it makes on the ground for people in Alaska. It \nmakes a difference in\n\n[[Page S12161]]\n\nMissouri, too. An estimated 14,000 new jobs, good jobs will be created \nin Missouri alone if we explore for oil in the Arctic because of the \ncollateral-related jobs around the country. That is one of the reasons \nthe Missouri Laborers Council, the Carpenters' District Counsel of St. \nLouis, that represent, respectively, 13,000 and 22,000 members, \nstrongly support this measure.\n\n  Mr. President, we should do it carefully. We should do it with a view \ntoward the concerns that have been raised, but the concerns are not a \nreason not to do it. I know people have said, well, it is not going to \nproduce much oil. A conservative estimate is 10 billion gallons. I \nthink it will be a lot more than that.\n  Prudhoe Bay was estimated to hold only 9 billion barrels of oil. The \nproduction today is at 13 billion, and it is still producing. I think \nthere is a lot of oil in the ANWR to get, but even if there is not so \nmuch there, it is no reason not to get it. We can do it the right way. \nWe should have done it a long time ago, and we certainly should do it \nnow.\n  I yield back any time I have not used.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington should be advised that time is running \nagainst her time.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, through the Chair I would like to say to \nthe Senator from Washington that at this point, because the only time \nremaining is her time, and we are not yet prepared to enter into the \nunanimous consent request to extend the time, although I hope that will \nhappen momentarily, it would be in her best interest to use the time.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, through the Chair, if I could inquire \nwhat the Senator from North Dakota is trying to propound in the \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The unanimous consent request the manager of the bill and \nI will offer will extend the time until noon.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator.\n  I would like to go over what I think are the important reasons we \nshould not drill in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge and why my colleagues \nshould support the Cantwell amendment to strike this language from the \nBudget Reconciliation Act.\n  As my colleagues have said earlier, we should not be doing this in \nthe Budget Reconciliation Act, and it really does set a precedent for \nwhat I hope is not further attempts to drill in other parts of the \nUnited States, whether it is off the coast of Washington, the coast of \nFlorida, or anywhere else by simply thinking you can come to the budget \nprocess and open up drilling in various parts of the United States. It \nis a very dangerous precedent. It also lays aside very important \nenvironmental regulations that should be met by any drilling efforts in \nthe United States. So here we are, about to allow drilling in the \nArctic Wildlife Refuge, and it is going to have the less protection \nthan any other public land.\n\n  Let me go through the 10 reasons I think we should not be doing this.\n  First, the Arctic Wildlife Refuge does not solve our current gasoline \nor heating oil supply problems, and I guarantee you, my colleagues are \ngoing to hear a lot about home heating oil and other problems when they \ngo home after we break for this year and people see their high heating \nbills and the enormous cost increases they are paying. So this is no \nsolution for our immediate problem. In fact, even if oil were flowing \ntoday from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, who is to say that OPEC \nwould not lower its supply and keep prices high? Moreover, the fact we \nare talking about something that is not going to happen for 7 to 12 \nyears from now is clearly not going to help us in the near term.\n  Second, the oil supplies in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge are not going \nto help us be any less dependent on foreign oil. We already know that \nour biggest problem is that this country is 50 percent dependent on \nforeign oil, and moving forward in the next 15 years that dependency \nwill grow to over 60 percent. To me, that says the way to get off \nfossil fuel and foreign consumption is to diversify, something this \nbill is certainly not doing.\n  The third issue is that we really do need to get off fossil fuel. So \nhow are we going to do that? That answer is that we need to diversify \ninto alternative fuels, such as Brazil and other countries have done, \nto look at a biofuels strategy and become more self-sufficient. The \nUnited States only sits on 3 percent of the world's oil reserves. To \nplan a strategy that continues to focus on this is just shortsighted.\n  Fourth, drilling in the Arctic will not translate into savings at the \ngas pump. Let me repeat that. It will not in the near term translate \ninto savings at the gas pump. The Energy Department, its own energy \ninformation administration, said that even when the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge oil supply is at peak production, it will only reduce gas prices \nby a penny a gallon. So we are going to open this pristine wilderness \narea for a penny a gallon 20 years from now.\n  Moreover, I believe it is important for my colleagues to get about \nthe real debate and pass legislation that focuses on the price-gouging \nactivities that could be occurring in America. Instead of passing this \non a budget bill, why don't we bring up by unanimous consent or on some \nother piece of legislation a price-gouging bill that gives the Federal \nGovernment the same power that 23 States have in prosecuting oil \ncompanies or others who are involved in manipulating the price of \ngasoline at the pump? That is what we should take extraordinary \nmeasures in the Senate to do, not this.\n  Fifth, there is no guarantee that the oil from the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge will be used in the United States. My colleague, Senator Wyden, \nI am sure is going to talk more about this issue, but there is nothing \nunder the current laws and regulations that is going to say that this \noil is going to stay in the United States. So as my colleague from \nIllinois said, here is this product we are going to get from a wildlife \nrefuge, and there is no guarantee that it is going to help our national \nsecurity at all, that it won't be exported to the highest bidder.\n  Sixth, oil leasing in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge will not bring \nsignificant revenues to the Federal Treasury as a certainty. Right now, \nthere is a big debate. There is a debate between the State of Alaska \nand the Senate about how royalties from the Arctic Wildlife Refuge \nshould be divided. The State of Alaska has been very clear. They think \nthey get 90 percent of those royalties. This bill tries to say they are \ngoing to get 50 percent. We know the State of Alaska is going to pursue \nthat in court. The difference is a lot of money. If Alaska is \nsuccessful, that means they will get 90 percent of the revenue assumed \nby this budget bill. This proposal says that the United States might \nget $2.4 billion. The State of Alaska is saying: No, no, no, you are \nonly going to get $480 million. The difference between $480 million and \n$2.4 billion is a lot of money, and I would like to see clarity that if \nthis have to happen we are not going to move forward without the \nguarantee that, in fact, we are going to see 50 percent of that \nrevenue.\n  Seventh, the oil leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as \none of my colleagues said, is about giving the oil companies something \nmore of profits. The notion that they have had $30 billion in profits \nin the last quarter--$30 billion in profits in the last quarter--and \nyet they are not helping to diversify at a time when it is very clear \nto the American people that being overdependent on foreign oil and \nfossil fuel in general is not the right direction for our country.\n  Eighth, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge will harm its \necosystem. Wildlife is going to be harmed. The fact that people think \nthese things can work together is amazing. We should consider the \nreason the Wildlife Refuge was established in the first place, because \nit is a unique area. There is a lot of drilling that goes on in Alaska \nand a lot of area that is consumed by this. The original designation of \nthe Arctic Wildlife Refuge was for the purpose of preserving this area.\n\n[[Page S12162]]\n\n  Ninth, drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge cannot be assumed to be \nenvironmentally benign. I know my colleagues would like to think that. \nBut the fact is, in Prudhoe Bay and the oilfields of the Trans-Alaska \nPipeline, there have been 4,532 spills from 1996 to 2004. In fact, the \ncurrent rate of reportable spills on the Alaska northern slope is about \n1 every 18 hours.\n  My colleagues would like to say this can be done in an \nenvironmentally sensitive way or that the environment is not going to \nbe impacted. I don't believe that is true. I believe the number of oil \nspills that have been reported show that is not the case.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a copy \nof the recent North Alaska oil company fines and penalties, the amount \nof money in penalties that have been paid by various companies over the \nlast couple of years for either clean air violations or pipeline leak \ndetections or other reasons for which various oil companies have been \nfined.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      North Slope, Alaska: Recent Oil Company Fines and Penalties\n\n\n                             Environmental\n\n       $80,000 civil penalty. ConocoPhillips. March 2004. Alpine \n     Oil Field--Clean Air Act Violations. ADEC imposed civil \n     penalty for high carbon monoxide emissions from turbines used \n     to re-inject natural gas at the Central Processing Facility \n     that exceeded the air quality permit by 215 tons over a year-\n     long period. On Nov. 14, 2004 ADEC issued Compliance letter \n     to CP for continued violations of excess Carbon Monoxide \n     emission levels at the injection turbine from August 24 to \n     October 2, 2004 (no fines).

December 21, 2001. Northstar Offshore \n     field. Clean Air Act violations. ADEC imposed penalties and \n     damages for violations of air quality permit for high carbon \n     monoxide emissions, exceeding daily flaring limits, and \n     operating equipment that had not been permitted. ($35,000 \n     suspended conditionally). The violations continued for years; \n     the compliance order was repeatedly extended. On June 22, \n     2004, ADEC wrote a Compliance Letter that BP was out of \n     compliance with its permit, the 2001 compliance order and \n     state regu1ations.\n       $80,000. BP.

Mr. President, lastly, on these reasons why we should \nnot move forward, is the notion that the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge is a symbol of this country's desire to protect and preserve \nwildlife areas and that somehow people would like to assume that long-\nterm damage has not already been done to other parts that have been \nopened up for drilling.\n  In fact, a Environmental News Service article that summarizes a 2003 \nNational Academy of Sciences report that says for three decades of oil \ndrilling on the Alaskan North Slope, while it has brought economic \nbenefits, for sure, it has also caused lasting environmental damage \n``and a mixture of positive and negative changes to that area.'' The \nreport found that some environmental damages will last for centuries.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Environmental News Service]\n\n            North Slope Report Fuels Alaska Drilling Debate\n\n                             (By J.R. Pegg)\n\n       Three decades of oil drilling on Alaska's North Slope has \n     brought economic benefits to the region, but has caused \n     lasting environmental damage and a mixture of positive and \n     negative social change, says an independent panel of experts.\n       The National Research Council report released Tuesday is \n     the first official assessment of the cumulative \n     environmental, economic and social effects of some 30 years \n     of oil drilling on Alaska's North Slope, which covers 89,000 \n     square miles.\n       The report, ``Cumulative Environmental Effects of Oil and \n     Gas Activities on Alaska's North Slope,'' does not offer any \n     policy recommendations on the issue of oil drilling within \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), which is east of \n     the established North Slope oil fields and remains the only \n     part of the nation's Arctic coast not open to drilling.\n       The Bush administration and some Republicans in Congress \n     are moving to open ANWR to drilling, despite fierce \n     opposition from environmentalists, Democrats and a handful of \n     Republicans.\n       ``That is a policy decision, not a science decision,'' \n     University of Washington zoology professor Gordon Orians told \n     reporters. Orians served as chair of the 18 member committee \n     that produced the report.\n       Even so, the report was immediately hailed by opponents of \n     drilling in ANWR, while at the same time it was labeled as \n     biased and flawed by some supporters.\n       The report is ``just another attempt by the people who have \n     been opposed to development in Alaska,'' said Senator Ted \n     Stevens, an Alaska Republican.\n       ``To hear them talk, you would think it would be in the \n     best interest of the country to turn the clock back and put \n     Eskimos back in igloos and deny them energy, deny them any \n     assistance of the federal government, and deny them any \n     income from the production of their lands.''\n       Stevens alleged that at least three committee members are \n     on record opposing increased drilling and said this \n     undermines the impartiality of the report.\n       Orians denied charges of any bias within the final report, \n     noting that the panel included individuals with ties to the \n     oil and gas industry, along with members linked to \n     environmental and conservation groups.\n       ``This is a unanimous report,'' Orians said. ``Everyone \n     agreed to this, even the members whose research has been \n     funded by the oil industry for years. The claim that \n     particular biases have slanted the committee's view cannot be \n     sustained.''\n       The study was mandated by Congress and carried out by the \n     research arm of the National Academies, which is a private, \n     nonprofit institution charged with providing science and \n     technology advice under a congressional charter. Members of \n     its committees are not compensated for their work.\n       The report finds that efforts by oil industry and \n     regulatory agencies have reduced many environmental effects, \n     but have not eliminated them. Some of the environmental \n     damage will last for centuries or longer because of the costs \n     of cleanup and fragile nature of the Arctic environment.\n       Oil was first discovered on the North Slope in 1968. Oil \n     production on the slope and along its coast accounts for some \n     15 percent of the nation's oil production.\n       There are concerns about the haphazard development of oil \n     and gas on the slope, driven by a consistent ``lack of \n     planning'' by different agencies and regulatory bodies with \n     oversight of the area, Orians said.\n       ``There has been no vision or planning on where things \n     ought to go,'' he said.\n       But scientific advances are helping to reduce some \n     environmental impacts. Smaller oil drilling platforms cause \n     less harm to the tundra, as does the trend that more roads \n     and drilling sites are now being constructed with ice instead \n     of gravel.\n       Fewer exploration wells are needed to locate and target oil \n     deposits. The use of remote sensing has reduced off road \n     travel, an activity the panel cited as having notable \n     environmental consequences. Off road trails for seismic \n     exploration have harmed vegetation, caused erosion and \n     degraded the aesthetic beauty of the tundra.\n       It is ``difficult to fully determine the impacts of off \n     road activity,'' Orians said, because the oil industry \n     refused to release information on where and when it had \n     conducted seismic explorations.\n       For some areas of concern, in particular oil spills, the \n     committee found no evidence that environmental effects have \n     accumulated.\n       ``Oil spills have not accumulated over time because spills \n     have been small and relatively contained,'' Orians said.\n       ``But if there were to be a major spill offshore in the \n     ocean, current technology cannot remove but a fraction of the \n     oil spilled.''\n       The report offers a mixed review of the impact of the oil \n     and gas industry on wildlife. There have not been large \n     declines in the caribou herds within the slope, but their \n     geographical distribution and reproductive success has been \n     altered. The animals avoid some traditional areas used for \n     calving and for protection from insects because of oil \n     development, and the report finds the spread of industrial \n     activity could increase this trend.\n       Some animals and birds, including bears, foxes, ravens and \n     gulls, have benefited from development on the North Slope. \n     These scavenging species have thrived with the addition of \n     food sources from human refuse. But these species prey on \n     eggs and nesting birds, some of which are threatened and \n     endangered. The report finds some bird species are struggling \n     to maintain stable populations because of this increased \n     threat.\n       The panel suggests that if oil activities expand, these \n     predator populations must be controlled if the impact to some \n     bird species is to be contained.\n       Bowhead whales have altered their migration patterns to \n     avoid noise from offshore seismic activity, the report says. \n     The extent of this detour and the impact to the species is \n     not fully understood, panelists said, but it is impacting the \n     indigenous societies of the slope.\n       The Inupiat Eskimos, for example, have a long tradition of \n     hunting bowhead whales, but are now finding they have to \n     travel much further out to sea to catch the whales. And the \n     Gwich'in Indians, who rely on caribou, are concerned about \n     changes to caribou herds and their migration patterns due to \n     oil drilling.\n       ``There is no question in the minds of the native community \n     that have been positive and negative impacts from oil \n     development,'' said committee member Patricia Cochran, \n     executive director of the Alaska Native Science Commission.\n       Money from oil development has improved schools, health \n     care and housing. But these improvements appear to have a \n     cost, the report finds, including increased alcoholism and \n     diabetes.\n       The report suggests the negative social impacts could be \n     mitigated by increased involvement of these communities \n     within the planning process for future oil and gas \n     development and for when oil and gas production declines on \n     the slope.\n       What will happen when production of oil and gas on the \n     North Slope has ceased is something that has not been \n     addressed, the report finds. It will take billions of dollars \n     to clean up and remove the infrastructure put in place to \n     drill oil and gas, costs that neither the government nor \n     the industry has said it is willing to absorb.\n       The panelists said further research into the environmental \n     effects of drilling should rely more on locals, explore air \n     pollution and contamination of water and food sources, as \n     well as the possible implications of climate change.\n       The report is intended to help policymakers with their \n     decisions, committee members said, and reflects that there \n     are environmental, economic and social tradeoffs for the \n     future of oil development on the North Slope.\n       ``When industrial development goes into an area there will \n     be some associated changes in the environment and society has \n     to face that, whether it is in Alaska or in the lower 48 \n     states,'' said panelist Chuck Kennicutt, director of the \n     Geochemical and Environmental Research Group at Texas A \n     University's College of Geosciences.\n       ``We are simply saying that there is change that will \n     occur. It is always a question of balance between the \n     benefits and the costs and these are perceived differently by \n     different people,'' Kennicutt said.\n       Bush administration officials said they welcomed the report \n     and highlighted its findings that technology is lessening the \n     environmental impact of drilling.\n\n[[Page S12164]]\n\n       The report shows that, ``We can protect wildlife and \n     produce energy on the North Slope,'' said Department of \n     Interior Secretary Gale Norton.\n       Protections that the administration supports, Norton said, \n     include mandated ice roads and runways, limits for \n     exploration areas to no more than 2,000 acres, analysis of \n     each proposed exploration site to avoid sensitive waters and \n     a mandate the exploration only occur in the winter.\n       Environmentalists and some Democrats believe the report \n     demonstrates that governmental oversight of drilling and its \n     environmental effects has been lacking.\n       ``The National Academies' report reveals what we have \n     suspected all along, that oil and gas exploration and \n     development have significant impact on wildlife and their \n     habitat and is leaving a legacy of pollution on one of \n     America's most pristine areas,'' said Congressman Ed Markey, \n     a Democrat from Massachusetts.\n       ``Oil companies haven't set aside the money required to \n     clean up their current infrastructure, let alone any \n     potential expansion,'' Markey said. ``It seems likely that \n     the restoration of the North Slope, if it is restored at all, \n     will fall on the taxpayer's shoulders.''\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I think it is known that the \nenvironmental damage to the region has been done, that leaks and clean \nair issues are prevalent in the area, that oil companies are being \nfined for those violations, and that we cannot just go about drilling \nin the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and think we are solving our \nproblems.\n  In fact, I would like to show my colleagues a copy of a map of what \nwe are talking about. Here is the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Here \nis the rest of northern Alaska. One can see the various designations of \nexisting Federal and State leases. The active Federal leases are in \nyellow. This is the area under discussion. So all the rest of Alaska in \nthis particular area--in yellow and red, and even in this beige, \nproposed Federal leasing plan--a lot of territory that is already \ninvolved in oil and gas production. Why not leave this last slice of \nAlaska's Northern coast alone and pristine?\n  A Washington resident, just to give my colleagues an idea, actually \ntook some pictures of this area of the wildlife refuge. One can see it \nis a very pristine area with wildlife and streams running through it. \nWe can imagine why someone wanted to preserve this area and why it is \nso important to the United States.\n  This happens to be, in my mind, a pretty infamous picture because \nwhen my colleague, Senator Boxer, and I were on the floor discussing \nthis issue a few years ago, there was a copy of this picture that was \nat the Smithsonian, part of an exhibit done by a Washington \nphotographer, a retired Boeing engineer who visited this area and took \nsome pictures and had a public display at the Smithsonian. As soon as \nthese pictures were used on the floor of the Senate, somehow his \nexhibit was sent to the basement of the Smithsonian and got a lot less \nattention because somehow, I guess, this picture portrays for the \nAmerican people something some people didn't want to see or didn't want \nto have advertised so specifically.\n  Here is another picture of the area that depicts what an \nunbelievable, pristine resource this is for the United States. We can \nsee how delicate the ecosystem of this region is and how challenging \noil drilling activity in this region can be.\n  I say to my colleagues that I believe the American people, and \ncertainly the news media around the country, have gotten the gist of \nwhat this debate is about because they have expressed their opinions \nabout this as well. I think they have been right on track about this \nissue. I would like to talk about some of those opinions.\n  The Milwaukee Journal Newspaper said:\n\n     . . . This effort may succeed, not because it's good public \n     policy but because supporters are trying to sneak it into a \n     budget reconciliation bill . . . supporters of good \n     government should not allow that to happen.\n\n  That is one newspaper in the Midwest.\n  Another from the South, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution:\n\n     . . . As always, drilling advocates are using distortions and \n     half-truths, claiming that awarding extractive leases on \n     protected lands will significantly reduce the Nation's \n     dependence on imported oil while having minimal impact on the \n     region's fragile ecology.\n\n  That from a newspaper in the South.\n  From the Philadelphia Inquirer, another newspaper that has followed \nthis issue. I thought they hit it right on the head in today's debate \nbecause they say:\n\n       Congress has wasted years trying to enact this single \n     proposal when, by now, ingenuity and investment in technology \n     could have developed better answers. Whether the United \n     States drills in the Arctic Refuge or not, this country has \n     no comprehensive plan to wean itself from oil. That's what's \n     really needed.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I interrupt the Senator for a moment \nso we might propound a unanimous-consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. If I can finish for a second, and then I will yield to \nthe Senator to make his request.\n  The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel is a summation of what this debate is \nabout. We have debated this for years, and the reason it has been \ncontentious is because a lot of people have concerns about this \ndirection and proposal. But now to do this on the budget where the \nenvironmental safeguards that are applied to other drilling, where the \nNEPA process and other safeguards are ignored, where we are not sure \nwhat oil revenue the United States is really going to get to recognize \nin this budget, when we don't know whether we are going to keep this \noil for economic security reasons, I agree with the Sentinel which \nsaid:\n\n       The reconciliation bill should be used to settle budget \n     matters, not to abuse the public's trust.\n  I will yield now to the Senator from North Dakota for his proposal.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senator from Washington yielding and the \nSenator from North Dakota for allowing us to proceed here, also in \narranging for this.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent the debate time on the pending \nCantwell amendment be extended to 12 noon and that the time from 10:45 \nto 12 noon be equally divided, except that the Senator from Washington \nshall, within that time, receive an additional 5 minutes; that any \namendments to the language proposed to be stricken be limited to the \ntime specified above and any second-degree amendments would be limited \nto the time specified under the agreement: that within the time \nallocated, Senator Talent shall have the right to offer an amendment \nrelative to ANWR; that the following first-degree amendments are to be \noffered during today's session within the time limits specified, all \ntime equally divided: Senator Grassley's amendment re: agriculture, \nfrom 12 to 1:30; Senator Bingaman's amendment relative to FMAP, from \n1:30 to 2 p.m.; Senator Byrd amendment re: VISAS, from 2 to 3; Senator \nLott and Senator Lautenberg amendment relative to Amtrak, from 3 to \n3:30; Senator McCain amendment re: spectrum date change, from 3:30 to \n4:15; Senator Murray's amendment re: dual eligibles, from 4:15 to 5 \np.m.; Senator Ensign's amendment re: DTV, 5 to 5:30; and Senator \nLandrieu's amendment on coastal impact or a Senator Conrad-designated \namendment, from 5:30 to 6 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object--and I hopefully will not \nbe objecting, I am sure we can work this out--in terms of the time for \nSenator Byrd's amendment, did we have that?\n  Mr. GREGG. From 2 to 3.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Very well. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, I want to ask a \nquestion. With reference to the pending amendment, would you refresh my \nrecollection here, Senator Talent has a right to offer an amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. During the period of pending debate from now until 12:00.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is that the time in which it would be debated?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no additional time. Has that been checked with \nhim?\n  Mr. GREGG. As I understand it, that is acceptable to Senator Talent.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reserve my right to object only because I am not sure \nthat is what he wants.\n  Is there any way the Senator can fit it in later on for 10 minutes?\n\n[[Page S12165]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. No.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is that the only other amendment in the list that \napplies to ANWR? On that list?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object because I \nwant to make certain we also got in the language that second-degree \namendments would be permitted during the above times and their debate \nwould be limited to the time specified under the agreement.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is applicable to the ANWR language.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And any others as well.\n  Mr. GREGG. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the agreement, as \nmodified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Washington for her courtesy in \nallowing us to proceed and interrupting her statement.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Even though Senator Cantwell has an extra 5 minutes, is \nit all right that we go and the Senator accumulate that time?\n  I yield myself 3 minutes, and then I will yield the management of the \ntime to the senior Senator from Alaska for the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to respond to one of the issues raised by \npointing to the map here. I have conferred with the Senator from Alaska \nand others about this Coastal Plain. If you see, it is in green and you \nsee these words, it says:\n\n       Not wilderness. Creation of the coastal plain oil and gas \n     exploration area.\n\n  This little box is within that, 20 acres. It is not within a \nwilderness area. It is not a wilderness. It was established by \nPresident Eisenhower, and contrary to what was said on the floor, it \nwas done that way for the very reason it was thought to have an \nabundance of natural resources; to wit, oil and gas. Therefore, it was \nset aside for an exploration area, the future use of which was to be \ndetermined by the Congress.\n  Isn't that interesting? Contrary to what has been said, we are doing \nexactly what President Eisenhower's set-aside intended. It intended it \nto be an oil and gas exploration area, for that purpose, to be \ndetermined in the future. By whom? Us. The very thing we are doing \nhere.\n  My last observation: For anybody in the United States who is worried \nabout America and its natural gas future, its natural gas price that is \ngoing through the roof, that this particular winter Americans are going \nto be terribly upset when the price goes up dramatically, with gasoline \nat the pump so high. It was a month ago that Americans were beginning \nto worry about their future. It is interesting to note that the State \nof Alaska, one of ours--not Russia, not some country that we don't know \nabout--actually contains sufficient natural gas that if we would have \nbeen on our toes, we would have had sufficient natural gas from our own \nState to where this crisis would not be occurring.\n\n  There are a lot of reasons. But one of them is the constant carping \nthat we can't do it because of environmental reasons, when we can. We \nknow how to do it. We do not have to destroy the wilderness. We don't \nhave to destroy the tundra. But if we keep doing what we are doing, we \ncan destroy our economy. That is the issue.\n  I am pleased to be part of this. I hope we will vote before the day \nis out on this issue, and we will finally prevail. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have sort of a unique role in this \nargument, since I was in the Interior Department in the Eisenhower \nadministration and helped create the Arctic Wildlife Range. It was \nspecifically on this Coastal Plain, specifically specified it was \nsubject to oil and gas leasing.\n  Then I was here at the time that Senators Jackson and Tsongas offered \nthe amendment that created the 1002 area and, as this chart shows, it \nwas specifically excluded from the Refuge. It is not wilderness. It \nnever was wilderness, and it has never been closed to oil and gas \nexploration. Their amendment required approval of Congress of the \naction--of the results of the environmental impact statement required \nby the Jackson amendment.\n  Mr. President, I am wearing an Alaska bolo tie today because two of \nmy friends, Laura and Crawford Patotuck, brought this to me and asked \nme to wear it when ANWR was up before the Senate. They are part of the \nAlaskan Native group that is here to support this bill and support \nproceeding with the oil and gas leasing.\n  I have heard some comments this morning about whether this is right, \nto have this provision in this bill. The Constitution of the United \nStates does not require 60 votes to pass a bill. That is only a \nprocedural rule of the Senate on how to end filibusters.\n  Filibusters plague the Senate. They continue to plague this Senate, \nand that is why the Budget Act was passed, to prevent filibusters on \nitems that would bring about increased income of the United States.\n  Many people are talking about the 50-50 split between the Federal \nGovernment and the State of Alaska under the Mineral Leasing Act. It so \nhappens I was the one who suggested it to Delegate Bartlett at the time \nthe Statehood Act was before the Congress, that we add to that, the \nStatehood Act, the provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act which \nguaranteed to Alaska 90 percent of the returns from oil and gas leasing \nin Alaska because we were not subject to the Reclamation Act.\n  The Reclamation Act no longer has any application. So Congress has, \nfor many years now, divided these receipts on a 50-50 basis, and this \nbill, when it becomes law, will specifically so divide it. That is not \nan issue that would be appealable to the courts. What would be \nappealable would be the original change in the law by the Congress if \nwe ever decided to file that lawsuit. Alaska has never filed such a \nlawsuit.\n  I hope we will not hear anymore about whether this provision of this \nbill applies to Alaska as it applies to all Western States that have \npublic lands. There is a 50-50 split on the royalties that are derived \nfrom oil and gas leasing.\n  One of my real joys this year was to receive a letter from my old \nfriend, James L. Buckley, Judge Buckley, former Senator from New York.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be placed on each \ndesk because I think all Senators should read it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me read it:\n\n       Dear Ted: Twenty-six years ago, after leaving the Senate, I \n     was a lead signatory in full-page ads opposing oil \n     exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve that \n     appeared in the New York Times and the Washington Post. I \n     opposed it because, based on the information then available, \n     I believed that it would threaten the survival of the \n     Porcupine caribou herd and leave huge, long-lasting scars on \n     fragile Arctic lands. Since then, caribou populations in the \n     areas of Prudhoe Bay and the Alaskan pipeline have increased, \n     which demonstrates that the Porcupine herd would not be \n     threatened, and new regulations limiting activities to the \n     winter months and mandating the use of ice roads and \n     directional drilling have vastly reduced the impact of oil \n     operations on the Arctic landscape.\n       In light of the above, I have revised my views and now urge \n     approval of oil development in the 1002 Study Area for the \n     following reasons:\n       1. With proper management, I don't see that any significant \n     damage to arctic wildlife would result, and none that \n     wouldn't rapidly be repaired once operation ceased.\n       2. While I don't buy the oil companies' claim that only \n     2,000 acres would be affected, even if all of the 1.5 \n     million-acre Study Area were to lose its pristine quality (it \n     wouldn't), that would still leave 18.1 million acres of the \n     ANWR untouched plus another five million acres in two \n     adjoining Canadian wildlife refuges, or an area about equal \n     to that of the States of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, \n     and New Hampshire combined. In other words, it is simply \n     preposterous to claim that oil development in the Study Area \n     would ``destroy'' the critical values that ANWR is intended \n     to serve.\n       3. In light of the above, it is economic and (to a much \n     lesser degree) strategic masochism to deny ourselves access \n     to what could prove our largest source of a vital resource.\n\n  I emphasize this:\n\n       Having visited the Arctic on nine occasions over the past \n     13 years (including a recent camping trip on Alaska's North \n     Slope), I don't think I can be accused of being insensitive \n     to the charms of the Arctic qua Arctic. I just don't see the \n     threat to values I cherish.\n       With best regards,\n       Sincerely, Jim.\n\n  There is a man who has changed his views. I do believe we should all \ntake\n\n[[Page S12166]]\n\ninto consideration the fact that he led the movement, started the \nmovement against the exploration and development of this Arctic Plain.\n  I must express my amazement that our colleague from Washington has \nintroduced an amendment to strip this provision from the budget \nreconciliation. In 1980, former Washington Senator, and my great \nfriend, Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson wrote a letter discussing the \nimportance of ANWR.\n  He wrote this about ANWR:\n\n       Crucial to the Nation's attempt to achieve energy \n     independence. One third of our known petroleum reserves are \n     in Alaska, along with an even greater proportion of our \n     potential reserves. Actions such as preventing even the \n     exploration of the Arctic Wildlife Range, . . . is an \n     ostrich-like approach that ill-serves our Nation in this time \n     of energy crisis.\n\n  I say this: Not only does ANWR serve our important national security \ninterest, it also serves the economic interest of the State of \nWashington.\n  The economic health of Puget Sound is tied directly to Alaska as \nillustrated in a report commissioned by the Tacoma-Pierce County and \nGreater Seattle Chambers of Commerce. Of particular importance is oil \nproduction from the North Slope.\n  Washington's refining industry purchases almost its entire crude oil \nstocks from Alaska. The report states that ``direct impacts from the \nrefining of Alaska crude oil within the Puget Sound region include \n1,990 jobs and $144.5 million in labor earnings. In 2003, oil \nrefineries in Puget Sound imported $2.8 billion worth of crude oil from \nAlaska.'' Alaska oil provided 90 percent of the region's refinery \nneeds.\n  Washington's refineries provide much needed gasoline and jet fuel \nsupplies to the Pacific northwest. Without the opportunity to expand \nproduction at the Cherry Point refinery, more than 300,000 gallons of \nfuel per day are lost. This is fuel desperately needed by consumers in \nboth Washington and Oregon.\n  Oregon has no refining. The refinery I mentioned is the one running \nAlaskan oil. Oil development is a major contributor to the health of \nWashington's economy. As oil wealth in the State of Alaska increases, \nso does the demand for Puget Sound goods and services. Perhaps this is \nwhy the chambers of commerce support balanced development of ANWR.\n  They understand that with Prudhoe Bay declining--it today only \nproduces around 950,000 barrels a day from a high of 2.1 million \nbarrels--additional oil resources must be developed to ensure the \ncontinued economic viability of the Puget Sound region.\n  The development of Prudhoe Bay contributed more than $1.6 billion \ninto the Washington economy. ANWR alone is estimated to create over \n12,000 new jobs in Washington alone, in addition to the revenues it \nwill generate for the State.\n  None of these benefits will take place if Senator Cantwell's motion \nis allowed to pass.\n  Not only are decreasing oil output and declining revenues affecting \nthe health of Washington, its major businesses are feeling the heat--\nparticularly the aviat1on industry.\n  The rise in fuel prices is greatly impacting our aviation industries. \nOur airline industry has lost over $25 billion in the last 3 years.\n  Sustained high jet fuel costs of $1.50 per gallon--which is almost \ntriple that of 1998 and 1999--continues to hamper the health of this \ncritical industry. Every dollar per barrel that the cost of oil rises \ncosts the airline industry an additional $2 million per month.\n  High energy prices also prevent job creation in the transportation \nsector. The Air Transport Association estimates that for every dollar \nincrease in the price of fuel, they could fund almost 5,300 airline \njobs. This should be particularly worrisome to those members who \nrepresent constituencies in the airline industry and those businesses \nthat support the airline industry.\n  At a time when Boeing, America's leading aerospace company, is \nstruggling to reassert its dominance in the aviation field, the high \nprices of oil are devastating.\n  Fuel costs are the second biggest costs for airlines. Given these \nhigh costs, airlines can not afford to purchase additional aircraft.\n  And air transport, which generated revenues of $1.5 billion in 2003, \nare also at risk from high fuel prices.\n  Washington State consumes 17.6 million gallons of petroleum per day, \nincluding 7.3 million gallons for gasoline and 2.5 million gallons per \nin jet fuel. It produces none of its oil.\n  I ask the Senator from Washington, where will your constituents get \noil if they do not get additional supplies from ANWR, when the pipeline \nin Alaska--the only known producing area--is declining almost daily?\n  Twenty-four years ago, during the debate on Anilca, I worked closely \nwith Senator Scoop Jackson and Senator Paul Tsongas to ensure part of \nthe coastal plain of Anwr remained open for oil and gas development.\n  Senator Jackson and Senator Tsongas promised oil and gas activity \nwould take place in the coastal plain subject to an environmental \nimpact statement which would have to be approved by Congress. In the \nspirit of compromise, they created section 1002 of Anilca, which set \naside 1.5 million acres along the coastal plain of Anwr for oil and gas \nexploration and development.\n  It is not wilderness. It has never been wilderness. It has never been \nwithdrawn. It has always been available for oil and gas development. It \nwas once passed by the Senate, and President Clinton vetoed the bill.\n  I have fought now for 24 years to make sure that the promise made to \nme personally--made here on the floor of the Senate by Senators from \nWashington State and Massachusetts, Senator Jackson and Senator \nTsongas--and that promise has never been fulfilled.\n  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is 19 million acres.\n  It is shown on this chart. The area set aside for oil and gas \nexploration the 1002 area, or the coastal plain is 1.5 million acres. \nBecause of advances in technology, only 2,000 acres of this 1.5 million \nwill be needed for production.\n  To put this in perspective, ANWR is about the size of South Carolina. \nThe area needed for development is about the size of Dulles Airport. \nDevelopment in the Coastal Plain is the equivalent of building an \nairport in South Carolina.\n  I want to go to chart 2 and show the Coastal Plain.\n  According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the Coastal Plain holds \nbetween 5.7 billion barrels and 16 billion barrels of oil.\n  Again, I emphasize that people are talking about 2 percent of the \nknown reserves. We have a lot of unknown reserves, particularly in \nAlaska and the West, which have not been explored, and the area off our \ncoast going toward Russia on the Outer Continental Shelf. Two-thirds of \nthe Outer Continental Shelf of the United States has not been explored.\n  We are capable of producing, as the Senator from New Mexico said, a \nlot more oil and gas. We can produce 876,000 to 1.6 million barrels a \nday by developing the Coastal Plain. That would fulfill our pipeline \nbackup. It is our country's single largest prospect for future oil \nproduction.\n  And, the actual amount of recoverable oil could be much larger. \nRemember, the first estimates at Prudhoe Bay were that there would be 1 \nbillion barrels of recoverable oil. In the last 30 years, we have \nrecovered 14 billion.\n  In 1973, at the time of the oil embargo, our country imported one-\nthird of its petroleum. We now import almost 60 percent of our oil. By \n2025, we will import almost 70 percent.\n  American dependence on foreign oil threatens our national security. \nWe now rely on unstable and unfriendly regimes to meet our energy \nneeds.\n  The coastal plain can produce over 36 million gallons of gasoline, \njet and diesel fuel, heating oil, and other products a day. It can heat \nover 8.1 million homes, or provide all of the gasoline that \nCalifornians consume each day. America needs American oil.\n  America needs this American oil.\n  People who say it is only a day's supply are talking about if there \nwere no other source of oil. It is a preposterous statement to say this \narea contains very little oil.\n  In 2004, our merchandise trade deficit was $651.52 billion, 25.5 \npercent of this deficit came from net imports of crude and petroleum \nproducts, which cost over $166 billion.\n  We are paying higher prices to meet our energy needs, and we are \nflushing jobs and money out of our economy.\n  Americans are paying more for gasoline, heating fuel, and consumer \nproducts. In the past 4 years, the average\n\n[[Page S12167]]\n\nprice of gasoline has increased by $1.84 a gallon--that's a 75 percent \nincrease!\n  For every $1 billion we spend to develop our domestic resources, we \ncreate 12,500 jobs. This means in 2003 we lost over 1.3 million jobs by \nimporting oil instead of producing it here--1.3 million jobs outsourced \nin order to bring oil from other sources.\n  By developing our resources on the coastal-plain, we will create \nbetween 700,000 and 1 million American jobs. We will put up to $60 \nmillion back into the U.S. economy each day instead of sending it to \nforeign countries.\n  Probably one of the things most important to me is that our Alaska \nNative people overwhelmingly support development on this Coastal Plain. \nOut of the 231 Alaska Native villages, only one has opposed this. Yet \nthey are the poster children for all of these environmental ads you \nsee. One, the Gwich'in Village, opposes the initiative in this bill.\n  Alaskans overwhelmingly support development in the Coastal Plain; \nthey know we can develop this resource in an environmentally \nresponsible way.\n  Alaska natives overwhelmingly support development on the Coastal \nPlain. Of 231 Alaska native villages, only one--the Gwich'in--opposes \ndevelopment.\n  And the tide of public opinion among all Americans has begun to turn; \nthey know development in the Coastal Plain will help lower energy \nprices, reduce our dependence on unstable and unfriendly regimes, and \ngrow our economy.\n  Let me turn to charts 4 and 5 because I think this is very important.\n  We constantly hear that this is a pristine place, the most beautiful \nplace on Earth. That is the area in wintertime. I defy anyone to say \nthat is a beautiful place that has to be preserved for the future. It \nis a barren wasteland, a frozen wasteland, and there are no porcupine \ncaribou at all there during that period of time.\n  The Coastal Plain is a frozen, barren land for 9 months of the year \nwith an average temperature of minus 50 degrees.\n  A majority of wildlife species use the foothills of the Brooks Range, \nabout 60 miles from the Coastal Plain.\n  Put up the other chart, please.\n  This is what it looks like in the summertime.\n  My colleague, Senator Murkowski, the great partner I have, showed \nwhere there was one well drilled with a 6-foot pipe sticking up. The \nrest of it is constant, constant tundra, no trees, no beauty at all.\n  The porcupine caribou herd uses the Coastal Plain for only 6-8 weeks \nper year, when development will not take place.\n  The herd spends the majority of its time in Canada, which has no \nseasonal or bag limits for native residents. It is estimated that an \naverage of 2,900 caribou are harvested in Canada each year.\n  There is no evidence that oil development will harm the porcupine \nherd. In fact, all evidence points to the contrary. The central Arctic \nherd at Prudhoe Bay has grown ten fold, from 3,000 in 1974 to over \n30,000 today.\n  There is no evidence that oil development has harmed the reproductive \nactivities of polar bears, a replica of which I proudly wear on this \ntie.\n  Resource development and conservation are not mutually exclusive.\n  Oil and gas companies use ice pads and roads to protect tundra and \nthe ecosystem. They employ directional and multi-lateral drilling to \nreach reservoirs of oil and gas, which reduces the impact to the land.\n  In fact, the Clinton administration issued a report which \ndemonstrated that oil and gas can be removed in an environmentally \nsensitive manner.\n  Development of the Coastal Plain will be subject to the strictest \nenvironmental standards in the world. With these standards and our \nadvanced technology, responsible development and conservation can \ncoexist.\n  Very clearly, a vote for this motion is a vote for the status quo, \nwhich my good friend Ronald Reagan used to say ``is Latin for `the mess \nwe're in.' ''\n  A vote for this motion closes our domestic energy resources to \nproduction. It's a vote for continuing to import more than 60 percent \nof our Nation's oil. It is a vote for outsourcing more than 1.3 million \nAmerican jobs a year.\n  A vote for this motion is a vote to increase home heating bills and \ntransportation costs. It's a vote to diminish our national security by \nrelying on rogue nations and unstable regimes for our energy needs.\n  Who would expect a Senator to come to this Senate floor and offer an \namendment that exports 1.3 million American jobs every year, will cost \nus $200 billion annually by 2025, and leaves our national security \nvulnerable to the whims of unfriendly regimes. But that's exactly what \nthis motion does.\n  A vote for this motion is not just a vote against developing our \ndomestic resources on the Coastal Plain. It's a vote for closing our \nNation's single greatest prospect for future oil production and backing \nout of the promise that was made to Alaskans--and all Americans--when \nSenators Scoop Jackson and Paul Tsongas created section 1002 of the \nAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.\n  A vote for this motion is a vote against Alaska Natives, who \noverwhelmingly support development on the Coastal Plain because they \nknow we can balance stewardship and conservation with resource \ndevelopment.\n  We cannot continue to increase our dependence on foreign oil. We have \nthe capability to continue to increase our production of oil and gas.\n  When you look at this proposal, this is an amendment to export 1.3 \nmillion American jobs overseas. It will cost us $200 billion annually \nby 2005. Why is it in this bill? That is the reason we want to stop \nthat. We want to stem the flow of jobs leaving this country. We do not \nwant to go beyond 60 in importing our oil. As a matter of fact, we want \nto reverse that. We want to go back to the promise that Senators \nJackson and Tsongas made when they created this portion of this area, a \nreserve for exploration and development. The Coastal Plain has been set \naside for exploration and development.\n  I close with this: An old bull is what they call us when they reach \nmy age in the Senate, World War II type. We remember when a Member's \nword meant something in the Senate and when the word of a Member who \nhas left the Senate was still fulfilled. We remember when the Senate \nwould do everything in its power to honor a promise.\n  In our State, we quote Robert Service: ``A promise made is a debt \nunpaid.'' This is a debt unpaid to this Senate, to the country, to \nAlaska, to proceed with what Senators Jackson and Tsongas outlined in \n1980, to explore for and develop that oil in the area, if it is \npossible to do so.\n  I understand other Senators wish to be yielded time.\n  How much time would the Senator like to have?\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator. I \nappreciate the time.\n  Regarding bull moose and bull elk, it is good to hear from an old \nbull on the floor as well.\n  I wanted to talk briefly about it in a fairly broad sense, and \nobviously the Senators from Alaska have talked about the details. I am \nimpressed with what they said.\n  I remind everyone we have recently completed an energy policy, one we \nworked on for a number of years. We worked on it partly as a base for \nthe need we see in this country for energy, partly over the fact we \nhave not had a long-term plan of where we will go. Whether it is \nenergy, medicine, whatever, we need to start looking at the future and \nhow we will fill our needs, how we will be able to provide for growth \nin the economy, provide for our families, provide for our communities. \nEnergy is very much a part of that.\n  The energy policy has been very important. It looks to the future. It \nlooks to filling our needs in a balanced policy. Policy looks to \nincreased production, new ways of production, and more technological \nways, such as horizontal drilling. In my State, they are looking at new \nways of exploring for oil without having to disturb the surface. It is \nnot what we had in the past.\n  I live in a place where we have areas that need to be preserved. We \nhave lots of areas, some for double utility, so we can use it for \nvarious things, and not set it aside. We are talking here about 20 \nmillion acres and using 2,000 acres. We are edging in close to Prudhoe \nBay. I have been there. It is not a wilderness area.\n\n[[Page S12168]]\n\n  We have the same experience in Wyoming. We have areas that need to be \nset aside. There are millions of areas--from the mountains in the \nRefuge, on down, and there will still be ocean front--and we can have \nutilization of the lands, combining the two in an economically and \nenvironmentally sound way. That is what is set up here.\n  In our policy we included opening of ANWR as another place. We are in \nenergy production heavily in my State, but we cannot produce enough for \neveryone. We need to expand that.\n  There are other Members who want to speak. I speak on this topic \ngenerally. We have looked at this everywhere and we should look in \nAlaska, as well. No. 1, we can do this without taking away the value of \nthe Refuge; No. 2, we need to do it for the economy of the people who \nlive there. Indian lands are right in this land. There are things that \nneed to be done there. We need to do it to fulfill our promise to \nourselves regarding the energy policy we have. I urge we continue to \npursue the policy we have in place now, to increase our domestic \nproduction.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not control the time.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator has 37\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. On each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes 21 seconds for the majority \nand 37\\1/2\\ minutes for the minority.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I'll take a few moments as I wait for my \ncolleagues to come to the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senators Durbin and Salazar be added as \ncosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a National Congress of American Indians resolution that \nstates their opposition to opening up drilling in the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    The National Congress of American Indians Resolution #BIS-02-056\n\n       Title: Supporting the Subsistence Lifeways of Alaska \n     Tribes, Gwich-in, Inuplat, Tlinglit and Saint Lawrence Island \n     Native Peoples, and of Related Indigenous Cultures in Canada \n     and Russia, and Opposing Efforts by Multinational Economic \n     and Political Interests that Would Endanger these Lifeways\n       Whereas, we, the members of the National Congress of \n     American Indians of the United States, invoking the divine \n     blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and purposes, in \n     order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants the \n     inherent sovereign rights of our Indian nations, rights \n     secured under Indian treaties and agreements with the United \n     States, and all other rights and benefits to which we are \n     entitled under the laws and Constitution of the United \n     States, to enlighten the public toward a better understanding \n     of the Indian people and their way of life, to preserve \n     Indian cultural values, and otherwise promote the health, \n     safety and welfare of the Indian people, do hereby establish \n     and submit the following resolution; and\n       Whereas, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) \n     was established in 1944 and is the oldest and largest \n     national organization of American Indian and Alaska Native \n     tribal governments; and\n       Whereas, the subsistence traditions of Alaska Native \n     peoples and other related indigenous peoples vary \n     considerably among regions and cultures, but are tied \n     together by the common strands of their importance for \n     indigenous cultural survival, and their vulnerability to \n     attack from outside interests that lack respect for these \n     subsistence traditions and would destroy or endanger these \n     traditions in pursuit of their multinational economic or \n     political objectives; and\n       Whereas, like the Yup-ik people of the Akiak Native \n     Community and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta of southwest Alaska, \n     the Gwich-in Athabascan people of eastern Alaska and Canada's \n     Yukon Territory, the Inuplat people of northern and western \n     Alaska, the Saint Lawrence Island Natives of the Bering Sea, \n     the Siberian Yup-ik familial relatives of Saint Lawrence \n     Islanders who live on the Russian side of the Bering Sea, and \n     other indigenous peoples of eastern Siberia, all depend on \n     the perpetuation of their various subsistence traditions \n     across the generations for the very survival of their \n     indigenous cultures; and\n       Whereas, legal barriers and ecologically destructive \n     practices imposed by multinational political and economic \n     interests can and have disrupted indigenous hunting \n     traditions in places around the world, and even where these \n     disruptive actions may have ultimately proven temporary in \n     nature, they have interfered with the perpetuation of \n     indigenous subsistence traditions across the generations, \n     thereby threatening the very survival of indigenous cultures; \n     and\n       Whereas, the cultural survival of the Gwich-in is so tied \n     to the survival and continuation of the migratory cycle of \n     the Porcupine caribou herd of Canada and Alaska that the \n     Gwich-in are known as the People of the Caribou; and\n       Whereas, the Inupiat people have likewise been referred to \n     as the People of the Whale because of their profound cultural \n     relationship with the bowhead whale, which provides the \n     foundation of their subsistence diet, and serves as a central \n     organizing factor for a culture that is largely structured \n     around whaling crew affiliations and associated familial \n     relationships; and\n       Whereas, the Saint Lawrence Island Natives are likewise \n     dependent upon whaling for their cultural survival, and the \n     Native peoples of eastern Siberia have only recently begun \n     the difficult task of trying to reclaim and reinvigorate \n     subsistence whaling traditions suppressed under decades of \n     Soviet rule; and\n       Whereas, the people of Southeastern Alaska are likewise \n     dependent on herring for their subsistence lifeways; and\n       Whereas, all Alaska Natives dependent on the riverways for \n     their traditional lifeways related to the salmon; and\n       Whereas, all of these subsistence traditions are currently \n     threatened by multinational political and economic interests \n     that place them at risk; and\n       Whereas, the cultural survival of the Gwich-in people is \n     threatened by multinational oil companies and pro-industry \n     officials in the highest ranks of the United States \n     government forces that would callously place the survival of \n     the Porcupine caribou herd at risk, by gambling that oil \n     exploration and development on the herds calving grounds in \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge of Alaska would not have \n     the devastating effects on the herd that many biologists and \n     people with indigenous knowledge of the caribou believe such \n     actions would; and\n       Whereas, the cultural survival of the Inupiat people, the \n     Saint Lawrence Island Natives, and the indigenous peoples of \n     eastern Siberia is likewise threatened by recent developments \n     before the International Whaling Commission. where Japan \n     succeeded in blocking the allocation of whaling quotas for \n     Alaska Natives and indigenous Siberians, beginning in 2003. \n     and did so solely out of a desire to retaliate against the \n     United States for its opposition to the resumption of a \n     commercial whaling Industry in Japan; and\n       Whereas, it is morally wrong and a violation of basic human \n     rights for multinational corporations and national \n     governments to place the survival of indigenous cultures at \n     risk, especially to pursue excess wealth or international \n     political advantage, and it is important that the NCAI oppose \n     these assaults on indigenous lifeways that are currently \n     being perpetrated on the international stage.\n       Now therefore be it resolved, That the NCAI does hereby \n     oppose the efforts of multinational oil companies and certain \n     high ranking federal officials, to open the Arctic Refuge to \n     all exploration and development in complete disregard of the \n     risks such actions would create for the cultural survival of \n     the Gwich-in people of Alaska and Canada, and calls upon the \n     government of the United States to reject any and all \n     proposals that might create such risks; and\n       Be it further resolved, That the NCAI similarly opposes the \n     efforts of commercial fishing interest which adversely affect \n     the subsistence salmon and herring traditional and customary \n     fishing rights of all Native Tribes of Alaska: and\n       Be it further resolved, That the NCAI similarly opposes the \n     efforts of the government of Japan and Japanese commercial \n     whaling interests, to play international power politics by \n     shutting down indigenous whaling in Alaska and Siberia at the \n     expense of indigenous cultures that must be allowed to \n     survive and perpetuate their way of life, and calls upon the \n     governments of the United States, Russia and Japan to take \n     appropriate steps to end this callous and abusive \n     mistreatment of indigenous cultures on both sides of the \n     Bering Sea border; and\n       Be it finally resolved, That this resolution shall be the \n     policy of NCAI until it is withdrawn or modified by \n     subsequent resolution.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, while I am waiting for some of my other \ncolleagues to speak, I point out a couple of things about this process. \nI showed a chart earlier that Americans across the country, and \ncertainly the news media covering this, say this budget process is not \nthe way to go about the opening up of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. More importantly, there are issues that are precedent setting \nand raise concerns such as, do my colleagues want to debate the fact \nthat they think 50 votes versus 60 votes is the way to do this policy?\n  As a Senator from a State that now has to endure a survey for \ndrilling off the coast of Washington, off the coasts of Oregon and \nCalifornia--and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee has been \ndiscussing opening drilling off the coast of Florida--this policy in \nthe\n\n[[Page S12169]]\n\nunderlying reconciliation bill is a very dangerous precedent. That is, \nthat if you can go to a budget process and open up drilling, why can't \nyou open up drilling in any other part of the country through this \nprocess?\n  I guess it is no surprise that the House of Representatives has \nactually already moved on legislation trying to open up drilling in \nother areas of the country. It is not a fantasy on my part that other \nMembers of the other side of the aisle could be promoting drilling and \ncould use a budget process for the same maneuver being used here. It \nsets a very bad precedent, a backdoor scheme.\n  Because what we are basically saying is that those oil interests are \nabove the public interests, and they do not have to meet the same \nrequirements. For example, the National Environmental Protection Act. I \nhave heard a lot about Scoop Jackson today. My colleagues should \nremember who wrote the National Environmental Protection Act and got it \npassed. It was Senator Scoop Jackson. We are very proud of that. Why \nwould we take NEPA and limit the alternatives that could be considered \nunder this bill for proposal impacts to the environment? That is what \nit does. By throwing this language in the budget resolution instead of \na normal process, we are limiting NEPA. We are limiting judicial \nreview. Why should we limit judicial review? We do not do that in other \nareas of oil drilling, but for this more pristine of areas we will \nlimit judicial review? All because we are doing it through the Budget \nprocess.\n  We will also be limiting the role of the Fish and Wildlife Service. \nAren't they an integral part of planning for production in various \nparts of the country? Why can't current Bureau of Land Management \nregulations that provide for the Fish and Wildlife Service be used to \nprovide for the protection of fish and wildlife? The answer is the \nBureau of Land Management and Fish and Wildlife Service are out of \ntheir normal role because we put this in the budget process.\n  What about compatibility? Why does this legislation assume that oil \nand gas activities cannot be undertaken in a manner compatible with the \nArctic Wildlife Refuge?\n  Transportation. The chairman has removed consideration in this \nunderlying bill authorizing oil and gas from the coastal regions, which \nis unusual language considering there is a whole range of issues, \nincluding pipelines, ports, and systems. Again, NEPA, judicial review, \nFish and Wildlife, Bureau of Land Management, transportation, and other \ncompatibility issues are not being addressed because we are throwing \nthis in the budget process.\n  What about the leasing provisions? I have talked a lot about this and \nI would love it if my colleagues from Alaska would support an amendment \nI plan to offer that specifies this cannot go forward until we verify \nthat it is a 50-50 split or that it isn't going to go forward. This \nSenator would love to know that my colleagues from the other side of \nthe aisle are so certain this is going to be a 50-50 revenue split that \nthey are willing to support clarifying in the language that the actual \nopening up of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge cannot go forward \nunless it is a 50-50 split. If they are so certain that is going to \nhappen, they should be willing to support my amendment.\n  As far as the economic issues, I guarantee my State constituents know \nvery well where their oil comes from. In fact, that has been the big \ncomplaint for a good part of the last 36 months, the fact that the FTC \nand other entities keep reminding the Northwest they are an isolated \nmarket getting oil from Alaska, yet our prices have gone up to over $3 \na gallon.\n  My constituents, who are getting squeezed at the gas pump, want two \nthings. They want us to have a price investigation and make sure that \nprice gouging is not going on and do something to protect them. And, \ntwo, they want something that will bring true competition to the price \nof fossil fuels and help them in not facing high fuel costs in the \nfuture.\n  Even the Energy Department says it is not going to help my \nconstituents. The Energy Department says in the peak years of \nproduction it would reduce prices a penny a gallon. I guarantee my \nconstituents want more than a penny a gallon reduction in gas prices. \nThey are not going to wait 20 years to get that. My constituents want \nto see real action on a price-gouging bill that we can push out of here \nthat gives the authority to pursue the activities of record profits and \nmake sure price gouging is not going on. They want us to get about \ndiversifying the sources of energy we use.\n  Diversification will mean a lot to our economy. I can say high gas \nprices are costing our economy today plenty. If you want to talk about \nthe airline industry, which has seen a 293-percent increase in fuel \ncosts over a 5-year-period of time, yes, there are people in Washington \nState who are losing their jobs because of that. They want aggressive \naction today. They do not want to see 10 years from now 6 months of an \noil supply that is not going to help them.\n\n  I want my constituents to understand a budget process that is a \nbackdoor scheme that basically does not leave them any better off today \nor in the future than they are today is not a responsible solution to \nour energy needs. They want to see us truly come up with something that \nis going to get us diversified off our dependence on fossil fuels. With \n3 percent of the world's oil reserves, the writing is on the wall. The \nUnited States needs to take a more aggressive action than drilling in \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  I remind my colleagues what the Milwaukee Journal pointed out:\n\n       The reconciliation bill should be used to settle budget \n     matters, not to abuse the public's trust.\n\n  That is what we are doing in this bill, trying to pass a wildlife \nrefuge off as an oil field drilling opportunity when we are not \naddressing important issues. We are not addressing the environmental \nprotections, the judicial review, fish and wildlife, the transportation \nissues, or the Native Alaskan issues.\n  We are setting down a very dangerous precedent. I don't want to see \nthe same gimmick used for Washington State, for Florida, or other areas \nwhen this Senate thinks by sticking something in a reconciliation bill \nthey can open up leasing of oil in the United States.\n  Some of my colleagues, I know, are going to talk about an important \nissue as part of this debate, whether this oil that is produced out of \nthe Arctic Wildlife Refuge should remain in the United States. If this \nSenate believes this debate is about oil and making America more \nsecure, getting off of our 50-percent dependence on foreign oil is what \nwe need to do. To do that, most people will say we have to get off the \nfossil fuel consumption.\n  If my colleagues who want to support this amendment want to drill in \nAlaska, they ought to be willing to say the oil ought to stay in the \nUnited States. If you think it is part of our national security plan, \nthen say it is part of our national security plan and keep it in the \nUnited States. I would go further to even say, why not create a refined \nproduct, like a jet fuel reserve, as they have in Europe? The Europeans \nfigured out jet fuel is expensive. They have not only a strategic \npetroleum reserve, they have a jet fuel reserve. They figured out they \ndo not want their airline industry subject to and their economy ruined \nby sudden price spikes.\n  I would go further than many of my colleagues in saying not only can \nthe oil not be exported, let's put it in a specific reserve dedicated \nto a particular, important sector of our U.S. economy--transportation \nand aviation.\n  I look forward to my colleagues who, in committee, did not think it \nwas such a great idea, who certainly thought that oil should be \nexported, who now say it shouldn't be. I am glad to see that change of \nopinion if that is what is going to happen in the Senate. This budget \nprocess is a backdoor end to opening a 6-month oil supply we will not \nsee for 10 years and will not do a darned thing to help consumers now \nor when it is at peak production.\n  We shouldn't fool the American people by giving them false choices in \nwhat is not a solution, and false budget choices when we cannot even \nguarantee to them the $2.4 billion that is assumed in this budget.\n  The difference between Alaska winning and the United States winning \non this debate is the difference between $2.4 billion and $480 million. \nSo I hope my colleagues, besides looking at this\n\n[[Page S12170]]\n\nexport issue and saying this oil should stay in the United States, will \nalso look at the commitment in saying that, yes, we only think this \nshould be opened up if the United States actually gets $2.4 billion. \nBecause otherwise this whole scheme is a matter of false choices, false \nbudget choices, false security choices, and false choices for the \nconsumer. In the end, Americans are still paying high energy prices.\n  Mr. President, while my colleagues sort out who is going to \npotentially offer a second-degree amendment, I will yield the floor to \ndiscuss with my colleagues that process.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nCantwell's motion to strike the provision to open the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge, ANWR, for drilling from the Budget Reconciliation Act.\n  Let me be clear: I am opposed to drilling in the Arctic. I am also \nopposed to attaching this provision to the budget reconciliation bill. \nANWR is a prominent national issue, arousing the deep passions of \npeople on both sides. Regardless of one's view on the issue, the \nquestion of whether to open the refuge to drilling warrants an \nindependent debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  The refuge's coastal plain, which is what would be opened up for \ndrilling, is the ecological heart of the refuge, the center of wildlife \nactivity, and the home to nearly 200 wildlife species, including polar \nbears, musk oxen, and caribou.\n  Today, the Senate is going to vote to open ANWR in the most \nenvironmentally harmful way. Rather than protecting this unique \nhabitat, the legislation before us directs the Secretary of Interior to \nopen the Refuge for drilling based upon an environmental analysis \nconducted 18 years ago, in 1987.\n  This environmental analysis was controversial when it was originally \npublished. It was then challenged in court in the early 1990s. However, \nthe claims were dismissed because at the time, Congress was not \nactively considering legislation to drill the Arctic Refuge.\n  As a result, this legislation would bypass the environmental process \nthat all drilling projects must undergo. It would also waive the normal \njudicial review requirements. In other words, the Senate is going to \nauthorize opening the Refuge, and is going to make sure that there are \nabsolutely no impediments to drilling, including the normal course of \nenvironmental and legal review.\n  This is simply unacceptable.\n  And why are we destroying this refuge? The Department of Energy \nestimates that opening the Refuge would lower gasoline prices one cent \nper gallon 20 years from now.\n  Let's not fool ourselves. Opening the Arctic Refuge will not lower \nenergy prices.\n  If we were serious about helping people with rising energy costs, we \nwould be talking about helping low-income Americans pay their heating \nbills this winter. Yet the Senate continues to vote down fully funding \nthe Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP.\n  If we truly wanted to bring down gasoline costs, we would be talking \nabout increasing fuel economy standards in our heaviest, most polluting \nvehicles.\n  Yet, instead, we are talking about opening one of our Nation's last \npristine environments.\n  This giveaway comes at a time of record profits for the oil industry. \nLate last week, the oil companies reported their third quarter profits. \nThe top five oil companies reported huge profit increases in the third \nquarter of 2005:\n  ExxonMobil reported third quarter profits of $9.92 billion, an \nincrease of 75 percent from the third quarter in 2004;\n  ConocoPhillips reported third quarter profits of $3.8 billion, an \nincrease of 89 percent from the third quarter of 2004;\n  Shell reported third quarter profits of up $9.03 billion, an increase \nof 68 percent from the third quarter of 2004;\n  ChevronTexaco reported third quarter profits of $3.6 billion, an \nincrease of 12 percent from the third quarter in 2004; and\n  BP reported third quarter profits of $6.53 billion, an increase of 34 \npercent from the third quarter in 2004.\n  If Congress is truly serious about addressing the issue of high \ngasoline prices, then we need to take a look at why oil companies \ncontinue to make increasingly high profits and how they can reinvest \nthose profits into improving our Nation's energy infrastructure.\n  Gas prices will not be lowered by opening the Refuge. At its peak, \noil production from the Refuge would only be about 1 percent of world \noil production.\n  It is not worth damaging the Nation's only Refuge for less than 1 \npercent of the world's oil output. This Refuge encompasses a complete \nrange of arctic ecosystems and that provides essential habitat for many \nspecies.\n  It is clear to me that drilling would not give us energy security and \nwould, in fact, carry huge environmental costs.\n  And this country does not even need this source of oil in order to \nreduce gas prices. The most effective way to reduce gas prices is to \nincrease fuel economy standards. In a 2001 report, the Congressional \nResearch Service wrote, according to the Energy Efficiency and \nRenewable Energy Fuel Equivalents to Potential Oil Production from the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR:\n\n       The Energy Information Administration (EIA) says that a \n     technology-driven projection for cars and light trucks could \n     increase fuel economy by 3.6 miles-per gallon by 2020. The \n     fuel economy improvement through the first 20 years would \n     generate average daily oil savings equivalent to four times \n     the low case and three-fourths of the high case projected for \n     ANWR oil production. Extended through 50 years, the fuel \n     economy savings would range from 10 times the low case to \n     more than double the high case for ANWR.\n\n  And that is an extremely modest assumption for the technology that \nexists today to increase fuel economy standards.\n  Imagine if we implemented a 30 percent increase in fuel economy \nstandards, which is technologically feasible, according to \nBusinessWeek, September 26, 2005.\n  If this Congress were serious about increasing our energy security, \nreducing our dependence on oil, and lowering gas prices, we would be \nworking on legislation that would increase fuel economy standards, not \ntrying to drill our way out of the problem as we are doing today.\n  We need to find real solutions to the problems of high energy prices, \nenergy security, and global warming. We should be encouraging energy \nefficiency, promoting the development of new and alternative fuels, and \nsupporting the invention and commercialization of new vehicle \ntechnologies. This provision accomplishes not even one of these goals.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting Senator Cantwell's \nmotion to strike the provision to open ANWR to drilling.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Cantwell to strike title IV of the bill before us, \nthe title that opens the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil \ndrilling. I do not support drilling in the refuge. But even if a \nSenator did, they should not support taking this action through the \nreconciliation process. It is inappropriate to make management \ndecisions regarding one of our Nation's largest and most ecologically \nimportant wildlife refuges in a fast-track, procedurally limited bill. \nDoing so restricts the ability of the Senate and the administration to \nensure that drilling is done in an environmentally sound way.\n  I have to agree with the ranking member of Energy Committee, Senator \nBingaman, who stated during the markup of this title, that this title \ndoes not just open the refuge to oil drilling, it also does so in the \nleast environmentally sensitive way possible. And, Mr. President, it \ndoes so in a manner that treats the Arctic Refuge differently than any \nother Federal lands or wildlife refuges.\n  Arctic Refuge drilling proponents repeatedly profess that oil \ndevelopment in the refuge would be done in an environmentally sensitive \nway. As the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I want to inform the Senate that title IV of this bill is \nactually riddled with clauses that weaken existing environmental \nstandards, exempt drilling from key rules, or otherwise allow oil \ndevelopment activities to sidestep environmental protection laws.\n  Let me list some of the more blatant examples for my colleagues. \nFirst, the title exempts parts of the proposed Arctic oil and gas \nleasing program from environmental review requirements. In particular, \nit declares that\n\n[[Page S12171]]\n\nthe Department of Interior's Environmental Impact Statement, EIS, \nprepared in 1987 satisfies the requirements of the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, NEPA, for preparation of the regulations that \nwill guide the leasing program. NEPA is supposed to ensure that public \nand Federal decision makers have the most recent, accurate information \nconcerning the environmental impacts of projects, but this clause seems \nto ensure the opposite. In fact, as long ago as 1991, in a case called \nNRDC v. Lujan, a Federal court found that due to new scientific \ninformation, Interior should have supplemented this very same 1987 EIS \nanalysis before recommending to Congress that it allow development on \nthe Coastal Plain.\n  In 2002, some 15 years after the 1987 EIS, the U.S. Geological Survey \nreleased a significant report detailing 12 years of study about the \npotential impacts of oil drilling on the wildlife of the Arctic Refuge. \nThis information can, and should be incorporated as the Interior \nDepartment's consideration of drilling.\n  Many now question whether the existing final legislative \nenvironmental impact statement, prepared in 1987 to comply with the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, is adequate to support development \nnow, or whether a Supplement or a new EIS should be prepared. As I \nmentioned, a court in a declaratory judgment action in 1991 held that \nthe Interior Department should have prepared a Supplemental \nEnvironmental Impact Statement, SEIS, at that time to encompass new \ninformation about the Coastal Plain. Therefore, without the language of \ntitle IV, it seems clear that either an SEIS or a new EIS would have to \nbe prepared before drilling could begin.\n  The bill before us states that the Congress finds the 1987 EIS \nadequate to satisfy the legal and procedural requirements of NEPA with \nrespect to the actions authorized to be taken by the Secretary of the \nInterior in developing and promulgating the regulations for the \nestablishment of the leasing program. This language explicitly \neliminates the need to redo or update the EIS for the leasing \nregulations.\n  There is no question that this language substantially weakens \nenvironmental review requirements. It significantly diminishes the \ncomprehensive analysis traditionally required by NEPA, by stating that \nthe Secretary of the Interior need consider only its preferred action \nand a single leasing alternative. The ``alternatives analysis,'' which \nis all but eliminated by this section of the bill, is the heart of \nNEPA. Senators supporting this provision should be fully aware that \nthese limitations strike at the core of our country's environmental \nreview process and requirements.\n  Further, this title undermines the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's \nauthority to impose conditions on leases. This title states that the \noil and gas leasing program is ``deemed to be compatible'' with the \npurposes of the Arctic Refuge. According to the Congressional Research \nService, this provision ``appears to eliminate the usual compatibility \ndetermination process for purposes of refuge management.'' CRS notes \nthat without the compatibility process, the authority of the Fish and \nWildlife Service to impose conditions on leases is called into \nquestion.\n  Mr. President, we can do better, and we should. Reconciliation \nconstrains the way in which Senators who are concerned about these \nissues, and who do not serve on the Energy Committee or the Budget \nCommittee, are able to address them on the floor.\n  I would caution all Members of the Senate who have committed to \nsupport Arctic drilling only in certain cases, or only if certain other \nlegislative or regulatory actions take place, to think seriously about \nwhether reconciliation serves their interests and their constituents' \ninterests. I would also caution all members, as Senators Bingaman and \nDurbin have done, that if this language remains in the bill, it opens \nthe door for further attempts through reconciliation to override the \nrequirements of environmental or any other law under the guise of \nensuring that we obtain revenue.\n  Finally, I oppose using reconciliation to open the Arctic Refuge \nCoastal Plain to oil drilling because I believe it is being used to \nlimit consideration of a controversial issue. The American people have \nstrongly held views on drilling in the refuge, and they want to know \nthat the Senate is working to pass legislation to manage the area \nappropriately in a forthright and open process. Senator Cantwell's \namendment is the best way to ensure that open process is followed, and \nI urge Senators to support her amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, once again, the Senate will vote on \nwhether to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. If it \npasses now, this may be the last time we vote on the issue. This may be \nthe last chance we have to save one of America's most pristine areas. \nSo, I want to talk about what our Nation will lose if we allow drilling \nto go forward.\n  In 1960, when President Eisenhower set aside 8.9 million acres to \nform the original Arctic Range, his Secretary of the Interior, Fred \nSeaton, noted that the area was ``one of the most magnificent wildlife \nand wilderness areas in North America . . . a wilderness experience not \nduplicated elsewhere.''\n  And the Coastal Plain, where oil drilling is proposed, is the area's \n``biological heart''--a crucial habitat for hundreds of species of \nanimals.\n  The Porcupine Caribou herd migrates through the Coastal Plain each \nyear, and--with a population of 130,000--it is the world's largest \ncaribou herd. Its 800-mile-long migration between Canada and the United \nStates is second only to the wildebeests of Africa. The Coastal Plain \nis the principal calving ground for the porcupine caribou, so they are \nespecially vulnerable to oil drilling.\n  The Arctic Refuge has the highest concentration of land polar bears \non Alaska's North Slope. Polar bears are particularly sensitive to oil \ndevelopment because they den in winter--exactly the time oil companies \nwant to drill.\n  Millions of migratory birds--over 130 species--journey thousands of \nmiles each spring to nest and feed in the wetlands on the Coastal \nPlain. The birds travel from six continents and every State in America.\n  Oil drilling--with its associated roads, pipelines, processing \nplants, airstrips, and other industrial facilities--would disturb these \nspecies' nesting and foraging habitats. The birds in the backyards and \nskies in every one of our States could become fewer and fewer in number \nif we disturb the area they have depended upon for millions of years.\n  Finally, I want to mention the muskox, which live year-round in the \nrefuge. Oil development would displace them from their preferred \nfeeding areas and would reduce calving rates.\n  Mr. President, this is one of America's--indeed, one of the world's--\nwilderness treasures. It is unique, pristine, and unspoiled.\n  Why would we risk that? We don't even get that much oil--6 months \nworth of oil--and not until 10 years from now.\n  But don't take my word for it--just look at the reaction from \nAmerica's oil companies. BP, Conoco-Philipps, and Chevron-Texaco have \nall pulled out of Arctic Power, the lobby group trying to open up the \nRefuge to drilling.\n  If the very companies that would put up the capital and resources do \nnot care about drilling in the Refuge, how can anyone argue that we \nwill be able to improve our oil supply?\n  If we were really concerned about energy security, we would require \nbetter replacement tires on cars, close the SUV loophole on fuel \neconomy standards, and increase those standards overall.\n  Closing the SUV loophole alone would save us, in 7 years, the same \namount of oil we would get from the Refuge. That is saving an Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge every 7 years. Let me put it another way. In \n20 years, we would save the equivalent amount of oil that we would get \nfrom three ANWRs.\n  Given that there is only about 6 months of oil in the Arctic Refuge \nand that the oil companies do not want to go there, what is this really \nall about?\n  I believe it is really about establishing a precedent for opening up \nother areas around the country to oil drilling.\n  That means off the coast of California, the Carolinas, and Florida. \nThat means in our national parks, the Rocky Mountains, and our \nwetlands.\n  Ever since the Senate voted to pave the way for oil drilling in the \nRefuge\n\n[[Page S12172]]\n\nback in March, this is exactly what we have seen--repeated attempts to \nallow drilling in areas previously off limits. If we can open an area \nas pristine, as unique, and as precious as the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, what couldn't be opened up?\n  And so I say to my colleagues, watch out: your backyard may be next.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Cantwell \namendment, which will protect the Refuge for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask how much time is left on each \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). There is 22 minutes 10 seconds \nfor the Senator from Washington and 4 minutes 21 seconds for the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Well, it is my understanding that one of my colleagues \nwants to offer an amendment that was part of the previous unanimous \nconsent agreement. I would ask unanimous consent, until they figure \nthat out, that time during a quorum call be equally divided between \nboth sides.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have only 4 minutes left.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am happy to debate whatever amendment. \nPart of the previous consideration was to have a debate on a related \namendment. I do not know where the Senator is in offering that \namendment. Do we have a time period in which he might--if I can inquire \nthrough the Chair, does the Senator who is controlling the time on the \nother side know when the Senator might be available to offer his \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would have no such knowledge.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I inquire of the Chair, does the \nSenator from Washington have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. She does.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Without jeopardizing her right to the floor, might I make \na parliamentary inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in terms of the time remaining, I think \nthe Senator from Washington, as I hear her question, is wondering about \nthe disposition of the Talent-Wyden amendment or the Wyden-Talent \namendment, however it is, that was previously reserved in the unanimous \nconsent agreement; was it not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The agreement acknowledged that \nthe Talent amendment would be offered but did not address a time \nagreement.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, I don't think that is correct. I think the Talent \nagreement was to be within the time to noon, to be considered within \nthat time. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, but not a specific amount \nwithin that period of time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Right. Mr. President, what is the time remaining on both \nsides at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 19\\1/2\\ minutes for the Senator from \nWashington--and time is running--and 4 minutes 20 seconds for the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So the time for the Talent amendment or the Talent-Wyden \namendment or the Wyden-Talent amendment would be controlled by the two \nsides who still have time remaining; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding of the \nagreement.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So it would depend on the Senator from Washington and the \nSenator from Alaska to relinquish time for the purposes of considering \nthe Talent-Wyden amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For yielding time for that purpose, that is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Are we still on the parliamentary inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We could enter into a time agreement now, could we not, \non the Wyden-Talent amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is my understanding, yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The current time agreement refers to a Talent amendment. \nI ask unanimous consent that be the Wyden-Talent amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Therefore, that is for the purpose of the Senator being \nable to yield time to Senator Wyden to start the process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I think my colleague from Oregon, who \nhas been a champion on this issue throughout the committee process, is \nprepared to call up the Wyden-Talent amendment and to speak on it at \nthis time.\n  How much time does the Senator from Oregon wish to have?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, would up to 5 minutes be acceptable?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Oregon 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 7 minutes.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2362\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cantwell for her excellent \nwork and concur with her remarks.\n  Mr. President, you cannot look the public in the eye and say you are \ngoing to drill in ANWR and then ship this oil to China or one of the \nhighest bidders around the world. That is, in my view, exactly what \nwould happen without the Wyden-Talent legislation that is going to be \noffered now.\n  Under the legislation, the Secretary could adopt oil lease terms that \nensure what is described as the receipt of fair market value. The \nlegislation does not make any mention whatsoever of what we have heard \nconstantly for months and months; and that is this is somehow supposed \nto reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign oil or increase our energy \nsecurity.\n  So what you would have is a situation where if the highest price is \nin South America, Arctic oil would go to South America; if the highest \nprice is in the Far East, Arctic oil would have to go to the Far East; \nand, certainly, given the insatiable demand for energy in China, I \nthink, with the dollar being weak, as sure as the night follows the \nday, without the Wyden-Talent amendment, this oil would end up going to \nthe highest bidder in the Far East, particularly the Chinese.\n  I do think this amendment is the very least the Senate can do to put \na Band-Aid on what I think is a fundamentally flawed decision. I hope, \nas colleagues look at this--we had the debate in the Energy Committee--\nthey get a sense of exactly what is involved.\n  With the inflated revenue projections of $2.4 billion from oil leases \nin the Arctic included in the budget, the Federal Government is going \nto be forced to sell the oil to the highest bidder to even come close \nto that amount. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that \nnet Federal proceeds, over a 10-year period, would be $2.6 billion, \nwith the initial royalties from production near the end of the decade. \nThe budget assumes nearly all of those revenues in the next 5 years \nalone.\n  So what that means is, if we are going to have any prospect of making \nsure this oil goes to the United States, we have to have this \nlegislation.\n  I also point out that the distinguished senior Senator from Oregon--\nwe still describe him as the senior Senator--Mark Hatfield, shared this \nposition for years. He was a supporter of the oil industry, but he \nsaid: By God, aren't we going to keep this oil here at home? Yet what \nwe heard in the Energy Committee is we are concerned about the \nMercantile Exchange, we are concerned about all kinds of questions \nabout trade law. This is not about the Mercantile Exchange. This is not \nabout trade law. This is about whether the pledge that has been made by \nsupporters, that this oil is going to stay in the United States, gets \nhonored.\n  I would like to tell my colleagues, particularly my good friend from \nAlaska, who said, ``Oh, it is a sure bet this oil will stay in the \nUnited States,'' that I specifically asked--I have the transcript with \nme--executives from BP, when they came to the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, whether they would make a commitment to keep Alaskan oil in \nthe United States. According to the official Senate transcript that I \nhave, they would not make that commitment. That is why this legislation \nis needed. To allow\n\n[[Page S12173]]\n\ndrilling, and then shipping it overseas, in my view, is a case of two \nwrongs making a colossal wrong.\n  So I hope the Senate now will accept this amendment. In my view, it \nis the very least that can be done to address the needs of consumers in \nour country.\n  I thank my friend from Missouri, who contacted me about his interest \nin this issue. With supporters of oil drilling claiming oil is needed \nto reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign oil, we ought to recognize \nthat in this Senate budget reconciliation bill we are not increasing \nU.S. energy security by one drop of oil--not one drop of oil--unless we \nhave the assurance that this amendment provides that the oil would stay \nin the United States.\n  I thank my colleague from Washington State for giving me this time. I \nappreciate the cooperation of the Senator from Missouri, who I think is \nprepared to speak at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, let me make a parliamentary inquiry. How \nmuch time do I have now?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator such time as he \nrequires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 46 seconds.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, that is the time remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I understand we are under time \nconstraints, and I will be brief.\n  I think the Senator from Oregon has made the case very persuasively. \nI congratulate him for raising this important issue in committee. I was \nconcerned that if we attached this provision in committee, it might \nsubject the whole provision relating to the ANWR part of the bill to a \nbudget point of order, and I did not want to imperil that part of the \nbill.\n  As I said before, when I spoke on the Senate floor, I simply do not \nsee any reason why we should cut ourselves off from accessing oil in \nour own country. But I think the Senator's amendment, and my amendment, \nis a natural supplement to the underlying purpose of exploring for oil \nin the Arctic. It is to increase our national security. It is to lower \nprices in the United States. It is to make certain we have access to \noil when we need it.\n  In order to do that, I think we have to be certain that the oil does \nnot go on the world market but, rather, is reserved for the needs of \nthe United States.\n  Not only is this right economically because, as the Senator said, it \nis important, if we are going to meet the budget targets in this bill, \nthat we have access to this oil here in the United States, it is also \nvery important as a hedge against foreign boycotts or threats or oil \nblackmail that somebody may want to use against the United States. The \nSenator is correct, this is not something the oil companies are going \nto like, but this is something that is in the interest of the national \nsecurity of the United States. I am grateful to him for bringing \nforward this idea and happy to support him in it and grateful also to \nthe bill managers for their attitude toward it.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 8 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I state for the record, we are prepared \nto accept this amendment, provided it waives the Byrd rule for further \nconsideration by the Senate and also waives the Byrd rule as applied \nonly to this amendment in a conference report when it returns to the \nSenate.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to inform colleagues, I will not be \nable to agree to such a unanimous consent request. I want everybody to \nknow we will not be able to agree to waive this throughout the process. \nWe might agree to waive it for Senate consideration, but we would have \nno assurance this would not be altered. There is no way to guarantee it \nmight not be altered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me finish. Then I would be happy to yield. There is \nno way to assure that other provisions might be added, and so we cannot \nagree to eliminating points of order through the whole process.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for an inquiry, \nwe are prepared to accept the amendment which specifically says the \nByrd rule is waived for this amendment only, and this amendment, if \ntotally unchanged, as it returns from the conference, but only this. \nBut I am informed that--and I inform the Senator--if this goes to \nconference, any Senator could raise the Byrd rule against the whole \nreport if it remains in there, unless we also waive it as to this \nsection.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me say that the problem, my counsel informs me, is \nother provisions could affect this one and I cannot agree to waive all \nbudget points of order throughout the whole process on this amendment.\n  We can conclude debate on this issue right now, and we are not going \nto vote on it until later. So maybe there is time to work through this. \nI want to make it clear. I have been informed by counsel I could not \nagree to a waiver at this point.\n  Mr. TALENT. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. TALENT. As always, the Senator speaks with candor, and I very \nmuch appreciate that. I want to hone in on the last point the Senator \nmade. We are not voting on this now, and we don't have to consider it \nnow. If we can keep an open mind to see if there is some way we can \nwork this out in the meantime, I am sure the Senator from Oregon feels \nthe same way. I understand entirely his reservations.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Has the amendment been filed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not been proposed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, must it be filed now to comply with the \nexisting time agreement?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I call up the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], for himself and Mr. \n     Talent, proposes an amendment numbered 2362 to the language \n     proposed to be stricken by amendment No. 2358.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue \nreading the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk continued the reading of the amendment:\n\n   (Purpose: To enhance the energy security of the United States by \nprohibiting the exportation of oil and gas produced under leases in the \n                    Arctic National Wildlife Refuge)\n\n       At the end of section 401, add the following:\n       (h) Prohibition on Exports.--An oil or gas lease issued \n     under this title shall prohibit the exportation of oil or gas \n     produced under the lease.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry: Can that amendment be amended \nlater, if it is left alone right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is an amendment to the language \nproposed to be stricken. As such, it is a first-degree amendment \nsubject to a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thought we had a time agreement to ban second-degree \namendments.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is not correct. There is no ban on second-degree \namendments. This second-degree amendment specifically provided for it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Another parliamentary inquiry: Is that amendment subject \nto a Byrd rule point of order now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this point the Chair is not aware of any \nreason why this amendment would violate the Byrd rule.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I didn't hear the Chair. Yes or no?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this point there is no violation. The Chair \ndoesn't see a violation at this point with this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Further parliamentary inquiry: If that is adopted and \nbrought back in the conference report, it would be subject to the same \nconsideration?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would be subject to the same consideration, \nbut there have been no arguments made to the Chair for or against a \nviolation of the Byrd rule.\n\n[[Page S12174]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Another parliamentary inquiry: That is an amendment to \nthe Cantwell amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is an amendment to the section of the bill \nproposed to be stricken by the Cantwell amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is an amendment to the provisions in the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Has the Parliamentarian made an actual ruling with \nrespect to the Byrd rule?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I want to make clear to my colleagues, what I hear \nhappening and what I think colleagues may think just happened may be \ntwo very different things. As I understand it, the Parliamentarian has \nnot made a ruling or a determination on this matter at this moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is it possible to pose a question through \nthe Chair to the Parliamentarian as to whether, if adopted, it would be \nsubject to the point of order under the Byrd rule?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Once it is adopted to the bill, it is not \nsubject to a point of order, when contained in the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I seem to be hearing that it is because of the condition \nof the bill right now, that the time has not expired, et cetera. Is the \nParliamentarian ruling because of the time situation or giving us an \nactual ruling now on application of the Byrd rule to this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is reserving a decision on the \nmerits of the Byrd rule as applied to this amendment because no such \nargument has been made.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. In part, the question of the Byrd rule violation here \nwould turn on the question of whether this scored; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is part of the analysis.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And that part of the analysis has not yet been done, I \nassume, in terms of the Parliamentarian making a final determination. \nHe has not had the evidence put before him; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So in terms of making a decision, the Parliamentarian \nsimply does not have all the information before him to make a judgment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 48 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will use 30 seconds.\n  I intend to raise a point of order against this amendment unless it \nis clearly ruled at the time the vote takes place that the Byrd rule \nwill not apply to this amendment here on the floor of the Senate now, \nduring consideration of this bill, or when the bill comes back as a \nconference report.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes 40 seconds for the Senator \nfrom Washington; 1 minute 28 seconds for the Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Is the Wyden amendment the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Wyden amendment is \npending.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, does the Senator from Oregon wish more \ntime?\n  Mr. WYDEN. No.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I will make a couple of comments in closing as we sort \nout the last on the Wyden-Talent amendment. This budget reconciliation \nact, as it stands now, without the Cantwell amendment striking the ANWR \nlanguage, is a false promise to the American people. It is a false \npromise that they are going to have cheaper gas prices now or \nsignificantly cheaper gas prices in the future. It is a false promise \non the amount of revenue that is going to be raised in the budget. It \nis a false promise that somehow this can be done in an environmentally \nsensitive way and that the area we have called for so long the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge can be preserved as it is. It is a set of \nfalse promises, and the American people deserve better. They know this \nis a time in which our country should be making serious plans to \ndiversify our overdependence on fossil fuel and change, and they \ncertainly don't want environmental considerations that have been long \nthe standard for oil drilling in America to be tossed aside by a budget \nresolution.\n\n  They certainly don't want the fact that there have been, as one \norganization, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation said, \n405 spills annually in the North Slope since 1996. They don't want to \ncontinue the trend in Prudhoe Bay and other Trans-Alaska Pipeline areas \nof causing 4,532 spills since 1996. The American people want to have \nresponsible production moving forward that meets the standards that \nproduction in America has lived by. That is, by the same standards of \nthe National Environmental Protection Act, judicial review, fish and \nwildlife, transportation issues, compatibility issue, protection of \nindigenous rights. They don't want a backdoor gimmick into helping the \noil companies, who have already been making record profits, continue to \nmake record profits on something that is going to offer very little for \nthe American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Cantwell amendment and to support \nthe Wyden amendment when it comes up so we can be true to this issue \nand say we don't want to drill in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge as a way \nto get out of our problems. We want to make an investment in the right \nprocess and have oil companies live by the environmental standards they \nare required to today.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If neither side yields time, time will be charged evenly between both \nsides.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Parliamentary inquiry: How much time remains on this \namendment now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Washington \nhas 58 seconds. The Senator from Alaska has 1 minute 28 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Time is running evenly at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Chair has informed us the Senator from Alaska has 1 \nminute 28 seconds remaining. The Senator from Washington has 58 seconds \nremaining. Right now they are charging the time equally.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am prepared to yield back the balance of our time if \nthe Senator is. I yield back the balance of my time conditioned on the \nSenator yielding back the balance of her time.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, at this time we will move to the \namendment offered by Senator Grassley and Senator Dorgan. Hopefully \nthey will both be here in short order to get that one started.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator withhold for a moment?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will withhold that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I think it might be useful for the \npurposes of informing our colleagues where we are now. We have \ncompleted the debate on the ANWR issue. We now go to the Grassley-\nDorgan amendment that is on payment limitations. We will then go to the \nBingaman amendment on the subject of FMAP. We will then go to the Byrd \namendment from 2 to 3 on the issue of visa reform. We will then go to \nthe Lott-Lautenberg amendment on Amtrak; that is from 3 to 3:30. From \n3:30 to 4:15, we will be on the McCain amendment; from 4:15 to 5 on the \nMurray amendment on dual eligibles; then an Ensign amendment on DTV \nfrom 5 to 5:30; then the Landrieu amendment or an amendment that I\n\n[[Page S12175]]\n\nmight designate from 5:30 to 6. That uses up all of the time.\n  If we could alert colleagues, we have a very restricted schedule. \nThese are the only amendments we could schedule time for and get \nunanimous consent. We apologize to our colleagues who wanted additional \nopportunities to offer amendments. It simply was not possible given the \nvery tight time limitations of reconciliation and given the events of \nyesterday.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Harkin, Obama, and Mikulski be \nadded as cosponsors to my pay-go amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2359\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator have an amendment he wishes \nto call up at this time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, the amendment by Grassley, Dorgan, Enzi, Harkin, \nHagel, Thune, Johnson, Brownback, and Feingold. It is the amendment on \npayment limits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself and Mr. \n     Dorgan, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n     Brownback, and Mr. Thune, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2359.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, since we are talking about farm \npayments and since I am involved in agriculture, I want to be totally \ntransparent that on the side I am a family farmer, I have income from \nthat farm, and I crop share with my farmer son Robin Grassley. We don't \nhire labor. So whatever farm payments go with our crops, I receive 50 \npercent of those farm payments from the Federal farm program.\n  This amendment is about the family farmer. Farm programs are not just \nabout the 2 percent of Americans who farm for a living. Farm programs \nare about several things, but, most importantly, they are about \nnational security because Napoleon said ``an army marches on its \nbelly,'' so obviously a secure food supply is very important for our \nnational security.\n  Second but not often said, it is about the social stability of our \nNation because any society is only nine meals away from a revolution, \nso a certain food supply has something to do with the stable society of \nany country.\n  The American people recognize the importance of the family farmer to \nour Nation and the need to provide an adequate safety net for family \nfarmers. That is why we have had a farm program for 70 years. In recent \nyears, however, these farm payments have come under increasing \nscrutiny, particularly from people who do not understand agriculture. \nAnd when you spend the taxpayers' money, there is nothing wrong with \nscrutiny. Critics of farm programs have argued that the largest \ncorporate farms reap most of the benefits of these payments.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, might I inquire through the Chair if the \nSenator would allow an interruption for a unanimous consent request \nwith respect to who controls the time in opposition?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I very much appreciate that.\n  Madam President, I would like to yield 45 minutes, the time in \nopposition, to the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, for his \ncontrol.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank very much the Senator from Iowa for yielding.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That brings up a situation I wasn't aware of. I thought \nwe had an hour equally divided. There was 45 minutes there, so do we \nhave 1\\1/2\\ hours and I have 45 minutes on my side?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Would the Senator like to reduce that to an hour?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No, at least not right now. Maybe later.\n  Madam President, I still would stay within my 15 minutes because I \ndon't want to use floor time that other Members might want to use.\n  But anyway, farm payments have come under increasing scrutiny, and \nthat is legitimate because we are spending taxpayers' money. Critics of \nfarm payments have argued that the largest corporate farms reap most of \nbenefits from these payments. What is more, farm payments that were \noriginally designed to benefit small and medium-sized family farmers \nhave contributed to the demise of those smaller farmers as well because \nunlimited farm payments have placed upward pressure on land prices and \ncash trends and have contributed to overproduction and lower commodity \nprices, driving many family farmers off the farm.\n  The law creates a system that is out of balance. This is pointed out \nin this first chart I have here that basically indicates--and you can \nlook at the different lines, but the bottom line is the one I most \noften use--10 percent of the largest farmers in America get 72 percent \nof the benefits that we appropriate to help family farmers with their \nsafety nets. I have to ask: How long are city taxpayers going to \nsupport a farm program for family farmers when 10 percent of the \nbiggest farmers are getting 72 percent of the benefits? That is \nsomething we in rural America need to be thinking about when we are \nanticipating just 2 years from now--less than 2 years--having a debate \non the renewal of the 2007 farm bill. Are we going to be able to \nmaintain support in the urban-dominated House of Representatives for a \nfarm safety net when 10 percent of the biggest farmers in America are \ngetting 72 percent of the benefits?\n  I believe we need to correct our course and modify the farm programs \nbefore those programs cause further concentration and consolidation in \nagriculture. Today, most commodities are valued off demand. Markets \ndictate profitability. When farmers overproduce by expanding rapidly \nbecause of the impact of Government farm payments, then markets are not \nfunctioning. Federal farm programs are influencing even land prices \nacross the country. Iowa land is selling between $4,000 and $5,000 an \nacre in counties surrounding my home at New Hartford, IA.\n  This amendment will revitalize the farm economy for young people \nacross the country by making land prices and cash trends more \naffordable, and that is going to be most important if we are going to \nrevitalize American agriculture by getting young people in it when you \nconsider today the average age of a family farmer is 50 years.\n  My amendment will put a hard cap on farm payments at $250,000. That \nis the same as what is in the President's budget, meaning the \nRepublican President's budget, meaning Republican President Bush's \nbudget. This will take it down from the current payment, $360,000, that \nis allowed under existing law, under the 2002 farm bill.\n  Just to remind everybody, I voted against the conference report on \nthe 2002 farm bill, and the lack of farm payments, of responsible hard \ncaps was the reason that I did. I worked back then with Senator Dorgan, \nwho is the main sponsor of this amendment, on a similar measure in \n2002, and it passed by a bipartisan, bipartisan support of 66 to 31. \nThe amendment, of course, was taken out in conference.\n  One section that was added in the 2002 farm bill set up the \nCommission on the Application of Payment Limitations. This was a \nsubstitute for the fact that we didn't get payment limitations; we are \ngoing to have a commission study it. This study concluded that payment \nlimitations affect the largest producers and these producers generally \nhave lower per-unit production costs than other producers. But the \nstudy also says smaller, less efficient producers may be able to expand \nproduction and become more efficient under further payment limitations.\n  Congress enacted in 1987 the Agricultural Reconciliation Act, more \noften\n\n[[Page S12176]]\n\nreferred to as the Farm Program Integrity Act, to establish eligibility \nconditions that are not being abided by today for recipients and to \nensure that only entities actively engaged in farming receive payments. \nTo be considered actively engaged in farming, this act requires an \nindividual or entity to provide a significant contribution of inputs--\ncapital, land, equipment, labor--as well as significant contributions \nof services, particularly labor, or active management to the farming \noperation. But people have been able to find loopholes around this act, \nand that has facilitated these huge payments that go beyond the limits \nthat are in law today.\n  Last year, I held a hearing through the Finance Committee on the GAO \nreport that was released April of 2004. The GAO report recommended that \nmeasurable standards and clarified regulations would better assure that \npeople who receive payments are actively engaged in farming. Of course, \nour USDA under both Republicans and Democrats does not want to write \nthese regulations, does not want to enforce them, and that is why we \nhave this legal subterfuge of getting around the payment limitations \nthat are higher but would be effective, and I wouldn't be arguing with \nthem if they were.\n  Of the $17 billion in payments that the USDA distributed to \nrecipients in 2002, $5.9 billion went to just 149,000 entities. \nCorporations and general partnerships represented 39 percent and 26 \npercent of these entities.\n  I want my colleagues to look at another chart from the Washington \nPost of March of this year:\n\n       If the purpose of the farm subsidies is to make family \n     farms viable, it's hard to see why payments of more than \n     $400,000 apiece should have gone to 54 deceased farmers \n     between 1995 and 2003, or why the residents in Chicago should \n     have collected $24 million in farm support over that period.\n\n  This type of arrangement, and others like it, raise questions about \nthe interpretation and enforcement of the 1987 act that requires each \npartner be, according to the law, actively engaged in farming.\n  This is why I wrote the General Accounting Office to conduct a study. \nI encourage Members of this body to look at that report.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate went on record supporting a reform of \nFederal farm subsidies.\n  During the markup of the Senate budget resolution, I was able, with \nthe ranking member of the committee, Senator Conrad, to include a \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment expressing support for stronger farm \npayment limits; hence, this amendment. That amendment passed the Senate \nBudget Committee 15 to 7.\n  The committee agreed that any reconciled mandatory agriculture \nsavings required under the resolution should be achieved through \nmodifications to the payment limitation provisions of the 2002 farm \nbill.\n  The budget resolution also instructed Congress to find $3 billion in \nsavings over 5 years in agricultural programs. I supported that \nresolution coming out of committee without offering my amendment in \ncommittee because we have a responsibility to support the chairman in \nmoving the budget resolution along. In the Agriculture Committee, it \nwas bipartisan. These savings consisted of cutting commodity programs, \nand we achieved the $3 billion savings.\n  The proposed amendment before the Senate would cap farm commodity \nfarm program payments at $250,000 a year. This would encompass direct \npayments, countercyclical payments, loan deficiency payments, and \nmarketing loan gains. Gains from commodity certificates would be \ncounted toward the limitation, closing another abusive loophole.\n  By tightening up loopholes, this amendment would save $1.1 billion in \nsavings over 5 years. With these savings, the Grassley-Dorgan amendment \nwould restore 50 percent of the CRP acres cut by the committee and \nrestore up to 75 percent of the Conservation Security Program money \nthat was cut during the Agriculture Committee markup of reconciliation.\n  These savings will allow us also to prevent a 2-percent reduction in \nacross-the-board commodity cuts that this resolution before us calls \nfor in the 2006 crop year.\n  Obviously, with all the increased costs of energy, farming, and \neverything else, we ought to do what we can to strengthen the safety \nnet and not weaken it. This would help prevent that 2.5-percent cut in \nfarm programs.\n  Not only has the Senate agreed to some type of payment limit reform \nin the past, but the President in his budget, as I said, included this \n$250,000 cap.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture recently at the Commodity Club luncheon \non October 6 said he has heard from producers all over the country. I \nattended such a forum at the Iowa State Fair, and I understand the type \nof feedback he received.\n  The concerns that have been expressed to the Secretary of Agriculture \nare that farm payments have been causing an increase in land values and \nthe greatest benefits going to the largest farmers.\n  I have been hearing directly from producers for years exactly what \nthe Secretary is hearing at his farm bill forums. We are hearing that \nyoung producers are unable to carry on the tradition of farming because \nthey are financially unable to do so because of high land values, high \nland prices, and cash rent.\n  Neil Harl, a distinguished agriculture economist, now retired, from \nIowa State University and one of the contributors to the commission \nreport I referred to, has come out with another report. Dr. Harl's \nstatement says:\n\n       The evidence is convincing that a significant portion of \n     the subsidies is being bid into cash rents and capitalized \n     into land values.\n\n  If investors were to expect less Federal funding or not at all, land \nvalues would likely decline, perhaps as much as 25 percent.\n  I have a number of editorials supporting my position. The third one I \nput up comes from the Des Moines Register. Again, it refers to \nresponsibilities I have as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \nassuming I can control every committee in the Senate, and I am willing \nto inform the Des Moines Register that no Senator who is chairman of \nthe Finance Committee does. They said, in regard to me as chairman of \nthe Finance Committee and Congressman Nussel as chairman of the House \nBudget Committee:\n\n       Both could make a difference for Iowa's farmers and rural \n     communities by steering adoption of payment limitations for \n     farm subsidies. Nearly three-fourths of Federal farm payments \n     go to 10 percent of the farms.\n\n  A fourth editorial is from a newspaper that the chairman of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, I know, respects very well, the Atlanta \nJournal-Constitution. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution says:\n\n       As time has gone by, smaller farmers most in need have \n     received less and less of government's support and corporate-\n     like farms more and more.\n\n  Their arguments for payment limitations.\n  By voting in favor of this amendment, we can restore the cuts that \nhave been made to the commodity and conservation programs and lessen \nGovernment support to corporate farmers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask for 15 seconds.\n  We can restore what we cut to family farmers in the resolution. We \ncan allow young farmers to get into farming and lessen dependence on \nFederal subsidies. I hope my colleagues will support this commonsense \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time. I ask people \nwho want to speak in support of the amendment to please come to the \nfloor so we can expedite this debate.\n  I might say that I have all sorts of respect for the Senator from \nGeorgia. He is a tough competitor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I don't take that as a sign of \nweakness, but I appreciate the comment from my fellow Senator from the \ngreat State of Iowa who, like myself, comes from a strong agriculture \nproduction State. I will have a little bit more to say about that in a \nminute.\n\n  Madam President, I rise today to make a few remarks, first, about S. \n1932, the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005, that is \nbeing considered by the Senate this week.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this bill would reduce \nmandatory spending by a total of $39 billion over 5 years as compared \nto current\n\n[[Page S12177]]\n\nlaw. As chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I know very well \nthat restraining the growth of Federal spending is a very challenging \ntask. It is a difficult job that most Senators, including myself, would \nprefer we not tackle, yet we must tackle. We must reduce growth of \nmandatory spending to get the deficit under control because that is \nincreasingly where the bulk of Federal spending occurs.\n  This is the first bill in 8 years that reduces the growth of such \nspending. Most importantly, this bill achieves these savings mainly by \nreforming mandatory programs rather than cutting benefits to low-income \nindividuals families.\n  The fiscal year 2006 budget resolution instructed the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry to reduce outlays by $173 million \nin fiscal year 2006 and by $3 billion over the 5 years covering the \nfiscal years 2006 through 2010 within mandatory spending programs under \nthe committee's jurisdiction.\n  CBO estimates that title I of this bill reduces mandatory outlays in \nthe Agriculture Committee's programs by $196 million in fiscal year \n2006 and $3.014 billion over 5 years.\n  The fiscal year 2006 savings amount is actually $23 million more than \nour instruction for that year, and the 5-year savings is $14 million \nhigher than the committee's instruction.\n  As a result, title I of the bill fully complies with the Agriculture \nCommittee's reconciliation instruction under the fiscal year 2006 \nbudget resolution.\n  Title I of the bill reflects the thoughts and suggestions of a broad \narray of agriculture conservation and nutrition groups, all of whom \ncare deeply about the Agriculture Committee's mandatory spending \nprograms. The Congress worked hard to write a farm bill in 2002. This \ntitle achieved savings from the farm commodity programs, but does so in \na way that leaves the structure of farm programs unchanged. The title \nachieves savings in our conservation programs, but it does this in a \nway that does not impact existing multiyear contracts in any program. \nThe title achieves modest savings in our research programs, but it does \nthis in a way that allows the basic structure to remain intact and \nrecognizes past funding levels.\n  Also, importantly, the title preserves budgetary resources for the \nupcoming 2007 farm bill debate generally suspending spending reductions \nin fiscal year 2011. None of the outlay savings in the Agriculture \nCommittee's title of the bill comes from the Food Stamp Program, \ndespite the fact that this program accounts for nearly half of the \nmandatory spending in the committee's jurisdiction.\n  I have heard concerns about achieving savings from the Food Stamp \nProgram from Senators on the Agriculture Committee, off the Agriculture \nCommittee, and from Senators on both sides of the aisle, and we \nreacted.\n  My view is that the Food Stamp Program supports poor and low-income \nfamilies trying to put food on the table and helps farmers by \nincreasing the food purchasing power of those families. It is a win-win \nprogram for American agriculture and for America.\n  As we move forward in the reconciliation process, I intend to oppose \nattempts to make any substantial cuts in the funding to the Food Stamp \nProgram. I have made that very clear from day one, and I continue to \nmaintain that position today.\n  While I support the reconciliation bill, I would like Senators and \nothers to know that we plan to work, hopefully in a bipartisan manner, \nto provide disaster assistance to farmers and ranchers and others in \nneed of separate legislation in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \nand other adverse weather events.\n  In the aftermath of these dramatic events, farmers are struggling \nwith production losses, sharply higher energy prices, and lower farm \nprices. I will oppose amendments that attempt to address disaster \nassistance for agriculture in this bill.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will support this bill and, in \nparticular, will not seek to make any changes in the provisions of \ntitle I.\n  I adamantly oppose any amendments that will change farm policy. We \nmade a contract with our farmers in the 2002 farm bill, and we, as \nlegislators, have an obligation to honor that contract that we made \nwith our farmers in 2002. We owe it to our farmers that the structure \nof this farm bill does not change until 2007, when reauthorization will \nbe considered in Congress.\n  My colleagues need to understand that if we have to redebate major \nprovisions of the farm bill every time we engage in a budget \nreconciliation process, then we will rapidly reach a point where it \nwill be impossible to gain needed support from U.S. agriculture.\n  I reiterate that under the circumstances of the current deficit, I do \nnot relish making these spending reductions, but I believe that we owe \nit to the American people to help reduce the growth of mandatory \nspending.\n  With respect to the amendment offered by Senator Grassley, my goal in \ncrafting the agriculture title of this reconciliation bill was to trim \nspending of agriculture programs rather than make sweeping policy \nchanges. Senator Grassley's amendment makes significant policy changes. \nThis debate should occur during reauthorization of the next farm bill. \nIt is a complex issue that deserves thorough discussion when all of our \nfarm policies are reviewed in 2007, not on the Senate floor during \nbudget reconciliation.\n  Let me first say that the chart that Senator Grassley put up I have \nno doubt is correct, when he says that 10 percent of the farmers in \nthis country received 72 percent of all payments. The fact of the \nmatter is, 10 percent of the farmers in this country produce more than \n72 percent of the products that come off the farm. It is not surprising \nthat the folks who produce crops are the farmers who are getting \nGovernment payments. That is what farm policy--good farm policy--is all \nabout. Poor farm policy will provide payments to those folks who are \nnot producing. But we have a good farm policy in place today.\n  The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 authorized a \ncommission on payment limitations for agriculture. This has been \nalluded to by Senator Grassley in his comments.\n\n  The purpose of the Commission was to conduct a study on the potential \nimpact of further payment limitations on direct payments, \ncountercyclical payments, marketing assistance loan benefits on farm \nincome, land values, rural communities, agribusiness infrastructure, \nplanning decisions of producers affected, and supply and prices of \ncovered and other agricultural commodities. This is a very broad array \nof issues which was to be looked at by this Commission.\n  Here is the first recommendation that the Commission stated, the \nCommission that Senator Grassley previously alluded to:\n\n       The 2002 farm bill establishes farm payment programs \n     including payment limits through the 2007 crop year. While \n     farm bills can be changed, their multiyear nature provides \n     stability for production agriculture. Producers, their \n     lenders and other agribusiness firms make long-term \n     investment decisions based on this multiyear legislation. \n     Consequently, if substantial changes are to be made in \n     payment limits, payment eligibility criteria, or regulations \n     administering payment limits, such changes should be part of \n     the reauthorization in the next farm bill.\n\n  Basically what the Commission that Senator Grassley alluded to is \nsaying is in 2002 we entered into a contract with farmers all across \nAmerica--in Iowa, in Georgia, in Arkansas, in California--wherever they \nmay be. Based upon the contract this body agreed to with farmers across \nAmerica, those farmers went to their bankers, to their equipment \nmanufacturers or retailers, to any number of other individuals who own \nland, they entered into rent agreements, they entered into loan \nagreements and long-term purchase agreements for farm equipment.\n  I might mention, farm equipment today, whether it is in Iowa or \nGeorgia, is not cheap. A cotton picker in Georgia costs about $250,000. \nI am sure a soybean combine costs just about that much also, even \nthough you can use it for corn and, by changing heads, other \ncommodities such as wheat. A cotton picker can be used for one thing, \nand that is to pick cotton.\n  But we made a contract with those farmers, and they, in turn, made \nobligations with other individuals based upon the contract we had given \nthem. Now some of my colleagues want to go back and reopen the farm \nbill and have the debate which we had in 2002, the last time there was \na vote on the Senate floor. The House has not taken up\n\n[[Page S12178]]\n\nthis issue. The House understands what the obligation of their body is. \nBut here we are, trying to reopen this bill one more time.\n  Let me tell you specifically what farmers are going to be faced with \nif this amendment should pass. Senator Grassley refers to the fact that \nhe is reducing payment limit caps from $360,000 down to $250,000 per \nyear. That is right. That is a debate that we had during consideration \nof the 2002 farm bill. It is an issue we will debate again in 2007. In \nfact, because of comments from Senator Grassley as well as others who \nfeel strongly about this, we reduced the caps in the 2002 farm bill \nfrom $450,000 in the 1996 farm bill down to $360,000; we reduced it by \n$90,000. We will have that debate in 2007. That is the time to argue \nfor lower payment limits.\n  In addition to that, the lower payment limits that are provided in \nthis amendment will reduce direct payments from their current level of \n$40,000 down to $20,000. So whether you are an Iowa corn farmer or you \nare a Georgia peanut farmer or a California cotton farmer, your direct \npayments are going to be cut in half in the middle of the stream, even \nthough you have made commitments out there which you are going to have \nto honor. You signed notes with your banker, with John Deere, AGCO or \nwhoever it might be, to purchase equipment. Your direct payments are \ngoing to be cut in half.\n  Let me tell you exactly how that works. Last year, there were $12.5 \nbillion in farm payments made. Guess where 10 percent or $1.3 billion \nof those farm payments went. It went to the State of Iowa, to farmers \nin Iowa, because they had a tough year last year. Because of the high \nyields of corn, the price dropped significantly, and under the \ncountercyclical programs, Iowa farmers got 10 percent of all payments.\n  Under the rationale Senator Grassley has put up on this chart here, \nthat this is unfair because 10 percent of the farmers get 72 percent of \nthe payments--10 percent of the payments went to one State. Do I think \nthat is unfair? Absolutely not. Because that is the way the farm bill \nwas designed.\n  When Iowa farmers have it tough, we have an obligation to extend a \nhelping hand to them. When folks in Georgia have a tough time in \nagriculture, or in Arkansas or in Texas, we have an obligation to \nextend a helping hand.\n  When times are good, yields are good and prices are good, farm \npayments are very low. In fact, when the 2002 farm bill was passed, \nthere was a lot of criticism coming from the same newspaper editorials \nto which Senator Grassley just alluded. One of them is in my State. I \nwear any negative editorial from the Atlanta Constitution as a badge of \nhonor because they are anti any major industry in our State, including \nthe No. 1 industry, which is agriculture.\n  In the 2002 farm bill, we established good policy for the \ncountercyclical payments to be made in those tough years. It was \nprojected by CBO that we would spend $52 billion over the first 3 years \nof the farm bill, and that is the figure that was continually alluded \nto by editorials and those who were critics of the farm bill--not \nnecessarily for the first 3 years, but that was a provision in the farm \nbill that was the most criticized.\n  The fact is, even though it was projected that we would spend $52 \nbillion, we had good yields and good prices all across farm country, \nand our farmers and ranchers only received $37 billion. So we had \nsavings of $15 billion. Have you seen any of these editorials from \nthese newspapers saying thank you to the American farmer and the \nAmerican rancher for saving us $15 billion? Absolutely not. But here \nagain we are, in spite of the fact that we have had these savings, we \nare coming back now and saying: Sorry guys, we want to dip into your \npocket a little bit more. We want to change your program, irrespective \nof what commitments you have made, and we are going to change your farm \nprogram and we are going to change your farm bill in midstream instead \nof letting it run through 2006 and 2007 and renegotiate the farm bill \nin 2007 as we are required to do right now.\n\n  I have strong objections to this amendment, not just because I think \ngood agricultural policy is going to be affected by this, because I as \na Member of the Senate do not think it is fair to look American farmers \nand ranchers in the eye and say: Look, I know we made a commitment to \nyou, but sorry, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to change the way we \ndo business. We are not going to honor the commitment we made to you.\n  That is wrong. It is wrong for America, and it is certainly wrong for \nAmerican agriculture.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Will the Senator yield time to me?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I am happy to yield as much time as he may consume to \nSenator Cochran, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Let me congratulate the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia for his leadership in our committee as the chairman of the \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee in bringing to the \nSenate a section of this reconciliation bill that contains changes in \ncurrent law that will help achieve the goals of the Budget Act. I hope \nwe will not be sidetracked now by an amendment that suggests that there \nis a better way to do what we have already done. In fact, to approve \nthe amendment offered by my good friend from Iowa would reinvade and \nurge the Senate to reconsider a farm bill that was passed 3 years ago. \nIt has a life of 5 years. It is the framework for decisions that are \nmade on farms all over America about what to plant and how to arrange \nfinancing, and these plans are made in advance. You cannot just change \nthe rules from one year to the next and expect to have a dependable \nsource of revenue to sustain an economy, a farm economy that is so \nimportant to our Nation.\n  This issue of payment limitations was debated fully during \nconsideration of the farm bill 3 years ago. Payment limitations were \nincluded in that bill. It is now the law of the land. Farm plans, \nincluding planting decisions and financing decisions, have been made in \nreliance on that law. The payment limit structure within the law is a \nprovision that was fully discussed and incorporated after careful \ndeliberation. This proposal to change that law in the name of \nreconciliation under the Budget Act undermines the objectives of the \nCongress to provide a stable and predictable farm policy. The payment \nlimit amendment offered by my friend will have a serious and adverse \neffect on farmers in Southern States in particular.\n  Farmers in my State are suffering from the consequences of Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita. Add to that the record-high energy prices, and you \nhave a recipe for total disaster. This amendment would be a fatal blow \nto an already beleaguered sector of our State's economy. This is not \nthe time to make such a significant change in agriculture policy.\n  Incidentally, the World Trade Organization Doha Round in Hong Kong \nthis December might result in the need to restructure U.S. farm policy. \nBut the appropriate time to consider possible changes resulting from \ninternational trade agreements will be when we debate the next farm \nbill, which will be 2 years from now.\n  I urge Senators to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I hope it is not wrong for me to say \nwho wants to speak. Senator Harkin wanted 10 minutes, and Senator \nDorgan wanted me to save him 10 minutes. I urge they or anybody else \nwho would want time from me to come over. That is all the time I am \ngoing to use right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, will you tell us what time is \nremaining on each side, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 22 minutes 19 \nseconds remaining. The Senator from Iowa has 24 minutes 23 seconds.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.\n  This bill is an attempt to finally make a dent--even a small one--in \nthe\n\n[[Page S12179]]\n\nmandatory spending that is threatening to engulf the Federal budget.\n  With mandatory spending currently accounting for over 50 percent of \nall Federal spending and projected to grow higher--it must be on the \ntable whenever we examine the budget and the deficit.\n  In addition to serving on the Budget Committee, I also serve on three \nof the committees that passed language that is now part of the bill \nthat we have before us.\n  I can tell you that in each of those committees, it took a lot of \nhard work and a lot of compromise to arrive at the language in this \nbill.\n  Difficult compromise means that hardly anyone is 100 percent happy \nwith the final product.\n  For instance, I am disappointed that the Finance Committee did not \ninclude restrictions on intergovernmental transfers in its package.\n  Intergovernmental transfers are financing schemes that some States \nuse to pull down more Federal Medicaid dollars than they are entitled \nto.\n  For example, some States overpay local government health care \nproviders, and then require the providers to return the excess funds to \nthe State.\n  The Finance Committee missed an important opportunity to curtail \nthese abuses, and I hope we can rectify this as the bill moves through \nCongress.\n  There are, however, parts of this bill that I think are of staggering \nimportance to this country.\n  In particular, I worked with Senator Domenici and others in the \nEnergy Committee to see that ANWR language was included in this \nreconciliation bill.\n  As prices continue to rise at the gas pump, and a barrel of oil \ncontinues to be high, America needs to increase its domestic supply of \nenergy and reduce our reliance on foreign oil.\n  Several months ago, I traveled to ANWR and saw firsthand how energy \ncompanies will develop it into a viable energy source.\n  After visiting sites in Alaska, there is no doubt in my mind that we \ncan develop ANWR in a safe and effective manner.\n  Once developed, ANWR will provide the United States with nearly 1 \nmillion barrels of oil a day or 4.5 percent of today's consumption for \nthe next 30 years.\n  This nearly matches the oil that we import from Saudi Arabia each and \nevery day.\n  I also want to address the fact that much of the debate here on the \nsenate floor yesterday, and last week in the Budget Committee, was not \nabout this bill that we have before us today.\n  The ranking member of the Budget Committee wants to talk about a bill \nthat we will likely mark up in the Finance Committee next week--the \ngrowth package.\n  The ranking member and his colleagues are constantly talking about \nhow we can't afford the ``tax cuts'' that the growth package is \nexpected contain.\n  My answer to that is this: The growth package will not be about tax \n``cuts''. It will be about stopping tax increases.\n  Let me say that again: The growth package will not be cutting taxes; \nit will be stopping tax increases that will affect American families.\n  Although my friends on the other side of the aisle may not want to \nadmit it, there are large tax increases on the horizon unless this \nCongress acts.\n  I am referring to the tax increases our constituents will feel in \ntheir pocketbooks and wallets if we fail to extend current tax law.\n  The so-called ``tax cuts'' the other side keeps refering to are \nreally nothing more than just keeping current tax law in place.\n  There are over 40 provisions that American families and employers \nhave come to rely on that will expire at the end of this year if we do \nnothing.\n  These are provisions in current law that are important to our \nconstituents and to our economy.\n  Let's take a look at the items that the Finance Committee, which I \nserve on, will likely examine soon.\n  First, there is the alternative minimum tax hold-harmless provision. \nThat one alone will cost about $30 billion to extend for just 1 year.\n  Madam President, 80,000 Kentuckians face a tax increase if that \nprovision is not extended. And, looking at our neighbors, 235,000 \nOhioans and 30,000 West Virginians will also face tax increases if it \nis allowed to expire.\n  The R tax credit will expire at the end of this year unless we act.\n  This is an important provision of the Tax Code that spurs innovation \nand new technologies and one that I and many others here support.\n  In fact, the bill introduced in the Senate in the last Congress to \nmake this provision permanent had 40 cosponsors, including 22 Senate \nDemocrats.\n  A lot of other important provisions will also expire if we do not \nact:\n  The deduction of tuition expenses--affects 36,000 Kentuckians;\n  The low-income savers credit--affects 94,000 Kentuckians;\n  The tax deduction for teachers for their classroom expenses--affects \n38,000 Kentucky teachers;\n  And the low-income savers credit which, in 2003, affected 94,000 low-\nincome Kentucky taxpayers.\n  These are Kentuckians who do not deserve a tax increase. And I am \ngoing to do all within my power to make sure that they do not get one.\n  But again, our friends on the other side of the aisle will say that I \nam just telling half the story.\n  What about the dividends and capital gains 15 percent rate extension, \nthey will ask.\n  After all, they argue, you Republicans want to extend that and that \nonly helps the rich.\n  Well, first of all, it is really hard to dispute the positive impact \nthat the 15 percent rates have had on the macro-economy.\n  Dividends paid by companies in the S 500 are up 59 percent since \nthe tax cut was implemented, and capital gains tax revenue to the \nFederal Government is set to exceed the CBO forecast by $16 billion in \nfiscal year 2006.\n  But let's talk about which taxpayers are benefiting from these 15 \npercent rates.\n  In my State, 18 percent of taxpayers benefited from the reduced rate \non dividend income and 13 percent benefited from the lower rate on \ncapital gains income in 2003.\n  Again, to look at some of our neighboring States, in West Virginia 17 \npercent of taxpayers reported dividend income and 11 percent reported \ncapital gains income.\n  In Ohio, 24 percent reported dividend income and 16 percent reported \ncapital gains income.\n  This is especially interesting when you consider that both Kentucky \nand West Viriginia have median incomes below the national average.\n  And yet a large number of our taxpayers report receiving capital \ngains and dividend income.\n  And this does not even count the workers and retirees who hold these \nassets inside their 401(k)s and other tax-deferred saving vehicles.\n  The fact is, dividends are important to millions of families.\n  According to 2002 irs data, nearly two-thirds of the taxpayers \nreporting dividend income had adjusted gross incomes below $75,000.\n  And the average dividend received by those with A.G.I.'s below \n$75,000 was over $1,700.\n  As we all know, these dividends are very important to the elderly.\n  Many of our retired folks rely on dividends to supplement their fixed \nincomes from pensions and Social Security.\n  While it is true that these lower rates don't sunset until the end of \n2008, it is important that we send a message to the economy by \nextending these rates this year.\n  Investors and financial markets will grow increasingly uncertain \nabout the future tax treatment of dividends and capital gains as 2008 \ngets closer, if we have not done our job by making these provisions \npermanent.\n  We just cannot risk adding unwanted volatility into the markets and \nthe economy--which continues to grow.\n  So, again, let me be clear--the proposals that we are talking about \nextending in the growth package that we will likely see soon are not \nnew tax proposals--this is simply current law.\n  If we do not extend these provisions we will cause a substantial \nincrease in the tax bills of American families and businesses.\n  In closing, I wanted to say a word to those who are complaining about \nthe ``cuts'' in spending contained in this deficit reduction package on \nthe floor today.\n\n[[Page S12180]]\n\n  The facts show that spending has grown rapidly in the last few \ndecades.\n  In just 3 years, from 2001 to 2004, total Government spending \nincreased by 23 percent--an increase of over $400 billion in just 3 \nyears.\n  Despite what we might hear today, we have greatly increased spending \nin a number of areas--including education and veteran's health care, in \naddition to homeland security.\n  Let's keep that in mind as complaints are being made about the bill \nbefore us today.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and I look forward to further \ndebate.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself a minute and a half.\n  Madam President, this amendment and this discussion both are not \nabout the cost of production of agricultural commodities. This \namendment and this discussion are about payment limits and the need to \nprevent public funds from being used by the biggest producers to become \neven larger by bidding up cash trends and capitalizing their extra \nprofits from production into land values.\n  There is public interest in this being the result of Federal farm \nprograms, and all except the very largest farmers know that and support \nthis effort.\n  Focusing on costs of production is totally meaningless, unless one \nalso includes the revenue from production.\n  Every crop has a different set of numbers on cost and a different set \nof numbers on revenue produced. Those numbers vary from crop to crop, \nand, to a degree, vary from region to region and year to year.\n  The farm program support levels have never been set on the basis of \ncost of production or on profitability, taking revenue into \nconsideration. Support levels have been set by the Congress, not by \nsome index based on cost of production.\n  Moreover, this is not about inefficiency, as some have argued for \nyears. The largest producers, with extra profit from their size or \nscale, from discounts received in input, and from premiums received for \nvolume production are not passed along to consumers. Those extra \nprofits are used to bid land away from midsize and smaller operators.\n  Keep in mind that these programs are not entitlement programs. The \npurpose is to stabilize the sector and provide an income supplement \nwhen commodity prices are low.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I am pleased to yield such time as she may consume to \nmy good friend from Arkansas, Senator Lincoln.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Madam President. I thank the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee for offering leadership on this issue and \ncertainly his friendship.\n  I rise today in opposition to the underlying amendment regarding \nfurther payment restrictions on the farm safety net.\n  This issue of payment limitation is not a new topic of debate. \nUnfortunately, it remains a largely misunderstood issue for many--both \ninside and outside the beltway.\n  As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I suppose I take for \ngranted that not everyone pays close attention to farm policy that we \nset. But they certainly pay attention to the fact that the grocery \nstore shelves in this great country are always full and that they get \nthe safest and most abundant and affordable food supply in the world. \nThey pay less per capita than any other developed nation on the globe \nfor this incredible food source.\n  Our producers do it with all of the many things that Americans want \nto be taken into consideration, whether it be the environment or the \neconomics, and they take into consideration the regulations. Our \nfarmers, our producers in this great land, are the most productive, the \nmost efficient of any across this globe.\n  I have to say, as a farmer's daughter, that I take pride in telling \nothers about the farmers I represent and what American farmers provide \nthis Nation and the entire globe.\n  Today, I come to the floor of the Senate to attempt to provide some \nclarity to this issue that has been misunderstood.\n  Above all else, our farm policy seeks to do one thing for producers \nof commodities: That is to provide a strong level of support to \nproducers against low prices brought on by factors completely beyond \ntheir control, including foreign subsidies--some that are five and six \ntimes higher than the help that we provide our farmers in this country.\n  Think about that. I wish I had Senator Conrad's charts that always \nshow the disproportionate share of subsidies of the EU, in particular, \nbut other countries which provide their producers to remain competitive \nin a global marketplace.\n  As I have traveled my State since we enacted the 2002 farm bill, I \ncan tell you that Arkansas farmers view our agriculture policy as a \ncontract, an agreement, that they have made between themselves, their \nlenders, and their government. They should. They should be able to look \ntheir government in the eye when an agreement such as the 2002 farm \nbill is made and say, We have a deal. We understand that in the next 5 \nyears we are going to work as hard as we possibly can with all of the \nvariables that we get, whether it is weather that we have no control \nover or trade that we have no control over, whether it is multiple, \ndifferent variables that they have no control over. But they know that \ntheir government has made an agreement with them and that their \ngovernment will stand by that agreement as they make their plans for \nthe enormous amounts of capital investment they have to invest in those \nfive crop years, knowing that some will be better than others but that \nthey can figure out there will be some consistency in the agreement \nthey have made with their government on the program that will allow \nthem to be competitive in a global marketplace.\n  I am here to urge my colleagues in this Chamber that today is neither \nthe time nor the place to break that contract and agreement that we \nhave made with our farmers.\n  This budget reconciliation process should not be used to make a \npolicy change of this magnitude. The underlying amendment will \neffectively do exactly that for the producers in my State of Arkansas \nand many States across this Nation.\n  But my colleagues don't have to take my word for it on this matter.\n  A bipartisan commission established as a part of the farm bill to \nconduct a study on the potential impact of further payment limitations \nraised the same cautionary note. This 10-person commission was \ncomprised of 3 members appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, 3 \nmembers appointed by the Senate Agriculture Committee, 3 appointed by \nthe House Agriculture Committee, and finally the chief economist of the \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  These facts alone should be enough for each of the Members of this \nbody to take their recommendation seriously.\n  I have taken the time to become familiar with their backgrounds and \nwith their report, a report that was nearly 2 years in the making--not \nsomething that popped up overnight but something that was thoughtfully \ndone to recognize how important a safe, abundant, and affordable food \nsupply is to this Nation.\n  As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and someone who has \nintimate knowledge of the farm operations in my State, I was pleased to \ndiscover the commission's top two recommendations support my position \nthat no change should be made in the farm safety net until the current \nlaw expires.\n\n  First, it specifically states that any substantial changes should \ntake place with the reauthorization of the next farm bill.\n  Some of you may be asking yourselves, What is substantial?\n  In strictly monetary terms, I can tell you that conservative \nestimates say that further payment limitations would cost my State \nalone almost $80 million a year. The overall economic impact to our \nState of Arkansas is estimated at nearly $500 million annually, a price \nfar too high to pay when our farmers are looking at unbelievably high \ngas prices, unbelievably high costs in terms of fertilizer and \napplication that has to be made, not to mention the trade implications \nthat exist out there for our producers.\n  The commission's second recommendation was, if changes are to be\n\n[[Page S12181]]\n\nmade, there should be an adequate phase-in period.\n  Not only does this team of experts, appointed by our Government's \nleaders in agriculture, urge that no changes be made to our current \nfarm safety net until the appropriate time, but they also urged that, \nshould that day come, our farmers need to be given an adequate period \nof time to avoid unnecessary disruption in their production, marketing, \nand business organization.\n  This is not something that happens once a month. Planning a crop, not \nonly for that year but the understanding of the implication of the crop \nyou plant this year on future crops you may plant, taking care of your \nland in a way that will make sure that land is sustainable for future \ngenerations, is not a 1-month-at-a-time operation.\n  In short, the commission acknowledges the complexity of this issue \nand recommends to each of us that we wait to proceed at the appropriate \ntime and then only proceed with caution.\n  This amendment takes the exact opposite approach and will send shock \nwaves through farm country, particularly in the South. In fact, the \nmere discussion of such a dramatic change creates an abnormal level of \nanxiety in my home State.\n  One of the fatal flaws of the previous farm law was its lack of an \nadequate safety net in the face of foreign subsidies and tariffs that \ndwarf our support of U.S. producers.\n  Again, Senator Conrad's chart says it better than anybody.\n  That level of subsidy that other nations provide their producers, \ntheir growers, is phenomenal compared to what we do for ourselves. The \nnew farm law corrected that mistake.\n  The amendment now before us would limit that very support at a time \nwhen producers need the help the most, creating a new and gaping hole \nin the safety net.\n  Furthermore, during hearings on the new farm bill, virtually every \ncommodity and general farm organization testified in opposition to \nfurther payment limitations.\n  Here we are today, once again, debating this issue of payment \nlimitations.\n  Proponents of tighter limits continue to sensationalize this issue by \nciting misleading articles about large farm operations receiving very \nlarge payments as a reason to target support for smaller farmers. But, \nunfortunately, sensationalized stories only serve to cloud their \nmisunderstood issue even further.\n  Senators truly need to understand that this amendment has very \nserious implications.\n  Let me attempt to provide some clarity on the issue of farms.\n  First, payment limitations have disproportionate effects on different \nregions in this country. Simply put, the size of farm operations is \nrelative to regions, but even more simply, what a small farm is in \nArkansas may be a huge farm in another State, which leads me to my next \npoint.\n  This amendment continues to unfairly discriminate on a regional basis \nbecause it does not differentiate between crops that are extremely \ncost-intensive and those that are not cost-intensive in the South where \nwe grow what we are suited to grow. That is what farmers do. You would \nbe a fool not to. To try to grow a crop that you are not equipped to \ngrow or intended to grow would be unbelievable.\n  What do we grow? We grow cotton and rice, which are highly capital-\nintensive crops. They require disproportionately more capital input per \nacre than any other crop.\n  What happened? You have to grow on an economy of scale, have a farm \nof an economy of scale so you can afford those capital inputs and still \nbe competitive in a global marketplace.\n  This amendment would lump cotton and rice with the same category of \ncrops that require half as much input cost. It absolutely does not take \ninto consideration the great diversity of this Nation, which is our \nreal strength. That is something we should recognize.\n  Finally, on the issue of size, farmers of commodities are not getting \nlarger to receive more payments. They get larger in an attempt to \ncreate an economy of scale to remain competitive internationally.\n  At a time when we are telling our farmers to compete in a global \nmarket, we now debate an amendment that would discourage farmers from \nacquiring the economies of scale that they will need to compete in that \nglobal marketplace.\n  Certainly, my colleague from Iowa, who chairs the Finance Committee \nand has jurisdiction over international trade, can appreciate that. He \nhas talked about it many times.\n  This amendment affects the cornerstone of support for our Nation's \nfarmers because it prevents the marketing loan from working correctly.\n  These limitations would lead to loan forfeitures and huge Government \ninventories of commodities if steps are not taken to ensure that \nproducers can market their commodities.\n  If you limit the amount of support farmers may receive, you are \nplacing on them a substantial domestic disadvantage before sending them \nout to compete in an international market that is already unfair for \nour producers.\n  This is not the case in Europe, where agriculture is subsidized at a \nlevel six times higher than we have here in the United States and in \nthe case of Japan, where agriculture is subsidized at a whopping 92 \ntimes more than we do in the United States.\n  Finally, I say to those who believe that farmers are getting rich at \nthe expense of the taxpayers, there is a reason why our sons and \ndaughters are not rushing back to the farm and their family heritage. \nIt is because farming is a very tough business, with lots of \nchallenges.\n  In the South, we face many of those, as farmers all across this \nNation do.\n  I hope that my colleagues will take into consideration that this is \nnot the time nor the place to deal with this issue. We made a contract \nwith our grocers, our farmers, and our producers. And we want to make \nsure that as a government we make good on that contract, and if, in \nfact, the time comes when we review it, we do it at the appropriate \ntime.\n  I yield my time to Senator Chambliss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and 15 minutes to the other Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, before the Senator from North Dakota \nmoves forward, I want to make sure that we are going back and forth. \nDoes the other Senator from Arkansas need time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Iowa for this \ntime.\n  Let me indicate that there are really three abuses which are \noccurring in the current system.\n  No. 1, there is no effective limit on the marketing loan benefit. \nCurrent law does not limit gains received through commodity marketing \nloan forfeitures or commodity certification transactions. The fact is \nthere is no limit on marketing loan benefits. That was never the \nintention.\n\n  No. 2, payments are not attributed to the individual who receives the \nbenefits. Producers may create multiple entities, such as corporations, \nto increase the total amount of payments received.\n  In the last farm bill debate in the conference committee--and I was \none of the negotiators on the conference committee--I took to my \ncolleagues an example from a State that will remain unnamed that \ninvolved 49 different entities that represented only 5 people. This was \nan incredible shell game to avoid and evade any kind of reasonable \npayment limits. This is the kind of abuse that will be shut down by the \nGrassley-Dorgan amendment.\n  No. 3, the definition of ``actively engaged'' has been weakened. A \ncottage industry of lawyers and accountants has developed to create \nshell organizations to allow nonfarmers to qualify for farm program \npayments because they have a minimal interest in a farming operation. \nIn some cases, participation in a farm management conference call once \na year now qualifies them as ``engaged.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. These are the three critical points I hope my colleagues \nwill focus on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, some things in the Senate are heavy\n\n[[Page S12182]]\n\nlifting and tough to deal with. This is the easiest decision ever to be \noffered to this Senate. The question is, for what purpose do we offer a \nfarm program in this country? The answer is, because family farmers \ncannot make it over the valleys of despair. With precipitous drops in \ninternational prices, devastating weather disasters, we will not have \nfamily farmers left unless we have a basic bridge across the valleys.\n  That is the purpose of the farm program. Instead of a bridge across \nvalleys to help family farmers populate the prairies of this country, \nthe farm program has become a set of golden arches for the biggest and \nthe wealthiest farms in the country.\n  Senator Grassley and I proposed something that is kind of novel here. \nWe proposed that the farm program be redirected to help family farms. \nWhat we say is this: At a time when we are going to cut price supports \nand cut the safety net for family farmers, we say maybe the better \napproach would be to restore those cuts and get the money by shutting \ndown the millions of dollars in checks going to the corporate \nagrifactories in our country. Is that a novel solution? No. It is what \nthe farm program was supposed to have been.\n  Let me describe what we have in this country. This is from a story in \nthe Washington Post a couple years ago.\n\n       A prominent and well-respected businessman who lives in a \n     million-dollar home, sits on a local bank board and serves as \n     a president of a tractor dealership with sales last year of \n     $30.8 million . . .\n\n  He is also, by some definitions a farmer--the principal landlord of a \n61,000-acre spread, $38 million from the Federal Treasury in 5 years.\n\n       Like other large operations this farm was structured to get \n     the most from government programs.\n\n  In other words, this was farming the farm program. A novel idea, \nfarming the farm program. Perhaps we ought to stop people from farming \nthe farm program.\n  Some of my colleagues say you have to be big in some parts of the \ncountry. That does not mean the taxpayer has to be shipping checks \ntotaling $68 million or $38 million to those operations. Want to farm \nthe whole country? God bless you. You have every right in this country \nto do so and we sure hope you are successful. But I don't see that the \ntaxpayer ought to be the one who bankrolls the financing operation if \nyou want to farm the entire county. That is all this is about.\n  My colleague Senator Grassley and I offer this not to penalize any \npart of the country. It is to refocus the farm program to where it \nought to be, to help family farmers through tough times.\n  I mentioned that millions of dollars go to corporate megafarms. I \nalso pointed out this is not what I came to the Congress to fight for. \nI want good support prices to go to family farms to help them through \ntough times so that in the long run we still have yard lights around \nthis country with families living on the farm producing America's food. \nThat is the purpose of a safety net.\n  Now, I described some of the megafarms, the corporate agrifactories \ngetting millions of dollars. The Grassley-Dorgan amendment says, let's \nput some limits on it. We asked the USDA, who gets the farm program \npayments? Do we have some evidence about how much goes to the big \ninterests? It is interesting, the USDA does not know to whom it is \nmaking the farm program payments. It does not know. In our piece of \nlegislation, we require it to know. When they are shoveling millions \nout the door at USDA, they should figure out where they are sending \nthem.\n  I was thinking about the payments that are made to farmers in the \ncountry. We care about family operations. That is the whole purpose of \nthis. By the way, if the purpose is not to support family farming, we \nought not have a farm program. We ought to get rid of it if it is not \nthe purpose. I believe it is the purpose and should be the purpose.\n  Remember that movie, ``Weekend at Bernies,'' while they haul around a \ndead guy for the whole weekend? They put him in the car, by a swimming \npool with sunglasses on, and hauled around a dead guy. The movies don't \nhave anything on the USDA. The USDA sees dead people on farm subsidy \nrolls. In fact, you have to be ``actively engaged,'' the law says, in \nfarming. And yet they are making payments to dead people. How can you \nbe ``actively engaged'' as a farmer if you are dead? But the USDA does \nnot know who it is sending money to so we could not expect them to \nanswer this question: Why are 55 dead farmers receiving more than \n$400,000 each in farm program payments?\n  I understand my colleagues exerting a lot of muscle trying to help \nlive farmers. Maybe at least we could agree on dead farmers not \nreceiving nearly half a million each.\n  Let's back up for a moment. Let's try to ask ourselves, why do we \nhave a farm program? Of what value is it to our country? My great-\ngrandmother actually ran a farm. She lost her husband, an immigrant \nfrom Norway, took a train to Eagle Butte Township, and with six kids, \npitched a tent, worked a farm, had a son who had a daughter who had me, \nwhich is how I came to southwestern North Dakota. It was a family farm. \nThink of the courage to run this family operation.\n  Over time, this country said we will not have them left on the \nprairie if we do not provide some basic support over tough times, a \nbridge over price valleys. So we did. It is called price supports, to \ntry and help family farmers.\n  Boy, has that grown. This little price support program trying to help \nfamily farmers through tough times has grown to become a huge boon to \nsome of the biggest operators in the country, having nothing to do with \nfamilies, having to do with corporate agrifactories. Is that what we \nwant the program to be?\n  The choice Senator Grassley and I offer is a simple choice. The \ncommittee brings to the Senate a proposition that says let's cut farm \nprogram payments for every farmer. Let's cut farm program price \npayments for every farmer. We say there is a better way. How about \nrather than pull the rug out from other family farmers, we decide to do \nwhat we should have done long ago, and that is, shut off the spigot on \nthe money that is going to the big corporate agrifactories that have \nnothing at all to do with families. I am not suggesting they are \nunworthy, the corporate agrifactories. I am not suggesting that at all. \nI am saying if they want to farm the whole county, half a State, or \nthey want to get bigger and bigger and bigger and decide to separate \ninto 49 or 69 or 89 entities in order to farm the farm program, God \nbless them. I just don't think there is a requirement that the American \ntaxpayer or the Federal Government has to bankroll them. I don't think \nthat is our requirement.\n  The urge and the urgency for Congress should be to want this country \nto maintain a network of family farms for the people who risk \neverything. We are not trying to define exactly what a family farmer \nis. Some are quite large. But I know what it isn't. Michelangelo was \nasked, how did he sculpt David? He said, I took a piece of marble and \nchipped away everything that wasn't David. We can have a family farm \nand chip away that which it is not.\n  That which it is not, which we are defining today in some respects, \nrepresents the enterprises that do not need the Federal Government's \nhelp to grow. They have already grown to the point where they are \nfarming a substantial part of our counties around the country.\n  This is a choice. We can decide to cut farm program payments for \neverybody and pull the rug out from under a lot of families out there \nbarely making it, given energy costs and the price of grain, or we can \nprovide the kind of program payments over tough times that we told \nfamily farmers we would provide and get the money to do that by \nlimiting the payments that go to people who are getting $38 million in \nthe case of the first enterprise I talked about. That is sensible.\n  The question is very simple: What do you think the purpose of the \nfarm program is? Whose side are you on? Who are you trying to help?\n  I suppose my discussion about dead farmers was tongue-in-cheek, but \nit raises an important question. If we had 55 farmers who are dead who \nreceive $400,000-plus, each of them, nearly half a million each, it \nraises a pretty important question about the golden arches that exist \nhere for some of the biggest enterprises out there in rural America.\n  This is not difficult. I understand, and I don't denigrate my \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S12183]]\n\nwho are forced to support the biggest corporate farms and to support \nthe way things are. I understand that. Everyone has a constituent \ninterest here. But our interest, the interest of Senator Grassley and \nmyself, is not to try to injure anybody or injure any part of the \ncountry. Our interest is to say this country should aspire to say to \nfamily farmers, You matter in America; we want you to be able to make \nit through tough times. That is why we have a farm program.\n\n  When the choice is, do we pull the rug out from under you with the \ncuts coming from the proposal today, or is there a better way by which \nwe can limit payments to the largest corporate farms and use that money \nto restore the kind of help we have always said we wanted to provide \nfamily farmers, isn't that a smart thing to do? Isn't that the right \nthing to do? Isn't that what public policy was designed to do, to help \nAmerica's family farmers?\n  Take a poll, any time, any place in America, and ask the question \nabout whether they value family farmers. They do. Farmers and ranchers \nwho live on the land risk everything. Every spring all they have is \nhope, the hope that maybe they will get a crop. Maybe it won't hail. \nMaybe it won't rain too much. Maybe it won't rain too little. Maybe \nsomehow they get a crop, after they put all the money in, in the \nspring. And when they harvest it, the hope they get a price and maybe \nthey will make a living. That is all they have, is hope.\n  That is why this Congress has in the past said, let's try to make \nsure they have some capability with a safety net to make it across \nthese price valleys and these tough times. That is what Senator \nGrassley and I are trying to preserve. Every year people try to chip \naway more and more and more. We are trying to preserve that hope, \ntrying to preserve a way of life, something we think is important to \nthe future of this country.\n  We can have corporations farm from California to New York, I suppose, \nbig agrifactories. But what are the consequences of that? We lose \nsomething very important in this country when we lose America's family \nfarm producers and family ranchers.\n  How much time did I consume?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator has consumed 11 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I reserve the final 4 minutes of my presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield to the Senator from Arkansas 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask that you tell me when my 4 \nminutes is up, if that is at all possible.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Grassley amendment. \nIt is hard for me to do that in the sense that I agree with Chairman \nGrassley on so many things, but I disagree with him on this amendment.\n  The 2000 farm bill is a contract, something the Congress entered \ninto, and I think it is a terrible mistake to change the terms of that \ncontract in midstream.\n  In fact, the USDA had a bipartisan payment limit commission. They \nlooked at it. They concluded the same thing: Don't change the rules in \nthe middle of the game. I do not think any business, much less our \nfamily farmers, can have any kind of business plan when the rules \nchange and the rules become very unpredictable.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Chambliss of Georgia, the chairman of \nthe Agriculture Committee. He has done an outstanding job of trying to \nbe fair when we look at this issue to make sure not one crop or one \nsection of the country is being singled out to carry a disproportionate \namount of the pain.\n  Recently, the WTO made a decision in a cotton case involving Brazil, \nso our cotton farmers have lost an important program known as Cotton \nStep II. We are going to add to the burden of our cotton farmers, and \nadd to the burden of our peanut producers and our rice farmers. The \nbiggest concern I have other than that, in addition to the concept of \nthis, is the idea of timing. It could not be worse. When you look at \nthe Southern States--Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, \nFlorida--we are reeling from hurricanes right now, all over that \nsection of the country. In fact, the University of Arkansas Extension \nService has estimated there is $900 million worth of hurricane-related \ncrop damage in our State alone--$900 million worth.\n  Then we look at our farmers. They are paying record energy prices. \nThey have these meritless WTO challenges. They have had storm damage. \nThey have had the worst drought in my State that we have had in 50 \nyears. I think it is a terrible time for us to be adding to their \nburden.\n  Of course, there are also many myths that have been perpetrated by \npeople who do not like some of these farm programs. One of these \ngroups--I don't know exactly anything about this group--but the \nEnvironmental Working Group says there is a farmer in my State, some \nguy named Riceland, who is taking boatloads of Federal dollars and \nsubsidies.\n  Who is Riceland? Riceland is not one farmer. There is not one guy \ndown there named Riceland. Riceland is a farm-owned cooperative. There \nare 9,000 family farmers who are members of this one cooperative. So, \nsure, if you bundle all 9,000 up and look, that is a lot of money. But \nwhen you look at all these 9,000 separate, independently owned farming \noperations, you get to see a more accurate picture.\n  So let's stick with the facts. The facts are this country has the \nmost stable, the most abundant, the safest, the most affordable food \nand fiber of any country in the world. One thing I would hate to see is \nus be dependent on foreigners for our food supply. Right now, \nunfortunately, we are dependent on energy. I think that is a matter of \nnational security. If we ever become dependent on foreign countries for \nour food, that would be a matter of national security.\n  Our trade deficit is at an all-time high. We are witnessing--this set \nof Senators--our manufacturing base in this country evaporating before \nour very eyes. Do we want to do this to our farm economy? I say no. I \nsay we need to understand we get a big return on the investment we make \nin our agriculture programs. In fact, all the programs combined--\neverything total--is less than one-half of 1 percent of the Federal \nbudget.\n  One of the great strengths America has is we are able to feed \nourselves and, if we are given the opportunity, to feed the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Isakson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Georgia, my dear friend. I appreciate his guidance and I associate \nmyself with his remarks. The distinguished Senator from North Dakota \nmade an admittedly tongue-in-cheek analogy about 55 dead farmers. To \nchange this program in midstream could put a lot of family farmers in \nthe South on life support, and that is not tongue-in-cheek. It would \nnot only cripple the agriculture economy of communities across the \nNation, but it would have a most devastating effect on farmers in my \nState and in the Southeast.\n  Make no mistake, adoption of this amendment would result in many \ntraditional family farms going out of business--plain and simple.\n  We had this debate in 2002, when we passed a carefully crafted farm \nbill. We debated farm payment limits extensively at that time, and it \nis absolutely wrong to seek to change those rules in midstream. That \ndebate takes place in 2007, when the bill is up for reauthorization.\n  Our farmers have made business decisions based on that farm bill. \nThey have had significant investments based on that farm bill. We \ncannot pull the rug out from under them in midstream.\n  This amendment punishes the farmer whose livelihood depends solely on \nthe farm. In my part of the country, a farmer must have a substantial \noperation to make ends meet. Why would we seek to punish family farmers \nat a time when they have made large investments in order to become \ncompetitive in an international marketplace? Now is not that time.\n\n  Mr. President, on behalf of farmers in my State of Georgia and across \nthe\n\n[[Page S12184]]\n\nSoutheast, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Grassley amendment.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining for the entire \ndebate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes 35 seconds on your side, and 2 \nminutes 18 seconds on the other side.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to correct, I think, an impression \nthat was made. I do not think it was intentional, but the impression \nwas that the Grassley-Dorgan amendment would prohibit the largest \ncorporate farms from getting payments. We do not do that. They are \nlimited in the payments they would receive. We do put a limit on it. We \ndo not prohibit them. They will still get payments right up to the top \nlimit. But that is all.\n  To further make my point, in one case, a Mississippi cotton farmer \nset up a web of 78 corporations and partnerships that collected $11 \nmillion in subsidies. The name of one of his companies was Get Rich \nFarms.\n  The farm program is not about getting rich for anybody. The farm \nprogram is to try to provide some protection and some help for family \nfarmers, who are left to the vagaries of a marketplace that whipsaws up \nand down with weather, natural disasters. This is not about getting \nrich. It is about getting through tough times. That is what Senator \nGrassley and I wish to do.\n  Now, Mr. President, my colleague from Iowa has arrived. I know he \nwishes some time. We have very little time left, but I will truncate my \nremarks so the remaining time will be available to Senator Harkin, who \nis also a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me provide the 6 minutes that is \navailable to Senator Harkin.\n  I say to Senator Harkin, there are 6 minutes available on this \ndebate. I will yield my time at this point in order to make that \navailable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to be clear about how much time I \nhave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 5 minutes 39 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to cosponsor \nthis amendment offered by Senator Grassley and Senator Dorgan.\n  Again, let's be clear why we are here debating this amendment. It is \nbecause the President's budget proposal called for taking away \nsubstantial funding that had previously been dedicated to agriculture \nand nutrition assistance. Accordingly, the congressional budget \nresolution requires cutting $3 billion out of programs in the \njurisdiction of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \nover the next 5 years. These cuts could come from farm income \nassistance, conservation, Federal nutrition assistance, or several \nother mandatory programs.\n  Fortunately--and I commend the chairman of our committee, Senator \nChambliss, for this--his mark did not cut Federal nutrition assistance, \nand neither does the committee-reported measure, although such cuts are \nprobably almost certain after we go to conference with the House.\n  Along with many of my colleagues, I opposed the cuts to agriculture \nfrom the time President Bush proposed them because I do not think they \nare justified. Three years ago we crafted a new, bipartisan farm bill, \nwhich the President praised and signed into law. We were given a budget \nallocation to deal with it. We stayed within it. The farm bill has in \ngeneral been working as intended. In fact, in for fiscal 2002 through \n2005, since the bill was signed, our Federal commodity programs are \nestimated to have saved the taxpayers of this country $14 billion \ncompared to the cost estimates right after the bill was enacted. We \nhave spent $14 billion less in those 4 years than we were entitled to \nspend in the farm bill.\n  So now we have the budget reconciliation bill before us. I don't \nbelieve there is any justification for cutting any funds out of \nagriculture, but the fact is, the budget resolution requires it. \nCongress is going to cut funds. The question is, how are we going to do \nit? How are we going to do it? Well, I am supporting the Grassley-\nDorgan amendment because it contains a much more equitable and sound \nway to achieve the $3 billion in cuts over the next 5 years.\n\n  Basically, the amendment says there will be a more reasonable set of \nlimits on the amount of Federal farm program payments that any one \nindividual is able to draw from the Federal Treasury. By obtaining the \nsavings in this way, the burden of budget cuts on the vast majority of \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers will be lessened.\n  Now, my colleagues--Senator Grassley, Senator Dorgan, and others--\nhave described very well how farm commodity program payments are \nheavily concentrated on a relatively small percentage of Americans who \ncontrol our Nation's largest farm operations. They have described how \nthese operations can be reorganized, manipulated, using various \npartnerships, corporations, and entities, to skirt the payment \nlimitations that are supposedly in the law now.\n  Again, let me remind my colleagues, the Grassley-Dorgan amendment we \nhave before us is basically what the Senate adopted in the debate on \nthe 2002 farm bill, by a vote of 66 to 31. This amendment was adopted \nin the farm bill. Of course, it was rejected in conference, because of \nstrong opposition from the House don't you know, but we adopted it \nhere. The Grassley-Dorgan amendment tracks the proposal in the \nPresident's budget.\n  Again, this amendment Senator Grassley and Senator Dorgan have \noffered is not onerous. It provides for a basic overall payment limit \non all benefits of $125,000 an individual. If you have a spouse, that \ncould be $250,000 for the couple. That is a pretty generous amount of \nmoney from the Federal Government to support a farming operation in \nanybody's book. So this is a modest proposal.\n  The other thing this amendment does is it cuts through all the \nconfusion and murkiness about the ``three-entity rule.'' This amendment \nwould track payments through to the actual individuals who receive the \nbenefits, and then apply the payment limitations directly and \nstraightforwardly. Now we will know exactly who is getting what. This \namendment will establish a stronger requirement of active personal \nmanagement of a farm or ranch before an individual is eligible to \nreceive farm program payments.\n  The reasonable payment limitations in the Grassley-Dorgan amendment \nare a better, fairer way to obtain the budget savings. Those savings \nare then applied in this amendment to mitigate the most damaging \naspects of the measure reported by the committee and which is in the \nbill before us.\n  The Grassley-Dorgan amendment delays for 1 year the 2.5 percent \nacross-the-board reduction in commodity program payments and benefits \nwhich applies to all recipients.\n  One other thing this amendment does is it lets us go back and lessen \nthe cuts to the farm bill's conservation title. What it does is it \nrestores conservation funds that the bill before us would take out of \nthe Conservation Reserve Program. It gets us back up to 38.45 million \nacres, close to the farm bill's 39.2 million acres. So this amendment \nsupports conservation.\n  It also puts money back into the Conservation Security Program, which \nwas cut by some 30 percent in the measure reported by the committee. \nThat is on top of cuts already imposed on the Conservation Security \nProgram in previous legislation.\n  So again, the Grassley-Dorgan amendment is fairer--more fair--than \nthe bill before us. It is straightforward, and it responds to the real \nneeds we have in rural America today. I commend Senator Grassley and \nSenator Dorgan for their amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, let me wind up with a couple of \nresponses to some of the comments that have been made.\n  First, Senator Dorgan got up and said we had one farm that had gotten\n\n[[Page S12185]]\n\n$37 million over 5 years. That is preposterous. It is wrong. It is \nsimply incorrect. The Senator from Arkansas made it very plain there is \none cooperative that has 9,000 members, called Riceland. The entity \nwhich Senator Dorgan was talking about was not an individual farmer. \nThere is no provision in the current law that would allow such payments \nto be made. That is simply wrong.\n  Secondly, there was a statement made that 55 dead farmers received \npayments. Let me tell you what happened so the American people \nunderstand. A farmer goes into the Farm Service Agency at the beginning \nof the year, and he fills out a form.\n  That form says how much he is going to plant of each specific crop. \nThey then know what payments they qualify for. Those checks are sent \nout during different times of the year and even into the next year \nafter the farm season is over. It is unfortunate that 55 farmers died \nduring that year before they got their checks. I am sorry about that. \nBut those farmers were family farmers. Their families deserve that \nincome because that family member was actively engaged in farming at \nthe time he went into the office and made the application. I kind of \nresent that. We talk about the fact that we want to continue the family \nfarm. The way we can continue the family farm is to take those folks \nwho do unfortunately pass away and eliminate the estate tax. But, \nunfortunately, our friends on the other side don't agree with us about \nthat.\n  Let me just say the commission to which Senator Grassley referred, \nand others have referred, was a commission created in the 2002 farm \nbill made up of farmers from Kansas, Texas, Mississippi, Illinois, \nNorth Dakota, Iowa, Georgia, Arizona, as well as USDA. That commission \nmade strong recommendations that we should not change this payment \nlimitation provision during the course of this farm bill. That is a \ndiscussion that should be held in the next farm bill debated in 2007. I \nsubmit that is when it ought to be.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, is it now in order to move on to the \namendment of the Senator from New Mexico?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized to offer his amendment, \nwith time equally divided in the next 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak. \nBefore I do, I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. The \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee used the word ``resent''--I don't \nremember the exact context--and suggested that somehow what has been \npresented on the floor of the Senate about the size of the corporate \nagrifactories sucking money out of this farm program is inaccurate. I \nstand by my statement and say there is plenty of evidence. I will put \neven more in the Record about the size of these enterprises that are \nsucking massive amounts of money out of the farm program at a time when \nfamily farmers are seeing their farm program payments cut. That is the \npurpose of our amendment.\n  I don't wish to extend this any great length. I only respond because \nthe Senator used my name. I will be happy to put in the Record the \nspecific and exact representations about the size of family farmers, \nthe largest corporate agrifactories taking massive amounts of money out \nof the program trough. I want family farmers to be available to have \naccess to that farm program payment that they need in order to survive. \nThat is the purpose of the amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for allowing me to respond.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2365\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Leahy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2365.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To prevent a severe reduction in the Federal medical \n assistance percentage determined for a State for fiscal year 2006 and \n   to extend rebates for prescription drugs to enrollees in Medicaid \n                      managed care organizations)\n\n       On page 188, after line 24, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 6037.

Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today is \nvery similar and essentially the same as the bipartisan language in S. \n1007, entitled the Medicaid Formula Fairness Act of 2005. That bill, as \nwe introduced it, had Senators Snowe, Rockefeller, Hutchison, Reed, \nJeffords, Lincoln, Leahy, Chafee, Pryor, and Johnson as cosponsors. \nThis amendment provides 30 States with protection from serious \ndecreases in the amount of Federal funding that they would otherwise \nreceive in fiscal year 2006 in the Medicaid Program.\n  Let me put up this chart to give Members an idea of who I am talking \nabout. This chart shows the States that are going to see cuts in their \nMedicaid Program in the current fiscal year. That is the fiscal year \nthat started the 1st of October.\n  Let me point to Alaska. The bill before us today provides that Alaska \nhas a full hold-harmless from the estimated $135 million they were \nscheduled to lose over the next 2 years under Medicaid because of the \ndemographic changes that Medicaid has calculated in a somewhat archaic \nway. That is in the current bill. The amendment I am offering does not \nchange that. The amendment I am offering leaves that alone. It does not \ndeal with the State of Alaska. My amendment tries to deal with the \nother 30 States, the red ones shown on this map, the other 30 States \nthat are adversely affected by these\n\n[[Page S12186]]\n\ncuts in Medicaid in the current fiscal year.\n  In the case of Alaska, the underlying bill says we are going to hold \nAlaska totally harmless from any cuts over a 2-year period. My \namendment says we are going to reduce the size of the cuts for these \nother 30 States so that they will not take as much of a cut as they \notherwise would. We say they can have up to a half of a percent of cut \nbut not more than that. It is a 1-year amendment. It is not a 2-year \namendment, as the underlying bill provides for the State of Alaska.\n  Currently, due to a technical change made in the calculation of per \ncapita income data, which is a major component of the calculation of \nthe Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP, there are \n30 States that are scheduled to lose over $800 million in Federal \nMedicaid matching funds. This is for the year we are already in. My \namendment would limit the negative impact that the loss of Federal \nMedicaid funds would have on the 30 States, the vulnerable populations \nthat they serve, and the safety net providers who serve Medicaid \npatients. It does so by holding those States to no more than a .5 \npercentage point drop in their matching rate.\n  Let me emphasize: The amendment does not even hold States fully \nharmless. We are not asking to do that. We are not urging that the \nStates should not take some cut. The amendment also allows States to \nreceive the better of either the current FMAP or an FMAP formula that \ndoes not re-benchmark per capita income data for fiscal years 2001 and \n2002. States should not be taking a loss in hundreds of millions of \ndollars in their Medicaid matching funds due to a technical revision to \ntheir per capita income calculations made by the Department of Commerce \nin 2004 but being retroactively applied to data in 2001 and 2002. And \nthat is exactly what is happening under current law. The approach makes \nlittle sense. Both the States and the low-income beneficiaries across \nthis Nation should not have to bear the negative consequences of this \nkind of a technical change.\n  For those who are still not persuaded, let me give additional reasons \nwe should not allow the 30 States that are in red on this map of the \nUnited States to lose over $800 million in Federal matching funds.\n  The first reason is, as the chart indicates, of the 30 States that \nbenefit from the amendment, 27 have received emergency declarations due \nto Hurricane Katrina. That includes the States of Mississippi, \nLouisiana, and Alabama, and 24 other States that received similar \nemergency declarations due to the influx of evacuees.\n  Second, States are also absorbing costs with respect to the \nimplementation of the Medicare prescription drug benefit right now. \nThey will continue to absorb those costs throughout fiscal year 2006. \nAlthough States are expected to receive a benefit in the long run, in \nthe short run they are being hit with hundreds of millions of dollars \nin costs. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that \nStates will absorb an additional $900 million in added costs in fiscal \nyear 2006 due to the prescription drug bill's implementation. The FMAP \ndrop to our States that I am talking about in my amendment compounds \nthe problem for our States.\n  One of the arguments against the amendment is, we don't have enough \nmoney. We can't afford this. Anyone who has really looked at this bill \nknows that is not the case. One item that I will mention as an example \nis this extension of the milk program, the dairy subsidy program that \nis going to cost another billion dollars, according to the provisions \nof this bill. The justification for this is minimal. It is something \nfor which most of the benefit will go to four States. It is not a good \nexpenditure of taxpayer dollars. It is just one example. I am sure \nthere are many others I could cite.\n\n  We have this amendment fully offset. We have found an offset that we \nbelieve the Parliamentarian agrees will more than cover the cost of the \namendment. The benefits to my State are substantial. The amendment does \nnot restore all of the $79 million that we are expected to lose in \nMedicaid funds because of this change in the Federal matching \npercentage next year, but it does reduce the size of that reduction so \nthat instead of a $79 million cut in Medicaid funding to New Mexico, we \nwould see a reduction of $13 million. This is more manageable. This \nwould allow our State to reverse the policies it has put in place that \nhave resulted in more uninsured children. I am sure a similar \ncircumstance exists for most of the other States, or all of the other \nStates I am mentioning.\n  The amendment would provide substantial benefits to each of the \nStates that are in red on this chart. Since I know Members are \nlistening, some of them in their offices and some of their staffs, let \nme elaborate on the extent of the relief that the amendment would \nprovide to the 30 States I mentioned: In the case of Alabama, there is \n$34 million in relief; in the case of Arizona, $22 million; Arkansas, \n$14 million; Delaware, $2 million; Florida, $25 million; Georgia, $8 \nmillion; Idaho, $5 million; Kansas, $2 million; Kentucky, $2 million; \nLouisiana, $43 million; Maine, $35 million; Michigan, $2 million; \nMississippi, $22 million; Montana, $6 million; Nevada, $17 million.\n  As I mentioned, the cut would be reduced for New Mexico in the amount \nof $66 million. Fourteen million would be preserved in North Carolina; \n$6 million in North Dakota; $52 million for Oklahoma; $6 million for \nOregon; $8 million for Rhode Island; $6 million for South Carolina; $3 \nmillion for South Dakota; $27 million for Tennessee; $113 million for \nTexas; $14 million for Utah; $10 million for Vermont; $27 million for \nWest Virginia; $9 million for Wisconsin; and $13 million for Wyoming.\n  This is a good amendment. It does not say the States should not cut \nback on their Medicaid or should not suffer some cut in Federal \nMedicaid funding, but it says that cut should not be as significant as \nwould otherwise be the case.\n  We can afford this. This is an amendment that is offset. I believe it \nis a very meritorious amendment and one that should be adopted as part \nof the underlying bill, and I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  At this point I yield the floor. I see my colleague is anxious to \nspeak, so I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  First of all, the Senator from New Mexico works very closely and very \nhard as a member of the committee I chair. I appreciate his hard work \nand he should not take personal anything I am saying about his \namendment.\n  Let me remind people what the Federal medical assistance percentage \nis all about. We call that FMAP for short. It sets the amount of money \nthat the Federal Government contributes toward the costs of a State's \nMedicaid Program.\n  When States are doing well economically, their Federal share goes \ndown. Then when States need more help, when their economy is not doing \nso well, their Federal share goes up. That is the way the formula was \ndesigned. That is the way it has worked. It seems it has worked well \nfor a long period of time. It helps States that need more resources \nbecause they have more low-income individuals who will qualify for \nMedicaid.\n  Of course, that is another part of the formula. And that makes a lot \nof sense because it targets scarce Federal resources to States with the \nlargest number of people enrolled in Medicaid. That is the way the \nprogram has been on the books since 1965 when it was first enacted.\n  The Federal contribution, the FMAP, is recalculated each year. As it \nturns out, at the beginning of the current fiscal year many States saw \ntheir Federal share go down, but other States saw their Federal share \ngo up.\n  So what is the argument that 2006 should be different than any other \nyear? The argument apparently is that this is different because the \nCensus Bureau updated data and that made the FMAP in a few States go \ndown. But the data from the Census Bureau is designed to make the \nFederal share amounts more accurate. We should seek accuracy in any \nformulas we have and the statistics that back up those formulas. That \nis just good common sense, the way Government ought to operate. And, of \ncourse, the Census Bureau goes through this very same exercise not just \nrecently--I mean recently but not just for the first time--every 5\n\n[[Page S12187]]\n\nyears, so this is not something new, and this is done to make sure the \nrate for Federal contributions to Medicaid, or the FMAP, is set \naccurately.\n  Of course, that is what we want. The Federal share should be set \naccording to an accurate formula, and the amount of money that goes to \neach State ought to be a very accurate amount of money. This is the \ngoal and that is what has happened with the improved data of the Census \nBureau.\n  The States that are affected do not want, of course, to see their \nFederal share go down, and it is very obvious that Senators, \naccordingly, would fight for the interests of their States. But \nCongress--if you look at the responsibility of all of us for the entire \ncountry--cannot come in every year and override the FMAP formula, \nbecause that defeats the whole purpose of having a formula in the first \nplace.\n  The Federal share went down in these States this year because, oddly \nenough, it was supposed to go down. In some years, the Federal share \ngoes up in a majority of the States instead of going down. And \nsurprise--that is the way it is supposed to work. When the Federal \nshare goes up, I can't recall anyone lobbying me as chairman of the \ncommittee to override the formula to lower their Federal share instead \nof increasing it.\n  If your general argument is that the formula is broken, it is going \ndown for 29 States, doesn't that mean it is not broken for the other 21 \nStates? Is it your argument that the formula only works when the States \nget more money?\n  It is true that the fluctuation in the Federal share calculation can \ncreate problems in States. I don't doubt that. If the States want to \nlimit the amount of decreases--and the increases in Federal funding--\nthen that is something that I would be willing to discuss further. I \nwould be willing to work with anybody in this body in the future to \nbring greater predictability to the process.\n  This summer, as an example, I worked on a proposal to do that with my \ncounterpart on the Democratic side of my committee, Senator Baucus of \nMontana. This proposal would put limits on how far the FMAP could go up \nor go down in any given year--in other words, to smooth out the peaks \nand valleys. It gives States predictability on their Federal share, and \nit would certainly bring stability to the process. I would be willing \nto introduce the Federal share corridor proposal that Senator Baucus \nworked on over the summer and have anybody in this body join us as \ncosponsors.\n  Finally, increasing the Federal share for 29 States this year \nnecessarily means that we create an even bigger problem in the year \n2007. This is then trying to solve one problem and creating another \nproblem. We will be back here next year to solve that problem--create a \nbigger problem in 2008 and be back here to solve that problem in 2008. \nMost of the States are projected to see slight increases in 2007. By \nholding all States harmless this year, their decreases the following \nyear will be greater. Are these States going to come back again next \nyear and ask for another temporary fix to get more money for their \nMedicaid Program? I guess I don't have to tell you the answer to that \nquestion. You know what the answer is. They are not going to be here to \nvoluntarily give up something.\n\n  I also question the offset included in this amendment to pay for the \nnew spending. This amendment would further increase the rebate paid by \ndrug manufacturers. It would do this by forcing manufacturers to pay \nStates rebates for drugs dispensed through the Medicaid managed care \nplan.\n  The bill we are considering today already increases the rebate paid \nby drug manufacturers from 15.1 to 17 percent. The bill also makes the \ndrug manufacturers pay millions more in rebates by closing a pair of \nloopholes in the rebate program. All together this bill already \nincreases the rebates drug manufacturers are forced to pay by $1.7 \nbillion. So this was not a source of revenue that my committee \noverlooked.\n  I understand my colleague might not think that is enough, but I would \nencourage him to look at the CBO report put out this past June \nexamining the price of name-brand drugs. That report shows that the \neffective rebate being paid by drug manufacturers is actually 31.4 \npercent and not 15 percent.\n  I am also concerned about the substantive implications of the \namendment. These Medicaid health plans are private businesses that can \nnegotiate low drug prices. Yes, that is the way it was set up, so plans \nwould negotiate lower drug prices. They already negotiate the best \nprice of the marketplace. The States already get the benefit of those \nlower drug prices that these plans negotiate. Making the manufacturers \nthen pay rebates for drugs on top of what is already negotiated is the \nsame as making them pay a double rebate for those drugs. Of course, \nthat makes no sense.\n  Yes, I do realize that the Medicaid Commission accepted this \namendment in its recommendations, but I am quite certain the Medicaid \nCommission's stamp of approval would not win support from Members of \nthis body for other proposals that we are considering today.\n  We have looked at this area. We have come up with responsible \npolicies that address loopholes, and I don't think we need to further \nincrease the rebate beyond what is already included in this bill. \nTherefore, with due respect for my colleague from New Mexico, I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the amendment and the offset that funds it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the situation relative to time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is 5 minutes on the side of the \nSenator from Iowa and 2 minutes for the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will yield myself time off that of the \nSenator from Iowa, and I would simply say that I think the Senator from \nIowa has summarized the reasons this proposal should be opposed. I want \nto reinforce that.\n  We have a formula in place. The whole theory of the formula, \nespecially the one adjusted annually on the basis of census figures, is \nthat there are going to be different States that win and different \nStates that are adjusted downward, and this formula specifically is \nadjusted based on income. If some States have an increase in the income \nof their Medicaid population, then clearly they are going to receive \nless in the area of Medicaid. If other States have people in the \nMedicaid population whose income goes down, they are going to receive \nmore. But if every year we step forward and those States which happen \nto have lost money under this formula are going to be held harmless, \nthere would be no point in having a formula and we would end up in \nbasic chaos as we moved into the outyears because of the fact you would \nhave built in so many grandfathered baselines.\n  So the Senator from Iowa is absolutely right. The responsible thing \nto do here is support the law as it is presently structured. More \nimportantly, the Senator from Iowa is correct in saying that the \noffsets which are proposed here really are a little illusory. First \noff, they have been proposed to be used in three other amendments \nalready. I don't know how many more amendments we are going to get, but \nthese offsets are becoming the custom fees of this round. It is really \nincredible to claim this offset.\n  In addition, of course, this offset by its very nature is punitive in \nthat it basically double-taxes those people who are supplying \npharmaceuticals to low-income individuals and we know that somebody is \ngoing to have to pay that. And that is probably going to be the States \nagain. They are going to have to renegotiate their pharmaceutical \ncontracts, and so you are going to take from one hand and give to one \nset of States and basically gerrymandering a formula that had already \nbeen put in place and put in place through reasonable allocations, \nwhile at the same time you are going to create an offset, should it \npass, that would essentially cost other States money or maybe the \nStates getting the new money. It may be a wash for some States in the \nend.\n  So as a practical matter, although the amendment, obviously, is well-\nintentioned--and clearly the Senator from New Mexico doesn't want his \nState to be impacted by the adjustment in the formula--it ignores the \nreality on the ground, which is that this formula is exactly that, to \nbe adjusted for change in the population and the economic status of \nthat population.\n\n[[Page S12188]]\n\n  So I do hope we would oppose it when we get around to voting on it \ntomorrow sometime. At this point I would reserve the remainder of our \ntime, if the distinguished Senator from New Mexico wishes to wrap up.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have 2 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just say about all of the talk \nabout how this formula is sort of inviolate and we don't want Congress \nto in any way change it, the underlying bill says it doesn't apply to \nAlaska. We are just writing into this bill there is going to be no cut \nin Alaska regardless of what the formula says. So all I am saying is \nlet's at least do something to lessen the extent of the burden we are \nputting on these other 30 States that I am talking about.\n  I don't think that is too much of a change. The underlying bill also \nchanges the formula with regard to Katrina victims, which is \nappropriate, 100 percent Federal matching funds for Katrina victims \nunder Medicaid. I think that is entirely appropriate. We have changed \nthis formula five or six times in the last few years. It would be \nappropriate to do this again. I think it is the right thing to do. It \nwill not only help our States, but it will help the people our States \nare trying to serve through the Medicaid Program. We have a great many \nin New Mexico. We have over 400,000 people in our State who depend upon \nMedicaid. It is absolutely essential that the State have the resources, \nincluding Federal resources, to provide the services, to continue to \nprovide the services for the children and the adults who are eligible \nunder that Medicaid Program.\n  So I believe this is good legislation. This is a good amendment.\n  I hear that the offset would be an extra burden on the States. CBO \nsays this is a savings for the States, that this offset saves money for \nthe States. So, in fact, I think it is a good amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would note the next amendment will be \nthat of Senator Byrd, who I understand is on his way, and he has the \nfloor beginning at 2 o'clock. I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are making very good progress. It is \nvery important that we stay on track.\n  The next amendment is a Byrd amendment on visa reform. That is to be \nfollowed by a Lott-Lautenberg amendment on Amtrak, followed by a McCain \namendment in the 3:30 to 4:15 p.m. timeframe, then a Murray amendment \non dual eligible from 4:15 to 5 p.m., an Ensign amendment from 5 to \n5:30 p.m., and finally a Landrieu amendment or an amendment by someone \nI might designate from 5:30 to 6 p.m.\n  We only have 4 hours of debate left on the reconciliation matter. All \nof the time has been allocated.\n  I am informed that Senator Byrd is on his way.\n  I very much hope that Senators understand, because of the events of \nyesterday and because of the very tight time limitations under \nreconciliation, there simply was not additional time for other \namendments.\n  Obviously, we will be going to votes on amendments tomorrow. I think \nwe already have some 15 amendments. That means at least 5 hours of \nvoting tomorrow. I hope colleagues will think about that very \ncarefully: 5 solid hours of voting tomorrow with just the amendments so \nfar.\n  I see Senator Byrd now entering the Chamber. His amendment is next.\n  I know the chairman of the committee shares the view that we need to \nmove through the rest of these amendments expeditiously and then \nSenators recognize that tomorrow we are going to be casting a lot of \nvotes. With what is already scheduled, already lined up, we will have 5 \nsolid hours of voting.\n  We are glad to see the senior Senator from West Virginia, who will \noffer his amendment. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we have almost completed the First Session \nof the 109th Congress and, incredibly, no serious debate about our \nimmigration policies has occurred. Not a word. No serious debate.\n  The number of aliens residing illegally in the United States stands \nbetween 8 and 12 million. Let me say that again. The number of aliens \nresiding illegally in the United States stands between 8 and 12 \nmillion--an alarming figure given the terrorism threat that confronts \nour country.\n  The level of legal and illegal immigration combined has surpassed \nhistoric records, causing increasing concern about the ability of our \nNation to absorb the influx. Our roads, our schools, and our health \ncare systems are overwhelmed and underfunded.\n  Go to any hospital in the area or in the surrounding area. Take a \nlook at what is going on. The waiting rooms, the emergency rooms are \novercrowded. Our infrastructure is just not ready for these influxes. \nWe are being overwhelmed. Go to the emergency rooms at the hospitals. \nGo over to Fairfax Hospital, for example, one of the finest hospitals \nin the country. There they are on cots in the aisles. I know because I \nhave been there. Our schools--how can we teach children when the \nschoolrooms are so overcrowded? What about our poor teachers?\n  Our infrastructure is just not prepared for this influx. Our roads \nare not prepared. And that infrastructure is being further worn away \nwith the budget cuts included in this reconciliation bill. Right here.\n  Immigration is an issue that demands the attention of the Congress. \nRegretfully, we have been told that tougher enforcement actions will \nhave to wait until next year. So imagine the surprise of Senators to \nfind provisions buried deep, deep, deep in this budget bill that would \nauthorize the Government to issue more than 350,000 additional \nimmigrant visas each year to foreign labor seeking to live and work \npermanently in the United States.\n  This is baffling. Baffling. Baffling. It is baffling, I say. If we \ndon't have the time to address the illegal immigration that threatens \nour national security, then how do we explain to the American people \nout there that we somehow found the time to raise the level of imported \nlabor each year? How do we do that? How do we do that?\n  On pages 810 through 815, separate from the deficit reduction \nmeasures related to immigration fees, are provisions in the \nreconciliation bill that would raise the annual cap on employment-based \nvisas and exempt the spouses and children of employment-based \nimmigrants from that cap. In addition, those pages include provisions \nto increase temporary H-1B visas for high-tech workers by 30,000 each \nyear. These are massive and destabilizing immigration increases, and \nthey are hitching a free ride--hitching a free ride--on this \nreconciliation bill; a free ride on this reconciliation bill. Hitch on \nit to get a free ride.\n  It is bad enough that so many American jobs are moving overseas and \nwages and benefits here at home are being curtailed to compete with \nThird World labor and unfair trade practices. Now these provisions \nwould make it more likely that working Americans will find themselves \nin competition with foreign labor for work in their own country and--\nand--is being done through this reconciliation process right here where \nthe immigration increase is clouded by budget provisions and where \ndebate and amendments are severely limited.\n  We are told that an immigration reform debate will take place early \nnext year. Senators are casting themselves as tough--tough, man. \nSenators are casting themselves as tough on enforcement and wanting to \nprotect American jobs. Well, that pronouncementstands in stark, stark \ncontrast to this effort under the cover of procedural protections and \nthe guise\n\n[[Page S12189]]\n\nof deficit reduction to increase the number of immigrants authorized to \nwork in the United States by an astonishing 350,000 visas per year.\n  These immigration provisions are not necessary for the Judiciary \nCommittee to comply with its reconciliation instruction, nor are they \nnecessary to achieve the spending cuts embraced by the congressional \nbudget. The House Judiciary Committee reported legislation to assess a \n$1,500 fee on L-1 visas for executives and managers of multinational \ncorporations and that savings provision more than satisfies the \nbudget's reconciliation instruction. So I hope that Senators will join \nme in striking these unrelated immigration increases and limiting the \njudiciary portion of this bill solely to an increase in the L-1 visa \nfee.\n  So the amendment that I will send to the desk is identical to the \nHouse language, excluding the provisions related to new judgeships, and \nwould raise the L-1 visa fee to $1,500 per application. Again, this \namendment simply strikes the unrelated immigration provisions and would \nstill allow the Senate bill to meet its reconciliation targets.\n  My amendment has the support of the professional employee unions of \nthe AFL-CIO, as well as immigration enforcement groups like Numbers USA \nand the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2367\n\n  I send that amendment to the desk and I ask Senators for their \nsupport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2367.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To replace title VIII of the bill with an amendment to \n section 214(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to impose a fee \n              on employers who hire certain nonimmigrants)\n\n       On page 810, strike line 17 and all that follows through \n     page 816, lines 21, and insert the following:\n\n                 TITLE VIII--COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\n\n     SEC. 8001. FEES WITH RESPECT TO IMMIGRATION SERVICES FOR \n                   INTRACOMPANY TRANSFEREES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 214(c) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1184(c)) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(15)(A) The Secretary of State shall impose a fee on an \n     employer when an alien files an application abroad for a visa \n     authorizing initial admission to the United States as a \n     nonimmigrant described in section 101(a)(15)(L) in order to \n     be employed by the employer, if the alien is covered under a \n     blanket petition described in paragraph (2)(A).\n       ``(B) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall impose a fee \n     on an employer filing a petition under paragraph (1) to--\n       ``(i) initially grant an alien nonimmigrant status under \n     section 101(a)(15)(L); or\n       ``(ii) extend, for the first time, the stay of an alien \n     having such status.\n       ``(C) The amount of each fee imposed under subparagraph (A) \n     or (B) shall be $1,500.\n       ``(D) Fees imposed under subparagraphs (A) and (B)--\n       ``(i) shall apply to principal aliens; and\n       ``(ii) shall not apply to spouses or children who are \n     accompanying or following to join such principal aliens.\n       ``(E)(i) An employer may not require an alien who is the \n     beneficiary of the visa or petition for which a fee is \n     imposed under this paragraph to reimburse, or otherwise \n     compensate, the employer for part or all of the cost of such \n     fee.\n       ``(ii) Any person or entity which is determined, after \n     notice and opportunity for an administrative hearing, to have \n     violated clause (i) shall be subject to the civil penalty \n     described in section 274A(g)(2).''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 286(m) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) is amended \n     by inserting ``, including those fees provided for in section \n     214(c)(15) of such Act,'' after ``all adjudication fees''.\n       (c) Expenditure Limitation.--Amounts collected under \n     section 214(c)(15) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as \n     added by subsection (a), may not be expended unless \n     specifically appropriated by an Act of Congress.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I see my friend, my bosom friend from Alabama, on the \nfloor. I am told that he is going to speak at this point. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Byrd for offering the amendment. There \nis a legitimate national interest in deciding how many of these visas \nshould be allowed, and in deciding how much the numbers should be \nincreased, if any. The matter came up before the Judiciary Committee, \nof which I am a member, within the last 2 weeks, the week before last. \nThere was a good deal of discussion and disagreement and my amendment, \nalmost identical to the amendment Senator Byrd is offering today, did \nnot fully come out of committee. The Judiciary Committee is not a \ncommittee that is in any way backward looking and is not a committee \nthat has no interest in having a fair immigration policy, but we had \nvery strong disagreements within our committee regarding whether \nincreases in H-1B visas and other permanent work visas were justified.\n  Senator Byrd is correct in raising the matter now and objecting and \noffering this amendment to fix it--what came out of the Judiciary \nCommittee. The current bill language will increase the H-1B visa cap by \nover 30,000 a year and increase the number of permanent employment-\nbased immigrants, not temporary, by 90,000 a year. Additionally, the \ncurrent bill language allows all family members of the workers to \nimmigrate to the U.S. and exempts family members from being subjected \nto the cap. They are currently allowed to immigrate, but are subjected \nto the annual cap. These changes compose a huge, important policy \nstatement. These extra visas will indeed increase revenue, because an \nadditional fee will be charged for each of these additional visas, but \nthis is not just a budget decision.\n  Now let's be frank. We are in a national discussion about \nimmigration. We need to be honest with ourselves. We need to do the \nright thing. We need to be compassionate. We also need to consider what \nis just, fair, and reasonable for our national interests. Any nation \nthat aspires to be a great nation has every right, indeed it has a \nresponsibility, to determine how many people come into their country \nand under what circumstances. We are into the process of debating how \nour immigration system should be reformed.\n  One of my first, biggest, and most important concerns is the timing \nof this policy change we might as well do this kind of thing as part of \nour overall immigration reform debate. We are going to continue it this \nyear and probably in the beginning of next year we will be full-fledged \ninto this discussion. To ram this language through as part of the \nBudget Reconciliation Act is unfortunate, and I do not think it is \nappropriate. That is why I support Senator Byrd's amendment.\n  What we come out with after we fully hear all of these issues \ndiscussed, how many the numbers would be, I do not know, but what the \nAmerican people are concerned about is all we ever pass is something to \nincrease the legal visa numbers, or to forgive people who have violated \nthe law or that kind of thing. That is what we pass and pass and pass, \nand they are wondering and have been asking firmly and repeatedly in \npolling numbers and when we go home to townhall meetings and talk to \nour people, in the phone calls and letters we get, they are simply \nasking, why do we not have immigration laws that are enforced? Why do \nwe not create a legal immigration system that actually works? Once that \nis done, they say, then you can talk to me, Mr. Senator, about how many \nmore people ought to be allowed in every year. Let us get this thing \nunder control.\n  So I think we are getting ahead of ourselves. I am not at all certain \nthat these numbers are necessary. In fact, I do not think they are at \nthis point. Just because somebody might be hired does not mean that \nthis country fully and totally needs them in the coming year as a \nsource of labor for our country.\n  Our Nation has been enriched by immigrants, talented, hard-working \nimmigrants. For the most part, that is exactly what we are talking \nabout. I do not dispute that we need to be discussing this issue. I do \nnot dispute that we may need to raise that number that we have today to \na higher number. I believe, though, the appropriate way to do it is \nafter hearings, after discussion, as part of the overall fix and at the \nsame time we can tell the American people not only have we been more \ngenerous to talented people who want to come and work but we have \ncreated a\n\n[[Page S12190]]\n\nsystem that keeps those who cheat, go around the law, undermine the \nlaw, to stop that from occurring. I believe that would be the \nappropriate, responsible approach to deal with it. I therefore will \nsupport the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alabama for his strong statement and for his support of the \namendment. His statement is very convincing, persuasive, and timely. I \nam very grateful for his coming to the floor and his joining in the \nsupport of this amendment. I hope all Senators will read his statement \nand learn therefrom and support the amendment.\n  I reserve any time that I may have remaining, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire controls 28 \nminutes. The Senator from West Virginia controls 9 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first I congratulate the Senator from West \nVirginia for bringing forward a thoughtful amendment, as always, and \nespecially for the fact that it actually, I believe, adds to the \nsavings, if I am not correct. So I cannot argue with that.\n  To be honest, I am not engaged in this issue. The bill was reported \nout of the Judiciary Committee. We have heard from Senator Sessions, \nwho is a member of the Judiciary Committee. I understand Senator \nSpecter is not going to have the opportunity to come over and debate \nthis because he is involved in a variety of other issues today. I am \nsure he has thoughts and opinions on this because it was part of the \npackage they reported.\n  I would like to speak briefly about the topic which the Senator from \nWest Virginia has raised because I think it is such a critical one, \nwhich is the issue of our borders and how we deal with it. I do have \nthe good fortune, along with the Senator from West Virginia, to have a \nresponsibility for the Homeland Security Agency, he being the ranking \nmember and I being the chairman of that appropriations subcommittee. We \nknow that we simply have borders which are too porous.\n  This year, with the significant assistance of the Senator from West \nVirginia, we were able to increase the funding relative to the number \nof Border Patrol agents to add another 1,500 agents when we count the \nsupplemental, and we were able to increase the number of detention beds \ntaking it up to about 20,000. We were able to add significantly to the \nnumber of immigration enforcement officials, and we were able to expand \ntechnology. We are nowhere near where we want to be. In fact, I asked \nmy staff what we need in this area and we really need a lot more. We \nneed about another 8,000 Border Patrol agents. We need about another \n10,000 detention beds. We need a significant expansion of the \ntechnology capability, satellite capability, unmanned vehicle \ncapability, helicopters, transportation facilities for our agents and \nphysical housing facilities. We need training facilities. There are a \nlot of resources that need to be committed.\n  As a result, basically, of the ramp-up time, it is very hard to get a \nlot of agents in place quickly because we want to get the right type of \nfolks. It takes awhile to hire them. We are only able to hire and train \nabout 1,500 a year. Hopefully, we can improve that.\n  Over the next 4 years, this is something I know the Senator from West \nVirginia and I are going to spend a significant amount of time and \neffort to try and make sure our borders are secure and that we do have \nborders where we can expect the people who cross those borders are \ncrossing legally. Part of it, of course, is making sure that people who \nget visas pay for the cost of issuing that visa. This is what this \namendment is about.\n  So I congratulate the Senator from West Virginia for his strong \neffort in this area. I appreciate his support as the ranking member on \nthe Homeland Security Subcommittee and of course the ranking member on \nthe Appropriations Committee. I look forward to continue working with \nhim on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my chairman for his sage remarks. \nLet me thank him also for the leadership that he demonstrates daily in \nthe Senate and in committees. I have great respect for him. I serve on \nthe Homeland Security Committee with him. He is a far-seeing, wise \nSenator. He acts in the service of his people and he too is concerned \nabout the protection of our country and its security. I thank him from \nthe bottom of my heart. I thank him for yielding.\n  Mr. GREGG. I obviously appreciate those generous comments coming from \na man who is truly a legend in the Senate and has done an extraordinary \nservice for this Nation over his many years in the Senate. I thank him. \nThose are very kind and generous comments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, several of the unions are very supportive of \nthe amendment I have just offered. Among these unions, it should be \nmentioned that the American Federation of Government Employees is very \nsupportive; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal \nEmployees; the American Federation of Teachers; the American Federation \nof Television and Radio Artists; the American Guild of Musical Artists; \nthe American Federation of Musicians; the American Federation of School \nAdministrators; the Communications Workers of America, including the \nNewspaper Guild, the National Association of Broadcast Employees and \nTechnicians, the International Union of Electrical Workers; the \nFederation of Professional Athletes; the International Association of \nMachinists and Aerospace Workers; the International Alliance of \nTheatrical Stage Employees; the International Brotherhood of Electrical \nWorkers; the International Federation of Professional and Technical \nEngineers; the Office and Professional Employees International Union; \nPlate Printers, Die Stampers and Engravers Union of North America; the \nScreen Actors Guild; the Seafarers International Union; the United \nSteelworkers; the Writers Guild of America, East. These unions are \ntrying to protect the health benefits and the wages of working \nAmericans, and they say that American workers are available to fill \nthese jobs.\n  The Department for Professional Employees, AFL-CIO, has a letter \naddressed to all Senators endorsing the amendment. Just to quote a few \nwords from the letter:\n\n       The 22 national unions represented by our organization \n     strongly support the Byrd amendment and urge your vote for \n     it.\n\n  Continuing, I speak again of the letter and call attention to these \nexcerpts:\n\n       There is absolutely no economic justification for expanding \n     the H-1B program. Unemployment among professionals in H-1B \n     occupations remains high . . .\n       Finally, it is worth pointing out that industry apologists \n     for off-shore outsourcing of American jobs have long \n     proclaimed that one of the benefits of globalization would be \n     the creation of high end, high skilled technical and \n     professional jobs for workers in the United States. These \n     same industries now seek to contract the number of these very \n     same high end job opportunities that should otherwise be \n     available to highly skilled American workers by once again \n     expanding the H-1B visa program.\n       On behalf of the 4 million professional and technical \n     workers that are members of our unions, we urge you to oppose \n     any action that would have the effect of making it more \n     difficult for unemployed U.S. professionals to find work.\n\n  Mr. President, Senators will please take note of these words on \nbehalf of these unions and the workers in the industries with which \nthey are concerned.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the Senator from Georgia 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, \nthe distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. I rise today in \nsupport of the budget reconciliation package passed by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and in opposition to\n\n[[Page S12191]]\n\nthis amendment. The Senator from West Virginia knows what great respect \nI have for him and his long-term service in this great institution. But \nI chaired the Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and \nCitizenship in the Senate Judiciary Committee during the 108th \nCongress. During that time, I worked very closely with my friends and \ncolleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator Grassley, to enact H-1B reform \nlegislation. That is the part of the amendment I wish to address.\n  One of the most important aspects of that reform was to increase the \nH-1B visa fee to $1,500 per application to fund education and training \nprograms for U.S. workers. In addition to the application fee, the \nlegislation added a $500 anti-fraud fee to every H-1B visa application \nto detect and prevent fraud in the visa program.\n  The reconciliation package passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nby a vote of 14 to 2, will generate $45 million annually from H-1B visa \nfees that will go toward scholarships and training programs for U.S. \nworkers. It will also generate $15 million annually to enhance \ngovernment enforcement of the H-1B program requirements that are \ndesigned to protect the U.S. workforce. These excess funds provide even \nmore muscle to the Department of Labor's enforcement and U.S. worker \neducation and training programs.\n  The Judiciary Committee's reconciliation package will allow for the \nrecapture of up to 30,000 H-1B visas that were authorized and made \navailable by Congress but went unused in previous years, provided the \nemployer pays a $500 fee for each recaptured visa.\n  I believe this proposal injects much-needed flexibility into current \nlaw by allowing the flow of these highly educated and highly skilled \nworkers to be driven by supply and demand rather than by an arbitrary \ncap each fiscal year.\n  Currently, only 65,000 H-1B workers are allowed into the U.S. each \nyear. Over the past 3 fiscal years, 2004-2006, the H-1B cap was reached \nbefore the end of the fiscal year. A similar shortage occurred in the \nmid-1990s when demand for high-skilled workers outpaced supply due to \nthe high-tech boom. Congress responded to the needs of the U.S. economy \nin the 1990s by increasing the H-1B cap to 115,000 for fiscal years \n1999 and 2000 and then increasing it again to 195,000 for fiscal years \n2001-2003.\n  By allowing the recapture of up to 30,000 H-1B visas for the next 5 \nyears, Congress will only be returning the total number of H-1B visa \nholders allowed to come to the U.S. to the fiscal year 1999 levels. I \nknow that many companies, in my home State of Georgia, ranging from the \nbiggest beverage companies and airlines in the world, down to small \nbusinesses, rely on access to these H-1B workers to effectively compete \nin the global economy.\n  Other companies rely on the expertise of foreign specialists to \nperform much-needed services their companies provide. For instance, \nrecently, a small company with 60 employees--all U.S. citizens--was \nawarded a contract with the Pentagon to improve rapid response \ncommunications between agencies in the event of a natural disaster or \nterrorist attack.\n  Not only are innovations like these critical to the security of \ncitizens of my home State, but they also can help create jobs for \nAmericans everywhere as demand for the innovation grows and the company \nexpands.\n  This company wanted to bring in a specialist from Northern Ireland to \nlead its development efforts. The company applied on behalf of this \nspecialist in August 2005 to come in on one of the available H-1B visas \nfor fiscal year 2006. However, there were no remaining H-1B visas \navailable for fiscal year 2006 and as a result, this company will have \nto wait until fiscal year 2007--14 months--to bring this specialist to \nthe U.S.\n  I am supportive of the increased flexibility provided in the \nJudiciary Committee's reconciliation package. When adequate U.S. worker \nprotections are in place, as they are in the H-1B visa program, with \nstrict wage requirements and labor market tests, Congress should \nfacilitate the success of U.S. businesses with our immigration laws.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 1 minute 3 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the National Research Council has estimated \nthat the net fiscal cost of immigration ranges from $11 billion to $22 \nbillion per year, with most government expenditures on immigrants \ncoming from State and local coffers.\n  Mr. President, how much is enough? How much is enough? In 2000, the \nCongress increased H-1B visas to 195,000 per year for 3 years, \nauthorizing over half a million new visas. Last year, the Congress \nauthorized 20,000 new H-1B visas each year, every year. The Immigration \nAct authorizes more than 140,000 employment-based visas each year. How \nmuch is enough? How much is enough? I say enough is enough.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join once again with the ranking member \nof the Budget Committee to remind Members that we now have pending \napproximately 15 amendments and that it will take us 5 hours tomorrow \nto vote those amendments. Tomorrow evening, we are going to adjourn at \n6 o'clock under any scenario, so if we cannot complete voting, we will \nbe here on Friday. I do hope Members will be conscious of that as we \nmove forward into the rest of this evening.\n  I understand when this amendment is over we will then be proceeding \nto the amendment by Senators Lott and Lautenberg relative to ANWR.\n  At this point, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, perhaps this is a good time to remind \ncolleagues of the lineup and encourage those who have remaining \namendments to come to the floor. If there is anyone wishing to speak \nduring the next 15 minutes, there is time available.\n  Now that we have gone to the Byrd amendment, the next amendment up \nfrom 3 to 3:30 is the Lott-Lautenberg amendment, to be followed by the \nMcCain amendment from 3:30 to 4:15, from 4:15 to 5 the Murray amendment \non dual eligibles, to be followed by the Ensign amendment on DTV from 5 \nto 5:30, and then the Landrieu amendment or an amendment to be \ndesignated from 5:30 to 6.\n  I hope very much that colleagues who have requested time watch the \nfloor closely. We are down to the last 3\\1/4\\ hours on the \nreconciliation bill in terms of debate time.\n  If there are those who have not had a chance to speak, if they watch \nthe floor closely--a number of these amendments may not take the full \namount of time--that would be their opportunity to talk.\n  As I have indicated, we have a few minutes left before 3 p.m.\n  If there are Senators listening or staff listening and their Senator \nwould like a chance to speak, either on the Republican side or on this \nside, this is their opportunity. This is one of their opportunities. \nThere may be a few more left, but it is a fleeting opportunity.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think it is important for people to \nappreciate what the Senator from North Dakota has said. Tomorrow, we \nwill a have a minimum of 5 hours of votes. Some of these votes are \ngoing to get fairly complicated because there will be points of order \nof various nature. People will have to be here all day and ready to \nvote.\n  If our membership remembers, during the Budget Committee, the Senator \nfrom North Dakota and myself took a position that we should move \nquickly through the votes, and we will take the same position tomorrow. \nMembers should be on the floor tomorrow all day.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I could revisit the point, I hope \ncolleagues understand what we are headed for tomorrow. It is not going \nto be fun. We already have 5 hours, at least, of voting tomorrow. We \nhope people take\n\n[[Page S12192]]\n\nthat into consideration as they think about their schedules tomorrow.\n  The chairman might remind us. We start tomorrow at 9 o'clock and we \nwill go right to votes; is that not correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Colleagues should be aware that tomorrow is going to be a \nday of voting one vote right after another. Votes have already been \nscheduled for 5 solid hours, at least. This is a time for restraint. \nThis is a time for colleagues to realize what it is like when we go \ninto these vote-aramas and to try to reduce the number of votes that \ncolleagues are asked to take.\n  When you get into this vote-arama, it almost becomes hard to fully \nappreciate and understand the votes you are casting. These votes come \nso fast and so furiously.\n  I hope colleagues are thinking about that as they consider how we \nconduct the business of the Senate tomorrow.\n  I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to the \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the manager of the bill \nand the ranking member.\n  I wanted to speak in opposition to the amendment filed by the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia that would strike the \nJudiciary Committee's H-1B visa provisions and insert a prior \namendment, the Sessions amendment, that actually was defeated in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  This, of course, is an attempt by the Judiciary Committee to comply \nwith the reconciliation instructions to generate some additional funds \nto meet the budgetary requirements of the budget resolution.\n  This is a part of the reconciliation process with the Judiciary \nCommittee to come up with some savings funds to meet the instructions \nof the Budget Committee. The Judiciary Committee decided to sweep all \nof the unused H-1B visas for the last few years and to use that as a \nmeans to satisfy the reconciliation instructions.\n  The ability to track and retain the best talent around the world is a \nmajor factor in American competitiveness. Arbitrary caps on employment-\nbased green cards and temporary visas for highly trained workers hurt \nour ability to track and keep that talent and ultimately jobs here in \nthe United States.\n  In other words, for all of those who are concerned about outsourcing \njobs out of America to other countries ought to be in favor of this \nJudiciary Committee provision and be opposed to the amendment filed by \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia. It will keep jobs here in \nAmerica rather than export them to places like India and China.\n  The Judiciary Committee in the House met its budget reconciliation \nobligation by imposition of a $1,500 fee on L-1 visas. The L-1 visa is \nused by multinational companies to transfer executives, managers, and \nemployees with specialized knowledge. This additional fee would not be \nused to improve processing or otherwise provide relief on other \npressing immigration issues such as the H-1B cap being reached 2 months \nbefore the fiscal year even began or 2 months after it began.\n\n  That proposed solution by the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia will do nothing to address that critical need of the American \neconomy.\n  Restoring access to the previously allocated H-1B visas will not only \nmake significant strides toward deficit reduction through the \nadditional fees that will be charged but also raise significant \nadditional sums for scholarships and training of U.S. workers. It will \nalso provide additional money for enforcement against fraud in the \nimmigration system.\n  The fact of the matter is the United States of America is not \ntraining a sufficient number of engineers and scientists. In 2001, only \n8 percent of all degrees awarded in the United States were in \nengineering, mathematics, and the physical sciences, which is more than \na 50-percent decline since 1960.\n  Today, more than 50 percent of all engineering doctoral degrees \nawarded by U.S. engineering colleges are to foreign nationals.\n  The United States must find a way to increase the pipeline of U.S. \nengineers. I know many companies already partner with U.S. universities \nand colleges, and indeed this is a long-term challenge of our economy--\nto create a sufficient number of homegrown engineers and scientists to \nmeet the demands of our innovative economy. But in the short term, we \nmust ensure that our immigration policies do not unnecessarily restrict \naccess to highly trained individuals, the kinds of employees that will \ncreate those additional jobs here in America.\n  Once again, the demand for high-tech temporary visas far exceeds the \nstatutory cap imposed by Congress.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, the fiscal year 2006 visas were gone 2 \nmonths before the fiscal year even began. They ran out in August 2005.\n  There is also a shortage of green cards, even for certain \nmultinational managers and executives. That means that in addition to \nthe years of processing delays, many immigrants must now wait several \nmore years for a visa to be available.\n  We need comprehensive immigration reform in this country. We need to \ndo more, a lot more, to strengthen our borders, to make sure that we \nknow who is coming into our country and why they are here.\n  Indeed, this body, I am confident, will be addressing that need for \ncomprehensive immigration reform in the near future.\n  But it is more than border enforcement--it is interior enforcement. \nIt is enforcement at the workplace. But it is also making sure that by \nsensible immigration laws we provide the trained workforce necessary \nfor American businesses to thrive and prosper and create additional \nemployment here in America.\n  On the other hand, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia has \nproposed no raising of the cap to keep unused H-1B visas from previous \nyears but instead to put a tax on the L-1 visa of $1,500 each. These L-\n1 visas are issued pursuant to trade agreements with countries such as \nChile, Australia, Singapore, and other countries so that when they \nconduct business operations in the United States, pursuant to these \nfree trade agreements, their managers and high-level employees can \nactually come here pursuant to that free trade agreement.\n  Likewise--this is the important part--our managers and high-level \nemployees can go to their country, pursuant to the free trade \nagreement, so that the benefits of this free trade agreement can be \nreached in the fullest.\n  It doesn't take much of an imagination to imagine that if we put a \n$1,500 tax on each L-1 visa issued to employees of some nation that has \na free trade agreement with the United States, they will simply turn \naround and retaliate and impose the same fees on American workers in \nthose countries.\n  Rather than producing additional revenue, this will, in essence, be a \nwash. In other words, this amendment does nothing to solve the problem \nabout a shortage of highly trained engineers and scientists who come \nhere because we simply don't have enough on a temporary basis so that \njobs can stay here.\n  This amendment does not solve that problem. This amendment, also, I \nbelieve, creates additional problems and distortions in our \nrelationships with countries with whom we have negotiated and \nauthorized a free trade agreement.\n  It is not only not helpful to the cause that we are seeking to cure \nby the Judiciary Committee's proposal, it is positively harmful in that \nit creates the potential for retaliation.\n  I wish we lived in a world where all of the good, high-paying, \ninnovative jobs we create in this country could be satisfied by \nAmerican workers. Indeed, the H-1B visa program requires that companies \nadvertise for Americans first and that they pay people who get H-1B \nvisas comparable wages with what an American worker would make so that \nthere is no manipulation of this visa to pay perhaps a foreign worker \nfar less and undercut the wages of\n\n[[Page S12193]]\n\nAmerican workers. There are already protections built into our \nimmigration laws to make sure that doesn't happen.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to vote against the Byrd \namendment. And I urge my colleagues to uphold the reconciliation bill, \nand vote it out as part of this package through the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the situation \nnow? I was told that we needed to call up an amendment at 3 o'clock. We \nare ready to go on. Senator Wyden, is he commenting on the subject at \nhand?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, that is correct. I want to propound a \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LOTT. I withhold recognition.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent once the Senate has \ncompleted its business on this legislation for tonight to be able to \nspeak for up to 45 minutes on the issue of bargaining power for the \nMedicare Program to hold down the costs of prescription medicine.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I have no problem, but \nthere are a couple of folks we have to clear that with. We will try to \ndo that promptly so we can arrange this.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If the Senator from New Hampshire has given me his \nresponse, I gather you would like me to hold off on my unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate that; or if we clear these, you do not have \nto stick around and we will make the request for you.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the offer from the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  When the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator \nfrom North Dakota have completed the processing of the various \namendments, I would like to have the opportunity to speak for up to 45 \nminutes. Perhaps other colleagues will want to participate on the \nquestion of holding down the cost of prescription medicine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2360\n\n        (Purpose: To reauthorize Amtrak and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I call up amendment 2360 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2360.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is in today's Record under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. LOTT. I take a few moments to talk about Amtrak and the intercity \npassenger rail. Several years ago, during the 1990s, I worked with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass Amtrak reform. We got it \ndone. It provided some improvements in Amtrak. It gave the Amtrak board \nsome additional authorities, some of which they have used successfully \nand some of which they have not taken advantage of. I even said at that \ntime I was convinced they could become self-sufficient, that they could \nmake enough changes, they could make enough off revenue that we would \nnot have to continue to pass funds each year through the appropriations \nproject for Amtrak.\n  I now am prepared to admit that is not going to happen. If we want a \nnational rail passenger system, we have to figure out exactly what we \nwant, how much are we willing to pay for it, and how that will happen. \nI don't think we can do it with appropriations bills each year. We are \ngoing to have to think more broadly and be innovative in what we allow \nthe Amtrak board to do. Some of the lines will probably have to be shut \ndown and some of the services curtailed. We have to make that decision.\n  In the appropriations bill that passed a week or so ago, the \nTreasury, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations \nbill, funds were included and some small reform provisions. We have to \ngo beyond that. We have to have some broader reform. In fact, the \nadministration has made it clear they will be in a position of having \nto oppose annual appropriations for Amtrak, the national rail passenger \nsystem, unless we have some reforms.\n  I started back in January trying to work through that and tried to \nsee if we could get some reforms. I did what I think is due diligence. \nI worked with the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Surface \nTransportation. I worked with the chairman of the full committee and \nthe ranking member, Senator Stevens from Alaska and Senator Inouye from \nHawaii, and Senator Lautenberg, my colleague from New Jersey, who is in \nthe Chamber. We talked about what we needed to do.\n  We also reached out and talked to the Amtrak board members, the \nInspector General, the Secretary of Transportation, we talked to labor, \nwe talked to the users, and we started moving toward developing some \nreform. We came to the conclusion of what is in this amendment. It is \nS. 1516, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act. The bill \nwas reported by the Commerce Committee in July after having had \nhearings. By the way, it passed with only one dissenting vote. It is a \nbipartisan bill. It is ready to be taken up by the full Senate.\n  I tried to help the leader find time to have this legislation \nconsidered in regular order, but have not been able to get it cleared. \nBecause of the way the Treasury-Transportation appropriations bill is \nwritten, I guess we could move to try to get this additional language \nin the appropriations bill, but I would like the Senate to know what we \nare doing here and have a chance to look at it and have a chance to \nvote on it.\n  I assume there is broad support for a national rail passenger system, \nincluding the Northeast corridor and for interstate rail service. But \nwe want some reform, too. That is why I am offering it here so it can \nbe considered, within reasonable time limits, and so our colleagues \nwill have a chance to take a look at it and actually express \nthemselves. I emphasize it was developed with input from the \nadministration, input we continued to include up until very recently. \nThe Inspector General, Department of Transportation, has been very \nhelpful in this regard.\n\n  The bill makes a number of important reforms to Amtrak. There are \nthree major themes: reform and accountability, cost cutting, and \ncreating funding options for States. By increasing executive branch \noversight over Amtrak, which they wanted and which I agree is \nacceptable, this bill ensures that taxpayers' money is used more \neffectively.\n  Under the current president, David Gunn, Amtrak has made some \nimprovements in its management but more needs to be done. They need us \nto give them the authority to do that. Amtrak must be run more like a \nbusiness. This bill requires Amtrak to develop better financial systems \nand to evaluate its operations objective. It forces Amtrak to improve \nthe efficiency of long-distance train service. People are not going to \nride a long-distance train if they are going to wind up arriving 12 \nhours late to their destination. Some people say we should cut out food \nservice and sleeper trains. Are you going to get on a train traveling \novernight from Florida into Washington, DC, and not have any food, not \nhave a sleeper option? Maybe we will have to evaluate that, but before \nwe start cutting out services, we need to see if we can't find other \nways to be efficient and make Amtrak attractive.\n  The bill reduces Amtrak's operating subsidy by 40 percent by 2011 by \nrequiring Amtrak to use its funding more effectively. The bill requires \na greater role for the private sector by allowing private companies to \nbid on operation Amtrak routes. Some people have reservations about \nthat. We have to think about ways we can provide better service at a \nsavings. This is one area we should consider.\n  The bill also creates a new Rail Capital Grant Program States can use \nto start new intercity passenger rail service. As a matter of fact, \nthere is a real need for this intercity passenger rail service within \nStates. It is being done in several States, being done pretty well, but \nin order to expand it we need a program that specifically provides \nfunds for it. This will not be the first time the States will have a \nFederal program they can use for passenger rail. But it will be a very \nimportant improvement putting intercity passenger rail on a similar \nfooting with\n\n[[Page S12194]]\n\nhighways, transit, and airports--all of which have Federal assistance \nthrough infrastructure. Some people say, my goodness, we cannot help \nAmtrak. Do we help the highways? Do we help the airlines? If we want a \ncomplete system of infrastructure and transportation, America needs to \ninclude rail as well as highways and air. States do not want to rely \nonly on Amtrak for intercity rail service.\n  It is unusual to add this to a bill that is intended to reduce the \ndeficit. I appreciate the work that has been done. I don't want to \ndelay it or encumber it, but time is running out. If we do not get some \nreform to go with the money, we may not be able to get the money. Do we \nwant Amtrak to wither on the vine? Do we want it to die because of our \nincompetence or failure to act? This is part of the process.\n  The administration has indicated it will not support any funding for \nAmtrak this year unless we do that. This gives an opportunity to look \nat it and speak on it. I hope my colleagues will allow us to add this \namendment to the deficit reduction package.\n  I yield to Senator Lautenberg for any comments, unless the chairman \nhas some action he needs to take.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator from Mississippi would allow me to inquire \nas to the time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. I assume the Senator from New Jersey will take the 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from Oregon wished to speak on the bill generally. \nIt does not appear there will be a number of people speaking in \nopposition. After the Senator from New Jersey uses the 6 minutes, I \nsuggest yielding part of the opposition time, should no one come in \nopposition, and I will yield that to Senator Smith from Oregon. That is \nnot a unanimous consent request; that is a game plan.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what is the distribution of time? I \nthought we had 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. You do, and you have 6 minutes left.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Six of our 15? Was that the arrangement, I ask the \nSenator from Mississippi? I thought we had a clear 15 minutes on our \nside.\n  Mr. LOTT. I was under the impression we had 15 minutes on each side. \nI used about 9 minutes of our time and there is 6 minutes left, so I \nbelieve you have 15 minutes if you want to use it. I thought it was 15 \nminutes on each side.\n  Mr. GREGG. But I understand Senator Lautenberg is a cosponsor, so he \ndoes not get 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am not hearing the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my understanding you are a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. But I thought it was clearly understood. I ask \nunanimous consent we have 30 minutes, except for the time used already, \ndivided in the presentation. This is an important amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent we be allowed 30 minutes, minus the time the Senator \nfrom Mississippi has already used.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, that means there would be no time in \nopposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Obviously, when the amendment was structured, it was that \nthere be half the time in opposition and half the time for the \nproponents. Right now there does not appear to be any Member here \nactively in opposition. Senator Smith would like to speak on the bill. \nI was thinking some of the opposition time could go to Senator Smith.\n  How much time does Senator Smith desire?\n  Mr. SMITH. I probably would not need more than 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield for a further request?\n  Mr. GREGG. For the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. DODD. Is it possible in some order here after the Senator from \nOregon, could I be heard for 10 minutes on the bill itself on another \namendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. I don't think so, to be honest. It appears we do not have \nany time, either, for Senator Smith.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Parliamentary inquiry: Who controls the time in \nopposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority manager controls the time in \nopposition.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The majority manager controls the time in opposition and \nthe majority manager is not in opposition.\n  Mr. GREGG. The majority manager is going to control the time in \nopposition.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I understand.\n  I ask the manager, is there a way we can perhaps parcel out the time \nin a way that would be acceptable to the manager?\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest that the Senator from Oregon can do his \nstatement in approximately half the time, 7\\1/2\\ minutes. Is that \npossible?\n  Mr. SMITH. I will certainly try.\n  Mr. GREGG. And we take the balance and parcel it between the Senator \nfrom Mississippi and the Senator from New Jersey since they were \nalready here.\n  As for the request of the Senator from Connecticut, hopefully, there \nis another window coming along so we can hear the Senator's concerns.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. How much time is still available to the proponents of \nthe legislation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Six minutes 22 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 10\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have several requests for time to speak on this \namendment. I wonder whether it is not possible to give us the \nopportunity to have those who would speak on behalf of the amendment \noffset by any opposition, in an equal amount of time, to give us 15 \nminutes to let the proponents make the case.\n  We will try to be as brief as we can. We will try to be as brief as \nwe can, so we can develop high-speed service for Amtrak and scoot \nalong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9 minutes 22 seconds in opposition.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest we get started and have the \nSenator from Oregon speak for 7\\1/2\\ minutes, and then the remainder of \nthe time will be available to Senator Lautenberg and Senator Lott as \nthey decide to divide it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized for 7\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Seven and a half minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, it is always difficult for Congress to save \nmoney. As the keepers of our Nation's checkbook, our main \nresponsibility lies in allocating our resources where they are needed \nmost. Instinctively, we as Senators like to send help to those who are \nin need, improve our infrastructure, and prepare for future crises. \nYet, in order to adhere to our budget, we are considering a \nreconciliation bill that requires us to save a significant amount of \nmoney.\n  While saving money during a time when there is so much need in our \ncountry is a very arduous task, the reconciliation package we are \nconsidering today is not only fiscally responsible but also morally \ndefensible. This is a bill that protects the less fortunate among us. \nIt takes pains to preserve the vital safety-net programs that millions \nof Americans rely on for such basic needs as feeding their families and \nreceiving proper medical care.\n  The package before us represents the work of five different \ncommittees and contains many hard-fought compromises. As is true with \nmost pieces of legislation, it is not perfect, especially when \nconsidering the many interests involved in an undertaking of this size \nand complexity. Yet when you consider the policies that are not \nincluded in this bill, I believe even many of my Democratic colleagues \nwill have to agree that this bill represents a true victory for our \nNation's poor because we found efficiencies through government and did \nso in a manner to protect people from harm.\n  In recognizing this victory for America's poor, I would be remiss if \nI did not thank Chairman Grassley for his diligent work in compiling \nthis bill. He managed to unite Members with diverse views and goals, \nmany of whom were skeptical of the process. For this, Chairman Grassley \nis to be congratulated.\n  I also commend Leader Frist for his tenacious efforts to hold this \ndelicate agreement together and shepherd it through the full Senate. \nThe same can\n\n[[Page S12195]]\n\nbe said for Chairman Judd Gregg who has, likewise, been patient with me \nand others and persistent in trying to accomplish this very important \npiece of legislation. To be sure, it is quite a challenge, but one \nwhich I am confident we will succeed in achieving.\n  Our greatest victory in this bill lies not in what is included in the \nreconciliation package but what we succeeded in keeping out of it. \nWhile all components of this bill are important, there are two areas \nthat if done incorrectly would have unraveled the very fabric of our \nNation's safety net system--Medicaid and food stamps.\n  Since March, I have worked with leadership to ensure that proposals \nintended to undermine the programs were not included in this bill. I \nestablished five very straightforward criteria on which to judge the \npackage.\n  First, the $10 billion in savings the Finance Committee was \ninstructed to find would come from both Medicare and Medicaid; second, \nthat any savings achieved through policy would not impact beneficiary \naccess or coverage under Medicaid; third, that we did not simply cost-\nshift to the States; fourth, that food stamps should be protected from \nreductions; and finally, that we would not utilize flawed and \nunjustifiable policies that result in cuts to services for the poor to \npay for spending on providers or people at higher income levels.\n  When you review this package, I believe you will agree with me that \nit meets all of these principles. This reconciliation bill protects our \nmost vulnerable and achieves savings by utilizing system efficiencies \nrather than placing an undue burden on our poorest citizens.\n  For instance, we did not put forward cost-sharing requirements in \nMedicaid. While some of my colleagues will argue that the poor get a \nfree ride under Medicaid and Congress should require them to contribute \nto their health care, studies actually show this to be a fallacy. In \nfact, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure \nSurvey, people with annual incomes under $20,000 contribute far more \ntoward their health care--15.2 percent, to be exact--compared to \nAmericans with annual incomes above $70,000, who contribute just 2.6 \npercent.\n  Additionally, because those who receive assistance through Medicaid \nhave such diverse needs, we should not assume a one-size-fits-all \npolicy will work for all States. In fact, looking at the experience of \nmy home State of Oregon, it is clear that cost-shifting does not \ngenerate money to be reinvested into the system; rather, it acts as a \nbarrier to care. Now, this may be the objective of some. It is \ncertainly not my objective.\n  Following Oregon's move to implement what they thought were modest \npremiums and copayments, the State only saved money because 50,000 \nOregonians lost Medicaid coverage. The State's own research shows no \nsavings were generated from the actual premiums or copayments. \nImplementing such a policy nationwide would result in millions of \nAmericans losing Medicaid coverage and joining the ranks of the \nuninsured and shifting the cost of their care to private insurance \nplans.\n\n  Another critical program the Senate protected from cuts--and for this \nI must commend my colleague, Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia--is \nfood stamps. According to a report released last week by USDA's \nEconomic Research Service, the number of households nationwide that \nwere food insecure increased to 11.9 percent, and those who are \nconsidered hungry increased to 3.9 percent. The major assistance \nreceived by these families comes through the Food Stamp Program, which \non average helped about 23.9 million people each month in fiscal year \n2004. It is also important to note that most food stamp recipients are \nchildren or elderly in poor families with a gross income of $643 per \nmonth.\n  Oregon has made bigger gains than any other State in the Nation in \nits fight against hunger, drastically reducing its hunger rate. USDA's \nreport showed that Oregon's food insecurity rate dropped from 13.7 \npercent of households in 1999 to 2001 to 11.9 percent for 2002 to 2004. \nThe report further showed that Oregon's hunger rate dropped over the \nsame period from 5.8 percent to 3.8 percent--the biggest decline in \nAmerica. Oregon's policy analysts and food relief leaders believe that \nthe State's aggressive food stamp outreach is to credit for the decline \nin Oregon's hunger rate. By 2002, 81 percent of those eligible, or more \nthan 427,000 Oregonians, received food stamps--the highest rate in the \nNation. I am proud of Oregon's achievement and pleased this bill does \nnot include any cuts which would jeopardize the tremendous progress we \nhave made in recent years.\n  We also excluded policies that, while cloaked as a crackdown on \nfraud, waste, and abuse, simply are known to result in cost-shifting to \nStates and private plans. One such proposal is called Intergovernmental \nTransfers or IGTs. Some have argued we should draw a hard line in \nFederal statute to prevent the use of IGTs. However, if you step back \nfor a moment and review the rules presently governing these policies, \nyou will find that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nalready has the authority to enter into these types of agreements with \nStates and to force States to change their arrangements. In fact, CMS \nhas required 26 States to adjust their so-called IGTs to better reflect \nwhat CMS believes is appropriate and has just 7 others to go in which \nit wants to make adjustments.\n  I fear that by drawing a hard line on this policy, we will remove \nCMS's flexibility to work with States to ensure that access and \ncoverage are not impacted. After all, some of the biggest recipients of \naid from these arrangements are children and public hospitals. Those \nfacilities are on the front lines serving the people in need.\n  We also rejected policies that would have abdicated the Federal \nGovernment's responsibility to ensure certain levels of access and \ncoverage for Medicaid beneficiaries. Many of the Governors support \ninstituting broad authority for States to restructure their programs by \nchanging benefit packages and eligibility standards.\n  As a former president of the Oregon State Senate, I am a staunch \nadvocate of States being the test bed of ingenuity. Over the history of \nMedicaid, we have seen numerous examples of States finding new and \ninnovative solutions to make their programs more efficient and able to \nserve more people. In fact, Oregon's creation of the Oregon Health Plan \nis just such an example of a success. However, I feared that in a rush \nto complete the budget reconciliation process Congress would simply \nprovide too much open-ended flexibility that ultimately would undermine \nthe cornerstone of Medicaid--ensuring access to a comprehensive benefit \npackage for those with diverse health care needs. That is why I worked \nto ensure that these types of proposals are left for when we take a \ncomprehensive review of the program that is based on a thorough \nunderstanding of the implications.\n  In developing this package, consideration was given to Medicaid's \nlong-term care program. It is unfortunate that our Nation has not done \nmore to prepare for the needs of an aging population. Medicaid \ncurrently is the long-term care provider for most Americans, regardless \nof their wealth. However, some policies were put forward that I could \nnot support. They would not have solved the problem, which is that some \npeople try to hide their assets so they can be passed on to heirs upon \ntheir death. Rather, I believe they would have succeeded only in \npenalizing unknowing seniors with limited money because of transfers \nthey made with good intentions to some of their family members or \ncharities. Instead, I continue to advocate for reviewing this system \nthoroughly and develop policies that encourage Americans to seriously \nplan for their long-term health care needs. Only then will we truly \naddress the growing challenge of an aging population.\n  Many of us have worked extremely hard to craft a reconciliation \npackage that is morally defensible and achieves savings through sound \npolicy decisions instead of arbitrarily cutting aid to those who need \nit most. By passing this bill as it stands we are sending a strong \nmessage that the U.S. Senate will fight vigorously for those who cannot \nfight for themselves. The policies we adopt as they relate to Medicaid \nand food stamps will be and must be the basis for any reconciliation \nbill that is ultimately considered by this body. We owe it to the \nAmerican people to let them know that their Congress will not\n\n[[Page S12196]]\n\nturn its back on our less fortunate citizens.\n  Hubert Humphrey once said:\n\n     The moral test of government is how that government treats \n     those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who \n     are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are \n     in the shadows of life--the sick, the needy, and the \n     handicapped.\n\n  In light of this standard, the reconciliation package before us is a \nsuccess and I offer it my full support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator from Mississippi, I assume, yields time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey, provided it is not more than the \ntime we have allocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 6 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi \nand commend him for the development of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I rise to echo the sentiments of Senator Lott, who \nserves so ably as chairman of the Commerce Committee's rail \nsubcommittee. Like him, I believe it is critical that we act to improve \npassenger rail service in our country.\n  One of the lessons we learned on 9/11 was that our Nation cannot \nafford to rely entirely on one mode of transportation. When our \naviation system shut down that day, Amtrak was able to reunite \nthousands of travelers with their families. We also saw chaotic \nevacuations during the recent hurricanes, with motorists stuck in \ntraffic for hours, and those without cars left behind. We need rail \nservice to help move our citizens to safety during emergencies.\n  And, of course, congestion isn't just limited to our roads. The DOT \nhas had to cap the number of flights at Chicago's O'Hare airport \ncutting 37 flights a day because of congestion. Even between here and \nNew York City, ground delays can be as much as an hour, when the flight \nitself is only 39 minutes of air time. We all know flight delays and \ncancellations are common. Coupled with long security lines, they make \nair travel increasingly stressful.\n  If we give people a choice that is viable and reliable, many will \nchoose rail. Amtrak enjoyed record ridership last year--more than 25 \nmillion passengers--and about as many travelers ride the train between \nhere and New York City as fly.\n  Other nations understand the importance of rail. Unfortunately, we \nhave been lagging behind. I remember a NATO trip I took from Paris to \nBrussels. There are 18 trains a day between these two cities. The 210-\nmile trip takes about 85 minutes.\n  The Europeans aren't any smarter than we are. They simply have made a \nsmart investment in passenger rail. Germany, with its modern, high-\nspeed rail system, invested $9 billion in 2003 alone. And the benefits \nof their world-class system are obvious to anyone who travels there. We \nneed a similar world-class system in our country.\n  States are in need of Federal leadership to help make improved \nintercity passenger rail service a reality, but the infrastructure \nneeds are prohibitive.\n  Our amendment authorizes funding for Amtrak's capital needs, as well \nas State grants for passenger rail. We make a significant Federal \ninvestment in roads--$35 billion a year. By comparison, we spend almost \nhalf that amount on airports and air traffic control towers.\n  This bipartisan amendment will ultimately provide millions of \nAmericans with more transportation choices.\n  So Mr. President, in the interests of less congestion, lower fuel \ndemands, and an improved environment, I ask my colleagues to support \nthe Lott-Lautenberg amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time back to my \ncolleague from Mississippi, should he need it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time do we \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 28 seconds.\n  Mr. LOTT. One minute. Mr. President, I have no requests for time. It \nis such a good bill and such a great amendment, I just cannot believe \nthere would be any Senator who would rise to oppose it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to be as accommodating to \nthe manager of the bill, the Senator from New Hampshire, as I can be, \nso I relinquish the floor.\n  I relinquish the time.\n  Mr. CARPER. I would like to thank Senator Lott and Senator Lautenberg \nfor working so hard to find a way for this important legislation to be \nconsidered by the Senate. The lack of authorizing language governing \nAmtrak--and all the entities with oversight over the railroad--has lead \nto sporadic, uncoordinated, and often contradictory actions by the \nadministration, the Amtrak board of directors, and Congress.\n  The year began with the President proposing to reform Amtrak through \nbankruptcy. Thankfully, this was answered by strong support for \ncontinued stable Amtrak funding in the House.\n  And here in the Senate, we have provided $1.45 billion for the \nrailroad in fiscal year 2006, allowing Amtrak to continue their capital \nimprovement program.\n  Much of this capital improvement program is designed to bring the \nNortheast corridor into a state of good repair. This is so badly needed \nbecause the Federal Government has ignored its responsibility to \nmaintain the corridor for decades.\n  There were also several authorizing provisions in the transportation \nspending bill, including language addressing food service and State \ncontributions to the Northeast corridor. While these provisions were \nremoved on the Senate floor, they were initially included because of \nstrong interest in improving Amtrak service and making the railroad \nwork better.\n  We may disagree on how to reform Amtrak, but that is the motivation. \nAnd we turn to appropriations bills when there is no opportunity to \nconsider a more comprehensive reauthorization bill.\n  Adding to the confusion, the Amtrak board of directors proposed their \nown reform package last spring. But since then, the board has changed \ndirection on some issues. For example, the board claimed in their \nreform package that separating the Northeast corridor from the rest of \nthe railroad's operations would be too complex and would not improve \noperations.\n  Then in late September, that same board adopted a resolution calling \nfor the creation of a wholly owned subsidiary to manage the Northeast \ncorridor infrastructure.\n  It is clearly time to pass a new reauthorization bill and set out a \ncomprehensive, steady policy for Amtrak. An Senator Lott and Senator \nLautenberg have introduced an excellent one.\n  The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act, S. 1516, was \npassed by the Commerce Committee in July by a vote of 17 to 4. It has \nstrong bipartisan and broad geographical support, including Senators \nfrom Alaska to Hawaii and Delaware to Montana.\n  The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act would reduce \nAmtrak's operating subsidies by 40 percent but would also authorize \ncapital funding for the States to invest in passenger rail \ninfrastructure. This is modeled on the incredibly successful system we \nemploy to support our highway and airport infrastructure.\n  Through the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act, we hope \nAct, we hope to create a national rail policy that allows Governors to \nmake transportation decisions for their States based on what the State \nneeds, rather than which mode of transportation is more highly \nsubsidized by the Federal Government. This is essential if we are going \nto have an integrated and efficient national transportation system.\n  I wish this legislation could have been considered on its own. But it \nhas been 3 years since the last authorization bill expired, and it is \ntime Congress prioritize our Nation's passenger rail system.\n  We need to move this legislation quickly or continued confusion is \nlikely at Amtrak. This confusion reduces the railroad's ability to \nprovide good service, troubles creditors and riders, leads to short-\nterm decision making and deferred maintenance, and costs the Federal \nGovernment more in the long run.\n  I urge support for this amendment.\n  Mr. BURNS. Just a few weeks ago, the Senate passed the Transportation\n\n[[Page S12197]]\n\nappropriations bill, which included $1.45 billion in Amtrak funding.\n  This amendment today represents the next step in continuing the fight \nto reform Amtrak in a way that preserves passenger rail as a necessary \ncomponent in our Nation's transportation system.\n  The Empire Builder, which runs through Montana, serves an important \npublic need, and I appreciate the work of Senators Lott, Inouye, and \nLautenberg on developing this reauthorization bill.\n  This bill provides needed reforms to help Amtrak operate more \nefficiently but does so in a way that enhances, rather than harms, \nexisting service.\n  Amtrak is a key component of Montana's infrastructure, and folks feel \npretty strongly about keeping the Empire Builder operational. \nConservative estimates indicate that the Empire Builder brings roughly \n$13 million annually into Montana.\n  Recently, Amtrak announced record ridership numbers for the past \nfiscal year--a trend we saw in Montana as well. Given the high fuel \nprices folks are facing these days, preserving alternate forms of \ntransportation is even more critical.\n  Amtrak continues to have widespread support throughout the country, \nand Congress needs to ensure that Amtrak remains a part of our Nation's \ninfrastructure. Part of Congress's duty is to make sure that Amtrak is \nresponsible with the Federal dollars it receives.\n  This legislation provides important reforms for Amtrak, including \naudits on amenities like food and beverage service, and sleeper cars. \nOn a train like the Empire Builder, those amenities are critical. On \nother trains, maybe some changes can be made. Each route needs to be \nevaluated for potential reforms.\n  Amtrak must work to reduce its reliance on Federal spending and \nimprove performance across the board. This amendment today moves Amtrak \nin that direction, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor.\n  I recognize that attaching authorizing language to the budget \nreconciliation is not the preferred method to move this bill. However, \nAmtrak needs to be reauthorized, and Congress must do its duty to \ndirect passenger rail reform.\n  So I hope that the Senate can agree to include this amendment today \nand take action on the important reforms that Amtrak needs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nLott-Lautenberg amendment to add S. 1516, the Passenger Rail Investment \nand Improvement Act of 2005, to the Budget Reconciliation package. The \nCommerce Committee favorably reported this bill in July of this year, \nbut we have been unable to get floor time for its consideration. As I \nsaid during our markup, I believe this is the most comprehensive \nreauthorization of Amtrak ever attempted by this body and I commend \nSenators Lott and Lautenberg for their hard work in putting it \ntogether.\n  Amtrak and intercity passenger rail are critical elements of our \nnational transportation system, and it is time for Congress to devote \nthe attention to Amtrak and passenger rail that we have given to our \nairports, highways, and other surface transportation modes. Amtrak's \ncritics and supporters alike agree that it is time to reauthorize the \ncorporation so that Amtrak has Congressional guidance on how to proceed \nwith important reform initiatives needed to improve service, grow \nrevenues, and cut costs. With time running out this year, adding our \namendment to this reconciliation package is probably the only \nopportunity for the Senate to vote on this important proposal. Senate \npassage of S. 1516 will signal our commitment to strengthen and reform \nAmtrak to the House and the administration, and hopefully, lead to \nenactment of a reauthorization this year.\n  Mr. LOTT. We yield the remainder of our time, Mr. President. Good \nluck, Mr. Chairman. You are going to need it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 58 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator \nfrom Mississippi being so concise and effective in their arguments.\n  The next amendment will be the McCain amendment beginning at 3:30.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, consistent with the prior discussion we had \nwith the Senator from Oregon, I ask unanimous consent that after the \ntime has expired for this bill, which occurs at 6 o'clock, the Senator \nfrom Oregon have 45 minutes as in morning business without the right to \noffer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2370\n\n (Purpose: To move forward the date on which the transition to digital \n                        television is to occur)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Sununu, and Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2370.\n\n       On page 91, line 6, strike ``April 7, 2009'' and insert \n     ``April 7, 2008''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment would do one very simple \nthing: It would move the DTV transition date forward by 1 year, making \nthe completion date April 7, 2008, rather than April 2009. This would \naccomplish the crucial goal of providing first responders with \ncritically needed spectrum one year sooner than is required in the \nreconciliation bill. This amendment, if adopted, could provide a \ngreater benefit to the American public than perhaps any other provision \nin this bill.\n  We know that first responders' ability to communicate during times of \ntragedy can be literally a matter of life and death for them and the \nvictims of natural and manmade catastrophes. This is a lesson that has \nbeen presented to us over and over again, well before Katrina and even \nseveral years after 9/11. Yet to this date, we have not made a \ncommitment to allocate the needed spectrum as soon as possible.\n  Almost 10 years ago, a coalition of public safety groups issued a \nreport asking Congress and the Federal Communications Commission for \nadditional first responder spectrum. In 1996, Congress promised first \nresponders would be provided with adequate spectrum for communications \nby December 31, 2006. However, shortly thereafter, Congress effectively \nreneged on that promise and set a bar for its fulfillment that would be \nunobtainable for decades. During a hearing held just last year by the \nSenate Commerce Committee, then-chairman of the FCC, Michael Powell, \npredicted it could be even ``multiple decades'' before the turnover of \nspectrum to first responders under existing law. That provision, which \nrequired 85 percent of homes to be available for high-definition \ntelevision, would have effectively prevented the analog spectrum from \never being returned, and that provision was never run through the \nCommerce Committee that I was chairman of at the time. It was never \ndebated or discussed. It was snuck into a bill by individuals at the \nrequest of the National Association of Broadcasters. It could have been \nno one else. That is a terrible way to do business. Unfortunately, more \nand more we are doing business by adding little lines into \nappropriations bills which never see the light of day.\n  I am sick and tired of it, and the American people are sick and tired \nof it. We are sick and tired of all the earmarks, and we are sick and \ntired of the billions of dollars of pork-barrel spending that occurs. \nWe are sick and tired of mortgaging our children's futures.\n  I am, most of all, sick and tired that the National Association of \nBroadcasters is able to prevent this transition from taking place at \nthe risk of American lives, our bravest Americans, our first \nresponders.\n  I will tell you what the Fraternal Order of Police say:\n\n       As Hurricane Katrina so clearly demonstrated, the ability \n     to communicate and transmit information can often mean the \n     difference between life and death. Congress should no longer \n     delay public safety access\n\n[[Page S12198]]\n\n     to this spectrum. Every year we wait is another year too \n     late. We cannot wait any longer for Congress to deliberate \n     over this issue. Therefore, we ask you to support a \n     transition date as close to December 31st, 2006, as possible.\n\n  That plea comes from the Congressional Fire Services Institute, the \nInternational Association of Arson Investigators, International \nAssociation of Firefighters, International Fire Service Training \nAssociation, National Fire Protection Association, the National \nVolunteer Fire Council, the North American Fire Training Directors, and \nthe International Association of Fire Chiefs.\n\n       Every day police, fire, and emergency personnel face \n     communications problems due to dangerously congested radio \n     communications systems. We need Congress to pass legislation \n     to complete the transition to digital TV and free the \n     spectrum for public safety use. The lives of first responders \n     and the citizens we serve are at risk.\n\n  That is signed by Chief Mary Ann Viverette, president of the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police.\n  Here we are, the lineup again, our first responders, the brave men \nand women who put their lives on the line in defense of the lives of \ntheir fellow citizens who have already given their lives, who have \nperformed so magnificently, who want to be able to talk to each other, \nwho want the spectrum freed up. And what do we do here in Congress? We \ndelay it as long as possible. It is disgraceful conduct on our part.\n  Let me tell you what the NAB says, the National Association of \nBroadcasters:\n\n       On behalf of America's local television broadcasters, I am \n     writing to urge your support for the digital transition \n     provisions included in the Senate reconciliation package. In \n     particular, we are concerned about floor amendments that \n     would harm television VIEWERS by either moving forward the \n     hard date or reducing the revenue allocated to assist \n     consumers in making this transition.\n\n  Get it? ``We are concerned about floor amendments that would harm \ntelevision viewers.'' They are worried about harming television viewers \nwhen the heads of the policemen, the firemen, all of the first \nresponders, everybody is worried about saving lives. So we are going to \ndecide, again, whether the National Association of Broadcasters carries \nthe day or whether we take care of those men and women who literally \nare putting their lives on the line every single day.\n\n  I have a quote here from Tom Kean, Chairman of the 9/11 Commission, \nconcerning his frustration and that of the 9/11 Commission, probably \none of the most respected persons in America:\n\n       What's frustrating is it's the same thing over again. I \n     mean, how many people have to lose their lives? It's lack of \n     communication, our first responders not being able to talk to \n     each other. . . . Basically it's many of the things that, \n     frankly, if some of our recommendations had been passed by \n     the United States Congress, could have been avoided. But on \n     the ground, the people that get there first can't talk to \n     each other because radio communications don't work. They \n     haven't got enough of what's called spectrum. So there is a \n     bill in Congress to provide first responders spectrum. The \n     bill has been sitting in Congress, nothing has been happening \n     and, again, people on the ground--police, fire, medical \n     personnel--couldn't talk to each other. That's outrageous and \n     it's a scandal and I think it costs lives.\n\n  I will repeat what Tom Kean, Chairman of the 9/11 Commission says:\n\n       That's outrageous and it's a scandal and I think it costs \n     lives.\n\n  I would like to have it earlier than 2008. I would prefer to offer an \namendment to set a date of 2007, as I did during the Commerce \nCommittee's executive session on this matter. Prior to that session, \nthe Congressional Budget Office expressed concerns about the revenue \nimpact of that earlier 2007 date. By the way, I don't begrudge the \nCongressional Budget Office for expressing fiscal concerns about \nperhaps not as much revenue as they can get. But is it revenue we are \nworried about or people's lives? The amendment failed very badly in the \nCommerce Committee. However, I am informed that a date of April 2008 \nwould likely generate considerably more revenue than the committee's \nreconciliation instruction of $4.8 billion, much closer to the level of \nrevenues expected under the April 2009 date than the January 2007 date \nthat I proposed in committee.\n  As such, this amendment's 2008 date should not raise any potential \nviolation of the budget rules. It is the best option we have at this \ntime.\n  I have a memorandum from the following organizations in support of \nestablishing a firm DTV transition date as soon as possible to clear \nthe megahertz ban for public safety use nationwide, the 700 megahertz \nban: Association of Public-Safety Communication Officials, \nInternational; Congressional Fire Services Institute; International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police; International Association of Fire \nChiefs; the Major Cities Chiefs Association; Major County Sheriffs' \nAssociation; and the National Sheriffs' Association.\n  Their memorandum is to Members of the U.S. Senate, dated November 2, \n2005. Subject: DTV transition.\n\n       The Senate Commerce Committee, in addressing DTV \n     transition, has set a hard date of April 7, 2009 by which \n     television broadcasters must vacate the 24MHz of spectrum and \n     the 700MHz band allocated to public safety. We applaud the \n     efforts of the Commerce Committee to address this critical \n     issue. Now, Senator John McCain will introduce an amendment \n     to set the date one year earlier--April 2008.\n       In 1997, as part of budget reconciliation, Congress set \n     December 31, 2006 as the date for broadcasters to vacate the \n     four television channels allocated to public safety. The \n     above listed organizations have sought ever since to assure \n     that date. Senators are well aware of the urgent need for \n     this spectrum to be made available, nationwide, to public \n     safety and our quest for the earliest transition date \n     possible. Senator McCain's amendment is an improvement in \n     that regard, and it has our support.\n\n  Here we are again, as we have been in the past. All of the brave men \nand women who don't stand to make a penny from this transition. There \nis no revenue that accrues to the National Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, to the sheriffs, to all of the medical personnel. They are not \ngoing to make a dime out of this. What they are going to do is carry \nout their mission, which is to save lives.\n  It is their view and that of the 9/11 Commission and, frankly, that \nof any objective observer that these people are unable to save people's \nlives because of a lack of ability to communicate with each other, and \nthe National Association of Broadcasters is again flexing its muscles \nto the point where it can very likely cost people's lives. So I hope \nfor once when we go home and talk about how much we support all these \ngreat public servants and what a great job they do--our chiefs of \npolice, our sheriffs, all of the people who guard us every day--maybe \nthe best way we can show our appreciation to them is to approve this \namendment and get them the spectrum they need in order to be prepared \nto save lives in the event of another disaster.\n  I do not have a lot more to say on this except that I ask for the \nyeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  At this moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Then I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the McCain \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could the Chair alert us as to the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 6\\1/2\\ minutes. \nThe time in opposition is 21 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And who controls the time in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire would control \nthe time in opposition if in fact he is opposed to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would be prepared to set aside the \npending\n\n[[Page S12199]]\n\namendment until such time as anyone else wants to come and talk on it \nor that my time expires so the other Members may proceed with Senate \nbusiness.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be set aside pending the \narrival of another Senator who may want to speak on this amendment. In \nthe meantime, other Senators may be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis graciousness and indicate that there are Senators who have \nexpressed an eagerness to speak, and what we have been trying to do on \nboth sides here is fit in Senators as they come to the floor. So this \nmay be a good time to alert Senators there are a few moments here that \nwould be available conceivably until 4:15 if Senators on either side \nwant to come and have a chance to make a comment. Perhaps it is also a \ngood time to alert Senators after this amendment we will go to the \nMurray amendment on dual eligibles from 4:15 to 5, the Ensign amendment \nfrom 5 to 5:30, and the Landrieu amendment from 5:30 to 6.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I thank the Chair. Again I want to \nthank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I also thank the Senator from Arizona for \nputting us in a position where the Members can speak. I have not had an \nopportunity to speak on the bill as a whole, so I would like to take \ntime on that, and if someone shows up in opposition to the amendment, I \nwill yield the floor to them to speak.\n  Now that the amendment has been laid aside, I rise today to speak on \nthe pending business of the Senate, which is the Deficit Reduction \nOmnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005, which is an extension of the budget \nresolution we adopted earlier this year.\n  I am very pleased that we have a budget and cannot express enough how \nimportant it is that Congress craft and follow a fiscal plan every \nyear. I have long advocated for a fiscal plan that includes strict \nrules for controlling the appetite of big Government and reins in \nspending. We are beholden to the taxpayer and to future generations of \ntaxpayers. The annual budget process should reflect that \nresponsibility. We must bear that in mind today as we debate this very \nimportant piece of legislation before us.\n  The 2006 budget resolution set forth a reconciliation instruction for \nsavings of $34.7 billion over the 5-year period of the resolution. \nCongress has not attempted to restrain mandatory spending through \nreconciliation since 1997. As my colleagues are well aware, mandatory \nspending represents the portion of the Federal Government that is on \nautopilot. Annual appropriators in the House and Senate allocate funds \naccounting for roughly one-third of the Federal Government's \nexpenditures as fully two-thirds of the spending is on cruise control. \nI am encouraged we are making an attempt to rein in even a modest \namount of mandatory spending. This entire process is, indeed, a test of \nthe body's willpower and integrity. Can we manage to make a few hard \nchoices today to protect the interests of our grandchildren?\n  Since 1974, Congress has passed 19 different reconciliation bills, \nand 16 of those survived Presidential veto to become law. Since 1990, \nreconciliation has been used three times to trim mandatory spending. In \n1990, mandatory spending was reduced by $100 billion; the 1993 spending \nreconciliation cut $96 billion; and the 1997 bill, $118 billion over a \n5-year period. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill \nbefore us today will reduce mandatory spending by $39.1 billion from \n2006 to 2010 and $108.7 billion from 2006 through 2015. By recent \nhistorical standards and contrary to the doom and gloom of several \nstatements made today on this floor, this is a modest reduction, no \nmatter how you slice it.\n  Once we adopt this reconciliation bill, we will be free to move on to \ndo the two other reconciliation bills allowed under this year's budget \nresolution. One of those instructions will increase the statutory debt \nlimit, a move I do not take lightly. The other of those reconciliation \nbills represents an instruction to the Senate Finance Committee to \nreduce the tax burden by up to $11 billion in fiscal year 2006 and up \nto $70 billion for the coming 5-year period.\n  This reconciliation bill will extend a variety of existing tax \npolicies that are very popular among the American public. For a change, \nI believe the popularity of these tax cuts is reflected in this body \nand I believe we will find a way to extend these important provisions.\n  While this is a debate we will have in the near future, I can't help \nbut express my feelings about that tax reconciliation. America's \nfamilies are relying upon us to extend these new tax policies that have \nbuoyed this economy in recent years. When considering the global war on \nterrorism, the broad economic impact of Hurricane Katrina, and the \ncurrent cost of energy in this country, one might expect the economy to \nbe sluggish. Economic data suggests the very opposite. It would be \nfoolish for this body to try to tinker with the policies that have put \nmore dollars in the pockets of America's workers to save, invest, or \nspend.\n  Some colleagues may disagree with my assessment and with the desire \nour citizens have to hold on to more of their earnings. I look forward \nto taking part in that discussion in the future. And that is a \ndiscussion for the future. The resolution we have in the Chamber today \nis not a tax extension bill. The Senate must discuss and debate the \nmerits of raising the debt limit and of extending the kinds of tax \nrelief that keep this economy humming along in such a healthy way. But \nthat debate will come later. Today we are talking about the first \ndeficit reduction bill since 1997. This is a major effort. It has been \n8 years since the Congress attempted to exercise any discretion over \nmandatory spending. There should be no illusions that this is a \ndefining resolution. We are not just defining this Congress or our \ncareers or the next series of campaign commercials; we are defining the \nscope of policies that will impact future generations. We must \ndemonstrate that mandatory programs are not destined to grow willy-\nnilly and without thought for those who have to pay for them.\n  We have heard a parade of statements these last 2 days that suggests \nthere is simply no way to reduce these programs, that too many people \nare dependent on these programs for them to undergo any sort of \nscrutiny. I say to my colleagues we are not only accountable to those \nwho benefit from these programs, but we are accountable to those who \nwork every day in America to pay for these programs. We must be \naccountable to those who are on the brink of entering the workforce, \nwho will face a greater tax burden if mandatory spending grows \nunchecked. The modest scope of this legislation suggests to me we can \nmeet the myriad obligations to those drawing on these programs while \nrighting the fiscal ship.\n\n  Since 1997, we have made no substantive step to control runaway \nentitlement spending. This year's budget directed eight different \nSenate committees to take a stab at it through instructions totalling \n$34.7 billion in savings. The committees were free to find greater \nsavings, and I am pleased to report that they did, to the tune of more \nthan $39 billion. All eight Senate committees exceeded their \ninstructions. This is no easy task and I commend the leaders of each of \nthese eight committees.\n  The Agriculture Committee's reduction has been scored by CBO at \napproximately $3 billion over the next 5 years. The package adopted by \nthe committee leaves unchanged the structure of the farm program \ncreated in the last farm bill while achieving some savings in the farm \ncommodity programs. Conservation programs are trimmed without impacting \nlandowners' or farmers' existing contracts in any program. Agricultural \nresearch programs and the food stamps program are completely untouched.\n  The Banking and Housing and Urban Affairs Committee portion of the \nbill is scored by CBO at a savings of $570 million. This legislation \nwill streamline and simplify the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings \nAssociation Insurance Fund, combining the two entities into the Deposit \nInsurance Fund. Additional provisions modify the policies of the FDIC \nto reflect inflation and the growing size of deposits by increasing the \nretirement fund size the FDIC can insure from $100,000 to $250,000.\n  Further, the Banking Committee has included provisions dealing with \nthe\n\n[[Page S12200]]\n\nFederal Housing Administration's inventory of defaulted mortgages. \nToday, in an effort to preserve a defaulted property as affordable \nhousing, the FHA may sell the property at below-market rates. The \nforegone proceeds from these sales may total $10 million a year. This \nlegislation will end FHA's permanent authority to sell such properties \nat below-market prices and authorize funds to support the \nrehabilitation of these properties.\n  The Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee section of this \nlegislation has been scored at $5.98 billion by CBO. The bulk of these \nsavings are generated by the auction of spectrum recovered from \nbroadcasters currently in the midst of the transition to digital signal \nbroadcasting. This spectrum, a long held and used public resource, will \nenhance public safety communications and advance the long-awaited \ntransition to DTV, or digital TV. Under this legislation, the FCC will \nbe directed to auction licenses for this spectrum in early 2008 in \nanticipation of the full conversion to DTV in April of 2009.\n  CBO scores the Energy and Natural Resources Committee title of this \nlegislation at $2.5 billion, achieved largely through the long-needed \nopening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Coastal Plain area. \nCareful development and production of oil and natural gas in ANWR will \nincrease our national security and energy policy and do so with a \nminimal amount of impact on this remote region of Alaska.\n  The Secretary of the Interior is directed to implement an \nenvironmentally sound and competitive oil and gas leasing program to \nensure the fair market value for the resources to be leased. I applaud \nthe Energy Committee for its efforts.\n  The Environment and Public Works and Judiciary Committees each \ncontribute somewhat more humble yet important titles to this \nlegislation. The EPW portion, which is focused on the reform of the \nEquity Bonus Program, a part of the overall highway program, carries a \nCBO score $30 million.\n  The Judiciary Committee title scores a deficit reduction of $578 \nmillion, largely through the recapture and subsequent sale of \nauthorized but unused immigrant visas.\n  The lion's share of savings in this legislation is contained in the \ntitles belonging to the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \nand the Finance Committee. These provisions also include those \nprovisions that are probably most exaggerated or vilified by the \nopponents of this package.\n  According to CBO, the Finance Committee reconciles a deficit \nreduction of $10 billion over 5 years through a variety of complex and \nimportant changes under Medicaid and Medicare. These two programs, \ncombined with Social Security, make up the bulk of our mandatory \nobligations that currently exist on autopilot. Today, mandatory \nspending accounts for 56 percent of all Federal spending.\n  On the brink of the baby boomer retirement, that number is expected \nto grow to more than 62 percent in 10 years unless we can find the \ncourage to do something about it. The path we are walking today is not \nsustainable.\n  As I have mentioned, this reconciliation bill attempts to deal with \nthis perfect storm by making minor adjustments to Medicaid and \nMedicare. CBO estimates that fiscal year 2005 outlays for Medicaid will \ntotal $184 billion. CBO's estimate for Medicare in 2005 is $332 \nbillion, for a total between the programs of more than $515 billion--\nmore than half a trillion dollars--for fiscal year 2005. The estimated \n5 year cost of these two mandatory programs is more than $3.4 trillion \nThe Finance Commitee's reduction in this legislation is $10 billion.\n  There is $3.4 trillion in mandatory spending reduced by $10 billion \nover 5 years. Our fiscal house is on fire, and we are talking about \ntaking a gallon of water out of the river to fight it, and you would \nthink we were drying up the river.\n  So the Finance Committee title of this deficit reduction bill \nincludes a net savings that some members of this body are exaggerating \nto mean the end of services as we know them. What very few opponents of \nthis bill are talking about is that in addition to this savings there \nare some very wise spending initiatives that will serve to make \nMedicaid and Medicare more responsive to the needs of those who depend \non them. As much as the doom and gloom set would like to talk about the \ndeficit reduction we make in this resolution, we must also discuss the \nimprovement and preservation of Medicaid and Medicare.\n  While achieving significant spending reduction the Finance Committee \nlanguage also reduces wasteful spending and targets resources to \nimprove Medicaid, achieving savings at both the State and Federal \nlevel. These savings will enhance our ability to serve vulnerable \npopulations. The language contained in this bill ensures continuity of \ncoverage for low income children by shoring up funding for States \nfacing shortfalls in the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nSCHIP, and expanding enrollment activities. This bill will also expand \nMedicaid benefits to encourage the parents of severely disabled \nchildren to go to work and earn above-poverty wages while maintaining \nthe services needed by their child.\n  This legislation also cracks down on fraud in Medicaid. This bill \ncloses loopholes in current Medicaid law concerning the transfer of \nassets to limit circumstances under which persons may intentionally \nshelter assets in order to qualify for Medicaid.\n  New requirements are included for States to apply partial month \npenalties and to accumulate transfers in computing the period of \nineligibility. Language in this bill creates useful new tools for \nexisting third party recovery programs by implementing State false \nclaims acts, which at the Federal level is the single most important \ntool taxpayers have to recover the billions of dollars stolen through \nfraud each year.\n  The Medicaid section of this act also includes some prescription drug \nrepayment reforms. This has been a hot topic in recent years, and I am \npleased to see us take action. Under this bill, the average \nmanufacturer price, AMP, is redefined to reflect discounts and rebates \navailable to retail pharmacies and then uses that definition for \npayments to pharmacies and for the calculation of best price. The \nlegislation before us further defines the weighted average manufacturer \nprice, WAMP, as the basis for a new payment system for these drugs and \nfor a new Federal upper limit for multiple source drugs.\n  These reforms go beyond what was asked of the Finance Committee and \nreflect a commitment by this Senate to enact sensible reforms to better \nserve the public. I appreciate the efforts of the chairman and the \nFinance Committee on this matter.\n  This legislation also makes a downpayment to respond to the health \ncare needs of low income families affected by Hurricane Katrina by \nproviding $1.8 billion to protect Medicaid benefits in Alabama, \nLouisiana, and Mississippi. These are among the important provisions \nthat will serve our Medicaid population and the taxpayer in this bill--\nand these are provisions being ignored by the other side.\n  Similarly, we see some commonsense initiatives in the Medicare \nportion of this bill. Of primary interest is the one percent increase \nin the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule instead of a 4.4 percent cut in \n2006.\n  This is of paramount importance to those individuals on Medicare \nbecause it provides incentives for physicians to stay with the system. \nWe are staring down the barrel of a punitive change in the Medicare \nsystem in the form of a fee reduction that is corrected in this bill--\nthat is good news for doctors and great news for patients. For Members \nof this body who represent rural populations, there are some very \nimportant provisions, including: an extension of the hold-harmless \nprovisions for small rural hospitals and sole community hospitals from \nimplementation of the hospital outpatient prospective payment system, \nan extension of the Medicare Dependent Hospital program that provides \nfinancial protections to rural hospitals with less than 100 beds that \nhave a greater than 60 percent share of Medicare patients, and an \nexpansion of coverage for preventative benefits under Federal Qualified \nHealth Centers. This is good news.\n  The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions portion of this bill, which \ncontains a significant savings and deficit reduction, accomplishes a \ngreat deal of reform and enhances service similar to the Finance \nportion. This title contains significant savings and deficit reduction. \nCBO estimates a savings of $9.8 billion, while priming our\n\n[[Page S12201]]\n\neducation infrastructure for the challenges of this new century. The \nProvisional Grant Assistance Program contained within this bill \nprovides approximately $8.2 billion in grant assistance to Pell Grant \neligible students studying math, science, technology, engineering and \ncertain foreign languages. This is a very exciting provision that \nrepresents that ability of the HELP Committee and this Senate to \nlisten. The rest of the world is gaining ground on America's \nsophisticated, high technology work force. For decades our technology \nand innovation has been the envy of the world and this provision seeks \nto ensure that we will continue to maintain that dynamic edge.\n  A well-educated work force creates high-wage jobs and expands our \nhorizons in every aspect of our culture. Again, this is a provision \nopponents of this bill seek to ignore, refusing to believe that there \nare noble programs among our sensible and necessary deficit reduction \nprovisions.\n  That is an all too brief summary of some of the provisions the eight \ncommittees receiving reconciliation instructions contributed to this \nlegislation. The constant mischaracterization of this bill amazes me. I \nhope in some small way that I have been able to clarify some of these \nissues for the public.\n  Under this bill, spending for low-income students, families, and \npatients will increase, and by no small margin. Without passage of this \nbill, more than $17 billion in loans, grants, sensible reforms, and new \nprograms to benefit families, students, and patients disappears. That \nis money to aid in the education of 5.3 million low-income students.\n  That is money to make Medicaid eligible 1.1 million low-income and \ndisabled children. That is money for 700,000 low-income children to \ncontinue to receive benefits under SCHIP. Not only is this bill not the \nend of the world, it appears to me it is an enormous reform and \nexpansion of numerous programs.\n  It is a credit to the authors of this bill that there is still a \ngross savings to the taxpayer. Ninety percent of that savings for \ndeficit reduction comes from a reduction in Federal programs that \neither do not impact low-income families or from receipts from the \nFederal Government's business relationships. The remaining 10 percent \nin reductions represents a serious restoration of fiscal responsibility \nin these programs--closing loopholes and preventing the unscrupulous \ngaming of the Medicaid system.\n  Before I yield the floor, I feel it is important to remind my \ncolleagues that this bill should be seen not as a landmark victory but \nas a good start.\n  If we are to do anything to seriously address the policy and \nentitlement burdens our children and grandchildren are likely to \ninherit we must start today and must continue in the future with \nreforms and sensible reductions in spending.\n  We are running a deficit of $319 billion. The deficit, while much \nlower than last year's, still represents our inability as policymakers \nto make tough decisions. Our failure to address the deficit, in this \nbill today and in the future, could have catastrophic consequences for \nthis Nation. Every day we allow spending to grow, either through \ndiscretionary programs or through the unchecked growth of mandatory \nprograms, increases our national debt. Today that debt stands at about \n$8 trillion, the debt held by the public accounting for $4.6 trillion. \nThis is a drain on our economy, and it gets worse every day that we do \nnothing.\n  I would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this good start. \nThe Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005 strikes me as \nbeing the least we can do for future generations. In the coming weeks I \nhope we will continue this discussion. I hope we will take seriously \nthe harm we can do by simply doing nothing.\n  I thank Chairman Gregg and the members of the Senate Budget Committee \nfor all their hard work on this legislation. The bill before us today \nrepresents a tremendous amount of work that began almost a year ago. As \nI mentioned at the start of my comment, this reconciliation deficit \nreduction legislation is a part of this year's budget plan, and I think \nit speaks to the power and importance of having a blueprint for our \nfiscal course. I look forward to working with the chairman and with my \ncolleagues to ensure that this legislation represents the beginning of \nnew, fiscally responsible, ongoing agenda to address our fiscal \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire wishes to speak in \nopposition to the McCain amendment. Do I need to call up the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator does not. The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, first I ask unanimous consent that the 45 \nminutes allocated to Senator Wyden occur after the debate on the \nAgriculture appropriations conference report this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Second, Mr. President, I would like to correct the \nrecord. I appreciate the Senator from Colorado yielding to me, but I \nwish to speak in support of the McCain amendment, of which I am a \ncosponsor. One might imagine Senator McCain would be enormously \ndisappointed if I came down to speak against his amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, will the Senator from New Hampshire yield?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. By all means.\n  Mr. ALLARD. There is a certain amount of time in opposition and in \nsupport of the amendment. I am not sure that we have it balanced.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Any time I use should be taken from time allocated in \nfavor of the amendment, if there is any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator McCain still has 5\\1/2\\ minutes under \nhis control.\n  Mr. ALLARD. How much time do we need for opposition statements? We \nhave until 4:15 p.m. allocated for debate on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is correct. We will \nproceed until 4:15 p.m. on this amendment. There is 6 minutes in \nopposition, as we stand at the present time.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallocated 3 minutes to speak in favor of the amendment and that the \nremainder of the time until 4:15 p.m. be reserved for those who wish to \nspeak in opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. To speak in favor of the amendment, which I cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment which moves the \ndate for returning spectrum that was allocated for the transition to \ndigital television ahead by 1 year. So instead of that spectrum being \nreturned to the Federal Government for use for other purposes in April \nof 2009, it will be returned in April of 2008.\n  I think this makes sense for a number of reasons. First, it moves \nforward this process of transition. We are technologically able to make \nthis transition. Many, if not most, of the facilities across the \ncountry are on a timetable to retrofit their equipment so they can \nbroadcast using the digital standards. It would certainly bring revenue \nto the Federal Government, the American taxpayers sooner because this \nspectrum that is available for auction could be auctioned earlier and \nthen put into the public domain used for new technologies, new \nproducts, for consumer safety, and that would certainly benefit \nconsumers. But it also provides a very real benefit to public safety \nbecause moving this timeframe up by 1 year would ultimately make the \nportion of the spectrum, about 20 percent of the entire spectrum coming \nback, available for use for public safety sooner. I am sure this is a \npoint that was strongly emphasized by Senator McCain in his remarks.\n  Those who support or oppose moving up this timetable would probably \nagree this process has taken much longer than anyone anticipated when \nit began back in the early 1990s. I don't think it serves the American \npeople well to drag it out any longer. I am sure there may be some \nconcerns about the precise date, but I think once we set a date sooner \nrather than later, markets will react, the companies that are providing \nservices will react, and public safety will certainly react because \ngoodness knows they can use the additional spectrum to meet the needs \nof\n\n[[Page S12202]]\n\nState, Federal, and local first responders who are dealing with public \nsafety needs every day.\n  I believe this is a commonsense amendment. I was pleased to support \nit in committee, and I am pleased to support it on the floor.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time to those who are prepared to \nspeak in opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to this \namendment. This amendment puts what we call a hard date only 2 months \nafter the January 28, 2008, auction required by the bill. That is when \nthe auction will commence. It is too soon to move immediately to a hard \ndate in April. The auction could take weeks to conduct, and even after \nit ends, there are several months necessary for the FCC to decide to \nwhom to award the final licenses. Without the licenses, new wireless \nproviders cannot build their systems, so a tremendous amount of \nspectrum would not be in use during this period of time.\n  Importantly, the auction proceeds will not be available until the \nfinal licenses are issued. That would mean consumers would face having \ntheir analog TVs shut off before the converter box program could be \nimplemented, as is suggested by our bill. American consumers will have \nto pay more to watch television if this amendment is adopted because \nthe analog cutoff date Senator McCain's amendment requires is \npremature.\n  The General Accounting Office and the Consumers Union estimate there \nare 20 million U.S. television households that rely upon over-the-air \nreception for their television signal. Broadcasting systems are ready \nto convert, but we cannot get this done until we have the converter \nsets so they can continue to watch their TVs. Their old sets will not \nrespond to the converted signal. Over-the-air reliant households \ndisproportionately represent America's most vulnerable. Low-income \nsenior citizens are disproportionately dependent on over-the-air TV; 43 \npercent of Latino households rely solely on analog television; and \nAfrican-American households are 22 percent reliant.\n  We have picked this date based upon the recommendations of the \nCongressional Budget Office to maximize the return from the sale of the \nspectrum. It is money that is necessary.That is why this portion of the \nbill is here--to raise money.\n  To the extent the money is not used for consumer boxes, a provision \nin our bill requires all money not used raised by the spectrum goes to \nreduce the deficit. It is a major deficit reduction concept. Having the \nhard date out to 2009 is going to raise more money. We need that \nadditional money to add to the interoperability portions of the \nreconciliation bill before us.\n  The April 7 date is simply too close, as I said in the beginning, to \nthe auction date of January 28. There has to be time between the \nauction date and the hard date to ensure that the communications \ncapability is there, the set-top boxes will be there, and that a \nportion of the television spectrum reserved for the first responders is \ngoing to be the first date available.\n  Moving this date is not going to make it available sooner because of \nthe time delay that will take place after the auction on January 28. It \nis just not physically possible to have a hard date that close to the \nauction date because of the time necessary to compute the value of \nthese offers, to go through the process of accepting the high bids and \nhaving the people bring forth the money to assure they are sound. The \nwhole concept of this bill has been to maximize the return.\n  The House date is December 31, 2008. Ours is April of 2009. We moved \nit there to get away from the Christmas season, to get away from things \nsuch as the Super Bowl. The longer it goes, the longer people will buy \nnew digital-ready televisions and will not have to rely upon the \ntransponders--the set-top boxes, we call them--that will be purchased \nwith this money. Our combination is, if we can get this bill passed \nthis year, we will have Christmas 2006, 2007, and 2008 before we get to \nthe point where we have to buy these set-top boxes. The more sets sold \nto new purchasers, the less it will cost to buy these boxes.\n  I do hope the Senate will see the wisdom in what we have done. We are \nworking closely with House Members on this issue. We believe we will \nreach an accommodation on the time, and it will be a 2009 date.\n  I urge the Senate not to adopt the McCain amendment because it will \ndestroy the process we are in, a very calculated process of ensuring \nthat the auctions take place, and then following those auctions, there \nis enough of a period to satisfy the goal of raising the money in order \nthat we may get to the total transition through the set-top boxes, \n8911, interoperability, and all the things that follow in the \namendment. For those who read our amendment, it is partially amended by \nthe McCain provision.\n  I don't know if there is anyone else to speak in opposition, but I \nurge the Senate not to adopt the amendment.\n  Mr. President, is there any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I don't believe there is anybody left to \nspeak on the McCain amendment. I ask unanimous consent that we proceed \nto the Murray amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2372\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2372.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide a 6-month transition period for coverage of \n prescription drugs under Medicaid for individuals whose drug coverage \n       is to be moved to the Medicare prescription drug program)\n\n       On page 188, after line 24, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 6037. CONTINUING STATE COVERAGE OF MEDICAID PRESCRIPTION \n                   DRUG COVERAGE TO MEDICARE DUAL ELIGIBLE \n                   BENEFICIARIES FOR 6 MONTHS.\n\n       (a) Six-Month Transition.--\n       (1) In general.--Only with respect to prescriptions filled \n     during the period beginning on January 1, 2006, and ending on \n     June 30, 2006, for, or on behalf of an individual described \n     in paragraph (2), section 1935(d) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1396u-5(d)) shall not apply and, notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law, a State (as defined for purposes \n     of title XIX of such Act) shall continue to provide (and \n     receive Federal financial participation for) medical \n     assistance under such title with respect to prescription \n     drugs as if such section 1935(d) had not been enacted.\n       (2) Individual described.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     an individual described in this paragraph is a full-benefit \n     dual eligible individual (as defined in section 1935(c)(6) of \n     such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396u-5(c)(6))--\n       (A) who, as of January 1, 2006, is not enrolled in a \n     prescription drug plan or an MA-PD plan under part D of title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act; or\n       (B) whose access to prescription drugs that were covered \n     under a State Medicaid plan on December 31, 2005, is \n     restricted or unduly burdened as a result of the individual's \n     enrollment in a prescription drug plan or an MA-PD plan under \n     part D of title XVIII of such Act.\n       (b) Application.--\n       (1) Medicare as primary payer.--Nothing in subsection (a) \n     shall be construed as changing or affecting the primary payer \n     status of a prescription drug plan or an MA-PD plan under \n     part D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act with respect \n     to prescription drugs furnished to any full-benefit dual \n     eligible individual (as defined in section 1935(c)(6) of such \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1396u-5(c)(6)) during the 6-month period \n     described in such subsection.\n       (2) Third party liability.--Nothing in subsection (a) shall \n     be construed as limiting the authority or responsibility of a \n     State under section 1902(a)(25) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(25)) to seek reimbursement from a \n     prescription drug plan, an MA-PD plan, or any other third \n     party, of the costs incurred by the State in providing \n     prescription drug coverage described in such subsection.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nRockefeller, Bingaman, Kennedy, Clinton, and Lautenberg as cosponsors \nof this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have some serious concerns about the \nbudget that is now before us.\n\n[[Page S12203]]\n\n  To make our country strong again, we need to invest at home. What I \nsee in this budget is a $35 billion cut from America's priorities, and \nI see that it will burden our children with a massive debt.\n  I am especially concerned this afternoon about what this bill will do \nto our most vulnerable in this budget and in the new Medicare \nprescription drug plan that is going to be implemented very soon.\n  This budget cuts $27 billion from Medicaid. That is a health care \nprogram, and it is a safety net for our country's most vulnerable and \nsickest. I think that cutting their health care is the wrong thing to \ndo.\n  As I look ahead to this new Medicare prescription drug law, I see a \ntime bomb that is ticking for more than 6 million Americans. A time \nbomb is ticking for our communities and for our health care providers. \nThat fuse is set to detonate on January 1, 2006, in a few short months. \nWe cannot stand by and let low-income seniors and the disabled lose \ntheir drug coverage. We cannot leave doctors, hospitals, and nursing \nhomes unprepared for the biggest change in decades, and we cannot push \nhundreds of thousands of people who need care on to our local \ncommunities.\n  We cannot wait. We need to fix this problem today. That is why I am \noffering this amendment. I have been working with Senators Rockefeller, \nBingaman, and Nelson to address this immediate crisis, and I want to \nthank them for their leadership.\n  I have also introduced my own bill to protect our most vulnerable. It \nis called the Medicare HEALS Act, S. 1822. I have been traveling around \nmy home State of Washington this past month and meeting with people in \nSeattle, in Lakewood, Yakima, out in Aberdeen, and Olympia. Everywhere \nI have gone they have been angry, confused, and very worried and with \ngood reason. Here are some of the concerns I heard. One senior told me:\n\n       Everyone I have talked to is totally confused--my doctor, \n     my pharmacist, even the Medicare number you are supposed to \n     call.\n\n  Another said:\n\n       If we can't understand this, this whole plan is going to \n     fail.\n\n  Everywhere I went, people were confused. There were questions I could \nnot answer. When I turned to the doctors sitting next to me, they did \nnot know the answer and neither did the pharmacists or the patient \nadvocates that were there with us.\n  If Senators, doctors, and experts do not understand this bill, how \ncan we expect an 80-year-old person with serious medical problems to \nunderstand this complicated new Medicare prescription drug plan? We \ncannot. So I believe we need more time and more resources to make this \nwork.\n  One person I met with said:\n\n       Please give us more time, give us the chance to understand \n     this so we don't make a mistake when we sign up.\n\n  One panelist said to me:\n\n       Taking something away from those that need it the most . . \n     . is not the American way.\n\n  I could not agree more, and that is why today I am offering this \namendment on this budget bill.\n  I have a lot of concerns with the Medicare prescription drug law. I \nwas one of those who voted against it in 2003 because I think seniors \ndeserve better, and I think America can do better for our seniors. I am \nvery concerned about the complexity. I am concerned about the coverage \ngap, and I am concerned about whether needed drugs will actually be \ncovered. I am concerned about the retirees who are losing the good \ncoverage they have today, and I am concerned about the late enrollment \npenalty that is going to punish seniors who need more time to pick the \nright plan for themselves.\n  I am working with many other Senators to address those specific \nconcerns. Today, the most urgent problem is the way that this new \nMedicare prescription drug law treats our most vulnerable: People with \nlow incomes, the disabled, and those who face serious medical \nchallenges such as AIDS.\n  This Medicare prescription drug law takes away the critical drug \ncoverage that these people have today and puts them into this new \nprogram that could charge them more money in exchange for less drug \ncoverage. If they do not sign up for a plan, they are going to be \nrandomly assigned one. Either way, the prescriptions they need may not \nbe covered. Because these are Americans who are living on the financial \nbrink, an interruption of their drug coverage or a new copayment could \nkeep them from getting the drugs they need to live. These people who \nare being affected do not know this is even going to happen to them. \nTheir doctors and their pharmacists do not understand it and this \nentire mess is going to burst into the open on January 1, a few short \nweeks away.\n  This Senate needs to take action now so we can prevent this \ncatastrophe, which is just a few months away. To understand this \nproblem, let us look at how our most vulnerable are getting their \nprescription drugs today and how that is about to change.\n  Today, about 6.4 million Americans with low incomes get help from two \nprograms: Medicare at the Federal level and Medicaid at the State \nlevel. These individuals are what we call in Washington, DC, dual \neligible because they are eligible for assistance from both Medicaid \nand Medicare.\n  What Medicare does not cover, States cover. For example, since the \nFederal program did not cover prescription drugs, the State programs \nfilled that gap. This State coverage is often called wraparound \ncoverage, and it is very critical for these vulnerable families. As a \nresult, these individuals got the drugs they need, often without \ncopayments or deductibles.\n  Now there is a big problem coming on January 1. The new prescription \ndrug bill will prohibit States from providing this extra help these \npeople need. Instead, what it does is take these people and move them \ninto this new Medicare Program alone, which will require of them higher \nout-of-pocket payments and will probably cover fewer drugs.\n  To me, it does not make sense to take away the good coverage these \nvulnerable families have today, force them into a program that might \nnot meet their needs, charge them more money in the process and then \nprohibit our States from helping out these most vulnerable residents. \nIt does not make sense, but that is exactly what this new drug program \nwill do, unless we fix it before January 1.\n  In fact, the new Medicare prescription drug program changes the \ncoverage for our most vulnerable families in five ways: First, it is \ngoing to impose higher costs, higher premiums, copayments, and \ndeductibles. These are our low-income families. They do not have the \nextra dollars.\n  Secondly, it is going to cover fewer drugs. Those drugs that they \nrely on right now for their health care, their mental health, may not \nbe covered in the plan they are randomly assigned to.\n  Third, it blocks our States from providing extra help as they do \ntoday, and our States are the end here. They are the ones who are going \nto see the fallout if these people do not get the prescriptions they \nneed.\n  Fourth, it provides no transition period to make sure that these low-\nincome residents do not face gaps in their coverage.\n  Finally, it penalizes people who simply need more time to understand \nand pick the right plan for them. These are real people that we are \ntalking about. I am going to introduce two of them.\n  Earlier this month in Seattle, I met a woman named Kathryn Cole. She \nis 36 years old. She is disabled, and she is living on Social Security \ndisability. She fills about 15 prescriptions every month. Her monthly \nincome is $757. That is what she lives on. Well, she told me: Even if \nthis copay were only $5, that adds up to $75 a month out of her $757. \nShe said:\n\n       I don't have that kind of extra money to squeeze out of my \n     budget.\n\n  Kathryn looked at me and she said, which week am I not supposed to \neat?\n  People like Kathryn across this country today are living on the \nfinancial edge. They cannot afford to pay more for their medication. \nThat is what America is about, making sure that the least among us are \nable to succeed in this country. Kathryn is one of those people.\n  In Olympia, in my State, I met a man named William Havens. He is 50 \nyears old, and he is living with HIV/AIDS. He takes 43 pills a day. \nWilliam told me:\n\n       For the first time I realize I'm going to have to make a \n     choice between pills and food.\n\n  It is outrageous that this Medicare prescription drug law is going to \nmake\n\n[[Page S12204]]\n\nlife so much harder for these people that I have met, such as Kathryn \nand William.\n  In addition to hurting these people, this new drug program, if \nenacted the way it is right now, is going to hurt our health care \nsystem. It is going to have a costly impact on our nursing homes, our \ndoctors, our pharmacists, and our hospitals.\n  Many of these dual-eligible individuals live in nursing homes. \nNursing homes are going to have to navigate through all of these new \nplans. In my home State of Washington, there are at least 14 of these \nnew plans that the dual eligibles are going to be assigned. Each one of \nthese plans has different costs and different formularies. Nursing home \nmanagers are going to have to see which plan their patient has and if \nthe needed drugs are covered.\n  In Olympia, I met with a doctor named David Fairbrook. He is in \nprivate practice, and he is also the medical director at two of these \nskilled nursing facilities. He cares for about 150 patients. He is very \nconcerned about his patients being randomly assigned to plans that do \nnot meet their medical needs. He said patients may be denied needed \ndrugs. They could be forced to change their medications, and they could \nvery well face a time-consuming, stressful appeals process.\n  Dr. Fairbrook predicted to me that there is going to be chaos for \nnursing staff regarding coordination of multiple suppliers, further \nduplicating their paperwork and documentation requirements. Chaos, he \ncalled it. There is a tremendous new administrative burden for \nunderstaffed and underfunded nursing homes and care providers.\n\n  In addition, unless we act, this new program is going to make the \nwork of our pharmacists across the country a lot harder. Pharmacists, \nas we all know, are literally going to be on the front lines. They are \ngoing to be forced to deny coverage to these patients. CMS is telling \nus that pharmacists will be able to look up and see what plan someone \nhas randomly been assigned to so when one of these patients comes into \ntheir pharmacy and says, I do not know who is covering me now, they are \nsupposed to be able to look it up and tell them.\n  Frankly, given all the errors and mistakes that CMS has made so far, \nI do not have a lot of confidence that this is going to be a flawless \ntransition. Remember, these people whom we are talking about do not \nhave a financial cushion. So if they go into the pharmacy and all of a \nsudden they find out, much to their surprise, that they have to have a \ncopay of $5 per prescription or more, they are living on fixed incomes, \nthey do not have an extra $20 or $30 to say, fine, okay, I will pay \nthis. They will turn away from the pharmacy counter, and they are not \ngoing to have the funds to pay for their drugs now and get reimbursed \nlater when some kind of paperwork system gets sorted out. So we are \ngoing to see a huge impact at our pharmacies, and we are already \nhearing about it from them.\n  Doctors are going to be on the front line. Doctors are going to have \nto know which drugs are on the formulary, and they may need to help \ntheir patients appeal any denials. I remind my colleagues, most of the \nplans out there right now do not have a formulary. So people who are \nlooking at this and making conscious decisions about which prescription \ndrug plan they are going to sign up for cannot make a reasoned decision \nyet because they do not even know which plans cover what drugs. So \ndoctors are telling us that they are going to have a real challenge as \nthey try to help their patients work their way through these plans to \nmake sure that their plan covers the prescriptions that are actually \ngiven to them.\n  One doctor I met with told me if doctors do not have the information \nthey need on this yet, if their patients pick the wrong plan and their \nmedicine is not covered, it can have serious medical harm.\n  Hospitals are also going to be impacted by this. They are going to \nhave to navigate all of these new plans that are being offered. They \nare going to have to deal with patients who have not been able to get \ntheir prescriptions. In fact, for many of these poor families, the only \nplace to get needed medicine is going to be the emergency room, and \nthat is going to increase the cost of health care for all of us.\n  So this new drug law is going to impose an expensive and confusing \nadministrative burden on doctors, on pharmacists, on hospitals, and on \nnursing homes. I think we can do a lot better than this. My amendment \nsimply says let us fix this problem before people realize that they \ncannot get the prescriptions that they need.\n  The Murray-Rockefeller-Bingaman amendment simply provides a 6-month \ntransition for low-income, dual-eligible beneficiaries. It does not \ndelay the implementation of the Medicare Part D Program. It simply \ngives States, CMS, and the Social Security Administration 6 more months \nto ensure that all of those who currently have access to prescription \ndrugs through Medicaid or who are eligible for Medicaid assistance are \nnot lost in this transition.\n  Surely we can at least do that for these people.\n  According to CBO, this amendment could cost $130 million over 5 \nyears. I say that is a very small price to pay when we are talking \nabout the lives of 6.4 million Americans. In this budget, we are being \nasked to cut $27 billion from health care for the poor. I think it is \nworth spending less than 1 percent of that amount to make sure our most \nvulnerable do not lose their drug coverage in this transition.\n  Today we got another example of how easily our most vulnerable can \nfall through these cracks. Just today, CMS announced it is going to be \nsending a mailing to 86,169 dual eligibles in my home State of \nWashington. But according to the numbers I got from my State, there are \nactually 95,000 of these dual-eligible patients. So somehow 8,831 \nvulnerable people are not being counted. They are not going to get a \nletter. They are not going to get signed up for a plan. They are going \nto get lost in this transition, and on January 31 they will have no \ndrug coverage. That is exactly why I am offering this amendment and \ntelling my colleagues that we need to have a transition period to allow \nthis to work.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and give our most \nvulnerable a few extra months to make sure they do not get lost in this \ntransition.\n  This is a life-or-death issue for many people. We cannot rip away the \nlast remaining safety net for these people. We owe them at least this \none very small fix. Time is running out. On January 1, millions of \nvulnerable Americans are going to be forced into a new system they do \nnot understand and that does not meet their needs. I believe we can \navoid this train wreck. People's lives are hanging in the balance, and \nI urge my colleagues to at least allow these people who are dual \neligible a transition period so they are not lost as this plan is \nimplemented.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, 98 percent of all drugs are covered by the \nMedicare Modernization Act. And HIV/AIDS drugs are covered. So I am \nhaving trouble understanding the need for this amendment. It makes no \nsense for dual eligibles to have coverage for prescription drugs in \nboth the Medicare and Medicaid Programs.\n  I have listened to the arguments the proponents of the amendment have \nused, primarily that the new Medicare prescription drug benefit will be \nvery confusing to those beneficiaries who are used to having their \ncoverage through the Medicaid Program. I personally believe providing \ncoverage through both programs will make it much more confusing for \nbeneficiaries. Instead of helping these vulnerable seniors, I believe \nthe Murray amendment would confuse them and not provide the help they \nneed with their drug coverage.\n  CMS is there. They will help. They know what to do. They are there \nfor these people. We have provided they would be there.\n  In addition, I don't understand why these beneficiaries would need a \nFederal match for Medicaid coverage because they cannot navigate the \nexceptions process or the transition process. If an individual has \nproblems with his or her drug coverage, there will be help available to \nthem through CMS, congressional offices, State government\n\n[[Page S12205]]\n\nagencies, and community organizations such as the AARP that is so \nstrongly behind this bill. There is no need for duplicative drug \ncoverage.\n  I might add, if I am not mistaken, I think the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington supported the Rockefeller amendment to the Medicare \nprescription drug bill that we fought so strongly over, that is now \nlaw. This particular amendment would have had the duals' drugs covered \nby Medicare, not Medicaid--this was included in the Medicare \nModernization Act of 2003. I don't know what brought about the change \nof mind.\n  CMS recognizes the transition from Medicaid drug coverage to Medicare \nis enormous and has been diligently working to ensure the process for \nbeneficiaries is as quick and efficient as possible. Protections are in \nplace to ensure that no full-benefit dual-eligible beneficiary will go \nwithout coverage when the new Medicare prescription drug benefit starts \non January 1, 2006. All Part D plans that CMS approves must meet strict \nMedicare regulations and standards guaranteeing that Medicare \nbeneficiaries receive drug coverage that best fits their needs.\n  Part D plans are required to have a coverage determination process \nwhich includes an exceptions process and appeals processes that provide \nenrollees with opportunities to challenge the exclusion of a particular \ndrug from a plan's formulary. Each plan must have a procedure for \nmaking timely coverage determinations on standard and expedited \nrequests made by enrollees. Plans must also make their determinations \nas expeditiously as an enrollee's health care condition requires, but \nno later than 24 hours for expedited decisions involving enrollees who \nwill suffer from serious health conditions, and 72 hours for standard \ndecisions.\n  These formulary and appeal procedures are in place to ensure that \nthere are no instances where a beneficiary is in need of a drug and \ncannot get it.\n  To address the needs of individuals who are stabilized on certain \ndrug regimens, Part D plans are required to establish an appropriate \ntransition process for new enrollees who are transitioning to Part D \nfrom other prescription drug coverage and whose current drug therapies \nmay not be included in their Part D plan's formulary. Additionally, \nthis amendment presents an unfair situation for States who have already \nagreed to pay ``clawback'' payments to the Federal Government. By \nmandating that State Medicaid Programs also pay for drugs, we would \nessentially increase the financial burden on the States.\n  I hope our colleagues will not vote for this amendment. In all \nhonesty, when we talk about the issue of choosing between food \nand drugs, the Medicare Modernization Act provides a substantial \nsubsidy for low-income seniors for their drug coverage. These seniors \nwill not have to choose between food and drugs, basically because their \ndrugs will be covered. They will not have to choose, as has been stated \nhere, between having enough food to eat and drugs. That is one of the \nthings we tried to take care of when we did the Medicare Modernization \nAct. Saying that you have to choose between food and drugs is not only \nwrong, it unfairly scares our senior citizens, and it confuses them. As \nI said at the beginning of my remarks, 98 percent of all drugs are \ncovered, and that includes HIV/AIDS drugs.\n\n  In fact, beneficiaries can use the plan finder tool to find plans \nthat cover specific drugs.\n  I want to clarify one thing. Seniors who are dual eligibles will \nreceive their Medicare drug coverage on January 1, 2006. It is not true \nthey will not be covered. They will be covered, and they will receive \ntheir drug coverage. That is what this bill is supposed to do, and that \nis what it will do.\n  I hope our colleagues will vote this amendment down because I think \nit not only confusing to seniors, but frankly, the way the benefit is \ndevised by CMS, beneficiaries should be able to get all the drug \ncoverage they need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I seek time, but I do not have the \nauthority from the floor manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 17 minutes left in opposition to the \nMurray amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will yield myself 10 minutes of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, I want to make very clear, \nregarding some of the concerns that have been expressed in support of \nthis amendment, I thought we took them into consideration 2 years ago--\ndid take them into consideration in their policy. I think now that \nthings are rolling out I am even more confident of what we did. So that \nwould apply also to the issues raised here, whether or not \nbeneficiaries have the ability to make decisions about their care, the \ntype of plan they want to be in.\n  We knew beneficiaries would need to have good resources to learn \nabout the benefits. We have, for instance, a State Health Insurance \nInformation Program that has counselors who can provide one-on-one \ncounseling. CMS has developed a network of community-based \norganizations to do the same thing. AARP is holding meetings--all over \nthe country, I believe, but I see them noticed in our newspapers all \nthe time. It seems like a massive number of meetings that my senior \ncitizen constituents have gone to.\n  Do I think nobody could fall through the cracks? Perhaps so. But I \nthink they would have to be people who are very isolated. I know CMS is \ntaken through the mail, and presumably everybody has an address that \ngets mail. We have taken very good care to make sure people are \nnotified through the mail. If there is one place where there might be a \nproblem, that is the extent to which States might not have everybody in \ntheir files. But I have even been satisfied that CMS has been working \non that problem for a long period of time.\n  So because we have thought about these things, I rise to oppose the \namendment by the distinguished Senator from Washington.\n  When we worked on the Medicare Modernization Act, which established \nthis drug benefit program, every State Governor wanted beneficiaries \nwho have Medicaid and Medicare coverage, dual eligibles, to get their \nprescription drugs through Medicare.\n  Members of both sides supported this approach. They said Medicare has \nbeen a universal benefit, available to all beneficiaries since its \ninception. The Medicare drug benefit should then be no different.\n  Those who supported covering dual eligibles under the Medicare drug \nbenefit noted that these beneficiaries would have nothing, no \nprescription drug coverage, if a State chose to end its Medicaid \nprescription drug benefit, which it could do. As Senator Hatch said, we \neven considered an amendment, supported by 47 Senators, to make the \nbenefit available to all Medicare beneficiaries, including Medicare \nbeneficiaries with Medicaid coverage.\n  For those of us who ultimately supported this approach in the final \nbill, did we think that we could just wave a magic wand to make the \ntransition happen? As I said, we did not think that. Transitions like \nthis are not easy. We knew that. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, the agency responsible for making this transition happen and \nadministering the program over a long period of time, knew it would be \na big task to transition all those folks into Medicare.\n  That is why the agency started working on a transition plan--with \nStates and advocacy groups--more than a year ago. In May, the agency \nissued a 44-page strategy for transitioning this group of beneficiaries \ninto the Medicare drug benefit. That strategy lays out in great detail \nthe steps that the agency will take to ensure continuity of coverage \nfor this vulnerable group of beneficiaries.\n  First and foremost, these beneficiaries will be assigned to a \nMedicare prescription drug plan with their coverage effective on \nJanuary 1st. Folks refer to this as auto-enrollment. This process will \nprevent any gap in coverage for these beneficiaries. The agency worked \nwith States to develop lists of dually eligible beneficiaries. These \nlists have undergone rigorous scrutiny to ensure their accuracy and \ncompleteness.\n\n[[Page S12206]]\n\n  Letters informing beneficiaries about the upcoming changes went out \ntoday. It clearly states that beneficiaries should choose a plan, but \nif they don't, they will be assigned to the plan listed in the letter.\n  The agency included some additional information in a question and \nanswer format. The first question is, ``What should I do now?'' Among \nother things, the answer says that beneficiaries should find out which \nplans cover the prescriptions they take and the pharmacies they want to \nuse.\n  I know that folks are concerned that a beneficiary might toss aside \ntheir letter--we have all done that with mail. That is why pharmacists \nwill have access to the beneficiaries and their assigned plan. So on \nJanuary 1st, when a beneficiary goes to a pharmacy, the pharmacist can \nfill that prescription under that plan.\n  Now, some people are concerned that a beneficiary will be assigned to \na plan that doesn't cover a drug they need, and they won't find out \nuntil they go into the pharmacy. In its transition guidance to plans, \nthe agency strongly recommended that plans provide for temporary \n``first fill'' of 30 days to provide a transition supply to meet the \nimmediate need of a beneficiary. This is a common practice today.\n  Any plan that chooses not to do this, had to provide the agency with \nsufficient detail on how it would ensure that new enrollees stabilized \non a drug not on the plan's formulary would continue to have access to \nthe drugs they need. For example, a plan not using the first-fill could \nhave procedures in place to contact enrollees in advance of their \ninitial effective date in order to identify their needs. All of these \nalternative plans were subject to the agency's approval.\n  In addition the agency carefully reviewed all of the plans' \nformularies to ensure that dually eligible beneficiaries would have \ngood access to the drugs they need. Many plans around the nation cover \nnearly all of the top 100 drugs used by seniors. The agency also \nrequired plans to cover all or substantially all drugs in six classes \nthat include drugs most commonly used by seniors.\n\n  I also know there is concern that a dually eligible beneficiary might \nbe assigned to a plan that doesn't cover a drug they need or include \ntheir pharmacy in its network. That is one reason why the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services sent the letters out now. Dually-\neligible beneficiaries can still pick whatever plan they want for their \ncoverage on January 1st, but if the don't make an affirmative decision, \nthen they will have coverage through the plan to which they been \nassigned.\n  And if that plan doesn't work for them, they can switch plans at any \ntime throughout the year. Any time.\n  I was among the Senators who voted against the amendment in the \nSenate, but I obviously agreed to the provisions hammered out in the \nconference committee.\n  Now is not the time to change the provisions. Letters have gone out \nto beneficiaries. Plans have submitted their proposals to the \ngovernment based on the specifications in the law. Changes now could \nlead to increased cost for all beneficiaries and Government.\n  Members argued with great passion as to why this group of \nbeneficiaries should have their drug benefit covered by Medicare. \nMembers of the conference committee worked to make that happen.\n  The Senate bill was bipartisan and it passed by a vote of 76 to 21. \nThe bill that emerged from conference was bipartisan and passed by a \nvote of 54 to 44 with the support of 11 Democrats and 1 Independent.\n  The bill passed because we recognized that if we asked seniors to \nwait for a perfect bill, that they were going to be left waiting for a \nlong, long time.\n  The AARP and more than 300 patient advocacy and health care \norganizations endorsed the final product. The AARP said the final bill \n``helps millions of older Americans and their families,'' and is ``an \nimportant milestone in the nation's commitment to strengthen and expand \nhealth security for its citizens. . . .''\n  The prescription drug benefit is affordable and universal. It will \ncover about half the cost of prescriptions for the average beneficiary. \nDually-eligible beneficiaries will have almost all their drug costs \npaid.\n  After years of hard work on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and \nDemocrats came together to pass the Medicare Modernization Act. Now is \nnot the time to reopen this issue.\n  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has worked hard to \nimplement the new program. Any changes at this point will almost \ncertainly delay the drug benefit from implementation.\n  In thinking about the months of negotiating this package, I can tell \nyou that there is no interest from this Senator to reopen and \nrenegotiate the new Medicare drug benefit now.\n  The time for delay is over. The new Medicare drug benefit was a \nbipartisan product, it is law, and it is set to begin for all \nbeneficiaries, who have waited long enough for this important benefit.\n  I agree that every step needs to be taken to ensure that there is no \ndisruption in coverage for these vulnerable beneficiaries.\n  I believe those steps are being taken. It is my understanding that a \nnumber of folks think that this transition will be too confusing for \nbeneficiaries. In my opinion, having some drugs covered by Medicare and \nsome by Medicaid will be even more so.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will have more to say on this issue, \nbut I would like to use my remaining time to enter into a colloquy with \nthe Senator from Wyoming.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set the pending amendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the time being charged?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. With time being charged. We can charge it against our \nside. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue I \nhave been working on for the past year--ending a runaway subsidy in the \nstudent loan program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Durbin and Clinton be added as \ncosponsors to amendment No. 2353.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, currently students are enjoying low \ninterest rates on their loans.\n  That was not always the case. In the 1980s, lenders were promised a \nrate of return at 9.5 percent on their loans when interest rates were \nhigh, but we were trying to keep costs down for students. In 1993, when \ninterest rates were coming down, extra payments to lenders on 9.5 \npercent loans were supposed to phase out. However, they did not start \nphasing out and were rapidly increasing until I took action with my \ncolleagues to end this practice.\n  Last year, I along with my colleagues, including Senators Kennedy and \nDurbin, who support closing this loophole passed the Teacher-Taxpayer \nAct. The Teacher-Taxpayer Act took aim at some of the most egregious \nabuse of this runaway subsidy and returned that money to student's \npockets. However, while the Teacher-Taxpayer Act took great strides \nforward on this issue, the Federal government is still paying out $1 \nbillion a year on the 9.5 percent loans. I believe we are far overdue \nin ending this practice.\n  I have filed an amendment to fully and permanently end the remaining \n9.5 percent subsidy loophole, which according to the Congressional \nBudget Office will provide a savings of approximately $500 million. I \nhave stated my intent repeatedly to finally close the remaining \nloophole. The Higher Education Act reauthorization bill moving through \nthe House of Representatives closes this loophole and Education \nSecretary Spellings have called for the ending this remaining loophole.\n  Mr. ENZI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Certainly.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank my colleague from Washington for her work on higher \neducation and for her passion about this issue in particular. She has \nbeen very interested in the higher education bill that we approved in \ncommittee, and was among those who supported its unanimous approval. My \ncolleague mentioned the Taxpayer-Teacher Protection Act, which I \nsupport and which\n\n[[Page S12207]]\n\nthe committee acted to make permanent. I would add that the Taxpayer-\nTeacher Protection Act has reduced holdings of these loans by more than \n$1.2 billion in only 6 months since its enactment.\n  While various estimates have been given about savings attached to \nending recycling, it would also put an end to an estimated $840 million \nin student benefits provided by non-profit lenders over the next 5 \nyears. By some estimates, that could mean a net loss of nearly $550 \nmillion in student benefits. Because of the efforts among lenders to \nprovide the most competitive benefits, it is likely that the net loss \nin student benefits would be much greater. It is also important for me \nto point out that the Senator's amendment does not capture these \nsavings for students, it only ends the practice of recycling, so the \nnet loss in student benefits would likely exceed $1 billion.\n  I would also note that Federal tax law prohibits non-profit lenders \nfrom retaining these subsidies that the Senator has described. I ask my \ncolleague if she agrees with my assessment, that Federal tax law \nprohibits non-profit lenders from retaining the 9.5 percent subsidy, \nand that excess funds must be returned to the Treasury, or be used to \nprovide student benefits.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would agree with that assessment, yes.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank my colleague for her commitment to continue to work \nwith me on this issue in conference and look forward to reaching a \ncompromise on this issue. I believe it is important that we get this \nissue right, so we can best serve students.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator. We may not fully agree on this \nissue but I commend my colleague's efforts to develop a bipartisan \nHigher Education Act reauthorization and the challenges in moving such \na bill through the Senate on a reconciliation bill.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Kennedy for his leadership on this \nissue, and I look forward to working with him and the chairman through \nconference on this issue. I appreciate the chairman's commitment to \nwork with me through that process to make sure my voice is heard and \ninterests are met. I think it is critical that, as we work with the \nHouse in conference on this issue and others, that we ensure protection \nand improvement of student benefits, and that any savings generated on \nthis issue be returned to students. We must also work to advance and \nprotect diversity in the lending market, which leads to the competition \nthat provides for improving student benefits in lending.\n  I thank my colleague for his commitment to working with me and look \nforward to working with him and Senator Kennedy through that process.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator Murray and \nSenator Enzi, discussing the important issue of ending the practice of \nproviding lenders a 9.5 percent interest rate on student loans. I thank \nSenator Murray for her leadership on the issue. We have been working \ntogether to close this loophole for several years now. As she \nmentioned, we passed the Taxpayer-Teacher Protection Act last year, and \nthat was a good first step in the right direction.\n  I would also like to thank Chairman Enzi for his willingness to work \nwith us in extending that important piece of legislation in the context \nof the reauthorization of higher education and for his commitment to \ncontinue to work on the issue as we move to conference on that bill.\n  As Senator Murray pointed out, the Federal Government will spend $1 \nbillion annually in additional interest on recycled loans through this \nprogram unless we end the practice completely. There is no doubt that \nsome of the lenders--particularly the nonprofits--are putting that \nexcess profit to good use, but we need to make sure all of this funding \nis being used in the best way possible to make college more accessible \nfor the neediest students. The best way to do this is to end the \npractice of recycling. Currently the taxpayers are spending $2.7 \nmillion each day that we allow the recycling of these loans, and too \nmuch of that is going to line the pockets of for-profit lenders. Too \nmuch of that money is adding to the enormous salaries of CEOs instead \nof helping low-income students realize their dream of going to college. \nWe need to make a conscious choice to help students and not banks.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues, Chairman \nEnzi and Senator Murray, on this issue as we move into conference with \nthe House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes remain in opposition.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest that by unanimous consent we \nbegin the process of debating the Ensign amendment and that 5 minutes \nbe added. He is here and ready to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2368\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2368 at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign], for himself and Mr. \n     DeMint, Mr. Smith, Mr. Sununu, and Mr. McCain proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2368.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To cut $2,000,000,000 from the converter box subsidy program)\n\n       On page 94, line 7, strike ``$3,000,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,000,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, first, I want to talk about the general \npart of the Deficit Reduction Act we have before us, and which the \nCommerce Committee dealt with a major part of. It has to do with the \ntransition to digital television.\n  It is a confusing issue for a lot of people, the issue of analog \ntelevision versus digital television. Digital television will bring far \nsuperior quality to our television. We hear about high definition. We \nhear about digital television today. There is a lot of confusion out \nthere.\n  In 1996, we set out to transition our television sets--actually by \nthe end of this year--over to the digital age, basically the 21st \ncentury in television, in which we would have a much higher quality \npicture for our television.\n  Because of a lot of reasons--I think a lot of them are political--we \naren't to that point. But what we are doing today in this bill is we \nhave all agreed we are going to have a hard date to actually transition \nto digital television. What is good about it is everybody can start \nplanning. We will know exactly the time we need to transition from the \ncurrent television signals the broadcasters are using. Actually, many \nof them are already broadcasting in both digital and analog, but they \nwill know there will be a hard date where they have to get fully geared \nto broadcast only in digital.\n  What does this mean for the consumer out there? A lot of people are \nafraid: Is my television set going to be turned off when this hard date \ncomes into effect? If we do this right, their television will actually \nwork better than it does today. Even their normal analog television \nwill work better when the hard date comes than it actually works today. \nWith the purchase of a little converter box, they will be able to \nreceive that digital signal. Even if they do not have cable television, \nwith their current analog television--which most televisions are today \nin the United States--they will be able to receive more television \nchannels free without rabbit ears, without the basic cable that they \nhave today. Because of the way technology works today in the digital \nage, for each one of those stations which they now have, they will get \nseveral stations of digital. There will be a lot more programming which \nthey will actually get free over the air. They will not have to pay for \nit. This is an advantage for people who aren't on\n\n[[Page S12208]]\n\ncable or satellite when we go to this hard date.\n  There are a lot of reasons for wanting to have that hard date. For \nthose who know anything about the Internet, we always hear about high-\nspeed Internet, or broadband access.\n  The United States is falling further and further behind the rest of \nthe world when it comes to broadband or high-speed Internet access. We \nused to be 11th in the world a couple years ago when it comes to \nbroadband. Today, we have slipped to 16th in the world. Eleventh was \nunacceptable for the United States, but 16th makes us less competitive \nin this highly technological world we are in in this global \nmarketplace. We have to do everything we can to advance the United \nStates getting up to speed to the Internet.\n  If you live in a rural area, one of the things this bill will do \ntoday, thanks to the good work by Senator Stevens, chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, one of the good things about having a hard date is \nthat we will be able to free up some spectrum when the broadcasters go \noff analog. There is valuable spectrum they will go off when they \nconvert to digital. When they go off the spectrum, the spectrum will be \nauctioned and used for a lot of good uses.\n  If you live in rural America and you want broadband coming into your \nhome, this spectrum will allow broadband to go throughout the United \nStates with very cheap ways of setting up the infrastructure. Today, it \nis very expensive to wire, to lay down cables or fiber optics in the \nground to rural America. This spectrum is going to make it much more \naffordable to bring broadband or high-speed Internet access to rural \nAmerica. That is another one of the huge advantages we have for making \na hard date.\n  First responders need the spectrum that the broadcasters currently \noccupy as well. It will make the radios work better. It penetrates, for \ninstance, stairwells. On September 11, the first responders' radios did \nnot work as well as they should because they do not have the same kind \nof spectrum they need to make the radios work better. Getting the \nbroadcasters off this analog spectrum will also make their radios work \nbetter.\n  In the bill, we give $3 billion to convert these analog televisions, \nthese little converter boxes that people will need to get for their \ntelevisions to work properly if they do not have cable or if they do \nnot have satellite. Three billion dollars, by many experts I have \ntalked to in looking at the experiences of countries such as Germany \nthat have done similar things, $3 billion is not going to be necessary.\n  First of all, I don't believe that everyone who has one of these \ntelevision sets should get a subsidy. We should have that subsidy for \nlow- or low-to-moderate-income families only. For somebody who has a \nlot of money, why should a middle-income taxpayer have some of their \ntax dollars going to subsidize somebody who happens to have a bunch of \nTVs in their house that wants a converter box? The average cost is \nestimated between $45 and $60 when they are in mass production. I don't \nthink it is unreasonable for somebody of means to buy that on their \nown. Most people buy a new computer for their home every few years for \na lot more money than what this converter box will cost.\n  It is very reasonable to cut the amount we have from $3 billion down \nto $1 billion for the subsidy. That is exactly what our amendment does. \nAt this time of runaway Government spending, it is important to look at \nevery place we can to save money.\n  Our amendment says instead of spending $3 billion on converter boxes \nto give subsidies to everybody in America, we will only spend $1 \nbillion. Right now, we cannot set the policies in place, but we can set \nthe amount in place. Later on, we can come back with the policies that \nwill reflect the billion. The House of Representatives put in their \nbill $990 million, right around $1 billion, which is what we reflect. \nThey went through the whole committee process. They did the same thing. \nIt is difficult to get our bill out of committee at the $3 billion \nlevel, but it is the responsible thing to do for this Senate, instead \nof subsidizing those who can afford to buy their own converter boxes, \nto take $2 billion of that and put it toward offsetting some of the \nspending in other areas with higher priorities at this time.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the time situation on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 16 minutes 30 seconds; the \nSenator from Nevada has 8 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will use the time in opposition if I \nneed it, and some others may want to speak.\n  Our committee worked hard on this bill, our portions of this bill, \nand the $3 billion associated with the converter box funds was derived \nfrom a CBO estimate based upon the problems that exist in the so-called \nanalog world. There are an estimated 73 million analog TV sets not \nconnected to cable or satellite.\n  Our reconciliation measure ends all analog broadcasts on April 7, \n2009. By that date, all televisions that rely on antennas have to be \nequipped with a digital analog converter box. We call that the set-top \nbox. The cost to the consumers to purchase the box is estimated to be \n$3 billion. This amendment would cut that to $1 billion. That is not \nenough to meet the problem of these 73 million analog sets.\n  I call attention to the Senate that there is a difference between the \nHouse approach and the Senate approach. The House would use a voucher \nsystem. The House estimates there are fewer sets than our estimate of \n73 million.\n  We believe by using the date--that is also subject to a question on \nan amendment that has been offered by the Senator from New Hampshire--\nby using the hard date of April 2009, we estimate we will raise a \nconsiderable amount more money than a date closer to the present day. \nThe impact of this far date is we have three periods where television \nsets are bought in great quantities, and during the Christmas period.\n\n  To the extent the analog sets are retired by digital-ready \ntelevisions, we will not need money. This $3 billion is up $2 billion. \nWe do not automatically throw in the $3 billion. This merely makes \navailable the estimate of $3 billion and earmarks that.\n  However, I call attention to the Senate that money not spent is \nearmarked in this bill to go to deficit reduction. It is not going \nanywhere else. There are specific items.\n  There will be some amendments offered. I specifically refer to the \namendment on page 94, line 10, that any amounts unexpended, unobligated \nat the conclusion of the program shall be used for the program \ndescribed in paragraph 3, which is, in fact, the basic debt reduction \nsystem.\n  There are some other complications here that I have gone into before. \nOne of them is, we ought to be able to take this bill to the House for \nconference and work out with them the best way to deal with the set-top \nboxes. One of the great problems is that there currently is a range of \nestimates, as the Senator has mentioned, from $40 to $60. If it is $60, \nwe do not have enough money. If it is $40, we have a little bit left \nover, and it will automatically go to debt reduction.\n  I personally think we have problems in the areas that were devastated \nby Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. The problem there is the televisions were \ndestroyed altogether. It may well be that the cost in those areas will \nbe substantially more than the costs of the set-top boxes. We have to \ndecide that. Someone has to decide to what extent and where the money \nis coming from to help those people who are not able to buy their \ntelevision sets, not able to replace them. Will FEMA do it? Are any \nother agencies going to do it? We will hear arguments that some of this \nmoney should be reserved for that. I, personally, support that. This is \na fund that is designed to make sure we stay connected with these \npeople.\n  One of the real problems about the devastated areas--and having lived \nin an area that was devastated one time by a monstrous earthquake--it \nis hard to stay in touch without the local news without television, \nwithout connection with the outside world. We should think about \nearmarking some of this money to go into the devastated areas.\n  Does the Senator from Montana wish time?\n  Mr. BURNS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am pleased to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes 25 seconds remains.\n  Mr. BURNS. If all of the money is not used for the set-top box and \nthere is money left over, yes, it does go to\n\n[[Page S12209]]\n\ndebt reduction, but isn't it also earmarked in there for first \nresponders and spectrum? Did we not talk about them? Basically that is \nwhy we are trying to free up a lot of the 700-megahertz block of \nspectrum.\n  I understood that was the case. The Senator said it all goes to \ndeficit reduction, but I thought some of it was held in reserve for \nemergency responders?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is right. There are a series of items held \nin reserve: $200,000 for converting low-power television stations and \ntelevision translators; $1.5 billion for emergency communications, \nwhich includes $1 billion for interoperability, $250 million for the \nnational alert system, $50 million for tsunami warning and coastal \nvulnerability problems; we have $250 million to deal with the Senator's \nE911. But after that, the provision strictly says if the proceeds of \nthe auction exceed the sums of payments under all of those, that amount \nhas to go to deficit reduction.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Again, it is an estimate.\n  I appeal to let us go to conference and work this out. I favor \nputting as much money as possible into debt reduction, but there are \nsome people who are going to have to have help in these disaster areas \nbeyond the moneys we have already provided in the other systems. That \nargument will come to the Senate. I intend to support the concept of \nusing a portion that we have earmarked, $250 million, and there is a \nmove for that to become $1 billion. We are not spending the money. We \nare authorizing expenditures up to this amount. What is not expended \nfor the programs goes to debt reduction. That is very important for the \nSenator to remember.\n  If the Senator wishes to comment on my comments, I will yield.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized with 8 \nminutes 24 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska always makes very \ngood and important points.\n  I emphasize a couple of things. First of all, I ask unanimous consent \nthat this GAO report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Table 1 provides the cost of a subsidy program under the \n     assumption that cable and DBS providers downconvert \n     broadcasters' signals at their facilities in a manner that \n     enables them to continue to transmit those signals to \n     subscribers as they currently transmit broadcasters' signals. \n     In this case, cable or DBS subscribers do not require any new \n     equipment, so only over-the-air households--approximately 21 \n     million American households--would need new equipment. As \n     shown in table 1, there is considerable variation in the cost \n     of the subsidy program depending on the level of a means test \n     and the price of the set-top box.\n\n    TABLE 1.--ESTIMATED COST OF SET-TOP BOX SUBSIDY, ASSUMING CABLE AND DBS DOWNCONVERSION, ONLY OVER-THE-AIR\n                                            HOUSEHOLDS ARE SUBSIDIZED\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                   Cost of subsidy, by estimated\n                                                    Percent of       Number of     cost of set-top box (dollars\n                                                   over-the-air     households             in millions)\n           Assumption about means test              households    subsidized (in -------------------------------\n                                                     eligible        millions)      $50 set-top    $100 set-top\n                                                                                        box             box\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMeans test at 200% of poverty level.............              50             9.3            $463            $925\n                                                                      (7.8-10.7)      ($391-534)    ($782-1,068)\nMeans test at 300% of poverty level.............              67            12.5             626           1,252\n                                                                     (10.9-14.1)      ($545-707)  ($1,090-1,415)\nNo means test...................................

Mr. President, the reason I hold up this report, partly \nto respond, during the hearings we had on transitioning from the analog \nspectrum to digital, we had the Germany experience where parts of \nGermany transitioned, and they had a program to subsidize some people \nwho would need to make their analog sets operate in a digital world. \nWhen they had this program in Germany, not nearly as many people \nparticipated in it as their government expected to happen.\n  The GAO report said if there were no means test, it would cost about \n$1 billion for all of the over-the-air broadcast televisions, one per \nhousehold for all of those who do not have cable and who do not have \nsatellite television. This is for, on average, about $50 per set-top \nbox.\n  Now, what I have said, and what I would like to see happen, is that \nwe means test this, that anybody, let's say, who is up to 200 percent \nof poverty would be the only ones subsidized for a set-top box. If we \ndid that, we could buy every one of those households two set-top boxes \nfor under $1 billion, and we would have enough money left over to \nadminister the program. And that is if 100 percent of the homes \nparticipate--100 percent.\n  Now, I think it is reasonable for us to expect that not 100 percent \nof the homes are going to participate, but that is even with 100 \npercent of the low-income homes participating. Even if they do, we will \nhave enough money in the program to buy every household, of 200 percent \nof poverty or below, two of these set-top boxes to make sure their \nanalog television works when we transition over to the digital age.\n  So I think it is very reasonable for us to only have $1 billion--\nwhich ``only $1 billion'' around here is a low number, I guess, but it \nis still a lot of money. I think that is plenty of money for us to \ntransition.\n  Let us not forget that their televisions are going to be working \nbetter. It is not like we are just giving them the same service. They \nare going to get more services. First of all, their TV sets will work \nbetter. The picture will be clearer. When you have over-the-air \nbroadcasts today, and you have rabbit ears, it is not a very clear \npicture. There is a lot of fuzz, and a lot of times it is not great \nreception.\n  In the digital age, your television will be much clearer. And for \nevery one of those television stations you currently have, you will \nalso have other stations--weather channels, news channels--broadcasting \nover the air for free. You will get a lot more services for less money. \nSo I don't think, for anybody making above 200 percent of the poverty \nlevel, it is unreasonable for us to ask them to buy their own set-top \nboxes. That is why I think there will be plenty of money, even at the \nbillion-dollar level, to be able to handle these things and some of the \nother things that may be needed down in the gulf coast.\n  But I look forward to working with the chairman of the committee. I \nalways hate to go against him because he is so accommodating on the \ncommittee. But this is something we will look forward to working with \nthe chairman on as we move through this process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9 minutes 4 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I think we ought to make certain that the \npeople are providing service to these analog sets now. The National \nAssociation of Broadcasters opposes this amendment. Furthermore, I \noppose it for the main reason that we are bringing into this country \nenormous supplies of what are called digital television sets now, but \nthey are not digital-ready. They are still analog, in effect.\n  We wanted to put on this bill a provision that said you cannot bring \ninto\n\n[[Page S12210]]\n\nthis country or manufacture in this country a set, from a certain \ndate--say, 90 days from now--that is not digital-ready.\n  It cannot operate without a converter box. The difficulty is, \nconsumers are buying thousands and thousands and thousands--into the \nmillions now--of sets, believing they are ready, but they are not \nready. They are digital, but they are not digital-ready. They will not \noperate without a converter chip or converter box. Under the \ncircumstances, we rely on the estimate of 73 million sets.\n  Now, it isn't an argument: How many converter boxes should there be? \nEvery set that is out there needs a converter box to operate. I am told \nby my staff, 20 million sets are sold annually, and still more than \nhalf of them are analog. There are a few of the very high-priced sets \nthat are digital-ready. Some of these sets are in the bedrooms of the \nelderly. They are in elderly care centers. Every room has a little set.\n  Now, who are we to say there are sets out there that don't get \nconverter boxes? That may be determined at a later date by the Congress \nin a bill we have to bring forward, a new communications bill. But for \nthis estimate now, we have to rely upon the estimate we have, that \nthere are at least 73 million sets out there that need a converter box, \nonce we reach the hard date. So that is where the $3 billion came from.\n  Again, I thank my friend from Nevada for his kind comments. But we \nhave to operate on the basis of dealing with the worst case in terms of \nproviding money. We have done that. This is the worst case we can face, \nthis $3 billion. So we have authorized up to $3 billion. To the extent \nit is not used, and not used for 9/11, not used for interoperability, \nnot used for first responders, not used for disaster areas, it will go \nto debt reduction.\n  Our committee has raised far more than was requested of us, and that \nis the problem.\n  We have the luxury of an estimate that says the spectrum auction will \nbring in more than $10 billion. That may be conservative. Many of my \npeople tell me, once we reach that hard date, the demand for this \nspectrum is going to be so large that we cannot even estimate the \namount of money that is going to be there. So $3 billion is not out of \nhand.\n  I urge my friend from Nevada to realize we are not appropriating the \nmoney. We are saying up to $3 billion. I urge the Senator not to change \nthat now. Let us go to the House. Let us work with the best available \ninformation. Let us try to get this bill back to the Senate as a \nconference report before this year ends.\n  If we do not do it and get that other amendment in there somewhere \nthat limits the future production of analog, or less-than-digital-ready \nsets, this demand for money is going to go up. All those sets are being \nbought now. Those new sets need a converter box. They are not digital \nready.\n  So again, I thank my friend. I do not think there is anyone else who \nwants to speak on this amendment. I am prepared to yield back my time, \nbased upon the Senator's comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I will take a couple more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to explain to \neverybody how important it is what the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee has done in getting us a hard date. Less than a year ago, in \nthe Commerce Committee, there was no way we were going to have a hard \ndate. People were talking maybe it would be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 years from \nnow. Some people said we would never have a hard date to convert from \nthe analog TV over to digital. So the committee chairman deserves a \ngreat deal of credit for actually getting us to this time, where we are \ngoing to have a hard date.\n  But the reason I think this is a reasonable amendment--and I would \njust reemphasize to my chairman--is I believe this program should be \nmeans tested, that it should not be for everybody in America, \nmillionaires and the like, to be able to get a digital converter box. \nIf they do not have cable in their homes, it is because they choose not \nto. So they should be able to buy their own converter boxes.\n  As I talked about this GAO study I have, if we limit it to people who \nare at 200 percent of poverty and below, we can buy every one of those \nhouseholds two converter boxes for less than $1 billion. If we do not \ncut the money down from $3 billion to $1 billion, I am afraid we will \nsubsidize every income level home in America, and this money will not \ngo for deficit reduction, that we will actually spend up to the $3 \nbillion.\n  So that is the purpose for offering this amendment. It is to try to \nguide the policy in the future, not just the money today.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment by \nSenator Ensign that would reduce the maximum amount authorized for the \nconverter box subsidy program from $3 billion to $1 billion. A similar \namendment was considered by the Commerce Committee and was soundly \ndefeated by a vote of 19 to 3.\n  The consumer converter box subsidy program is an essential part of \nmaking sure that those consumers who today rely on over-the-air analog \ntelevision are able to make a smooth transition to digital television \nthat does not render their existing analog TV sets obsolete.\n  Without a robust subsidy program, over-the-air households--which are \ndisproportionately minority, elderly and poor--will face a significant \nburden. Moreover, because the Commerce title transfers any unobligated \nfunds from the converter box subsidy account to the account that will \nfund interoperable public safety equipment, this amendment would end up \nhurting first responders in their ability to get new equipment that can \nuse this newly cleared spectrum.\n  Because of significant uncertainty as to consumer demand and the \nexpected cost of converter boxes, we must leave the fund at $3 billion \nand err on the side of caution.\n  For this reason, I must oppose this amendment. I am joined in my \nopposition to the Ensign amendment by the AARP, Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, Consumer's Union, U.S. PIRG, National Hispanic Media \nCoalition, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, League \nof United Latin American Citizens, and the Puerto Rican Defense & \nEducation Fund, among others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe all time has expired on this \namendment. I believe the Senator from Alaska yielded back his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, in a few minutes, I think Senator Landrieu \nis going to be over here to offer the final amendment of the day.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2392\n\n  Pending that, I ask unanimous consent to strike the language on page \n41, beginning on line 3 through line 11.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is of the bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  This is a unanimous consent request to strike the language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Amendment (No. 2392) was agreed to as follows:\n\n       On page 41 of the bill, strike lines 3 through 11.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, very briefly, we now are going to go to \nthe Landrieu amendment. I understand Senator Landrieu is on her way to \nthe floor. She will have from 5:30 to 6 o'clock. At that time, we will \nbe done.\n  I see Senator Landrieu now in the Chamber. We will then be finished \nwith the debate on reconciliation, which means we then go to votes on \nthe\n\n[[Page S12211]]\n\namendments. I want to again alert our colleagues, we have 15 amendments \nalready pending. That is 5 hours of solid voting. We would like to send \nthe message, as clearly as we can, to our colleagues: 15 amendments is \nprobably enough. We do not need to add to the time of the Chamber with \nadditional amendments.\n  I think we have had a very good, full debate on reconciliation. We \nhope very much that 5 hours of solid voting will be sufficient.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if the Senator from Louisiana \nis ready, that we could begin on her amendment at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2366\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 2366.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2366.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide funds for payments to producing States and coastal \n  political subdivisions under the coastal impact assistance program)\n\n       On page 95, line 21, before the period at the end insert \n     the following: ``, of which $1,000,000,000 shall be \n     transferred to the Secretary of the Interior to make payments \n     to producing States and coastal political subdivisions under \n     section 31(b) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1356a(b))''.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we will support an effort to pass \nlegislation to make the technical change deleted from our bill in a \nmore appropriate vehicle.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, thank you very much. I appreciate the \nleaders providing me with an opportunity to speak, briefly, about this \namendment.\n  There have been very important amendments that have been offered and \ndebated throughout the day. As the managers have expressed, we will be \nvoting probably into the night and tomorrow to try to finish budget \nreconciliation. But one of the amendments I have brought today to speak \nabout is one of the most important things we are going to need as a \nfoundation for the recovery of the gulf coast.\n  We have had many discussions about the aftermath of Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita--two major hurricanes that have hit the gulf coast. \nAnd, of course, Wilma hit Florida recently. And there was the \nsubsequent breaking of a levee system that just devastated a major \nAmerican city and region--one we are still reeling from, as our local \nofficials, our business leaders, our university presidents, our general \ncommunity struggles to try to provide a framework for rebuilding. We \nare in the midst of that great debate.\n  The reason it is so difficult--as you can imagine from your own \nexperience as a leader, I say to the Presiding Officer--is that when \nthis has never happened before, there is no textbook. The tragedy is of \nsuch magnitude and is unprecedented in nature that there is no textbook \nyou can go to, to say: Here is step one, step two, step three, as to \nhow to rebuild south Louisiana, southern Mississippi, parts of Alabama \nand Texas.\n  We have had some expedience with hurricanes before. I am not \nsuggesting we have not. But we have not had the experience of a \ndevastation, the kind we are experiencing right now in the New Orleans \nmetropolitan area region--including Saint Bernard Parish, Plaquemines \nParish, Saint Tammany Parish, Jefferson Parish, Washington Parish, \nTangipahoa Parish--and all along the southern part of Mississippi, and \nthe southwestern part which was hit by Rita.\n  I am going to be showing some pictures of it in a moment so that my \ncolleagues can continue to see--not just hear, but to see--pictures of \nthe devastation.\n  So I come to the floor today to offer an amendment for this body to \nconsider that will move some money we have identified in reconciliation \nto our coastal restoration program.\n  In the last Energy bill, by a bipartisan vote of the House and the \nSenate, with the support of the administration, we were able to secure \na downpayment, if you will, on a new coastal plan that will help not \njust Louisiana, but the producing States that generate so much money \nfor the general fund through oil and gas production off of our shores.\n  It was a significant step in the right direction. It happened a few \nweeks before Katrina and Rita hit, and it gave a spark of hope to \npeople in our part of the country that Congress was listening and \nunderstood that the Federal Government had to provide not just \nmandates, not just plans, not just studies, but real money to help us \nsecure better coastal protection. I only wish we had done this 20 years \nago because maybe we could have prevented some of the damage from \nKatrina, but we didn't. And we can talk about why we didn't and what \nthe consequences are, but it is more productive to talk about what we \ncan do now.\n  As we debate how to prioritize our money through reconciliation--some \nfor increased investments, some for tax cuts, some for deficit \nreduction--I wanted to come to the floor to offer an amendment that \nwould provide an additional billion dollars for coastal restoration.\n  In Louisiana, we are the hub of the oil and gas industry, along with \nTexas and Mississippi. This is a picture of one of the major pipelines \nthat comes off of our shore through the marshland. I am not sure if \nthis pipeline is oil or gas, but it is one or the other because they \nhave to be in separate pipelines. They are laid down through our marsh. \nThese are the lifelines, if you will, to light up the country, whether \nit is Chicago or New York or California. The price of gas is extremely \nhigh. The price at the gas pump is high. We don't have enough of these \npipelines in the country, and we are not conserving enough. We are \nworking on both--increasing production and conserving more. But right \nnow, this pipeline exists.\n  As you can see, when the hurricane struck, the levee systems of this \npipeline were broken and water started moving and gushing into this \nmarsh. Saltwater comes in and the marsh starts fading away. It is \nbasically eaten up by saltwater coming in. We need to be constantly \nvigilant about maintaining proper levee systems. Some of this work has \nto be done by the private companies that laid down the pipelines, but \nthe Federal Government has a great role to play in investing wisely and \nstrategically to help keep this marsh healthy. It protects the city of \nNew Orleans and, most importantly, it protects the whole region and, \nmost importantly, it protects the mouth of the Mississippi which serves \nas such a trading hub for the Nation.\n  This is another picture that shows the devastation of the wetlands \nloss that was in National Geographic. It is particularly moving. This \nis a man who is holding up a picture of a camp that his grandparents--\nright off of Empire, LA--used to have when he was a child. This is \nprobably 40 to 45 years ago, maybe a little bit longer. It is small, \nbut you can see the healthy marsh that once existed behind this home.\n  This is what it looks like now. You can't see marsh for miles and \nmiles. It has been eaten up. We have been here now year after year \nsaying: Every investment that we can make, we can restore this marsh. \nWe can't restore every acre we have lost, but we know that our \nscientists and our engineers can restore a lot of this marshland. The \nmarshland serves--south of Louisiana, south of New Orleans, and in the \nsouthern part of our State--as a great protective barrier. It protects \nnot just people and businesses, but the energy infrastructure, the \npipes, the refineries that exist to help our Nation continue to grow.\n  Investments of this nature are quite important.\n  Without a continuing affirmation from this Congress that we \nunderstand investments in coastal protection are important and we are \ngiving real money to it, I am afraid anything we do will be for naught \nto rebuild the New Orleans region. Because people have told me--poor, \nmiddle income,\n\n[[Page S12212]]\n\nand wealthy, business people and workers--Senator, I cannot bring my \nfamily back. I won't bring my family back. I can't build my business \nback unless I have some security or sense that the administration and \nthis Congress are going to help us build a levee system so we don't \nwash away again.\n  Think about that. Why would someone who lost their home or their \nbusiness, even if they received an insurance check--which some people \nhave, not all people, and we are working on that--even if they received \na $250,000 insurance check to rebuild their building, why would they, \nif they think this is what their house or their neighborhood might look \nlike? This is a little dramatic because, of course, this is not what \nNew Orleans looks like. This is outside of the city, but this is what \nPlaquemine and St. Bernard look like. Why would someone take an \ninsurance check? To be clear, we wouldn't give someone an insurance \ncheck to build a house such as this in this area because we are going \nto build smarter, better, and higher. There will be some places people \ncan't go back and rebuild.\n  But in the middle of the metropolitan area, in a neighborhood that \nnever flooded before, people have checks. And they are saying: I am \nafraid to rebuild my house. What if a big rainstorm comes or another \nhurricane and washes us away.\n  Anything we can do, whether it is a half a billion, a billion, next \nyear coming back with some more--we are not expecting $20 or $40 \nbillion in one shot. We know that is a lot of money. But we have to get \na little bit every year so we can give people hope that this can be \ndone.\n  Basically, that is what the amendment does. We have had great support \nfrom Chairman Domenici, from Ranking Member Bingaman. We have had good \nsupport from Senator Stevens, an understanding from Senator Stevens and \nSenator Inouye on the Commerce Committee, because they share \njurisdiction, although the Energy Committee has jurisdiction over the \nOuter Continental Shelf. Most certainly, the Commerce Committee \nunderstands the importance of coastal because it is under their \njurisdiction. That is basically what the amendment does. We will be \nvoting on it tomorrow. I am hopeful we can get good support for the \namendment and lay an additional downpayment on top of that money that \nwe did for energy and get that done.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2352\n\n  I see my colleague Senator Kennedy here. We wanted to speak for a \nmoment on another amendment that is pending. I yield a minute to \nSenator Kennedy to speak on the education amendment of Senator Enzi.\n  How much time do we have left, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Shall I yield some time to Senator Kennedy of that 5 \nminutes? I am happy to yield about 3 minutes to him.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Chair would let me know when there is 1 minute \nremaining.\n  In a bipartisan way, our Health and Education Committee, under the \nleadership of Senator Enzi, has found some $2.7 billion that can be \nused for education. Under the Landrieu amendment, $1.1 billion of that \nwill be used to reduce origination fees that help students all over the \ncountry. The rest, $1.6 billion, would be used to help the 370,000 \nchildren who have been displaced as a result of Hurricane Katrina.\n  This will be the only opportunity in the Senate to help children who \nhave been displaced from their education. This is the only opportunity \nfor the Senate to take action. On August 29, when that hurricane came \nthrough the gulf and flooded Louisiana and caused havoc along the \ncoast, schools were decimated. Hundreds of thousands of children have \nall been displaced. Schools--public, private, and also church-related--\nhave welcomed these children into their midst, across the Nation. This \namendment is one-shot, one-time, temporary assistance to those schools \nthat are accepting displaced children and need support.\n  There are some who have said: We can't do this because this is a \nvoucher program. I have been opposed to vouchers because we have scarce \nresources. And if we have scarce education resources, we ought to use \nthem for public schools. We don't have that choice today. There are no \npublic schools. This was an equal opportunity disaster for children, \nProtestant, Catholic, Jewish, across the gulf. We have one opportunity, \nonly one opportunity, to provide some help, and it is our amendment. We \nprovide all kinds of protections to ensure this aid is temporary and \nfor the schools that opened their doors to displaced students. This is \nabout children. It is simple. These children, these schools, need \nassistance.\n  I reject those arguments that say this is a foot in the door. I was \naround here when we passed Medicare, and they said: This is socialized \nmedicine. That was poppycock then. It is poppycock now.\n  Let us help those children. Let's say for those children who were \nimpacted by this disaster, let us provide help to the schools that have \nopened their arms to embrace these children for a limited period of \ntime.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana for sponsoring the amendment with \nmy distinguished colleagues on the Education Committee and myself, and \nI urge the Senate to approve the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor his strong advocacy and support. Without his leadership and that of \nSenator Enzi, we would not be where we are today on the Enzi-Kennedy-\nAlexander-Landrieu amendment.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I reserve that time. There may be \nopposition. I am hoping not. I would be happy to yield back all the \ntime if the manager wants to move on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may reserve the time.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am sympathetic to the concerns of the \nSenator from Louisiana relative to the needs of the children who have \nbeen affected so significantly by the event. I especially appreciate \nthe fact that Senator Kennedy has come to the floor and supported \nessentially a program which will allow the dollars to follow the \nchildren versus a program which would be more school centric and, \ntherefore, you could call it a voucher. Whatever you want to call it, I \ncall it good sense to allow these dollars to follow the children. \nHopefully, that will be the way the final package is arranged.\n  The only issue is whether the money comes from the additional savings \nwhich came out of the HELP Committee or whether the money comes from \nthe $40 billion which has already been appropriated as a part of the \noriginal Katrina supplementals, the additional supplementals that may \nfollow. So where the money comes from is the issue. As the amendment \nprocess goes forward tomorrow and we determine whether these dollars \nare still available and whether it is appropriate to use these dollars \nor whether we should look toward the supplemental, in any event, the \nprogram should be paid for.\n  At this point, I am going to move on to another subject, unless the \nSenator wants to respond to my comments with her 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will respond. I thank the Senator for \nhis interest in helping out in this extraordinary circumstance with \n370,000 children displaced. I wanted the Senator to know, of course, I \nhave been in and out of the city many times. I spoke to one of my \nrelatives and asked, how is the neighborhood looking?\n  She said: Mary, it is so strange. There are no children anywhere in \nthe city of any age. You don't see any children.\n  As Senator Kennedy said, the reason is because we have no school \nsystem. Three-hundred and seventy thousand children have moved to other \npublic and private systems, grateful to anyone who would take them in.\n  I thank our colleagues for coming together in this bipartisan way--\nSenator Enzi, Senator Kennedy, Senator Alexander, Senator Dodd--to put \ntogether\n\n[[Page S12213]]\n\nan amendment that is not a voucher program, not a traditional ``help \npublic schools only.'' It truly is a bipartisan compromise to try to \nhelp in an extraordinary situation.\n  I hope tomorrow, when we have this vote, we will get a positive vote. \nI thank the Senators for allowing us to offer the coastal amendment. We \nhave a lot of support for this. Again, it will add to the money we \nalready have. We will need more over time, but every little bit at this \npoint helps to give people hope that they can come back to this region, \nlive safely and securely with floods and rainstorms, hurricanes, and \nother disasters.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \nintroduced by Senator Enzi. This amendment is designed to do two \nthings: provide additional savings to postsecondary students by \nlowering origination fees on student loans and provide immediate relief \nto K-12 students affected by Hurricane Katrina. The K-12 portion of the \namendment is based, in part, on the Hurricane Katrina Elementary and \nSecondary Education Recovery Act introduced by Senators Enzi, Kennedy, \nAlexander, and myself just weeks ago. Like the bill, the amendment is \ndesigned to provide much needed relief to the children, families and \nschools devastated and affected by Hurricane Katrina.\n  Two months ago, hundreds of thousands of children were displaced by \nKatrina. Schools in the Gulf States were damaged and in many cases, \ndestroyed. But schools in the Gulf States were not the only ones \naffected.\n  In response to this unprecedented crisis, schools across the country \ntook Gulf State students in, offering them a safe haven, a place to \nlearn and some sense of normalcy and routine. The willingness of these \nschools to take students in without hesitation point to the education \nsystem as an integral part of our communities. The amendment before us \nassists these schools and the schools directly impacted in a number of \nways.\n  First, it provides immediate aid to restart school operations in the \ndistricts devastated by Katrina. In the wake of the hurricane, the HELP \nCommittee held a hearing on the devastating affects of the storm. At \nthis hearing, the superintendent of Jefferson Parish Schools in \nLouisiana said that if ``you rebuild the schools, they will come.'' \nThrough these comments, she helped us understand that rebuilding \nschools will have a major impact on the economic viability of the \ncommunities directly impacted by the storm. She reminded us of \nsomething that we already knew, that schools are the heart and soul of \ncommunities.\n  The amendment also provides financial assistance for displaced \nstudents wherever they are currently enrolled in school. Through these \nprovisions, public and nonpublic schools will receive assistance for \nspecified purposes as long as materials purchased and services provided \nare secular and neutral in nature and are not used for religious \ninstruction, indoctrination or worship. This provision recognizes that \nin taking students in, schools around the country may need a little \nextra support in getting these students the services that they need and \nthe education that they deserve.\n  Additionally, the amendment also allows the Secretary of Education to \ndelay for up to 1 year the highly qualified provisions within the No \nChild Left Behind Act for teachers affected by Katrina. This provision \nrecognizes that like students, teachers and paraprofessionals have been \ndisplaced and should not be professionally penalized because of this.\n  Mr. President, collectively these provisions provide temporary, \nemergency impact aid for displaced students. It is temporary in that it \nsunsets at the end of the current school year, emergency in that it is \nnecessary because of the extraordinary circumstances that we have been \npresented with, and impact aid as it is assistance for those schools \nthat have been impacted as thousands of children and their families \nhave left the devastated areas.\n  Most importantly, by attaching this legislation to reconciliation we \nare providing students with assistance now. It has already been 2 \nmonths since the hurricane devastated the Gulf region. These children \ncannot and should not have to wait another day for the assistance that \nwe promised in the wake of the storm 2 months ago.\n  Today, we are reaching out to all students because it makes sense, \nbecause it gets kids back on their feet as quickly as possible. As I \nhave said before, we are not changing the generic laws. The level of \nassistance we are providing to nonpublic schools is being authorized \nsolely because of the unprecedented nature of the crisis, the massive \ndislocation of students, and the short duration of the assistance. I \ncannot underscore this enough--The provisions in this bill are a \ndeparture from Federal law but they are a temporary departure in light \nof extraordinary events.\n  Next school year, in terms of assistance to nonpublic schools, we \nwill go back to the ways things are. For now, we will get students the \nassistance they need. They deserve as much.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nmaterial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       PROVISIONS OF S. 1932 EXTRANEOUS PURSUANT TO THE BYRD RULE\n\n       (Prepared by the Senate Budget Committee Democratic Staff)\n\n            Title I as Reported by Committee on Agriculture\n\n       No apparent violations.\n\n Title II--As Reported by Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Description of\n           Provision                Violations           provision\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSection 2001..................

Mr. President, I rise today to offer my thoughts on the \nDeficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act currently pending before \nthe Senate.\n\n[[Page S12215]]\n\n  On its own, this bill would cut about $39.1 billion from mandatory \nspending programs over the next 5 years. But it is a mistake to look at \nthis bill on its own because the reconciliation process under which \nthis bill comes to the floor is made up of three parts that when put \ntogether will cut funding for critical programs, implement \nirresponsible tax cuts, and actually increase both the deficit and \nnational debt.\n  Today we are considering the first part of the reconciliation \nprocess, a package of spending cuts. As a member of the Budget \nCommittee, I opposed this bill in committee and will oppose it when the \nfull Senate votes on it later this week. While I am pleased the bill \ncontains provisions related to FDIC reform that I have fought for, \noverall this bill simply takes us in the wrong direction.\n  I believe, in the interest of providing more tax cuts for wealthy \nAmericans, the leadership in the Senate is cutting funding for \nprograms, many of which are critical in my home State of South Dakota. \nFor example, the bill includes $4.57 billion in cuts to Medicaid that \nare the result of changes in the way pharmacies are reimbursed, \nsomething that may harm community pharmacies in my State.\n  There are new restrictions placed on State Medicaid targeted case \nmanagement programs, which have created much concern among consumer \nadvocacy groups. Also included is a provision that reduces payments to \nlong-term care providers for unpaid beneficiary payments or ``bad \ndebt,'' a provision that is being opposed by leading nursing home and \nconsumer groups.\n  Further, I am very troubled by the $3 billion in cuts to agricultural \nprograms, including a 2.5 percent across-the-board cut in commodity \nprograms and $1.1 billion in cuts to conservation programs over the \nnext 5 years. This proposal would weaken the essential safety net that \nwe need to foster economic development in rural America and would be \nespecially difficult in this time of weak commodity prices. The 2002 \nfarm bill, our contract with rural America, has already come in at $14 \nbillion under projected costs. Simply put, agriculture has paid enough.\n  If this Senate proposal were not bad enough, I have little doubt that \nthe package that will be brought back after conference with the House \nwill be worse. The House is considering a proposal to cut at least $50 \nbillion in spending over the next 5 years. The Washington Post notes \nthat the House package will ``cut back Federal aid to State child-\nsupport enforcement programs, limit Federal payments to some foster \ncare families, and cut welfare payments to the disabled.''\n  In addition, the House bill includes $3.7 billion in cuts to farm \nprograms, including $844 million in cuts to food stamps.\n  Budgets are about priorities, and I understand the need to bring \nspending under control. But it seems irresponsible to do so at the \nexpense of ordinary people and struggling family farmers when huge \nagribusinesses continue to reap millions without effective payment caps \nin place, and tax cuts for multimillionaires are being preserved.\n  I recently received a thoughtful letter on the budget from Bishop \nMark S. Hanson, the presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church \nin America, ELCA, and signed by all 66 ELCA bishops. I am a member of \nthe ELCA, and while I do not take directions on how to vote from my \nchurch, my religious faith and the values it instills in me do impact \nmy views. As the letter states, ``Programs such as Food Stamps, \nMedicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and \nTemporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) help to keep struggling \nfamilies together and assist low-income working families in moving to \nhigher economic ground. This is not the time to cut such important \nprograms while using the cuts to pay for tax breaks for those who don't \nneed them.''\n  The country faces a series of challenges that Congress is failing to \naddress. Instead of cutting domestic programs to pave the way for \nadditional tax cuts, the Congress should focus on solving the problem \nof soaring energy costs. High energy prices are a tax on the middle \nclass and drain disposable income, causing the public to spend less and \nmake painful tradeoffs all in order to keep the car or truck filled \nwith gas. The Democrats have a plan to reduce gasoline prices and help \nfamilies with high winter heating costs. Unfortunately, the \ncongressional leadership is not focusing on the real needs of Americans \nin choosing to devote an entire week to a package of budget cuts as \npart of a larger plan to push a tax cuts for the rich agenda.\n  If this truly was a deficit reduction package, or even if the savings \nwere going to pay the costs of hurricane relief, that would be one \nthing. However, when this bill is approved, the Senate is expected to \nbegin working on the second piece of the reconciliation process, an \nirresponsible tax cut bill. The reconciliation instructions approved as \na part of last spring's budget resolution provided for an additional \n$70 billion in tax cuts.\n  While the tax bill has not been finalized, early indications are this \nbill will not result in tax breaks for middle and working class \nAmericans, but will once again reward the wealthiest in our society. \nAnd when these tax cuts are included, the Republican's deficit \nreduction omnibus reconciliation plan will actually increase the \ndeficit by $20 billion to $30 billion over the next 5 years. So what \nmany in the majority party in Washington will call trimming the fat \nactually increases the limit on the national credit card.\n  This leads to the final piece of the Republicans' reconciliation \nplan--Congress will be required to pass legislation to raise, yet \nagain, the Federal debt ceiling by $781 billion. It may surprise many \nAmericans to learn that a large portion of our Nation's public debt is \nactually held by foreign countries like Japan and China. By further \nincreasing our debt and the need for more foreign financing of that \ndebt, we give other countries substantial leverage over our economy and \nthreaten our Nation's economic well-being. Make no mistake, the \ndecisions we are making in enacting this legislation will have long \nlasting consequences for our economy.\n  As I said earlier, budgets are about priorities. The budget proposal \nwe have before us simply sets the wrong priorities by cutting programs \nfor the most vulnerable in our society to make way for additional tax \ncuts for millionaires, all the while increasing the debt burden we will \npass on to our children and grandchildren. These are not priorities \nthat I--or the vast majority of Americans--can support.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, to make our country strong again, we need \nto invest here at home, and that is why I oppose this budget. It is a \nbill that will cut $35 billion from America's priorities and burden our \nchildren with massive debt. Simply put, I think America can do better.\n  I will vote against this flawed budget, just as I did in the Budget \nCommittee last week, because it starves our highest priorities. Not \nonly that, this bill opens up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to \noil drilling, which will not solve our energy problems. And I have \nserious concerns about a House proposal--which could be added to the \nHouse version of this bill--to split the Ninth Circuit into two smaller \ncircuits.\n  Mr. President, a budget is a statement of priorities. As I look at \nthe challenges facing our country--and as I listen to people in my home \nState of Washington--it is clear that our top priority now must be \nmaking America strong again. To do that, we need to invest here at \nhome.\n  Today, too many people don't feel secure. They feel like they are one \nstep away from losing their job or their pension or their healthcare. \nThey are worried about high gas prices and how they are going to heat \ntheir homes this winter. They are worried about the men and women in \nuniform, who are returning home and can't find a job or healthcare. \nThey are worried they won't be able to afford college tuition for their \nchildren. Many people are worried about the new prescription drug \nprogram, which will make life harder for so many vulnerable families.\n  Today people across America worry about being safe here at home. They \nlook around their communities and see aging and unsafe highways, roads \nand bridges. After what happened in the Gulf Coast with Hurricane \nKatrina, they are worried their own communities are not protected. \nThere is a coastline, or a volcano, or a fault line, or an aging dam in \nevery State in this\n\n[[Page S12216]]\n\nNation, and this budget doesn't make the right investments in \nprevention or protection.\n  This budget has the wrong priorities. I believe we should be \nproviding greater investments in the tools that spur economic growth \nand help all Americans--education, health care, transportation, and job \ntraining. In short, we should be making Americans more secure. \nUnfortunately, the package before us today does just the opposite. It \ncuts $35 billion from areas like healthcare and education.\n  And what is more, this is only the first step in the reconciliation \nprocess. You will not hear much about it from the other side of the \naisle, but in the coming weeks, the Senate is scheduled to take up the \nnext piece of the reconciliation process--a massive tax giveaway that's \neven bigger than the cuts we're considering this week.\n  So what's happening here today is we're being asked to make painful \ncuts for average Americans so that in a few weeks we can turn around \nand give massive giveaways to the most well off. That is what's really \ngoing on here.\n  The massive tax cut package that's coming soon would give billions \naway to the richest people in our country. Multi-millionaires and \nspecial interests will reap the benefits from these budget-busting tax \nbreaks, including capital gains and dividends tax breaks. In fact, the \nupcoming tax breaks exceed the spending cuts we're considering this \nweek by more than $30 billion.\n  And who benefits? 53 percent of the benefits of capital gains and \ndividends go to those with incomes greater than $1 million. Listen to \nthe facts. On average, those who make more than $1 million would get \ntax cuts of more than $35,000. But those with income under $50,000 \nwould get just $6.\n  Something is clearly out of whack.\n  The Senate leadership wants to impose painful cuts on average \nfamilies today. Why? So that in a few weeks they can give massive tax \ncuts to the most well off. That is wrong.\n  Today people are hurting on the Gulf Coast. People are concerned for \ntheir safety--be it by terrorist attack or flu epidemic and instead of \nmeeting these important priorities, the Senate will cut spending, give \naway tax cuts, and increase the amount of debt each American owes.\n  Taken together, these efforts represent the core values and \npriorities of the Republican Congress, but not of the American people. \nAmerica can do better. The bill before us this week cuts important \nprograms while doing almost nothing to address the real priorities \nfacing our nation.\n  First let me talk about Medicaid--a health care program, a safety net \nfor our country's most vulnerable and sickest. This bill cuts Medicaid \nspending for those least among us by $27 billion. At the same time, \nRepublican members of this body are refusing to take up and pass bi-\npartisan Medicaid relief for Americans affected by Hurricane Katrina, \nthey want to slash spending on the program here today.\n  What about agriculture--programs that make sure we can feed our \nNation? This bill also cuts agriculture investments by $3 billion, and \nthat will have a painful impact on our family farmers who are \nstruggling today. Just last week, I sat down with farmers from \nWashington State, and I can tell you they are reeling from drought and \nhigh fuel and fertilizer prices. This bill makes their lives even \nharder by retracting the support that helps family farms get by and \nwill impact our country's ability to ensure we will be able to feed our \nNation and keep our country strong. These farm families need our help, \nbut Republicans just say no.\n  This bill also undermines the pension plans of millions of hard-\nworking Americans. This is a top anxiety for people everywhere I go. Is \nmy retirement gone? What happened to my security?\n  This bill will increase the financial burden on companies and drive \nmore employers into bankruptcy and out of the defined benefit pension \nsystem. It more than doubles the Pension Benefit Guaranty premiums, and \nit will index those payments in the future. This budget we are debating \ntoday undermines the carefully crafted bipartisan pension reform bill \nthat the HELP Committee bill recently passed unanimously. America's \npension policy should be driven by what is best for American workers, \nretirees and employers--not by the need to meet an arbitrary budget \ntarget.\n  And of course, this budget opens ANWR up to shortsighted drilling. \nThis misguided effort is especially troublesome, and is worth a few \nminutes of time here on the Senate floor. We are all concerned about \nthe high cost of energy. It's a tremendous burden for families, \nbusinesses and farmers. We should use that concern to make wise choices \nthat will actually help our country. Instead, this bill takes \nshortsighted steps in the wrong direction. The responsible way to \naddress our energy problems is to focus on long term solutions like \nreducing our need for oil, and investing in clean, renewable energy \nsources.\n  I oppose drilling in ANWR because the potential benefits do not \noutweigh the significant environmental impacts. The Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge is an important and unique national treasure. It's the \nonly conservation system in North America that protects a complete \nspectrum of arctic ecosystems. It's the most biologically productive \npart of the Arctic Refuge. And it's an important calving ground for a \nlarge herd of caribou, which are vital to many Native Alaskans. Energy \nexploration in ANWR would have a significant impact on this unique \necosystem.\n  Further, development will not provide the benefits being advertised. \nProponents claim that energy exploration has become more \nenvironmentally friendly in recent years. While that may be true, there \nare still significant environmental impacts for this sensitive region. \nExploration means a footprint for drilling, permanent roads, gravel \npits, water wells, and air strips. We recognize that our economy and \nlifestyle require significant energy resources, and we are facing some \nimportant energy questions. However, opening ANWR to oil and gas \ndrilling is not the answer to our energy needs.\n  And let's keep in mind that drilling in ANWR will not make us less \ndependent on foreign oil. As a Nation, the only way to become less \ndependent on foreign oil is to become less dependent on oil overall. \nThe oil reserves in ANWR are not enough to significantly reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  There are better ways to meet America's energy needs--including \nboosting fuel efficiency, expanding the use of homegrown renewable and \nalternative fuels, investing in new technologies like fuel cells, \ndeveloping and deploying more energy efficient technologies, and \nimproving conservation and energy efficiency. Drilling in ANWR is not a \nserious answer to our country's serious energy challenges, and it \nshould not be included in this budget bill.\n  Another reason I am voting against this bill is because it will \nclearly get much worse in conference--through steeper cuts in critical \ninvestments. This budget bill already cuts $35 billion from America's \npriorities. And on the House side, leaders are working to cut an \nadditional $15 billion from infrastructure, education and healthcare. \nThat would move this bill even further in the wrong direction.\n  Finally, I am very concerned about a possible attempt in the House--\nwhich we may see next week--to split the 9th Circuit.\n  As a member of the West Coast delegation, I strongly oppose this \nchange. The House proposal is not warranted by the facts and is not \nsupported by the judges on the circuit. Back in 1980, when Congress \nsplit the 5th Circuit, all of the judges supported that move. But \ntoday, that is not the case. I understand that a majority of judges on \nthe 9th Circuit oppose the split. I've spoken with some of them, and \nthey have said a split could create new problems.\n  They pointed out that splitting the circuit would impose new costs \nfor facilities, staff and administration. The efficiency we have today \nwould turn to duplication tomorrow if the circuit is divided. There \nwould be significant costs to establish a new circuit headquarters and \nto create a duplicate administration system. In an era of limited \nbudgets, this makes little sense. As the ranking member on the \nsubcommittee that funds the Judiciary, I know we don't have extra money \nto spend to duplicate administrative services.\n  A split would also lead to a duplication of cases. Today, by deciding \ncases for nine States, the circuit provides\n\n[[Page S12217]]\n\nclear, uniform guidance to district courts. That prevents a duplication \nof cases. If the circuit is divided, issues decided in the new 9th \nCircuit would have to be decided again in the new 12th Circuit, \ndoubling the use of judicial resources and costing even more money. And \nin addition to the massive cost associated with splitting the 9th \nCircuit, the change would split the West Coast Technology Corridor into \ntwo different circuits. That could have a paralyzing effect on IT and \ntechnology growth since there would be a weaker judicial foundation.\n  I share my concerns about this because next week there may be an \neffort in the House of Representatives to attach the judicial provision \nto the House version of this bill. I want House Members to know that as \na member of the affected delegation--and as the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee that funds the Judiciary--I oppose this change.\n  Mr. President, this budget plan has the wrong priorities and that is \nwhy I am voting against it. We need to make America stronger and invest \nhere at home. This budget does just the opposite--cutting key \ninvestments in the things that our people need. Why? To have money for \ntax cuts for the wealthiest. America can do better. I urge my \ncolleagues to reject these flawed priorities and work to invest in that \nwhich will make our country and our people strong.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, more and more our country's fight against \nHIV/AIDS is being hindered because we are not focusing enough of our \nresources on treating individuals who have been diagnosed with HIV so \nwe prevent their illnesses from progressing to full-blown AIDS. This is \nespecially true for those with low-income who may lack stable access to \npotentially life-saving pharmaceutical treatments and other health care \nservices.\n  While Medicaid is an important provider of health care to vulnerable \nAmericans living with AIDS, they generally must be disabled before they \ncan qualify for coverage. In a sense, we require them to become sicker \nbefore they can get treatment, and that is simply not right.\n  Full-blown AIDS is an incredibly costly illness and it has much more \nof an impact on an individual's quality of life than HIV. That is why \nit is important for us to focus our resources on providing early \ntreatment to individuals with HIV.\n  Earlier this year, I, along with 27 of my colleagues, filed \nlegislation that would have allowed states the option of providing \nMedicaid coverage to low-income individuals who have been diagnosed \nwith HIV. The initiative, known as the Early Treatment for HIV Act, or \nETHA, was modeled after the successful breast and cervical cancer \nbenefit added to Medicaid program several years ago. My amendment would \nprovide the care in the same ``early is better'' fashion, so that more \nHIV cases are prevented from reaching the point of full-blown AIDS.\n  Like the breast and cervical cancer benefit, ETHA would provide \nStates the incentive of an enhanced Federal Medicaid match to extend \ncoverage to those individuals living with HIV--the same rate that is \npaid to them to operate their S-CHIP programs.\n  Realizing the tight budget constraints we are currently facing, I \nhave restructured my original ETHA proposal into a 5-year demonstration \nproject that is capped at $450 million. States will apply to the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services to offer Medicaid coverage \nto low-income individuals who have been diagnosed with HIV.\n  This scaled back version would provide Congress and CMS the \nopportunity to learn more about the cost-saving benefits of providing \ntreatment to those with HIV in the early stages of their illness. It is \nexpected that in addition to Medicaid, other Federal programs--like SSI \nand Medicare--will realize significant long-term savings by preventing \nindividuals from being disabled by full-blown AIDS.\n  Additionally, with more and more states having financial difficulties \nwith their AIDS Drug Assistance Programs--such as North Carolina, \nNebraska, Missouri and Minnesota--it is important that we provide \nalternative methods of delivering treatment to those individuals with \nHIV/AIDS who may be living in poverty.\n  Most importantly though, the assistance authorized by this proposal \nwill help individuals with HIV lead healthier, longer lives, so that \nthey can remain active participants in both the community and the \nworkforce and improve their chances of living to one day see a cure for \ntheir illness.\n  As I mentioned, the cost of this amendment is $450 million over 5 \nyears. That amount would be offset with a .8 percent increase in the \nbrand-name prescription drug rebate. I realize that the package already \nincludes an increase in the drug rebate, but the additional request \nmade in this amendment, less than one percent, will have an enormous \npayoff in the long-run. I don't believe it's too high a price to pay \nfor the benefits that ETHA will provide the Federal and State \ngovernments, as well as individuals living with HIV.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. I \nunderstand that there is concern over keeping the underlying package \nthat was passed by the Finance Committee intact. I assure you that this \namendment will not affect the bottom-line savings Chairman Grassley and \nother members--including myself--worked so hard to achieve in title VI \nof the Deficit Reduction Act.\n  In fact, in the long-term, my amendment should increase savings to \nthe Federal Government by providing targeted, effective care to those \nindividuals who genuinely need it, which will help them maintain \nactive, healthy lives. That is a strategy I fully support.\n  I will be working with the leadership as the debate moves forward \ntoday to schedule a vote on this amendment. At the appropriate time, I \nask for my colleagues' support on this bill that is not only fiscally \nresponsible, but the right thing to do.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2351\n\n  Mr. CARPER. The last time I came to the floor to discuss the benefits \nof reinstating the pay-as-you-go rules, I related to everyone the \ntheory of holes.\n  As much as I like talking about Dennis Healey, who used to be Great \nBritain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, I was hoping that I wouldn't \nhave to again remind my Senate colleagues of his wisdom.\n  The theory of holes is simple. It says, when you find yourself in a \nhole, stop digging. Not only are we still digging, we also seem to be \ndigging more furiously, taking ourselves to new fiscal depths.\n  Last year, we dug our way to a $319 billion budget deficit, which is \nthe third worst deficit in the history of our country. That number, by \nitself, is a clear indicator of our current fiscal misfortunes.\n  What is more telling is that number--again, a $319 billion deficit--\nwas hailed as good news by some in the current administration. Why? \nWell, because, at the beginning of the year, everyone expected the \ndeficit to be over $400 billion. An improvement from worse to bad is \nstill bad.\n  It is no wonder that many Americans think Washington, DC is no longer \nin touch with reality. Where they live--in towns large and small across \nDelaware and across America--this kind of fiscal recklessness is not an \noption. To the contrary, the vast majority of the people we serve \nstrive to live by two simple rules: Live within your means and pay as \nyou go.\n  In turn, families demand that their State and local governments live \nby the same rules. We in Congress used to live by those same rules. \nUnfortunately, they were allowed to expire in 2002.\n  We have been close to reinstating pay-as-you-go budgeting on two \noccasions since 2002. A year ago, the Senate voted to reinstate it. \nUnfortunately, it did not survive conference and was dropped out of the \nfinal compromise. Then, earlier this year, we fell one vote short of \nagain passing pay-as-you-go budgeting.\n  With this amendment, Senator Conrad is giving us another opportunity \nto again live within our means and to pay for the things we find worth \ndoing.\n  Pay-as-you-go budgeting requires that proposals to increase spending \nwould have to be offset, either by cutting other spending or by raising \nrevenue. Likewise, if I were to propose a tax cut, I would have to come \nup with an offset to make sure the hole we are in was not dug deeper.\n\n[[Page S12218]]\n\n  Pay-as-you-go budgeting served us well during the 12-year period it \nwas in force. And, it is important to note that during that time it \napplied to both the spending and tax sides of the ledger. That kind of \nacross-the-board fiscal discipline eventually lead to our eliminating \nthe deficit, establishing budget surpluses and even beginning to pay \ndown a significant portion of the publicly held debt.\n  That is not a bad record. In fact, it is a good one. And, it looks \nespecially good when compared to our current period of record deficits \nand a national debt of over $8 trillion.\n  We cannot continue down the fiscal path we are currently on. A fiscal \npolicy based on cutting taxes, on increasing spending and then on \nborrowing whatever is needed to make up the difference cannot be \nsustained.\n  Moreover, today's borrow-and-spend policies are as immoral as they \nare unsustainable. We are running up bills that will be left for our \nchildren and grandchildren to pay.\n  However, we still have time to do the right thing. We still have time \nto begin to put our fiscal house in order. Voting for Senator Conrad's \namendment to reinstate pay-as-you-go budgeting would be a good start to \nthat end.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2352\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered along with \nseveral of my colleagues be explained very simply--it commits the \neducation savings above the HELP Committee reconciliation target to \nstudents.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, my committee received the largest reconciliation \ninstruction--$13.65 billion in spending cuts over 5 years. That is \nnearly 40 percent of the overall target. We exceeded that target and \nreported legislation with net savings of $16.4 billion over 5 years. \nThat is an additional $2.75 billion beyond HELP's reconciliation \ntarget.\n  This amendment ensures that extra savings generated from education \nwill be returned to students. Let me be clear, education savings should \nbe for students.\n  The amendment makes higher education more affordable for students by \nreducing the cost of college by lowering the origination fees students \npay on Federal student loans. The current origination fee of 3 percent \nwould be reduced to 2 percent under my amendment. This change of 1 \npercent can save students at least $500 over the 10-year life of the \nloan. For independent and graduate students, these savings are even \ngreater.\n  Why is it important that higher education be more affordable? Because \neducation beyond high school and lifelong learning opportunities are \nvital to ensuring that America retains its competitive edge in the \nglobal economy. Technology, demographics, and diversity have brought \nfar-reaching changes to the U.S. economy and the workplace, including \nan increased demand for a well-educated and highly skilled workforce. \nIf we continue on the path we are on, we will not have people with the \ntalents and the skills we will need to fill the jobs that will be \ncreated over the next few years. In this decade, 40 percent of job \ngrowth will be in positions requiring a postsecondary education.\n  If our students and workers are to have the best chance to succeed in \nlife and employers to remain competitive, we must ensure that everyone \nhas the opportunity to achieve academically and obtain the skills they \nneed to succeed, regardless of their background. For many, acquiring a \npostsecondary education or training will be the key to their success.\n  This amendment also provides fiscally responsible temporary aid for \nmore than 300,000 students displaced by Hurricane Katrina. As soon as \nthey could, both public and nonpublic schools in neighboring \ncommunities, regions, and States enrolled these students. Many of these \ndisplaced students are still enrolled in schools that are not the ones \nthey would have been attending had Hurricane Katrina not struck.\n\n  This amendment includes provisions from the Hurricane Katrina \nElementary and Secondary Education Recovery Act, S. 1904, a bipartisan \ncompromise that accomplishes the common goal of providing relief to \nsupport the instruction and services that the students displaced by \nthis terrible storm need in order to continue their education, \nregardless of whether it is in a public or nonpublic school.\n  With this amendment we will be providing one-time, temporary, \nemergency aid on behalf of these students. These displaced students \ndeserve help to continue their education under these extraordinary \ncircumstances caused by a disaster of unprecedented scope. At the same \ntime these States and schools need realistic, fiscally responsible \nassistance from the Congress to accommodate the students they have \ntaken into their education system, who came to them without any \nproperty tax base or tuition payment which had already been made. Our \ntop concern was to make sure that all displaced students continued \ntheir education.\n  Some students are already returning home as their schools reopen, but \nsevere problems of displacement remain. Many schools will remain closed \nfor the entire school year. This amendment is a one-time temporary \nsolution that sets aside ideological differences to make sure that \nchildren are not harmed unnecessarily by the impact of this \nunprecedented disaster. It focuses on the immediate needs of students \nwith the expectation that they will return home to their local school.\n  Let me briefly describe what this amendment does. First and foremost, \nit provides support for all displaced students, ensures accountability, \nand is fiscally responsible by sending the funds through regular \nchannels to local school districts and accounts established on behalf \nof students attending nonpublic schools.\n  The amendment helps schools directly impacted by the hurricane reopen \ntheir doors by providing $450 billion in grant assistance. These grants \nare meant to supplement FEMA funding to ensure the effective use of \nFederal funds and can be used to assist those who are working to reopen \nthese schools.\n  The largest portion of the funding under this amendment is focused on \neasing the temporary transition of students into new schools, both \npublic and nonpublic, through one-time emergency aid. These funds will \nbe used to help defray the additional costs incurred as a result of \nenrolling displaced students and provide assistance to schools in a \nnonideological and responsible way.\n\n  Quarterly payments are made based on the head count of the displaced \nstudents temporarily enrolled in schools. The total for these four \npayments is $6,000--$7,500 for students with disabilities--per \ndisplaced student or the cost of tuition, fees, and transportation for \nnonpublic students, whichever is less.\n  Parents of displaced students verify that they have made the choice \nfor their child to attend a nonpublic school, and the nonpublic school \nmust attest to the use of funds and the numbers of displaced students \nin attendance.\n  The assistance provided through this amendment is temporary--it \nsunsets at the end of this school year. This amendment is necessary \nbecause of the extraordinary circumstances and the emergency nature of \nthis situation.\n  Our efforts must be focused on ensuring that the educational needs of \nthe children affected by this unprecedented emergency are addressed, \nand I believe that this amendment achieves that goal. I am sure that \nsome of you have heard from school groups opposing this amendment. I am \nsurprised that groups representing the very schools and students that \nhave been most impacted by this disaster are now opposing efforts to \nprovide relief to their students, teachers, and administrators. It is \nimportant that we provide this much-needed relief to those who are \nworking to make sure our displaced students don't suffer even more than \nthey already have by this extraordinary disaster.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Education savings \nshould go to students. An investment in our students is an investment \nin our future.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we have now completed, for all intents and \npurposes, all of the debate on the deficit reduction bill, 20 hours. \nThat will be effective as of 6 o'clock.\n  I would note once again, as the Senator from North Dakota has noted \nand I have noted, tomorrow we begin a fairly complex and lengthy \nprocess of voting on the amendments that have been\n\n[[Page S12219]]\n\noffered. There are 16 or so amendments already pending, which \nrepresents many hours of voting, and there may be additional amendments \noffered. Obviously, we hope they will be limited because there is a \ndesire, I believe, by most people to complete this bill tomorrow. But \nif we do not finish all the voting by 6 o'clock, then we will move the \nevents over until Friday because this bill will be completed under \neither scenario.\n  At this time I want to thank again the Senator from North Dakota and \nthe staff for their courtesy, their professionalism, their effort to \nmove this bill along in a very constructive way as we moved through the \ndebate process. I also especially wish to thank my staff, which has \ndone a great job of getting us to this point. Tomorrow is going to be a \nfairly intense period for these folks and we appreciate them in \nanticipation of all the work they are going to have to do.\n  Mr. President, I will yield back the remainder of the time on this \namendment and ask unanimous consent that for the purposes of this bill, \nall time be deemed to have expired relative to debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand the next item of business will \nbe the Agriculture appropriations conference report.\n  I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/02/senate-section/article/S12219-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12219-S12220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is my understanding that for the remainder of the day, \nwe have completed work on budget reconciliation and we are about to \nmove to the Agriculture appropriations conference. I understand \nChairman Bennett is on his way to the floor, and as soon as he gets \nhere I will yield, but I thought for the few moments that remain prior \nto that, I would discuss that very important appropriations conference \nwe will soon be discussing.\n  The reason I want to do that is because I made an effort during the \nappropriations conference to deal with what I believe is a major issue \nthreatening American agriculture today that the Congress has largely \nignored at this moment, and the courts are now working their will and \nthe trial bar is working its will at the moment to try to change the \nintent of law.\n  The agricultural industry is, I think, very concerned about \nlitigation actions being taken to apply the Superfund law, referred to \nas CERCLA, and its counterpart, the Community Right to Know Act, better \nknown as EPCRA, to emissions or discharges primarily from livestock and \npoultry waste produced during the normal course of farming operations.\n  Someone would say, You mean a dairy farm or a poultry operation ought \nto be plunged into Superfund? Well, that is exactly what is being \nattempted at this moment and, of course, we would say no. The reason we \nsay no is because when those laws were created by Congress, agriculture \nwas clearly exempt. It was intended to be and it was exempt at that \ntime. If you were to put agriculture into the CERCLA/EPCRA issue, \naccording to EPA's own description, then you have changed the whole \ndynamics.\n  According to the EPA's own description, the Superfund law is ``the \nFederal Government's program to clean up the nation's uncontrolled \nhazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund program, abandoned, \naccidentally spilled, or illegally dumped hazardous wastes that pose a \ncurrent or future threat to human health or the environment are cleaned \nup.''\n  That is the responsibility of EPA under that issue. Are dairies and \nfeedlots uncontrolled and abandoned hazardous waste sites? That is what \nwe are talking about at this moment.\n  EPA goes on to say that ``the Superfund law created a tax on the \nchemical and petroleum industries and allowed the Federal Government to \nrespond to releases or potential releases of hazardous wastes that \nmight harm people or the environment. The tax went to a trust fund for \ncleaning up abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste sites.''\n  The question is, if we allow the courts and the legal process to \ndrive those in agriculture into EPCRA and into CERCLA--again the \nSuperfund law and the Community Right to Know law--is Congress then \nready to appropriate moneys for other concentrated herd releases that \nmight result? Should dairies, poultry farms, farmer-owned cooperatives, \nand others be required to pay into Superfund as the nuclear \nlaboratories and the petroleum industry do?\n  That was never the intent of Congress, and in trying to speak to that \nissue, Congress has to date been silent because environmental groups \nhave moved in and are standing at the doors of some of my colleagues, \nwringing their hands and saying oh, no, no, communities have the right \nto know and it ought to be included in all of this, even though the law \nsays not.\n  Now, that is not to say that these agricultural entities of the day \nare not responsible for clean air and clean water. They are under the \nClean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. They work with EPA in those \nstandards. They work with their State environmental councils and \nenvironmental departments to meet those kinds of standards.\n  What we are talking about is a legal issue attempting to shift, if \nyou will, these responsibilities away from the intent of the law, as \nspoken to so very clearly by this Congress in the creation of those two \nentities, EPCRA and CERCLA.\n  Another provision of the Superfund law allows EPA to fine violators \nup to $27,500 per day. Does that sound like a sum tailored to fit a \nfarmer? Environmental groups would have you think that, well, you know, \nthis is only for the big boys, the big operators. But then they do not \ndefine big. They say, well, large concentrated herd areas. It is the \nsmall versus large issue. Once it is well established that large \noperators in American agriculture are required to comply under these \nacts and meet the standards of the acts, any of us who have ever \nwatched the progress or the evolution or the migration of law through \nthe courts over time know it is only a moment in time before the small \noperator is included.\n\n  I made an effort during Agriculture appropriations and Agriculture \nappropriations conferences to clarify this issue and to say once again \nvery clearly to the American public the intent of the laws of Superfund \nand Community Right to Know, and those intents were very clear--not to \ninclude American agriculture. It isn't the big versus small issue at \nall. It is where do you rest the responsibility on the issue. It is not \nto say that American agriculture doesn't have a responsibility. Of \ncourse, they do. And they are fulfilling that responsibility under \nState law, under county zoning, under EPA, under the Clean Water Act \nand the Clean Air Act. These are issues that I hope this Congress will \nsoon address.\n  As to my amendment that I attempted, that the Republicans in the \nSenate did support in the conference, the conference collapsed itself \nso that it would not have to deal with this ``thorny issue'' of the \nmoment; it walked away from the National Association of State \nDepartments of Agriculture that supported our effort and the Southern \nAssociation of State Departments of Agriculture because at the State \nlevel, State Departments of Agriculture get it, they understand it, and \nthey know this has to be clarified. We cannot let the trial bar, if you \nwill, and communities of interest try to rewrite public policy through \nthe court process. That is exactly what is going on today. Several \nlawsuits have been filed in this effort.\n  I am certainly going to be back, as I know many of my colleagues \nwill, in attempting to deal with this very important issue. I do \nrespect what Chairman Bennett had to do to move the Agriculture \nappropriations conference forward. I had hoped we could get the CERCLA \nand EPCRA amendment into the conference, but it is not here. The \nconference is silent to it. The conference did good work. I am pleased \nto see that we could get as far as we could get in a variety of issues.\n  The chairman and the ranking member are now in the Chamber. They had\n\n[[Page S12220]]\n\na tough road to meet budget reconciliation with what they were \nallocated. I know that was difficult, and I appreciate the work my \nstaff was able to do with the chairman and the ranking member's staffs \nto get where we got with what we have today. I wish we had my \namendment. I don't want those who say they stand for agriculture \nwalking away from this issue and allowing the courts to rewrite public \npolicy. If we are responsible practitioners of public policy--and that \nis what we are--then this is an issue we well ought to take on. Every \nState in the Nation has this problem today, and we ought not let the \nbar, the courts, and a few interested parties rewrite our laws.\n  I hope we can address this again at another time.\n  I do appreciate the work that was done. There were a lot of issues \nleft on the table in this conference I hoped we could have addressed, \nthat we could then get to, certainly those which dealt with healthy \nforests, categoric exclusions, and other issues, but that is debate for \nanother day.\n  The chairman is in the Chamber. It is 6 o'clock. It is his time to \nbring forth the Agriculture appropriations conference report. I thought \nI would use some of the limited time we have to debate this important \nappropriations conference report.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/02/senate-section/article/S12220-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12220-S12228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   APPROPRIATIONS FOR AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG \n    ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING \n                 SEPTEMBER 30, 2006--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the conference report to accompany the Agriculture \nappropriations bill; provided further that following the completion of \nthat debate it be laid aside, that the vote occur on adoption of the \nconference report tomorrow morning immediately following the remarks of \nthe two leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, it is my understanding we now have 2 \nhours equally divided to discuss the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Once the clerk reports the conference report \nby title, that is correct.\n  The clerk will now report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2744) making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural \n     Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and \n     for other purposes, having met, have agreed that the House \n     recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate \n     and agree to the same with an amendment and the Senate agree \n     to the same, signed by a majority of conferees on the part of \n     both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record of October 26, 2005.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks, the following Senators on our side be allowed \nto speak on the conference report: Senator Burns for up to 15 minutes; \nSenators Enzi, Craig, and Thomas for up to 10 minutes each; Senator \nThune for up to 7 minutes; and Senator Cornyn for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I assume the request means \nwe will go back and forth in rotation across the aisle.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, that is my understanding. This is the \nreservation of time on my side so that Senators will know the time is \nreserved for them, and if one Senator might otherwise be tempted to run \non, the order can be called so that every Senator will have his right \nfor speaking reserved. It does anticipate time will go back and forth \nbetween the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 2744, which provides funds for the \nDepartment of Agriculture, Food and Drug Administration, and the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission for fiscal year 2006.\n  I will mention a few highlights of the bill to demonstrate why it \nbenefits not just farmers and ranchers but every constituent of the \nMembers of the Senate.\n  On nutrition, this bill provides for more than $12.6 billion in child \nnutrition programs, $5.2 billion for the Women, Infants and Children \nnutrition program, and nearly $108.3 million for the Commodity \nSupplemental Food Program.\n  I know particularly in response to Katrina that there has been great \nconcern about WIC in the country as a whole. This bill funds WIC.\n  For the farmers, ranchers, and conservation, there is more than $2 \nbillion in farm ownership and operating loans, $840 million for \nconservation operations, and more than $1 billion total for all USDA \nconservation programs.\n  For those of us who are concerned about research, there is more than \n$2.5 billion for research on nutrition, crop and animal production, \nbioenergy, genetics, and food safety.\n  There is funding for cooperative research with agriculture and \nforestry schools in every State and with Native Americans, Hispanic, \nand historically Black centers of learning, and extension programs that \nteach nutrition in low-income communities.\n  In pest and disease control, there is more than $820 million to \nprotect American agriculture, forests, and horticulture from plant and \nanimal diseases.\n  For those interested in rural development, the bill provides for \nnearly $5 billion in single and multifamily housing in rural areas, and \nmore than $6 billion in electric and telecommunications loans.\n  Turning to the Food and Drug Administration, there is a $62 million \nincrease over fiscal year 2005, with key increases of $10 million for \ndrug safety, $7.8 million for medical device review, and $10 million \nfor food safety. Overall, however, the spending level remains \nconsistent with the previous year and does not represent for the entire \nbill a major spending increase.\n  I ask for the support of all Senators for this conference report.\n  I reserve whatever time may be left after the Senators have exercised \ntheir rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nappropriations conference report for Agriculture, Rural Development, \nFDA, and related agencies.\n  Our conference allocation of just over $17 billion was a $258 million \nreduction from the Senate-passed level, but I think we did a good job \npreserving the Senate priorities. This bill contains funding vital for \nresearch, conservation, nutrition programs, rural development, and the \nFood and Drug Administration. Some of the bill's highlights include the \nfollowing:\n  For research programs, including the Agricultural Research Service \nand the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, \nthe bill provides an increase of nearly $66 million to support work on \nsolutions to many problems faced by farmers--including research \nprograms for BSE or mad cow disease, Johne's Disease, soybean rust, and \ncountless other programs.\n  The conservation title of this bill contains funding for important \nwatershed improvements, including soil and water erosion control, flood \ncontrol, and watershed dam rehabilitation. The Natural Resources \nConservation Service received an increase in this conference report of \nmore than $12 million over last year.\n  Nutrition programs also received increases over last year in this \nconference report. Child nutrition programs receive $12.6 billion, an \nincrease of more than $870 million to provide school lunches to low-\nincome kids. The WIC program received $5.257 million, an increase of \nnearly $22 million, and language proposed by the administration to \nrestrict eligibility and cap administrative funds was not included.\n\n[[Page S12221]]\n\nThe Food Stamp Program received an increase of more than $5.5 billion, \nand the Commodity Supplemental Food Program received an increase over \nlast year as well.\n  In the rural development title, more than $700 million is provided \nfor the Rural Community Advancement Program. The Rural Housing Service \nreceived an increase of $105 million above last year's level, bringing \nthe total loan authorization level of more than $5 billion to provide \nhousing to low-income rural Americans.\n  The Food and Drug Administration received nearly $1.5 billion this \nbill, an increase of nearly $40 million over last year's level. This \nincludes increases for medical device review, drug safety, food defense \nand BSE.\n  The bill Senators have before them is a product of multiple hearings, \nregular proceedings in both the House and Senate, nearly a 3-hour \nconference meeting, and countless staff hours. While this may seem \nunremarkable, it is, in fact, the first time since the fiscal year 2002 \nbill that the Agriculture appropriations bill has come through this \nprocess in the regular order.\n  At the end of the day, while not perfect, I believe we have produced \na good bill, one that comes as a result of much hard work and \ncompromise on all sides.\n  I thank Senator Bennett and his staff--John Ziolkowski, Fitz Elder, \nHunter Moorhead, Dianne Preece, and Stacey McBride--for once again \nworking with my staff as closely as they did.\n  On my side, I thank Galen Fountain, Jessica Arden, Bill Simpson, and \nTom Gonzales worked very hard as well. Together both sides made every \neffort to protect Democratic priorities, as well as Republican \npriorities, for the good of everyone. I believe the strong bipartisan \nrelationship we have on this subcommittee has resulted in a bill for \nwhich all Senators should be proud to vote.\n  I urge Senators to do just that and vote in favor of adopting this \nconference report.\n  Before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent that time be \nallotted for the following Senators to speak on this conference report \non the Democratic side: 5 minutes for Senator Murray, 10 minutes for \nSenator Dorgan, and 15 minutes for Senator Harkin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue that did not \nsurvive the conference, and I am hopeful we can replace it. I am \ntalking about the country-of-origin labeling. As we know, a couple of \nyears ago we put that provision in our Agriculture bill. I was one of \nthe original sponsors of the country-of-origin labeling. It is \nreasonable and something we ought to do.\n  In the meantime, we seem to have delayed it, we seem to have set it \nback. That is what has happened again in this bill. It seems to me we \nought to move back to the original purpose and get it back in place.\n  It is very important that we deal with this issue as we look forward \nto the trade meetings. We are shortly going to be going to Doha and we \nhave gone to Hong Kong. This is one of the issues being talked about in \nagriculture and agricultural trade and, quite frankly, the nature of \ntrade in this world is such that we are going to see more and more \ntrade of agricultural products. As that happens, it is legitimate for \nthe consumers in this country to say: I want a product that was made in \nthe United States and to be able to know that.\n  We do this on lots of products. We do it now on fish and shellfish, \nand it appears to be working. We ought to do it as well on livestock. \nThere is a variety of products that have come in. We will see more and \nmore of it around the world as time goes on.\n  We are very proud of our livestock program in the United States, \ncertainly the healthy part of it, the acceptable part of it for \nmarkets. I think we are going to see more of a tendency toward \nmarketing these products because of the health issues, so there is no \nreason why they cannot be marked as well for their country of origin. \nIt is important we do that, that we get away from this idea of simply \nprolonging it and setting it off, and that we come to grips with \nletting the bill that has already been passed and accepted come into \nplace.\n  This business of delaying does not seem to be right. It was supposed \nto have been implemented in 2004, and it was designed to do that. It \nwas delayed for 2 years, until 2006. The appropriations bill before us \ndelays it again until 2008.\n  There are two points I wish to make. One, it is a valid concern and \nsomething we should be doing. It is good for the market, it is good for \nagriculture, it is certainly good for consumers, it helps us be \nstronger in the international trade situation, and it is something we \nought to do.\n  Furthermore, it is not proper to be simply setting it back, to have \nit as an amendment on these bills and move it back another couple of \nyears.\n  The last time the Senate voted on COOL was in November of 2003. The \nvote was 58 to 36 in support of mandatory COOL.\n  This has been very disappointing. I happen to know there are other \nSenators in the Chamber who would like to talk about this topic, so I \nwill not take any longer.\n  I close by saying we need to take a look at the future of \nagriculture, we need to take a look at the future of world trade, and \nwe need to take a look at the opportunity for consumers in this country \nto choose where their products come from.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to talk about an \nissue that affects Americans all across the country, and that is the \ncredibility of the FDA.\n  I thank Senator Bennett and Senator Enzi, who are both here, for \ntheir work in a bipartisan fashion on the language that was put into \nthe Agriculture appropriations bill. I also thank Senator Kohl for his \nhelp.\n  Every time I come to the floor to talk about the FDA and plan B, I \nhope it will be the last time. I continue to hope that the FDA and HHS \nwill do the right thing and put science, safety, and efficacy over \npolitics. Unfortunately, over the past couple of years, I, along with \nmillions of Americans, have been disappointed time and time again.\n  I have always supported a strong and independent Food and Drug \nAdministration. It is the only way in which the FDA can truly operate \neffectively and with the confidence of American consumers and health \ncare providers. Americans have to have faith that when they walk into \ntheir pharmacy or their local grocery store that the products they \npurchase are safe and effective and that their approval has been based \non sound science, not on political pressure, not on pandering to \ninterest groups.\n  That is why the application process for plan B emergency \ncontraceptives has been so troubling to me.\n  Back in December 2003, 2 years ago, the FDA's own scientific advisory \nboard overwhelmingly recommended approval of plan B over-the-counter \napplication by a vote of 23 to 4. But the FDA has not adhered to its \nguidelines for drug approval and continues to drag its heels.\n  In fact, Alastair Wood, who is a member of that advisory panel, said:\n\n       What's disturbing is that the science was overwhelming \n     here, and the FDA is supposed to make decisions based on \n     science.\n\n  It is obvious to me--to many of my colleagues--and to millions of \nAmerican women that something other than science is going on now at the \nFDA, and it is far past time to get to the bottom of it.\n  That is why I am especially pleased that I have been able to secure \nbipartisan language in the Agriculture appropriations conference report \nthat expresses the sense of both bodies of Congress that enough is \nenough.\n  The language simply says:\n\n       The conferees remain concerned about the legal and \n     regulatory issues relating to approval of drugs as both \n     prescription drugs and over the counter products, and urge \n     the FDA to expedite rulemaking on this topic.\n\n  If the leaders of FDA and HHS refuse to take the steps to restore the \nconfidence of the American consumers and FDA's ability to promote safe \ntreatments, then Congress has to step in. The health and well-being of \nthe American people should not blow with the political winds. Caring \nfor our people is an American issue, and part of that goal is ensuring \nwe have access to safe, effective medicines in a timely fashion.\n\n[[Page S12222]]\n\n  How can we trust the FDA to move quickly on vaccines for global \npandemics if they continue to operate the way they have on plan B?\n  Time and time again, I, along with Senator Clinton of New York and \nothers, have asked simply for a decision on plan B. We have not asked \nfor a yes or a no, just a decision. This continued foot-dragging is \nunusual, it is unwarranted, and it is unprofessional. This continued \ndelay goes against everything the FDA's own advisory panel found nearly \n2 years ago: that plan B is safe, effective, and should be available \nover the counter. There is no credible scientific reason to continue to \ndeny increased access to this safe health care option, but there is \neven less reason to deny an answer.\n  Yesterday marked another deadline in the approval process for plan B. \nYesterday was the last day of the highly unusual 60-day comment period \nthat was asked for by FDA. Senator Clinton and I joined with nearly \n10,000 Americans in calling on the FDA to take a real step toward \nclosing the agency's credibility gap by making a prompt decision based \non scientific evidence.\n  I am on the floor tonight to say I hope the FDA does just that. The \nlanguage we secured in this conference report is a good step, but it is \nnot the last word on this issue. The problem with politics subverting \nthe FDA's adherence to science and its integrity is so profound and so \nurgent that I intend to use every tool available to me as a Senator to \nmake sure this discussion about our priorities and our future is not \nlost.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I will assume I was next in the queue. I thank the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture for bringing this \nconference report up. You know, I just want to point out to the \nAmerican people that even though the total of this bill is $100 \nbillion--That's--I rounded that off a little bit--only $25 billion gets \nto production agriculture. We could add in some conservation programs \nand watershed and this type of thing and probably get that up a little \nhigher but not a lot.\n  What I am trying to say, better than half of this bill does not go to \nthe farm and ranch producing community in this country, and yet the \nbill is $100 billion.\n  I have been on the Appropriations Committee since 1993. For 12 years, \nI have served with my colleagues in this body and have gone through a \nlot of conferences. I have chaired some. I have been ranking in some. \nThere are a lot of good things in this bill that help my State of \nMontana and agriculture across this Nation, but if there is one \nshortcoming--I say, not very much of it gets to the farmers and \nranchers out of this $100 billion. I was a county commissioner. I \nunderstand WIC. I understand nutrition programs. I understand food \nstamps for those folks who really need help. I'll tell you what, it is \nborn in every one of us who comes out of the farm and ranch community: \nwe do not like to see people hungry. We have always been like that.\n  With regard to this conference, we had four or five items that were \nvery important that we have to address in this body, and we were closed \ndown. Categorical exemptions, which my friend from Idaho just spoke on \na few minutes ago, in forest rehabilitation, forest legacy, forest \nhealth--all of those programs are designed to help our timber \ncommunities take advantage of the great resource that is around them, \nand also it does a lot for fire prevention.\n  Another thing about this amendment we had on the prevention of the \nslaughter of horses for human consumption, we did not get that \nresolved. I invite any of my friends who voted for that amendment to \ncome to my office and answer the phones because I'll tell you what, \nlast Saturday there was a horse sale in Billings. If anything prompts \nsome calls, just let somebody go to the next horse sale.\n  Then we got down to the country of origin labeling that was put into \nlaw and signed by the President of the United States in the 2002 farm \nbill. It is the law of the land, and an overwhelming majority of both \nthis body and the House of Representatives voted to put it there. Yet \nwe are denied the money to write the rules and regulations and \nimplement the law and put it into effect.\n  This year, they just said: We are going to go voluntary for 2 more \nyears. I am going to tell you something, that has not worked. Now, \nthere is nothing done here that is done in the dark of night. It is the \nlaw. Did we accomplish getting it implemented in this bill? No, we are \ndelayed for two more years.\n  What is even worse, there was no debate and no vote in the conference \ncommittee while the conference was going on. Just like I said, I have \nchaired conference committees on appropriations, and we did not leave \nthat room until all of the issues that were still on the table were \ndealt with, folks got to debate them, we listened to them, and we got \nan up-or-down vote.\n  I am not really concerned about the results of a vote; I am concerned \nabout a vote. So this was something that was done that absolutely was \nbeyond my belief.\n  We know that our cattle producers are pretty proud of their product. \nThey produce a good product. We do not feed a lot of cattle in Montana, \nbut we raise a lot of feeder cattle. They go to Colorado, Kansas, and \nNebraska to be finished out. They produce a great product for America's \ndinner tables, the greatest source of protein we have in our diet. They \nalso want to know where it comes from, and that is being denied our \nproducers today.\n  I heard from my colleagues who say they should delay COOL until the \nfarm bill. They say the law will not work and we need to rewrite it. I \nagree with some of that, but there are provisions right now that are in \nthe current labeling law that need to be implemented.\n  So I seriously doubt that any of my cattle producers can be convinced \nat this point that Congress intends to make a good-faith effort to \nimprove the law as it stands today. We have had three years to work on \nthat law, and the only thing Congress has delivered to the hard-working \nranchers in my country is one delay after another, and that is \nunacceptable.\n  We have given the meat packers years to volunteer and voluntarily \nlabel the meat. Not one packer has done that. Now, we have labeling on \nthat. We have certified Angus beef, and we have a lot of house brands \nand house labels and some breeds of cattle promote their production, \nbut nothing says ``USA.'' These delays are not designed to help us \nimprove this important law; they are just a way that the packers get \ntheir way.\n  In all likelihood, this evening the Senate will debate this issue, \nand tomorrow we will pass this conference report. I did not sign the \nreport, and I shall vote against it tomorrow even though there are some \nvery good things in here, but enough is enough.\n  Given the hysteria of the meat packers, one would think that COOL \nassistance would destroy the whole industry, and one would think origin \nlabeling is some outlandish, unheard of concept when it has been around \nfor the last four years. Packers whine about labeling products in the \nUnited States, and the packers are engaged in country-of-origin \nlabeling in foreign markets. I do not see what the difference is? It \nfeels to me like you have been discriminated against for your product? \nAnd those who do not want labeling, are you not proud of your product? \nAre you afraid to put your brand on it? Afraid to put a label on it? \nWhat is the problem?\n  Most of our major trading partners require country-of-origin labeling \non imported beef and beef products. I could go all night about the \nsituation in which we find ourselves in regarding to beef trade with \nJapan. We took a pretty tough stand. I believe that it is time that \nmarkets be opened.\n  New Zealand passed a COOL law just last week at the very same time \nthat this conference was shirking its duty to the American cattle \nproducers.\n  By the way, New Zealand is not afraid to put a label on their lamb. \nOne can go to any grocery store, and the package says, ``New Zealand \nlamb.'' They are proud of that product. Yet we do not want to do that. \nConsumers in the United States do not deserve to know where their beef \ncomes from, but foreign consumers do. That is the message we are \nsending on this conference report tonight.\n  We know that foreign consumers demand U.S. beef. It is pretty plain. \nI have talked to the consumers in Japan. They are getting ready to \nserve these beef bowls. It is the most desired product we ship there. \nYet by their standards, they have decided to keep\n\n[[Page S12223]]\n\nour product off of their market. They have nerve enough to come here \nand expect us to accept theirs when they have a larger problem than we \ndo in that arena. So Congress is telling the producers that they lose \nout again in this conference report with a delay provision put in at \nconference with no debate and no vote.\n  I will cast a vote against the conference report when it comes up \ntomorrow. This is a terrible way to do business in the Senate. We can \ndo better in this body. We can respect everyone's opinion and \neverybody's amendment and everybody's bill, but give them a vote.\n\n  We are going to talk about a judge one of these days, and we are \ngoing to say he deserves an up-or-down vote. This issue does, too. \nThere is no difference. And we were denied it.\n  So I am disappointed, but yet we move along and there will be another \nday when again we will saddle up and try to get this legislation \nimplemented, which basically is the law of the land. Make no mistake \nabout it, this hurts our credibility. We better start taking our job \nvery seriously. Instead, we are taking ourselves too seriously.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I believe I am yielded 10 minutes per the instructions of \nthe Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first I will say a word about the \nleadership of this subcommittee, Senator Bennett from Utah and my \ncolleague, Senator Kohl, from the State of Wisconsin. I appreciate the \nwork they have done. This is not easy to do. The product that came out \nof the Senate was a good subcommittee bill. To the chairman, the \nranking member, and their staffs, I thank them for all of the work they \nhave done on this legislation.\n  As they might know, while they are complimented, there is something \nthat comes behind the compliment. They both know that I did not sign \nthe conference report, having nothing to do with their actions or their \nactivities. I refused to sign the conference report because of what \nhappened in the conference. I wish to describe just a little of that.\n  The process by which we went to conference with the U.S. House was \none in which we expected we would be treated with some respect and we \nwould, through the normal course of things, make judgments and \ndecisions and have votes. That did not happen. It did not happen on the \nissue especially of the country-of-origin labeling for meat--something \nmy colleague just described. This is a commonsense, farmer-friendly, \nrancher-friendly law that has always been opposed by the big meat-\npacking plants and those who do their bidding. The fact is, it is the \nlaw of the land and should have been implemented last year.\n  One day, I brought a porterhouse steak to the floor of the Senate. I \nhad to ask consent to show it on the Senate floor. I held up a \nporterhouse steak and I said: I would like to know if anybody can tell \nme where this piece of meat came from. Anybody? Well, nobody could tell \nwhere the piece of meat came from. It is just a piece of raw meat in \ncellophane. It comes from the store.\n  I asked the question: Might it have come from this particular packing \nplant? This packing plant, by the way, was only inspected once by a \nUSDA inspector. It happens to be in Mexico. Here is what he said he \nfound. This is a packing plant sending meat to our country. The \ninspector found:\n\n       Shanks and briskets were contaminated with feces, a U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture official later wrote of his tour of \n     the plant on the floor. In the refrigerator, he wrote, a \n     diseased, condemned carcass was observed ready for boning and \n     distribution in commerce.\n       The audit noted paint and viscera containers, condensation \n     from dirty surfaces dripping into the exposed product . . .\n\n  Did anyone know if that piece of meat came from that plant? No one \ncould tell because it was not labeled.\n  I thought then about something I read when I was in school. Upton \nSinclair wrote the book ``The Jungle'' in 1906. He described the \nconditions in the packing plants of Chicago. He said:\n\n       There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the \n     water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of \n     rats would race about on it.\n\n  Then he described how they would lace loaves of bread with poison and \nlay them around, and the rats would eat the poison and die, and they \nwould shove it down a hole and grind it up and ship it out as meat.\n  People read ``The Jungle'' written by Upton Sinclair and demanded \nsomething be done in this country, and it was. We have a wholesome \nsupply of meat in this country that we are proud of. Our farmers and \nranchers who produce it have a wholesome supply that is inspected. We \nare proud of it.\n  ``The Jungle,'' 1906--I just read what he said in the book. May 1999, \none inspector goes to Mexico--by the way, he has never gone back. This \nplant was closed, opened immediately thereafter with new owners and a \nnew company name, and has never been inspected since. Condensation from \ndirty surfaces dripping into the exposed product . . . Carcass shanks \nand briskets [were] contaminated with feces. . . .\n\n  Does it sound like 1906? Sound like ``The Jungle''? Or if you are \nreading ``The Jungle,'' 1906, by Upton Sinclair:\n\n       There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in \n     the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit \n     uncounted billions of . . . germs.\n       The employees' feet touched carcasses . . . a diseased \n     condemned carcass . . . was observed in the chilling room \n     ready for boning and distribution in commerce.\n\n  How much progress have we made?\n  So we go to conference and there is a requirement there be meat \nlabeling, and the big packing houses and those that do their bidding in \nthis Congress say it would be way too complicated.\n  We can drive a remote car on the surface of the planet Mars, and we \ncan't stick a label on a piece of meat, for god's sake? We did require \nthat of seafood. Go to the local grocery store and buy some seafood and \nyou will find a label.\n  Let me tell you what the manager of the meat department at a \nsupermarket had to say about implementing labeling for seafood. On \nApril 4, 2005, asked about labeling seafood, this fellow at a \nsupermarket said, ``It's just a matter of putting a sticker on the \npackage.''\n  Not a problem. So why, then, are the American consumers now told, as \na result of this conference, that not only are you not going to get \ncountry-of-origin labeling last year when you were supposed to have had \nit--and then we extended it, the folks over there on the House side \nextended it--so now they extended it 2 more years. And they did that \nafter they recessed the conference and extended the date for \nimplementation of this law--and it is a law--by 2 years, never having a \nvote, never notifying anybody.\n  I would expect the chairman and ranking member of this subcommittee \nshould be furious about that. They probably are. I wrote, by the way, \nthe chairman of the conference and said to the chairman of the \nconference: That will only happen once because you will not have a \nsecond conference in which we sit around and somewhere between the \nissue of thumb-sucking and daydreaming, believe there is a crevice to \ndo the right thing.\n  If you decide you are not going to allow votes and then get rid of \nthe conference and go behind a closed door with one party from one side \nof the Capitol and decide you are going to change the law and shove it \ndown everybody's throat, you are only going to get to do that once. The \nnext time you go to a conference like that, it is going to be a much \ndifferent circumstance because we now know how at least some are \nwilling to treat others in the conference.\n  It wasn't so much about treating us, it was about how you are \ntreating farmers and ranchers who are proud of what they produce, and \nit is about how you are treating consumers in this country. Oh, in this \nCongress, regrettably, the big interests still have a lot of sway, a \nlot of influence. They somehow at the end of the day get their way. \nThey especially get their way when the door is closed, when the lights \nare out; the door is closed, and it is done in secret. And that is \nexactly what happened here. People should be furious about what has \nbeen shoved down the throats of the Congress as a result of a few \npeople in that conference.\n  So the result will be bad public policy. The result will be consumers \nconsuming food, consuming meat that they do not know the origin of. \nWhy? Because the Congress said: You don't\n\n[[Page S12224]]\n\ndeserve to know the origin of that meat.\n  There is much to say about this subject. My colleague from Montana \ndescribed his disgust. My colleague from Iowa will as well. I probably \nshould, in the middle of this angst, say again that this is not the \nfault of the Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett. It is not the fault of the \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl. They did not do this.\n  My guess is--I have not talked to them at great length--they would \nhave provided a conference that is the regular order: have debate and \nhave a vote, have a debate and have a vote, and you count the votes \nand, in this system of ours, determine who has the votes and what \npolicies prevail.\n  That is not what happened with respect to this conference with the \nHouse, and I regret that. We will have another opportunity. In the \nmeantime, the consumers lose, the ranchers lose, the farmers lose \nbecause those, whose names I don't have in this statement, behind \nclosed doors, in secret, decided to pull the rug out from under all of \nthose interests.\n  I assume they are applauded today by the big economic interests, as \nis always the case in this Congress. But one day soon, I think \nconsumers and others will say: There is no cause for applause for you. \nIn fact, you really should be doing something else.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I am going to keep the litany going on country-of-origin \nlabeling because I am upset, too. I want to speak in opposition to that \nspecific provision in the conference report, H.R. 2744, which is the \nAgriculture appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006.\n  The report before the Senate includes an additional 2-year delay--\nuntil September 30, 2008--for the implementation of mandatory country-\nof-origin labeling for covered commodities, except for fish. Fish was \ntaken care of earlier.\n  I am highly frustrated that implementation funding has been stripped \nbecause this is not the first time the conference committee has \ntraveled beyond the scope of its conference. The House bill stripped \nfunding for implementation of country-of-origin labeling for meat and \nmeat products for fiscal year 2006. The Senate bill did not include a \ndelay. However, the conference result is a new 2-year delay that will \nkeep consumers in the dark about the origin of their food.\n  Mandatory country-of-origin labeling was included in the 2002 farm \nbill, yet consumers and producers, except those that catch, raise, or \neat fish, will not see any benefit from country-of-origin labeling \nbefore the next farm bill is written. The opponents of labeling claim \nit will cost too much to implement. If we do not provide any funding \nfor implementation, they will be right because any cost would be too \nhigh. I have heard the concerns of those who have responsibilities \nunder the law, but those concerns can be addressed.\n  I wish to point out I asked how much country-of-origin labeling would \ncost and was told it would be $1.5 billion to keep track of the cows so \nwe would know where they came from. There are much simpler systems that \ncan be put in place. Canada keeps track of all of this now. But when we \nstarted having problems with other animals, I asked how much \nan identification system for all animals would cost, and was told that \nit would only cost half a billion. Tell me, how can you keep track of \nevery animal in the country for a third of what it costs just to keep \ntrack of cows? It is bad accounting, if you ask me. It is a plain, \nblatant statement they don't want to do country of origin. Why wouldn't \nthey want to? I guess to increase the sale of beef from other \ncountries.\n\n  As I discussed this matter with my colleagues, it has become clear \nthere is a need for education regarding country-of-origin labeling. \nMany of them were not here when the last farm bill debate was done. For \nthose who were, the issue of country-of-origin labeling may not be \nfamiliar because it was not debated on the Senate floor. Country-of-\norigin labeling was included in the bill by way of an Agriculture \nCommittee vote, and the final details of the law were worked out during \na conference with the House.\n  For those of my colleagues who were not personally familiar with the \ntopic, they should not excuse themselves from consideration of this \nimportant issue because their State doesn't have significant numbers of \nlivestock producers or farmers. I have livestock producers in my State, \nbut I care about country-of-origin labeling because I am a consumer of \nagricultural products. I am sure that all of us have a lot of consumers \nof agricultural products in our States, so it should be a concern of \nevery State. Everybody ought to be researching this. Everybody ought to \nbe concerned that we do not have labeling.\n  Country-of-origin labeling is relevant for agricultural producers, \nfor consumers, and even for the Members of the Senate. In fact, the \ncountry-of-origin labeling law is based on the Consumer Right To Know \nAct of 2001, which I cosponsored. The law requires the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture to put in place a system for U.S. retailers to inform \ntheir customers, when they buy beef, lamb, pork, or other perishable \nagricultural commodities, from what country the product originated.\n  Food labeling can help increase consumer confidence by assuring \nconsumers they are making informed and knowledgeable decisions about \nthe products they buy. People know that the United States has the best, \ncleanest, and safest system for processing beef. Consumers should know \nif the meat they are bringing home to feed their family has been \nproduced here or if it was imported from a country that may have fewer \nenvironmental, health, or safety regulations on livestock production.\n  The country-of-origin labeling law is not a new concept in the world. \nMost U.S. trade partners, including the EU, require country-of-origin \nlabeling for food. Many of the laws in other nations are more rigorous \nthan the U.S. law. Virtually every other item a consumer buys in the \nUnited States indicates a country of origin.\n  I understand that some people say we do not need to have country-of-\norigin labeling when the USDA is already moving forward on a national \nanimal identification program. I have mentioned that I am fascinated by \nits cost. This is simply not the case. A national ID program will be \nuseful for health safety reasons. It will help pinpoint and track the \nspread of disease, but this information will not be passed on to the \nconsumer. Tracking disease is not the only concern. Providing \ninformation to consumers should also be a priority, and the only \nconsumer-focused program is country-of-origin labeling. That is a \npriority for me.\n  After the first 2-year country-of-origin implementing delay was added \nduring an appropriations conference almost 2 years ago, I joined other \nSenators in cosponsoring legislation to move the implementation date \ncloser to the present. With this second 2-year delay, it is readily \napparent that opponents of country-of-origin labeling are using this \ndelay tactic to gut country-of-origin labeling. Rather than meeting us \nfor an open debate on the merits of the law, they continually put it \noff and allow it to work through the House process. By saying we need \nmore time to implement the law, they are making the law voluntary.\n  Time is one thing that the debate surrounding country of origin has \nhad. This issue was debated in the years before its inclusion in the \nfarm bill. Since the law was passed, 2 years were granted for \nrulemaking to ensure its thorough implementation. We have already had a \n2-year delay. Removing funding for implementation did not improve the \nprocess, it stopped the process cold. For those who have genuine \nconcerns regarding implementation of the country-of-origin labeling, \nthe answer is not to put off implementing the law but to implement it \nproperly.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues why mandatory country-of-origin \nlabeling passed in the farm bill. Consumers and producers want the \ninformation that it will provide. Consumers want to know.\n  Personally I am more of a food consumer than a food producer, but as \na shoe store owner, I could tell you where the shoes I sold were from. \nIt was required.\n  My dad used to travel on the road and sell some shoes. They were \nBall-Band rubber footwear. There was a little dispute that came up at \none point in time on that because they had to be labeled if they were \nmade in the United States, and other countries were not allowed to use \nthat label. But in Japan, they started another little town, and they \nnamed it Usa, U-S-A with no dots\n\n[[Page S12225]]\n\nafter the letters. Then they could say their boots were made in USA, \nwhich looked like U.S.A.\n  Other people are jealous of the labeling that we have. We require \nthat kind of labeling so our consumers know where their shoes or boots \nor shirts or hats--things that don't hurt them nearly as much as what \ngoes inside their body--are from. As a father, I could tell you where \nthe clothes I bought for my children were made. I have to say, I would \nrather have known more about what I was putting into my growing kids \nthan what I was putting on my growing kids.\n  It is really simple. Artists sign their work, authors pen their books \nwith pride, and American ranchers and farmers want to sign their work, \ntoo. They want consumers to know they are proud of what they have \nproduced. They are convinced the people of this country want U.S. beef, \nU.S. pork, and U.S. lamb.\n  Although I appreciate the work done by this conference on other \nimportant provisions for agriculture, and I appreciate the work they \ndid on some of the issues that have already been mentioned, because of \nthis critical issue to a huge industry in my State, I will be voting \nagainst final passage.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I hope not to use all time because others want to speak, \nalso.\n  I want to take a few minutes to lay out my reasons for my vote on \nthis conference report tomorrow.\n  First of all, there are many aspects of the bill that I do support \nand which I believe should become law. I believe Senator Bennett and \nSenator Kohl worked very hard to get this bill through.\n  I supported the bill as it was reported from committee and as it \npassed the Senate. I believe it was a good bill given the \nsubcommittee's allocation when it passed the Senate, and I said so on \nthe Senate floor. But, unfortunately, the conference process with the \nHouse was seriously flawed and resulted in a seriously flawed report as \na result.\n  In some instances, it is as if the House were negotiating with the \nadministration rather than allowing the Senate any meaningful role.\n  My greatest concern is the continued assault on the farm bill's \nmandatory conservation programs, particularly the Conservation Security \nProgram. As passed by the Senate, this bill included no annual cap on \nCSP spending. That is as it is in the 6-year farm bill which was passed \nin 2002 and signed by the President: no annual cap on CSP funds. So the \nCongressional Budget Office's baseline estimate for CSP spending in \nfiscal 2006 was $331 million based upon the program's mandatory funding \nand no set annual spending cap, as was passed in the farm bill.\n  While the other body included an extremely low cap of $245 million \nfor CSP in 2006, traditionally, we usually attempt to kind of split the \ndifference on matters such as this. But in this instance, rather than \nsplitting the difference between the House and Senate--the conferees \nevidently chose to split the difference between the President's budget \nproposal to cap CSP at $274 million and the $245 million cap in the \nHouse bill for a conference level of $259 million. That is far below \nthe $288 million that would have resulted from splitting the difference \nbetween the House and Senate figures.\n  In effect, the will of the Senate as expressed in the bill that we \npassed by a vote of 97 to 2 was totally thwarted.\n  Since the farm bill was enacted in 2002, the USDA conservation \nprograms have taken a real beating year after year. They have been used \nrepeatedly as a source offsets to fund other needs.\n  Including this conference report, the annual appropriations measures \nfrom fiscal year 2003 through fiscal year 2006 have cut $1.13 billion \nin mandatory funds that we dedicated to conservation in the farm bill.\n  In addition to that, last fall, a further $3 billion was taken out of \nthe Conservation Security Program to pay for disaster assistance. And \nin the Senate budget reconciliation measure now pending a further $1.78 \nbillion would be taken away from conservation over the next 10 fiscal \nyears--over $1.2 billion of that from the Conservation Security Program \nalone.\n  Again, here is a chart that illustrates what we are talking about.\n  If you look at Agriculture appropriations, those bills have cut, from \nfiscal year 2003 through 2006, $1.13 billion. Here on the chart is $3 \nbillion which was an offset taken out of the Conservation Security \nProgram to pay for disaster assistance.\n  Mind you, prior to the past few years, when we have had disasters in \nthis country that require extraordinary amounts of disaster assistance \nwe have paid for the assistance out of the general fund. When there is \na tornado, a hurricane, or a flood--whatever it might be--we don't rob \nprograms that are particularly important to one group of Americans in \norder to pay for the disaster assistance. We paid for the disaster \nassistance out of the general fund.\n  Yet when we had a drought disaster in this country that affected many \nStates in the West and Midwest, the money to pay for disaster \nassistance was taken from the Conservation Security Program to pay for \nit. That was strongly pushed by the administration and the House. Many \ntimes on the floor I said that was wrong. I objected to it. But that is \nwhat happened. They took the money out of agriculture conservation to \npay for disaster assistance. It was wrong then; it is wrong now to do \nthat.\n  Then on top of those cuts, in the Senate budget reconciliation \nmeasure, another $1.78 billion would be taken out of conservation.\n  So what we have here is cumulative, $5.9 billion taken out of \nconservation programs in measures before us just since fiscal year \n2003.\n  Again, I might add that conservation is part of the bill that was \nloudly praised by President Bush when he signed the farm bill. I was \nthere at the signing. The President said this is a great bill, \nespecially the conservation provisions. The Department of Agriculture \nput out publications on the farm bill highlighting conservation. Yet \nsince the farm bill as passed, in measures passed or now before the \nSenate $5.9 billion will be taken out of conservation programs.\n  Again, I want to emphasize this conservation funding taken away is \nmandatory spending in the farm bill as to which we met all of the \nbudget requirements when we passed the farm bill. We met all of the \nbudget requirements. It was within the budget allocation provided to us \nwhen we passed the farm bill.\n  In earlier debate today on the reconciliation bill, I heard a lot of \ntalk about the importance of not reopening the farm bill. That was the \ndebate on the amendment offered by Senator Grassley and Senator Dorgan \non payment limitations. I heard a lot of talk about not reopening the \nfarm bill. Sorry folks. The farm bill has already been reopened many \ntimes regarding on conservation, and other programs for that matter.\n  To complain about an amendment limiting payments to those getting \nhundreds of thousands of dollars annually from farm programs, to \ncomplain that this is reopening the farm bill is a bogus argument.\n  Where were their voices last year, the year before, and the year \nbefore when all of this money was being taken out of the farm bill, out \nof mandatory spending? Why didn't I hear their voices on the Senate \nfloor saying we can't reopen the farm bill? There was not a peep from \nthem.\n  But now when it is proposed to limit payments to the largest farmers \nin America to meet some of our budget reconciliation requirements, they \ndon't want to reopen the farm bill. We should never have reopened it to \ntake money out of it to pay for disasters.\n  I have a number of other concerns. I joined with those who are upset \nabout the country-of-origin labeling provision. During the debate on \nthe 2002 farm bill--I was chairman at the time--there was a bipartisan \neffort. We included country-of-origin labeling for meats, fruits, \nvegetables, peanuts, and fish. I supported it then, and I support it \nnow. It makes sense. Producers in our country ought to be able to add \nvalue by differentiating the origin of their products. Consumers ought \nto have the power of information of\n\n[[Page S12226]]\n\nchoice. Unfortunately, the will of producers and consumers has been \nignored, behind closed doors, without debate, without a hearing, \nwithout votes. Country-of-origin labeling for meats, fruits, \nvegetables, and peanuts has now been delayed until September 30, 2008, \nafter this farm bill expires.\n  They just want to kill country-of-origin labeling altogether, in the \nnext farm bill--and in the meantime by rewriting the farm bill in the \nappropriations process. It has gotten out of hand. It is making a \nmockery of the both the authorization and the appropriations process.\n  I happen to serve on both authorizing committees and the \nappropriations committee. They both have a legitimate role to play. To \nhave the authorization committee usurp the power of the appropriations \ncommittee is just as wrong as to have the appropriations committee \nundercut and make a mockery of the authorization process. But that is \nwhat the House did.\n  I don't mind losing if you have fair debate and if you have fair \nvotes. If you lose, you lose. To me, that is democracy. I don't mind \nthat. What I object to is when the House of Representatives, the \nchairman of the House subcommittee, bangs the gavel and says we will \nmeet subject to the call of the Chair, and we never meet. They go \nbehind closed doors and they do this. They take away country-of-origin \nlabeling, they put limits on conservation, and I don't even get a \nchance to vote on it. No one gets a chance to vote on it. They say, \ntake it or leave it. That is what I object to.\n  I am also concerned that the same back-door process I am describing \nwas used to amend the Organic Foods Production Act. Earlier this year, \nthe First Circuit Court of Appeals struck down three final rules for \nthe National Organic Program. I urged the organic community to come \ntogether and reach a consensus on what was needed to respond to the \ncourt decision. That didn't happen. Some people were left out of the \nprocess.\n  Last month, Senator Leahy offered an amendment to our Agriculture \nappropriations bill as a placeholder in the hope that the organic \ncommunity would have more time to discuss these proposed changes in the \nlaw, and reach a consensus which we could then put into the conference \nreport. Unfortunately, this conference report complicates what was \nalready a complicated and sticky issue.\n  Again, behind closed doors, without a single vote or debate, the \nOrganic Foods Production Act was amended at the behest of large food \nprocessors without the benefit of the organic community reaching a \ncompromise.\n  To rush provisions into the law that have not been properly vetted, \nthat fail to close loopholes, and that do not reflect a consensus \nundermines the integrity of the National Organic Program.\n  The Agriculture appropriations conference report also strikes a \nprovision adopted by the full Senate that would limit contracting out \nto private companies to carry out the Food Stamp Program.\n  Again, this amendment was adopted without objection by the full \nSenate. It was reaffirmed by Senate conferees. We did have a vote. The \nSenate conferees voted to uphold the Senate side. The issue went to the \nHouse conferees, and that was the end of it. Usually you work these \nthings out in conference. Again, the chairman gaveled the conference \nshut, went behind closed doors, and threw out the provision.\n  Here is the hypocrisy of that. In the Agriculture appropriations \nbill, there is a limit, a prohibition against any money being used to \ncontract out to private companies for the operation of the rural \ndevelopment programs or farm loan programs. So those programs can't be \nprivatized. But already the Department of Agriculture is approving \nprivate contracting for Federal food assistance applications.\n  Again, I guess the needs of the poor don't warrant the same kind of \nprotection other clients of USDA receive.\n  There are other problems with this bill. I am disappointed that the \nmeasure eliminates or reduces funding for a variety of programs in the \nfarm bill's rural development title. For example, there is a major \nreduction in the value added development grants.\n  Fortunately, the bill does call for revamping the rural broadband \nloan program. Clearly this is a technology that needs to be available. \nWe need to have rural broadband access for economic development.\n  I am thankful to the chairman and others for the inclusion of \nnumerous projects that help promote biofuels and bioproducts, which \nhave a lot of promise for this country. I also commend them for \nincluding funding for the national animal disease facilities at Ames, \nIA.\n  One last thing I would mention is that Congress provides money in \nthis bill for Public Law 480, the title II Food for Peace Program, the \nlargest foreign food aid program of the U.S. government. The funding in \nthis conference report is the same as last year, but that was not \nenough to meet both massive emergency food aid needs and to provide the \nneeded funding for development assistance. Quite frankly, I am \nconcerned that the administration in its budget proposal--which is the \nbasis for this appropriations measure is seriously shorting the \ndevelopment assistance projects under Food for Peace.\n  In many cases, investment in mitigating chronic food needs in \ndeveloping countries in 1 year may avert the need for much higher \nemergency food aid in later years.\n  For example, one of the countries where USAID development projects \nwere cut back earlier in 2005 was Niger, a country which by summer was \nexperiencing a serious shortage in food availability, which prompted a \nflash appeal for emergency assistance by the U.N.'s World Food Program \nin August.\n  On the other hand, I am pleased that funding for the McGovern-Dole \nFood for Education Program has been boosted to $100 million for fiscal \nyear 2006.\n  Again, there are good things in this bill. The bill is not totally \nbad. But I have a lot of objections to the process on which the House \nproceeded and the outcomes in the conference report that resulted from \nthe process. This is not the way to do things.\n  This sort of sort of one-sided process, behind-closed-doors process \nis a sharp break from the normal practice in appropriations conference \ndeliberations. It sets a terrible precedent.\n  For the reasons I have outlined, especially for all of the money \nbeing taken out of conservation, for the further delay of COOL, the \ncountry-of-origin labeling, and other problems I mentioned, it pains \nme, and I don't like to vote against the conference report. I have \ngreat respect for the chairman and the ranking member. As I said, they \ndid a good job. But what came back from the House is not good for our \nfarmers or rural communities, it is not good for consumers, and it is \nnot good for conservation.\n  For those reasons, I will sadly have to vote against this conference \nreport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, country-of-origin labeling has been an \nissue in the Senate for quite awhile, and yet, after all this time, \nwe're no closer to promoting U.S. products than we were a decade ago. \nIn reviewing the storied history of this issue, it is clear that there \nis no shortage of viewpoints. One view that has been overwhelmingly \nvocalized is that U.S. producers of beef and pork want to market and \npromote their products as born and raised in the United States of \nAmerica. They are proud of what they produce, and they should be: the \nU.S. produces the safest, most abundant food supply at the most \naffordable price, and our livestock producers want to capture the value \nthey add to the market.\n  But just like every other debate in Washington, the debate over \ncountry-of-origin labeling has been about the means to accomplish the \ngoal. It is not that we are fighting about whether or not promoting \nU.S. products is a good idea. We are fighting about how to do it. Some \nin the U.S. Senate, and some around the country have said: ``If it \nisn't mandatory, it's not labeling,'' or that the current mandatory \nlabeling law that passed in the 2002 Farm Bill is the only way labeling \nwill work. I strongly disagree.\n  The current mandatory law is an example of a good idea gone awry. The \nwarning signs of the negative impact of this law have long been on the \nhorizon. On a number of occasions the U.S. Department of Agriculture, \nthe Government Accountability Office, and the Office of Management and \nBudget have\n\n[[Page S12227]]\n\npublished reports and studies, and testified before Congress about the \nburdens of mandatory country-of-origin labeling.\n  In 1999, GAD testified before Congress that ``there is going to be \nsignificant costs associated with compliance and enforcement'' of \nmandatory labeling.\n  The next year, GAO released another study indicating that.\n\n       U.S. Packers, processors, and grocers would . . . pass \n     their compliance costs back to their suppliers . . . in the \n     form of lower prices or forward to consumers in the form of \n     higher retail prices. And when USDA issued its proposed rule, \n     they included a cost-benefit analysis that said \n     implementation could cost up to $4 billion--with no \n     quantifiable benefit. The rule was followed by a letter \n     from the Director of Office of Information and Regulatory \n     Affairs at OMB, Dr. John Graham, which said ``this is one \n     of the most burdensome rules to be reviewed by this \n     Administration.''\n\n  Not surprisingly, these predictions were recently realized when \nseveral processors, preparing for implementation of mandatory labeling \nin September 2006, sent their suppliers letters spelling out the \narduous procedures that would be employed to verify animal origin, \nensure compliance, and indemnify the processors from liability for \ninaccurate information.\n  Given these ominous warnings, many of my constituents are rightly \nconcerned about the financial and record keeping burdens this law will \nimpose on them. They ask:\n\n       How can something so popular, like marketing and promoting \n     U.S. products be so expensive?\n\n  There has to be a better way to market and promote U.S. products. I \nam pleased that the conference report for the Fiscal Year 2006 \nAgriculture Appropriations Act contains a provision that will delay \nimplementation of mandatory country-of-origin labeling until 2008 \nbecause it gives us 2 more years to enact a meaningful, cost-effective \nlabeling program like the Meat Promotion Act of 2005, which I \nintroduced with 13 of my colleagues earlier this year. This bipartisan, \ncommonsense legislation would establish a voluntary country-of-origin \nlabeling program driven by the free-market, not the rigid legal \ninterpretations of Federal bureaucrats.\n  I stand with livestock producers that want to market and promote the \nproducts they proudly raise. I believe they should be able to market \nand promote their products as born, raised, and processed in the United \nStates, and I believe the Meat Promotion Act of 2005 provides the most \neffective and efficient opportunity for them to do so, while adding \nvalue to their bottom line and helping the economy of rural America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise, too, on behalf of South Dakota's \ncattle producers to voice my support for country-of-origin labeling and \nalso to express my profound disappointment in the tactics that were \nemployed to derail country-of-origin labeling in the bill under \nconsideration this evening.\n  I have been a supporter of mandatory country-of-origin labeling since \nfirst being elected to the House of Representatives in 1996. I offered \nthe country-of-origin labeling amendment in the House Agricultural \nCommittee 2002 farm bill deliberations. Figuratively speaking, that was \na bloody battle. Anyone who was in the room will tell you we spent 4 \nhours fighting over this issue about whether to include country-of-\norigin labeling in the 2002 farm bill. The truth of the matter is, even \nthough at that particular point in the process we were not able to get \nincluded in the House farm bill, we were later on, when the bill went \ninto conference with the Senate, the Senate adopted a provision, and we \nwere able to retain that provision. So when the 2002 farm bill \nconference report was reported to the floor of the House and the \nSenate, it included mandatory country-of-origin labeling. It was passed \noverwhelmingly by the House and the Senate, put on the President's desk \nand signed into law. In fact, it was signed into law by the President \nback on May 13, 2002.\n  I assumed at that time that we had achieved a major victory for the \nranchers that we represent, the cattle producers in places such as \nSouth Dakota and other areas of the country. Unfortunately, I was \nwrong.\n  Even though country-of-origin labeling has been the law of the land \nsince that day, it has been on the receiving end of an onslaught of \nattacks and delays. Where I come from, a deal is a deal. The Congress, \nthe elected Representatives of the people of this country, through the \n2002 farm bill, adopted a provision that would implement mandatory \ncountry-of-origin labeling. Under the 2002 farm bill, country-of-origin \nlabeling was set to be implemented by September in 2004. The fiscal \nyear 2004 agriculture appropriations bill--and at that time I was not \nin the Congress--delayed implementation until September of 2006. And \nnow the conference report we have before the Senate today will delay it \neven further, until 2008.\n  It always ends up being done in the dark of night. As was noted \nearlier by several of my colleagues in the Senate, the House \nnegotiators came to this process and walked away from the table, not \neven giving us an opportunity to debate this in the light of the day. \nIt would be great to have the debate on the floor, but even in the \nconference there was not an opportunity for Members of the Senate to \nhave their voices heard through a vote on that particular provision.\n  If you want to rewrite the 2002 farm bill, don't do it in a \nconference committee, for crying out loud. Let's do it in the light of \nday. Let's at least give the members in the conference committee an \nopportunity to vote up or down on this issue. I believe if the members \nof that conference committee had that opportunity, those in favor of \ncountry-of-origin labeling would have prevailed.\n  I have heard the arguments against mandatory country-of-origin \nlabeling more times than I can count. While I respect my colleagues and \ntheir views, I disagree with those who oppose this program and wish to \ndelay it to death.\n  My colleague from Texas suggested this is a bad thing, we cannot \nimplement this. How do we know? We have not implemented it yet. We \npassed the law. The people's representatives of the Congress spoke out \nin favor and made it part of the 2002 farm bill. We have lots of \npeople, naysayers, now saying it will never work. How do we know? It \nhas never been implemented.\n  The deal we struck back in 2002, and the commitment we made to the \nproducers of this country and to the consumers of this country, has now \nbeen derailed not once but twice. Literally, it is death by a thousand \ncuts to the producers across this country who believe the Congress had \ntaken their side and made a commitment to implement this legislation.\n  My colleague from Texas--again, whose views on this I certainly \nrespect--suggests we just have a voluntary system. The people who are \nopposed to doing this mandatory country-of-origin labeling, how do you \nexpect them to come out and voluntarily say, we are going to do it. \nThey are the very folks who are fighting, resisting, opposing, trying \nto delay and ultimately kill the country-of-origin labeling provision \nthat was a part of the 2002 farm bill that ought to be the law of the \nland today.\n  Everything that we have in this country has a label on it. The tie I \nam wearing this evening says ``Made in China.'' The glasses, as I get \nolder, I need for reading purposes, say ``Made in China.'' Even the \nholder for the glasses has a labeling on it. The pen I hold in my hand \nsays ``Made in Japan.'' Literally everything we purchase in this \ncountry has a label. We know where things come from, where they \noriginate. In the last farm bill, we even implemented for fish, for \nfruit and vegetables. Yet we do not want to know where the meat comes \nfrom that the consumers of this country consume on a daily basis? Does \nanybody understand or recognize the inconsistency in that argument?\n  It will not be very far from here that producers in this country will \nbe forced to implement an animal ID system, and somehow we cannot \nimplement a country-of-origin labeling system. Yet we are going to ask \nproducers to trace the origin of those animals as a food safety \nprecaution.\n  I argue, again, that country-of-origin labeling is an opportunity for \nour producers to differentiate their product from those products raised \nelsewhere in the world. We have the highest quality, and our producers \nare proud of what they raise in this country. They want\n\n[[Page S12228]]\n\nto be able to differentiate it, but they are going to be required in \nthe not-too-distant future, as a food safety measure, to implement an \nanimal ID. We have a number of pilot programs underway across the \ncountry today. When one of those is adopted as some sort of a national \nstandard, producers will be expected to trace the origin of those \nanimals. The only question is, Who is going to pay for it?\n  It is a slap in the face to this Nation's livestock producers and \nconsumers. This recent delay is unacceptable. It is unwarranted. Who \nloses? The livestock producers who grow and raise quality products in \nthis country, who want an opportunity to market and differentiate their \nproducts, and ultimately, the consumers of this country who have a \nright to know where the meats they purchase, day in and day out for \nconsumption by themselves and their families, comes from. Special \ninterests have won out this day over the will of our producers, our \nconsumers, and the elected representatives in the Senate. That is a sad \nday.\n  I will oppose this Agriculture appropriations conference report for \nthat reason.\n  I yield back my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened to this debate with \ninterest. There are a few things perhaps to get on the record so we \nhave it clear if someone wishes to go back in historic fashion and look \nat all this and say what really happened. I would like to make a few \ncomments to that extent with respect to country-of-origin labeling.\n  Conferences are for the purpose of resolving differences. The Senate \nhad no statement at all with respect to country-of-origin labeling, so \nthe Senate bill would have allowed the law to go forward in the way \nthat many of the speakers here tonight have asked. The House bill would \nhave killed it--not delayed it, killed it. The House voted \noverwhelmingly to eliminate country-of-origin labeling.\n  We had to come up with a compromise. We could either have the Senate \nposition--that it goes forward--we could have the House position--that \nit dies--or we could have something in between. In the spirit of most \nconferences, we came up with something in between.\n  We have not killed the program in this conference report. We have \ndelayed the implementation. So the Senate did not get what it wanted, \nwhich was full speed ahead. The House did not get what it wanted, which \nwas to kill the program. We have a compromise.\n  I think we should understand that so those who say, We caved in to \nthe House, the House did it to us, without any consultation or \nconference with the Senate--well, understand that is not true. We \narrived at a compromise between two very different positions. It does \nnot satisfy the people in the Senate, and it probably does not satisfy \nthe people in the House.\n  Now, I will say from a personal point of view, I am getting tired of \nthis debate. It came up when I became chairman of the subcommittee the \nfirst time. We have had to deal with it several times now. I think this \nis an issue that should be resolved in the authorizing committee. I \nthink the authorizers should come to the conclusion it is a good idea \nand we should go ahead with it or they should come to the conclusion we \nmade a mistake in the farm bill and we should kill it. They should not \nask us in the appropriations process to make the decision that the \nauthorizers need to make.\n  The point has been made here that the date we set on this, with this \ncompromise between the House and the Senate, carries to a point beyond \nthe expiration of the current farm bill. That is true. That means the \nauthorizers will have an opportunity, before we visit this issue again \non the Appropriations Committee, to make their decision. The \nauthorizers will have an opportunity to either re-endorse the idea or \nto kill it.\n  So I say to those who feel so strongly on both sides: Talk to the \nauthorizers when it comes up in the farm bill and make the decision--do \nwe really want to go ahead with this or do we really want to kill it?--\nand not ask those of us in the appropriations conference to have to \ndeal with it. Get it off our plate and put it in the place where it \nbelongs.\n  I make one other comment. As I have looked at the issue, I find \nmyself on the side of those who think it is a mistake. I have no \npressure from consumers who want a label on meat that says where it \ncomes from. I do not think they would pay that much attention to it. \nThe history of country-of-origin labeling for virtually every other \nproduct is that consumers are mildly interested but that it does not \nsignificantly affect their purchasing.\n  If someone really believes this would make meat more attractive to \ncustomers, he or she has the opportunity to put that label on right \nnow. A voluntary program would make it available everywhere. But if \nsomeone wants to promote Iowa beef, they have the opportunity right now \nas a marketing device to say, This is Iowa beef, without having to go \nthrough all of the regulatory requirements that are connected with this \nlaw.\n  So once again, this is an issue that the authorizers should look at. \nThis is an issue that those of us who have been forced to deal with it \nare tired of. We hope this is the last time we will have to deal with \nit in an appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter sent to me from \nthe USDA Acting General Counsel regarding sections 794 and 798 of the \nfiscal year 2006 Agriculture Appropriations Act be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                Office of the General Counsel,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 28, 2005.\n     Hon.

Sec. 603, or under \n     guidelines issued by USDA under section 903 of the Federal \n     Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (FAIR Act), 7 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1901 note. If enacted, section 794 would prohibit \n     the use of appropriated funds to pay the salaries and \n     expenses of USDA employees to perform inspections of horses \n     under either section 3 of the FMIA or the guidelines issued \n     under section 903 of the FAIR Act.\n       If enacted, section 798 would (1) amend the FMIA by \n     removing the list of species, i.e., ``cattle, sheep, swine, \n     goats, horses, mules, and other equines'' at every place \n     where it presently occurs in the FMIA and replace such list \n     with the term ``amenable species''; (2) provide that the term \n     ``amenable species'' means those species subject to the \n     provisions of the FMIA on the day before the date of \n     enactment of the Act, as well as ``any additional species of \n     livestock that the Secretary considers appropriate''; and (3) \n     make similar amendments to section 19 of the FMIA regarding \n     the marking and labeling of carcasses of horses, mules, and \n     other equines and products thereof. Section 798 would become \n     effective on the day after the effective date of section 794.\n       Having reviewed these sections, it is our opinion that \n     section 798 does not nullify or supersede section 794 and \n     that, if both sections are enacted as written, barring \n     further amendment the prohibitions effected by section 794 \n     would become effective 120 days after the date of enactment \n     of the Act.\n       Please let us know if you have any further questions \n     regarding this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              James Michael Kelly,\n                                           Acting General Counsel.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On November 20, 2002, in Scottsdale, AZ, a gay man was attacked while \nleaving a bar. According to police the man was leaving a bar when two \nmen approached him. One man said, ``you offend me . . . you are an \ninsult to straight men.'' He then attacked the victim punching him \ntwice in the face.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/02/senate-section/article/S12229-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROSA PARKS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nthe truly legendary and enduring figure of the 20th century, Rosa \nParks, who dedicated herself to fighting for equality and justice.\n  Rosa Parks, the matriarch of our Nation's civil rights movement, died \nlast Monday at the age of 92. An American icon who changed the course \nof the 20th Century, Rosa Parks believed that men and women, regardless \nof color, should not be treated as second class citizens. Sixty years \nafter the name Rosa Parks first made headlines, her courageous acts \ncontinue to symbolize the cause of freedom in America.\n  As we mourn the passing of Rosa Parks, we are reminded of the power \nand integrity of her spirit. Her quiet dignity and fearless strength \nshaped and inspired the civil rights movement in the United States over \nthe last half-century.\n  Most historians date the beginning of the modern civil rights \nmovement in the United States to December 1, 1955. Tired and weary not \nonly from a long day of work, but from years of discrimination and \nracial inequality, an unknown seamstress in Montgomery, AL, refused to \ngive up her bus seat to a white passenger. On that momentous day in \nhistory, Rosa Parks was arrested for violating a city ordinance, but \nher lonely act of defiance sparked a movement that ended legal \nsegregation in America.\n  The subsequent bus boycott by African Americans created a national \nsensation. Led by Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., the Montgomery bus \nboycott lasted nearly 13 months and inspired the Nation's civil rights \nmovement.\n  The boycott led to the Supreme Court questioning the legality of the \nJim Crow law that mandated the discrimination of African-Americans on \nthe public bus system. And on November 13, 1956, in the landmark case \nBrowder v. Gayle, the Supreme Court banned segregation on buses. A \ntremendous victory for the cause of freedom and equality.\n  Throughout her long life, Rosa Parks possessed an innate ability to \nlead. Her quiet acts of courage illuminated for Americans the disgrace \nand moral injustice of segregation. She continued to inspire non-\nviolent protests in the name of civil rights throughout the 20th \ncentury and changed the face of America forever.\n  Rosa Parks was born in Tuskegee, AL, in 1913, a time when black and \nwhite America seemed destined to remain perpetually divided. In 1932, \nshe married civil rights activist Raymond Parks. Together, they worked \nfor the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, where she worked as a \nsecretary for the Montgomery branch and as its youth leader.\n  In the summer of 1955, while working for the NAACP, Rosa Parks \nattended an interracial leadership conference. She later said that it \nwas at this conference where she ``gained strength to persevere in my \nwork for freedom, not just for blacks but for all oppressed people.''\n  Rosa Parks had a distinguished career of public and community \nservice. In 1965, Rosa Parks began to work as a receptionist and office \nassistant for Congressman John Conyers in his Detroit office, where she \ncontinued to work until 1988. Later, she established the Rosa and \nRaymond Parks Institute for Self-Development. Its ongoing mission is to \nmotivate and direct youth to achieve their highest potential.\n  Rosa Parks once remarked that she wanted to be remembered ``as a \nperson who wanted to be free and wanted others to be free.'' She lived \neach day by this mantra and inspired countless individuals in America \nand throughout the world to take up the mantle of freedom.\n  But although our country has come a long way since the days of the \nJim Crow laws, it doesn't mean that we still don't have even more to \naccomplish. We must protect the advances made by America's minorities, \nand also further those advances in the years ahead.\n  Today, we honor the life and legacy of Rosa Parks, a great champion \nof freedom, equality and justice, and prosperity for all people. I \nbelieve that it was especially fitting that she was given the distinct \ntribute of lying in honor in our Nation's Capitol. An icon who changed \nAmerica, there is no doubt that Rosa Parks will remain etched forever \nin our memories.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/02/senate-section/article/S12229-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12229-S12230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE RECENT ELECTIONS IN ZANZIBAR\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the \nsituation in Zanzibar, Tanzania.\n  Just last month, Zanzibaris went to the polls in Presidential and \nparliamentary elections. I commend the strong voter turnout and the \nunderstandable desire of Zanzibaris that their votes be counted. \nUnfortunately, the people of Zanzibar have so far been denied the \naccountable and transparent election process they deserve. This is a \ncruel repeat of the Presidential and parliamentary elections held in \n1995 and 2000, which were widely considered to have been mismanaged, \nresulting in serious irregularities. Credible allegations were made \nafter the 2000 elections that votes were manipulated to deny the \nopposition Civic United Front, CUF, victory in Zanzibar.\n  Even more disturbing was the violent aftermath of the 2000 elections. \nIn 2001, demonstrators protesting election abuses in Zanzibar and Pemba \nmet with a brutal police response in which 32 people died, hundreds \nwere arrested, and countless others fled to neighboring countries for \nasylum. These events were deeply troubling and underscored the need for \nreal reform to ensure that violence and serious irregularities in the \nelectoral process were not repeated. I traveled to Pemba in the \naftermath of these troubling events, and in my conversations with local \nresidents and leaders, I sensed real frustration with the failure of \nthe Tanzanian authorities and the international community to speak out \non behalf of the civil and political rights of the people of Zanzibar.\n  The Mukata II agreement established in 2002 gave rise to hope for \nchange. Reforms under this agreement, agreed to by all parties and \nimplemented in the 2003 local elections in Pemba, gave further reason \nto believe that the rights of the Zanzibari people would now be \nrespected. Unfortunately, while the Mukata II agreement set out to \nimprove transparency and ensure that election results are credible to \nparties, it appears today that Zanzibari voters' rights are again being \nignored.\n  Once again, serious allegations of voting irregularities and unfair \npreelection conditions have surfaced, including double voting, \ninaccurate voter lists which prevented eligible voters from casting \nballots, and media bias. Once again, reports speak to the use of \nexcessive force against civilians protesting these injustices.\n  The Government of Tanzania and the Government of Zanzibar have a \nresponsibility to pursue accountability for past abuses and \ntransparency in the political process. The U.S. Government has a \nresponsibility, too. To turn a blind eye to the abuses that have taken \nand are taking place in Zanzibar is inconsistent with our principles, \nand it is, frankly, inconsistent with our interests. Zanzibar's \npopulation is nearly entirely Muslim. Given all the hostility, all of \nthe suspicion, and all of\n\n[[Page S12230]]\n\nthe resentment of American foreign policy that exists in the Muslim \nworld, we cannot afford to be indifferent to this kind of injustice. I \ncall on the administration to provide Congress with a plan to work with \nthe rest of the donor community to send strong, unmistakable signals to \nthe Tanzanian Government that the disenfranchisement of the people of \nZanzibar is simply unacceptable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/02/senate-section/article/S12230-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SUPERB PERFORMANCE OF THE COAST GUARD\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Before he was \n     dispatched to New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane \n     Katrina, Milam had never been called out of Alaska for a \n     mission and had never done urban search-and-rescue work. But \n     like thousands of other personnel, he was brought to \n     Louisiana to do what the Coast Guard does best: improvise \n     wildly.\n       Milam made his first rescue late one night near a warehouse \n     outside New Orleans. After dropping him into the black miasma \n     below, his helicopter did something he had never seen in his \n     entire 13-year career: it flew away--so that he' could hear \n     the cries for help. He looked around through his night-vision \n     goggles and saw what looked like caskets--in fallen trees, on \n     porches. Yes, they were caskets, dislodged from a nearby \n     cemetery. That night Milam found a man and four dogs and \n     helped hoist them all safely into the helicopter when it \n     returned. The man's pig, however, Milam left behind. ``No way \n     I'm taking a pig. The pig will be O.K.,'' he says. And so it \n     went for 11 days, with Milam experiencing such firsts as \n     flying over a semitrailer sitting on the roof of a house, \n     seeing alligators undulating in the water below and finding \n     himself surrounded by four men with shotguns in a dark, empty \n     hospital. (They were security guards, as it turned out, and \n     just as frightened as he was,) ``I'm like, man, they didn't \n     teach me this in swimmer school.''\n       In Katrina's aftermath, the Coast Guard rescued or \n     evacuated more than 33,500 people, six times as many as it \n     saved in all of 2004. The Coast Guard was saving lives before \n     any other, federal agency--despite the fact that almost half \n     the local Coast Guard personnel lost their own homes in the \n     hurricane. In decimated St. Bernard Parish east of New \n     Orleans, Sheriff Jack Stephens says the Coast Guard was the \n     only federal agency to provide any significant assistance for \n     a full week after the storm. Coast Guard personnel helped his \n     deputies commandeer boats and rescue thousands. So last week, \n     when two representatives from the U.S. Government \n     Accountability Office came to ask how he would fix the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), he had his answer \n     ready: ``I would abolish it,'' he told. them. ``I'd blow up \n     FEMA and ask the Coast Guard what it needs.''\n       In one sense, that has. already happened. After the \n     implosion of FEMA director Michael Brown, President George W. \n     Bush placed Coast Guard Vice Admiral Thad Allen in charge of \n     the federal response to Katrina. Before Hurricane Rita even \n     hit land, the Administration placed a Coast Guard rear \n     admiral in charge of that recovery. These are essentially \n     urban-planning jobs--not something men and women who spend \n     much of their professional lives on water are exactly trained \n     to do.\n       So how is it that an agency that is underfunded and saddled \n     with aging equipment--and about the size of the New York City \n     police department--makes disaster response look like just \n     another job, not a quagmire? How did an organization that, \n     like FEMA, had been subsumed by the soul-killing Department \n     of Homeland Security. (DHS), remain a place where people took \n     risks? And perhaps most important, can any of these traits be \n     bottled?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/02/senate-section/article/S12230-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR. RICHARD E. SMALLEY\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. \nRichard Errett Smalley of Rice University.\n  On October 28, 2005, Texas and America lost a brilliant mind, a great \nAmerican and a dear friend, Richard Smalley.\n  Early in his life, Dr. Smalley developed a love for science as he \ncollected single-cell organisms with his mother at a local pond and \nstudied them with a microscope.\n  He took this love of science with him to the University of Michigan \nwhere he graduated in 1965 with a bachelor's degree in chemistry.\n  After working at a Shell Chemical Company manufacturing plant in New \nJersey for 4 years, Dr. Smalley continued his education at Princeton \nUniversity, graduating with an M.S. in 1971 and his Ph.D. in 1973.\n  He moved his family to Chicago to begin a postdoctoral period with \nDonald H. Levy at the University of Chicago.\n  While there, Dr. Smalley's work began to elevate when he pioneered \nwhat has become one of the most powerful techniques in chemical \nphysics, supersonic beam laser spectroscopy.\n  In 1976, Dr. Smalley joined the Department of Chemistry at Rice \nUniversity as an assistant professor, where he, along with his \ncolleague, Dr. Robert F. Curl and British chemist Sir Harold Kroto, \ndiscovered a new class of carbon molecules called the fullerene, or \n``buckyballs.''\n  This discovery led to the team's 1996 Nobel Prize in chemistry, and \nspurred the development of nanotechnology as a revolutionary area of \nscience capable of solving global problems in fields ranging from \nmedicine to energy to national security.\n  Dr. Smalley's accomplishments in the field of nanotechnology have \ngreatly contributed to the academic and research communities of Rice \nUniversity, the State of Texas, and the entire country.\n  He, along with Nobel Laureate Michael Brown, was a founding \ncochairman of the Texas Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science, \nwhich has played an instrumental role in enhancing research in Texas.\n  Dr. Smalley devoted his talent to employ nanotechnology to solve the \nworld's energy problem, which he believed could ultimately solve other \nglobal problems such as hunger and lack of water.\n  His devotion to science and its application to solving world issues \nearned him numerous honors and accolades, including the Distinguished \nPublic Service Medal from the U.S. Department of the Navy and the \nLifetime Achievement Award from Small Times Magazine.\n  While Dr. Smalley may no longer be with us, his legacy will continue \nto grow as scientists build upon his work and all of us around the \nworld reap the benefits of his discoveries.\n  My condolences go out to his wife Deborah, two sons, Chad and \nPreston, and the rest of his family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/02/senate-section/article/S12230-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12230-S12234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIP DIARY ON BEHALF OF THE HURRICANE KATRINA FARMWORKERS DISASTER \n                             RELIEF EFFORT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the trip diary of Dr. John Arnold on behalf of the Hurricane \nKatrina Farmworkers Disaster Relief Effort.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Trip Diary Hurricane Katrina Farmworkers Disaster Relief Effort (The \n Largest Interstate Non-Governmental Relief Effort of the Katrina/Rita/\n                      Tornado Aftermath Disasters)\n\n       Trip log of Dr. John David Arnold on his 6-day trip to the \n     Hurricane Katrina Disaster States of Mississippi and Alabama \n     from Friday, September 9, 2005 to Wednesday, September 14, \n     2005--His debriefing trip to federal\n\n[[Page S12231]]\n\n     agencies and Congressional Representatives in Washington, \n     D.C. September 29 and 30, 2005.\n\n\n                              INTRODUCTION\n\n       Why go to the Mississippi and Alabama? Perhaps because they \n     are rural states with many farmworkers that are consistently \n     ignored and would be forgotten about in the Hurricane \n     Katrina/Rita relief efforts. Also, because of the abject \n     poverty these workers are in. They would be hard pressed to \n     find resources to evacuate. Most had no credit cards, no bank \n     accounts, no gas, nor cars to put it in. A key concern was \n     the remoteness of these rural agricultural states and the \n     lack of adequate infrastructure to deal with Hurricane \n     disasters. Another key factor is that the coastal region \n     infrastructure was all but compromised by the storms. Our \n     long-term relationship with two sister farmworker \n     organizations, Mississippi Delta and Telamon Alabama \n     farmworker councils as contacts would facilitate our relief \n     assistance as their headquarters are located far inland and \n     their infrastructure was intact. This was an opportunity to \n     move much needed relief supplies to that region for present \n     needs as well as establish for the future a permanent \n     emergency relief supply distribution and training center. The \n     following is my diary of the 6 days spent in the Gulf States \n     region from September 9th--September 14, 2005, and subsequent \n     events.\n\n\n                      Pre-Weekend Collecting Phase\n\n   September 7, 2005: Initial Contact Phase with Gulf States region \n                                partners\n\n       A. Initial contact with sister agencies Mississippi Delta \n     and Alabama Telamon Farmworker Councils.\n       B. Conference call LULAC Executive Board to secure \n     $5,400.00 to pay for the costs of the first convoy of three \n     (3) trucks with emergency relief supplies from Arizona to \n     Clarksdale, Mississippi\n\n\n        September 8th: PPEP Katrina Relief Effort in Tucson, AZ\n\n       I spent most of the day (AM) arranging for transport \n     vehicles and volunteer laborers to load the (3) 26' Penske \n     rental trucks with emergency relief supplies. By noon trucks \n     had been secured as well as 12 students from PPEP TEC Charter \n     H. S., Fernandez Learning Center. Initially the donated items \n     came from both of the 13 PPEP TEC Charter High Schools, the \n     general public, and later the bulk of the items from World \n     Care. Lisa and Pam, from World Care were most generous with \n     the relief supplies they had collected as well as with \n     volunteers, trucks and drivers. The students of PPEP TEC were \n     also great and we worked loading the 3 26' trucks for about \n     4-5 hours in 107 deg. heat. One of the young ladies passed \n     out and was taken to urgent care--she was fine. The hungry \n     student volunteers were treated to the Home Town Buffet all \n     you can eat buffet. The media was great; CBS Channel 13 \n     showed up and interviewed us about what we were doing as well \n     as the Tucson Citizen photographer Gary Gaynor. During the \n     loading, I was interviewed by Maria Garza live on her \n     Hispanic radio network program. One of about a dozen such \n     interviews daily while I was in the gulf state region. The \n     Washington Post tracked me down in Clarksdale on the abuses \n     to the immigrant workers. We spoke about the need for mobile \n     medical clinics, bilingual volunteers to translate for \n     Spanish speaking volunteers wanting to fill out FEMA \n     Emergency relief applications. There was discussion about \n     Wal-Mart and Home Depot making discounts and jobs for Katrina \n     low income victims to repair their home--of course many do \n     not even have homes to fix nor are the insurance companies \n     willing to pay for it if they did have insurance. The \n     students that helped us load the trucks were impressed with \n     that because of their hard work they were ``now \n     humanitarians--they showed there is hope for the future \n     generations.''\n\n\n     September 9th: Mobilizing Volunteers, Resources, Departure to \n                           Clarksdale, Miss.\n\n       A press conference was held at 10:30 a.m. Friday, September \n     9, 2005 to thank everyone involved with the relief effort as \n     well as a send off for those 7 individuals on the PPEP staff \n     that volunteered to make the some 25 hour 1,500 mile drive \n     from Tucson to Clarksdale, Mississippi to our drop off point \n     and then fly back to Tucson. They were Art Benge, Olivia \n     Bernal, David Green, Suzette Hamill, George Long, and Samuel \n     Lopez. I flew down ahead of time to make preparations for \n     their arrival and visit farmworker camps in the region. \n     George Long from PMHDC would head up the first convoy. The \n     press conference was attended by the Arizona Star, Tucson \n     Citizen and Channel 4 (NBC) provided coverage. About 35 \n     students and staff along with Representative Ted Downing \n     participated in the send off. Representative Ted Downing \n     spoke of the loss psychologically that Katrina victims have \n     sustained. This includes disorientation because the landmarks \n     are gone, time of day no longer matters, whether it's Sunday \n     or Saturday is meaning less. Despair, poverty, disease, loss \n     of family members and possessions blur everything. Time seems \n     to stand still until the shock wears off, relief or rescue \n     arrives, if ever. During Maria Garza's live radio \n     broadcast, I brought up these points and others; such as \n     need for volunteer bilingual psychological counseling, \n     legal assistance for the victims, bio-hygiene was also \n     discussed as crucial, just to feel clean again. Among the \n     items transported were health, personal hygiene kits, \n     canned food, clothing of all ages, bedding, water, \n     crutches, walkers, infant needs, and even pet food there \n     was need for insect repellent as the mosquito population \n     was exploding carry diseases. Clorox is a priority as the \n     monster mold that sets in afterwards.\n       My flight to Clarksdale was rerouted to Little Rock, \n     Arkansas 2 hours away from Clarksdale. My purpose for flying \n     ahead of the relief convoy was to make preparations in \n     Clarksdale to set up the proposed storage facility to be used \n     later for distribution of the contents of the three trucks of \n     donated items. Furthermore, we were to have a press \n     conference and tour on Saturday the local emergency shelter \n     with Hector Flores, President of LULAC, Congressman Benny \n     Thompson as well as consult with local emergency officials.\n       Initially, LULAC contributed the $5,400 to cover rental of \n     the 3 trucks, airfare for drivers to return home, gas and \n     lodging. PPEP, Inc. contributed the staff hours, logistics on \n     both ends of the trip. My flight arrived at Little Rock at \n     10:24 p.m. where I was greeted by Mr. Nathan Norris a \n     representative from Mississippi Delta Farmworker Council who \n     drove me to Clarksdale. Because of several detours we arrived \n     in Clarksdale at 4:00 a.m.\n\n\n September 10th Clarksdale, Mississippi Tour/Press Conference/Outreach \n                        to Farmworkers, Morning\n\n       Don Green picked me up from the Best Western and we had \n     breakfast and talked over strategies for recovery the efforts \n     including microbusiness and housing development. Afterward we \n     went to the Mississippi Delta Farmworker Council office in \n     Clarksdale and greeted Barbara Thompson and met the other \n     staff. I located Hector Flores President of LULAC that had \n     flown into Jackson, Mississippi, and rented a car. During the \n     morning, two groups of Mexican farmworkers came into the \n     office and I translated for them as there were no Spanish \n     speaking workers there or anywhere I went. We made \n     arrangements to go visit the farmworkers that evening where \n     they lived as well as present the services available in Don's \n     job training organization. Don and I went out to Stovall \n     Farms where we saw some farmworkers and also promised to \n     return with Pizza's in the evening and talk to the rest of \n     the group. Back at the office we made preparations for the \n     press conference at 1:30 p.m. Mr. Hector Flores arrived with \n     assistant Mr. Briones and he talked to some of the \n     farmworkers whom had come into the office and took photos \n     with them. We then took off to the local shelter located at \n     the Clarksdale Expo Center. The center was being toured by \n     the local, State, and congressional representative Bennie \n     Thompson. The center was very well organized, equipped, and \n     supplied all with local resources--mainly none governmental. \n     After the shelter tour, we went back to the Mississippi \n     Delta office for the press conference. Hector, myself, and \n     Congressman Thompson spoke to the press and the group \n     assembled there. The balance of the afternoon was devoted \n     to making flyers in Spanish, which I translated, and \n     ordering 60 pizzas and sodas for the evening farmworkers \n     meetings.\n       At 5 p.m. went back to Stovall Farms passing the Indian \n     burial mounds. We found the farmworkers playing volleyball \n     behind one of the houses. Corn, barley, marlo, cotton, \n     soybeans, rice, and catfish farming are common to the area. \n     There are also some casinos along the river. Some of the \n     people say the once rich soil is being depleted and \n     contaminated by overuse of pesticides. The farmworkers at \n     Stovall listened to our presentation of services, ate pizza, \n     and we took pictures together. Don's group played volleyball \n     with the farmworkers, an important bonding between two \n     diverse cultures yet with the same farm work background. We \n     then left for a trailer park near Clarksdale that housed \n     farmworkers, unlike Stovall farms most spoke English. We ate \n     pizza together with these workers whom were interested in \n     computer, CDL, and technical classes. The Stovall farmworkers \n     wanted English classes. Both types of classes were going to \n     be looked into by Barbara Thompson from Delta.\n       The last stop was to visit some farmworkers was at Vance, \n     Mississippi, about 15 miles south of Clarksdale. One group of \n     male farmworkers invited us into their home where we \n     exchanged pizza and a Mexican dish prepared by the \n     farmworkers. Afterwards, we took the balance of the pizza to \n     the shelter for the evacuees whom were mostly out for the \n     evening in town. We spoke to the sheriff safety officers at \n     the shelter and they advised us if we were going to the \n     coastal cities of Biloxi and Gulfport we should take extra \n     gas rations as supplies were non-existent. Also, suggested we \n     travel with armed guard or get Military Police escort while \n     in the immediate coastal area as there are armed gangs, car \n     jacking, and looting. Once there, I saw none of that, only \n     people whose dreams were shattered and praying that relief \n     would arrive soon. Also suggested, was that we must leave \n     before it gets dark because it is extremely dangerous and the \n     military has a curfew and will snipers shoot at you. I then \n     returned to my hotel. Most all the hotels in Mississippi are \n     completely filled with evacuees. The first available \n     reservations were in December.\n\n\n     September 11th: Trip to Gulf Coast Region--PPEP Convoy Arrives\n\n       We left Clarksdale at 6 a.m. and traveled down Highway 49 \n     through Indianola, Jackson, and Hattiesburg to 1-10 and \n     Gulfport. One of Don's staff personal that drove was armed in \n     case of an emergency. We arrived\n\n[[Page S12232]]\n\n     in Jackson and stopped for fuel to ensure we could get in and \n     out of the Gulf area. From that point on we began to see \n     damage of trees uprooted and buildings in disrepair.\n       As we got closer to Biloxi and Gulfport, there was evidence \n     of military personnel, shelter tents and relief stockpiles in \n     the open, mainly donated items that were being distributed. \n     People were returning and the areas inland north of the US-90 \n     were congested with vehicles. Perhaps loading up with \n     supplies, rebuilding materials, and families returning to \n     survey what was left if anything. Some of the gas stations \n     were open (long lines) and a few restaurants were all very \n     busy. As we got closer to downtown Gulfport the road was \n     blockaded and cars were screened by the Military Police. The \n     Downtown was abandoned as far as business activity since most \n     of them were damaged, many beyond repair or blown away.\n       As we approached US-90 the buildings were leveled and the \n     large hotels facing the beach were blown out and only their \n     structural frames remained. Once on US-90 we were stopped \n     again and screened carefully to continue westbound. Once \n     heading west, the evidence of the magnitude of the storm was \n     alarming. The floating casinos were beached. One casino had \n     rested atop what was once a 3-story motel and flattened it. \n     All the businesses along the route were swept away and barely \n     a trace left where they once stood. The large oaks were \n     leveled and stripped of their leaves. Most were up rooted. \n     The banana industry warehouses and trucks near the docking \n     areas were gone. Their mangled and twisted trailer truck \n     frames were scattered everywhere. I took several hundred \n     digital photos with one hand and attempted to videotape the \n     unbelievable devastation with the other hand. As we proceeded \n     east on US-90 in Gulfport, I noticed only empty spaces where \n     many stately mansions I remembered previously seeing were \n     swept away. All that was left was mangled truck frames, \n     vehicles, scattered railroad cars, and enormous uprooted oak \n     trees. Occasionally there were cement steps that once led up \n     to the houses otherwise there was no evidence of some ones \n     home ever being there.\n       The only structure that remained with some semblance in its \n     former state was the Gulfport Girls College where my mother \n     once attended school, now Mississippi State College. However, \n     upon closer inspection only the walls remained. The building \n     had been gutted by the wind and water surges that were some \n     30 feet high and winds up to 200 mph. The newer school \n     structures were gone. One heartening thing was the 300-year-\n     old oak tree known as the Friendship Tree apparently \n     survived. I took some photos there and called my daughters \n     Chaska and Tika and let them know the tree they played on was \n     still there. In order to enter the area we had to have a \n     military escort as helicopters were flying overhead watching \n     closely for looters. Military Humvees were patrolling the \n     area and checked on our presence. I took so many photos \n     because I knew I could never describe what I saw nor would \n     anyone believe me. These photos were some of the first taken \n     as we were admitted to the areas shortly as it was opened up \n     to public access. The roadway was not stable in some places \n     and washed away in others. I was careful not to take photos \n     of any families' victims of Katrina that might be surveying \n     the damage. We headed back east on US-90 towards Biloxi, \n     Miss. Once again the former business district was totally \n     devastated or washed away. All the homes were devastated or \n     completely gone. All that was left in some cases were the \n     foundations and front steps. Some owners had left an \n     American flag where there house once stood. One sign said \n     ``Pray for Us'' others said ``looters will be shot.'' We \n     stopped at the Biloxi Fire station to pick up Jacobo Brado \n     from the Mexican Consulate. He was on loan from the \n     Mexican Embassy to provide relief, cash, and airfare back \n     to Mexico for certain evacuees. Also, they were running \n     interference with the local military base that had \n     arrested some illegal workers of one of the re-\n     constructions contractors. He took us to a small Hispanic-\n     owned grocery store where we talked to the owner and \n     patrons whom came into the store about conditions in the \n     Latino community. We also visited a nearby apartment \n     complex where many Latinos live that worked in the casinos \n     that were now damaged. It will take 9 months to a year, \n     weather permitting to get them open again. Most of the \n     tenants at the apartments lost their furniture and \n     personal items during the Hurricane. We also went to a \n     barrio we were told once housed hundreds of immigrants \n     with their businesses and homes. Nothing was left but \n     mounds of rubble, tree fragments, foundations, and heavily \n     damaged vehicles. Some of the rubble was piled 20-30 feet \n     high. It was total devastation. There was a terrible smell \n     of sewage, perhaps rotting flesh, etc. I just could not \n     imagine the once happy neighborhood now devastated beyond \n     recognition. Proceeding west on US-90 in Biloxi was most \n     difficult as the roadway was washed out in several places. \n     Along the beach was a grouping of military tents called \n     ``camp recovery'' I we also saw a hovercraft beached as \n     well as some navel vessels docked. There was also a \n     Mexican Navy ship with medical personnel and portable \n     water purification units there. They were being delayed we \n     were told because of U.S. Customs red tape. After our \n     coastal tour we went and had lunch, there we left Jacobo \n     and his three cell phones and headed back toward \n     Clarksdale, Mississippi. All totaled it was a 6-hour drive \n     from Clarksdale to Gulfport; we stayed 5 hours on the \n     coast and 7 hours returning as we stopped in Indianola, \n     Miss. to see Clanton Beaman.\n       Clanton heads up the Mississippi Delta Housing programs for \n     farmworkers. I have known him for over 30 years and we talked \n     about the funding of the programs and what would be needed \n     for the reconstruction. Ironically USDOL had cut of all of \n     his emergency and temporary housing funds this year.\n       We had dinner there and arrived at the Best Western in \n     Clarksdale shortly after midnight. We also were informed that \n     the PPEP relief convoy of 3-26' Penske rental trucks and the \n     1998 Pontiac van loaded with computers (donated by PPEP Inc) \n     had arrived safely that evening. The Mississippi Delta staff \n     had greeted them and provided a dinner. The sheriff also \n     escorted them from the Arkansas/Mississippi border into \n     Clarksdale.\n\n\n       september 12th: unloading relief supplies from tucson, az\n\n       We met the PPEP drivers at 8:00 a.m. and went to the \n     Clarksdale Hospital Cafe, which provided us a free breakfast \n     and lunch. That morning we drove the trucks to the \n     Mississippi Delta distribution point but it was too small. So \n     the Chamber of Commerce provided us a 60,000 sq. ft. \n     warehouse with 3 loading bays free of charge. It took \n     several hours for the local crew to unload the trucks. We \n     contacted World Care in Tucson about the increased storage \n     space for a regional distribution center and Pam from \n     World Care immediately dispatched a 53 semi loaded with \n     more relief supplies. Mississippi Delta received that day \n     130 calls for relief. They desperately need Spanish \n     speaking personal to reach the Latino Community and \n     farmworkers. We made pleas through the media to get \n     Spanish speaking volunteers to come to Clarksdale. LULAC \n     responded and will send someone and Mississippi Delta will \n     provide housing.\n       The media, local, national, and international was great. \n     Everyday at noon I provided an update over Maria Garza, Miami \n     based National Hispanic Radio Program. The Washington Post \n     called as did the Hispanic Magazine. The Arizona Daily Star \n     also did a story and photo. These all helped us get more \n     relief supplies and donations to World Care.\n       Once the trucks were un-loaded, Mississippi Delta treated \n     the PPEP workers to a trip to the ``Rhythm and Blues'' Museum \n     as Clarksdale, as it is the nation's capital for \n     contributions to that music. Many of the greatest blues \n     singers are from that region. Afterwards we returned to the \n     Mississippi Delta office for the signing over of the 1998 (6) \n     passenger van being donated by PPEP along with 5 computers \n     for use in the emergency relief and re-training the \n     farmworkers. We also visited the Chamber of Commerce to see \n     if they would sell the warehouse we are using to distribute \n     the emergency relief supplies. They are asking $650,000 for \n     the property which is an about 10 acres and has railroad and \n     3 loading docks.\n\n\n September 13th: Trip to Mobile and Baldwin County--Agriculture Region \n                                Alabama\n\n       I left Clarksdale for Memphis to catch a Delta flight to \n     Mobile, Alabama via Atlanta, Georgia. The purpose of the \n     Alabama visit is to identify farmworkers Katrina disaster \n     relief victims and find their whereabouts and needs. On my \n     way to Mobile, I spoke to LULAC and obtained an additional \n     $4,000 to transport two more 53' semi-trucks to Clarksdale. \n     World Care said they would match several more 53' semi-trucks \n     eventually making it 9 semi-trucks, and 3--26' foot delivery. \n     trucks to Clarksdale. Also, I spoke to Hector Flores to see \n     if he could help Mississippi Delta purchase the warehouse as \n     a permanent regional emergency relief center. LULAC will \n     secure appointments with USDA, HUD, Commerce, and other \n     agencies for my upcoming trip to D.C.\n       Once in Mobile, Alabama, I headed to the Mexican Consulate \n     located in the Hispanic Ministries building on Dolphin Island \n     Parkway. After briefing the Mexican consulate staff we waited \n     for Michelle Coel of the Alabama Telamon Farmworker Council \n     and her assistant Elizabeth. We all then went to a very \n     crowded Olive Garden Restaurant to have a late lunch and \n     exchange information about what each was doing. Afterwards we \n     went with the Mexican Consulate staff to Fairhope located in \n     Baldwin County. This is a major agricultural region for \n     peanuts, cotton, peaches, etc. Names of the Mexican \n     Consulate staff were: Alberto Diaz (Atlanta), Alfonso \n     Joule (Chicago), David Penaflor (Florida), and Astrid Diaz \n     (SRE. D.F.), Enrique Maldonado (Consul General), Jorge \n     Cesar (Atlanta).\n       When we arrived one of Michelle's contacts greeted us and \n     took us to a grocery store where farmworkers shop. There were \n     75 farmworkers there waiting for us. I translated for \n     Michelle as she explained what Telamon Alabama Farmworker \n     Council does and the services they offer. The Mexican \n     Consulate team that included Enrique Maldonado from the \n     Mexican Consulate in Atlanta, Georgia and staff from other \n     branches of the SRE. They made presentations of their \n     government's services. The farmworkers raised a number of \n     concerns such as;\n       1. Abuses by local law enforcement officers stopping, \n     citing, and harassing Hispanic drivers to a point they are \n     afraid to drive.\n       2. Landlord abuses of charging high rents and surcharges \n     along with steep fines if late. Shutting off water \n     arbitrarily. Also having vehicles towed off and throwing out \n     their furniture in the street. Non-refundable deposits of \n     $1800 are required to move into dilapidated trailers.\n\n[[Page S12233]]\n\n       3. Abuses by employers refusing to pay workers for their \n     labor. Threatening to call immigration and have them deported \n     if they complained.\n       4. Fear of government and law enforcement to the point they \n     do not report crimes against them such as robberies, \n     assaults, rapes, etc.\n       5. No recreation available for the youth, which breeds \n     drinking and drug abuse.\n       6. No one to turn to for help or to be their advocate.\n       7. Need for picture identification cards and classes to \n     learn English were top priorities.\n       8. Expressed the desire to be working and helping with the \n     reconstruction efforts in the region.\n       Both the Mexican Consulate and Telamon Alabama staff gave \n     out checks for rental assistance, and other emergency needs \n     that surfaced from the workers. The Mexican Consulate and I \n     visited a family in a trailer park that needed to be \n     repatriated to Mexico. Airfare was made available as well as \n     the logistics to get to the airport. There was mention that \n     the US Immigration Authorities were honoring an Amnesty \n     directive to not arrest Katrina victims. Maybe someone in \n     Washington got smart and realized we might need these workers \n     to repair the devastated Gulf States. Later I found out this \n     was contradicted by numerous arrests of illegal workers. The \n     message from Washington on this issue was not clear. Also, it \n     was reported in the newspaper that several victims whom \n     applied for disaster assistance were in deportation hearings. \n     This experience pointed out how poorly we are prepared to \n     make accessible emergency relief services or even to notify \n     and evacuate these workers when danger is eminent. Also, it \n     pointed out the greed that drives abuses and discrimination \n     and harassment directed towards our farmworkers. Also, the \n     need for Spanish speaking workers at hospitals, schools, \n     banks, police forces, county, state, and federal \n     offices. Ironically, it was at the Mexican Consulate I \n     found that they were the only governmental agency on the \n     scene along with the USDOL NFJP WIA 167 grantees that \n     provided Spanish speaking services. They also rescued me \n     and provided lodging in Mobile as there were no hotels \n     available. We crashed with the Mexican media and staff in \n     a 4-bedroom house.\n\n\n September 14th: Tour of Bayou La Batre and Pascagoula, Miss. Disaster \n                                Regions\n\n       I got up early and called the airport transportation \n     dispatcher and told her I wanted to tour the coastal disaster \n     areas. I left at 8:00 a.m. from the Mexican Consulate house \n     and proceeded west to Bayou Batre. I was told this is one of \n     the most important gulf shrimp and fishing areas mostly run \n     by Cambodian and Vietnamese immigrants. There were reports \n     that Latinos were moving into the area as well. I noticed at \n     the local store ``Jurritos sodas'' and other favorite food of \n     Latinos. However neither the Asians nor Latinos could be \n     found because there homes were wiped out.\n       As for the fishing port area it was heavily damaged and \n     well as the residential and business districts. There is \n     grave concern about the water quality for the shrimp and \n     fish. Government workers were on rafts testing the waters. \n     The stench was almost nauseating. The driver took me along \n     the coastal area where the fisherman once lived. There were \n     very few structures left as the storm surge was up to 30 \n     feet. The fishing peers were just poles in the water and none \n     of the infrastructure survived. I could see the water line on \n     the trees as well as debris high up on the limbs. There were \n     fishing ships overturned and some pushed far inland. Upon \n     returning to highway 90 I proceeded to Pascagoula, \n     Mississippi. By the way, the driver ``James'' pointed out the \n     alligator farm that made the national news because of the 200 \n     alligators that had escaped. We stopped and I saw an enormous \n     bull alligator still in his confinement.\n       However, across the parking lot in a shallow pond, there \n     was a small alligator that peered up at me, when I approached \n     him he lunged forward at me.\n       Once in Pascagoula, Mississippi, I observed much of the \n     devastation I saw in Gulfport and Biloxi, but on a much \n     larger scale. The devastation on the waterfront neighborhoods \n     was total. Some huge homes had been pushed inland, others \n     destroyed on their foundations. Most of the lots had only \n     their concrete front steps. Otherwise, their lots were swept \n     clean by the force of the winds and 20' to 30' water surges. \n     Some locals said that the gusts of winds got up to 200 miles \n     an hour. In the interior neighborhoods the people were just \n     returning and you could see clothing drying out and mounds of \n     ruined furniture and appliances piled up, tagged, out front \n     for removal. Some streets were still blocked because of the \n     debris, service trucks, and removal equipment.\n       Everywhere there were utility vehicles restoring power, \n     dump trucks, cranes, front loaders, and emergency vehicles. \n     There was definitely a bustle of activity to restore some \n     semblance of the community. There were some gruesome \n     stories such as before one hardware store could open 5 \n     dead bodies had to be removed from the roof. As for \n     comparisons to Hurricane Camille the old timers said \n     Katrina by far was the worst. Even the elevated railroad \n     bridge and Highway 90 were breached this time. I had to \n     hurry back to Mobile to catch a plane, but the driver said \n     there was not enough time so we continued on the \n     Pensacola, Florida to catch a flight to Tucson, Arizona \n     via Dallas, Fort Worth. On the way to Pensacola, Maria \n     Garza gave me 25 minutes on her program to discuss the \n     aforementioned negative situations with the farmworkers we \n     found in Baldwin County, Alabama.\n       Upon my return to Tucson we had a press conference to \n     debrief and thank the volunteers and our partners such as \n     LULAC, PPEP TEC Charter High School students, and World Care. \n     By then five more 18-wheelers from World Care had arrived in \n     Clarksdale, Miss. In Mobile, Alabama, we have located another \n     warehouse as a sub regional distribution center. Yes there \n     was another Hurricane since then, ``Rita'' who spawned high \n     winds, water, and tornados in the Clarksdale region. Both \n     Hurricanes were category 5 and three weeks apart.\n       After Rita, the only indoor relief center was in Clarksdale \n     as most others were left to the elements and ruins. Don and I \n     made plans to travel to Washington, D.C. to hopefully meet \n     with government officials; USDOL, USDA, HUD and Commerce to \n     find resources to keep the relief center permanent for \n     economic development and training. We also will attend the \n     National LULAC Board meeting while there and thank them for \n     their donations. We will show a PowerPoint we developed \n     showing the relief efforts, the devastation, as well as a \n     photo album and this trip diary.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       What was accomplished on this short trip to the Gulf States \n     was the following:\n       1. Collection and transporting of emergency relief supplies \n     from Tucson, Arizona that included 6 53' semi-trucks, 3 26' \n     semi-trucks, donation of 1998 (6) passenger van with (5) \n     computers. PPEP, INC. staff which drove these trucks came \n     from our school, property management, finance, and housing \n     divisions. World Care whom we owe the greatest thank you \n     provided 9 semis and CDL drivers. Lisa and Pam of World Care \n     get 3 gold stars! They never said ``No''--just that ``more \n     trucks are on the way.'' LULAC earns a gold star for \n     providing $10,000 to cover the cost of 3 drivers' food, 2 \n     semi's, lodging, 3 rental trucks, gas and associated costs.\n       2. Establishing in Clarksdale, Mississippi a permanent \n     regional emergency relief distribution, training, and \n     economic development center. We secured free of charge a 10 \n     acre 60,000 sq. ft. modern warehouse with 3 truck bays, \n     railroad spur for securing storing and distribution of \n     emergency supplies. We need $650,000 to purchase the \n     building.\n       3. We helped bond relationships between the African \n     American community and the Latino community everywhere we \n     went. Jesse Jackson and Hector Flores of LULAC have named \n     this the ``New South'' partnership.\n       4. We have helped surface the abuses and discrimination \n     that is on going in the region against Latinos. We owe much \n     gratitude to Maria Garza and her national Hispanic radio \n     program that aired my updates each day. As well as the \n     Mexican Consulate staff from Atlanta, Georgia.\n       5. We have given the local farmworkers staff and the \n     farmworkers our love and concern and the knowledge that there \n     are many of us out there that care about them and this \n     forgotten region.\n       6. Learned to appreciate what it means to lose all your \n     earthly possessions, pets, including loved ones.\n       7. Set the foundation to continue supporting the long-term \n     recovery efforts long after FEMA, Red Cross, and the \n     Salvation Army, which never arrived for the farmworkers and \n     other relief agencies, depart the region.\n       8. We found out great and lasting relief efforts for those \n     forgotten really do work--even without federal dollars.\n       An important thought came to me; President James Madison \n     once said ``those societies that honor the workers that toil \n     the fields shall endure.'' I observed that in the Katrina \n     crisis brought out the best and worse in our society. If all \n     the dedicated efforts I witnessed made during the \n     aforementioned relief efforts are any indication--then \n     President Madison would be proud of them.\n\n\n      The Debriefing in D.C.--Post Katrina/Rita/Tornado Aftermath\n\n       On Friday, September 30, 2005, Don Green and myself made \n     several visits in D.C. on Capitol Hill as well as meeting \n     with federal officials to present our Katrina/Rita emergency \n     relief report and recommendations on what is needed not to \n     help provide much needed relief as will as re-construction of \n     the rural agriculture regions.\n       Furthermore, the important of the Clarksdale facility as a \n     permanent emergency relief distribution training center, we \n     also presented our concerns on civil rights violations, and \n     wide spread abuse by tenant landlords and the failure of \n     FEMA, Salvation Army, and the Red Cross to reach farmworkers \n     hurricane victims. Perhaps a good reason not to give to the \n     Red Cross or Salvation Army because at it never will get to \n     farmworkers. Best give to local charities and relief \n     organizations that have on going contacts with farmworkers. \n     We presented the fact that these agencies had they found the \n     farmworkers there were no Spanish speaking field workers. We \n     also discussed the failure of federal agencies medium of \n     communication to warn farmworkers of eminent danger as well \n     as relief efforts. Most federal agencies were putting the \n     word out over their websites or in the media but in English. \n     Of course farmworkers do not have computers and when \n     electricity was out so were the radios.\n\n[[Page S12234]]\n\n                             USDOL Meeting\n\n       We raised the concern with USDOL that by sending all its \n     relief monies to the State Work Force Investment Boards the \n     relief does not get to the farmworker community or the \n     organizations that serve them. We also made note that USDOL \n     contracting with privately owned personnel agencies that have \n     no previous experience providing job referrals to \n     farmworkers. Furthermore, we made mention that the government \n     and relief agencies bypassed the USDOL WIA 176 NFJP \n     farmworker job training grantees in Alabama and Mississippi \n     that had a combined 40 years experience serving local migrant \n     and seasonal populations. Don Green submitted a proposal to \n     USDOL for $80,000 to hire 3 Spanish speaking outreach workers \n     to assist the farmworkers victims. USDOL is to get back with \n     him on that request. We also requested USDOL for funding to \n     create a training program for operating an emergency relief \n     warehouse and distribution center. Training would include \n     forklift operations, CDL truck drivers, warehouse management, \n     inventory, receiving and distribution, accounting, computer, \n     and English classes.\n\n\n                              HUD Meeting\n\n       Meeting took place in the office of the Deputy HUD \n     Secretary Roy A. Bernardi, whom we presented the need for \n     acquiring the $850,000 needed to purchase and renovate the \n     Clarksdale facility. Our Katrina/Rita Relief Report was also \n     presented and we requested that Secretary Jackson take this \n     report to his briefing at the White House later in the day.\n\n\n                              USDA Meeting\n\n       Met with Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Charles F. Conner \n     and his assistant Annabelle J. Romero and also presented the \n     need to provide funding to obtain the Clarksdale Relief \n     Facility. We also presented to the Civil Rights Deputy \n     Assistant and presented the civil rights and blatant abuses \n     of farmworkers in Baldwin County, Alabama.\n\n\n                       US Department of Commerce\n\n       We met with Secretary Gutierrez and presented him the \n     Katrina/Rita Report. He was most interested and indicated \n     that we would contact HUD and USDA and see how the 3 agencies \n     could be of assistance in obtaining the Clarksdale Facility.\n\n\n                Direction of Office Personal Management\n\n       We met with Director Carol Springer and staff regarding \n     Spanish media outlets to get the word out to farmworkers \n     during emergencies. Also, requested her to talk to FEMA and \n     other governmental agencies about the need for hiring and \n     training Spanish speaking workers to interface with \n     farmworkers and others in the workforce.\n\n\n                            On Capitol Hill\n\n       We were able to also present our Katrina/Rita Relief \n     Reports to Arizona Congressman Raul Grijalva, Senator John \n     McCain, and Ken Salazar (Col) directly. We also spoke to the \n     staff of Senator Mike Enzi (WY); Senator Lieberman of \n     Connecticut, Senator McCain took special interest in the \n     report because of family roots in Mississippi.\n\n\n                                 LULAC\n\n       Don Green and I were recognized at the LULAC luncheon, and \n     allowed to give our profound thanks for the $10,400 LULAC \n     contributed for trucking of relief supplies from Tucson to \n     Clarksdale, Mississippi. Don Green received the LULAC \n     Presidential Citation Award by President Hector Flores for \n     the job he and his agency had done to help farmworkers in \n     Mississippi.\n       That evening Leticia Aragon, President of LULAC Council \n     1091 of San Luis, Arizona, presented Don Green a check for \n     $1,075 which was collected by the farmworkers adult and youth \n     from her hometown to help fellow farmworkers in Mississippi. \n     Eight farmworker youth who were attending the National LULAC \n     Leadership Conference in D.C. joined in the presentation. On \n     Saturday, I officially presented the Katrina/Rita Relief \n     report to the LULAC National Board meeting and thanked them \n     for their generous support both financially and other support \n     including opening doors to the government agencies to hear \n     our case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/02/senate-section/article/S12234-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HONORING WERNER FORNOS\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I would like to honor \nWerner Fornos, who is retiring after 23 years as president of the \nPopulation Institute. Across his long and productive career, Werner has \nworked tirelessly to improve the lives of Marylanders and people around \nthe world.\n  Werner has been a dedicated public servant. He and I served together \nin the Maryland House of Delegates from 1966-1970. As a delegate he \nfought many important legislative battles--to protect the State's \nnatural resources, to strengthen civil rights and to ensure open \ngovernment. He served as Maryland's Manpower Administrator and as \nAssistant Secretary of Human Resources. At the Federal level he served \nas Special Assistant to the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Labor for \nlabor-management relations and Deputy Assistant Manpower Administrator.\n  Over the past three decades, Werner broadened his focus to the \ninternational arena, fighting to expand access to voluntary and \naffordable family planning information, education, and services to \ncouples across the globe. He has spoken to college and university \naudiences and service and community organizations in all 50 States and \nhas addressed virtually every major international population and \ndevelopment conference. He has written numerous opinion articles for \nnewspapers and magazines worldwide, and is the author of the book, \n``Gaining People, Losing Ground.''\n  His numerous awards and honors include the Humanist of the Year Award \nof the American Humanist Association; the University of Maryland \nUniversity College Alumnus of the Year Award; Germany's Order of Merit, \nthe highest distinction granted by the German Government; Rotary \nInternational's 2005 Service Above Self Award; and the 2003 United \nNations Population Award.\n  Werner Fornos' efforts for more than a quarter of a century have \naimed to provide a better quality of life for people everywhere.

Mr. President, I proudly rise today to recognize \nMr. Sam Moore for his outstanding contribution to Kentucky Agriculture.\n  Mr. Moore has served as president of the Kentucky Farm Bureau \nFederation since December 1998 following 7 years of service as first \nvice president. He has been a member of the Kentucky Farm Bureau \nFederation board of directors since 1975 and is a distinguished member \nof the American Farm bureau board of directors. Mr. Moore, a Butler \nCounty native and father of six has been an active member of Kentucky's \nagricultural community all his life. In 1973, Mr. Moore was selected an \noutstanding young farmer by the Kentucky Jaycees, and the following \nyear he won a similar designation from the Kentucky Farm Bureau. As \nKentucky's representative in the 1974 national young farmer \ncompetition, he received a special citation as one of the top entrants. \nIn 2003, he was selected as Man of the Year in Kentucky Agriculture by \nProgressive Farmer Magazine.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Moore has announced he will retire after 30 years \nof outstanding service to the Kentucky Farm Bureau.

Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge an \nimportant milestone in my home State. I am pleased to join with the \nmore than 1150 families who are members of Indianapolis Hebrew \nCongregation as they commemorate their year long sesquicentennial \ncelebration.\n  On November 2, 1856, fourteen Jewish men in Indianapolis signed the \nconstitution and by-laws to create Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation, \nthe first Jewish congregation in the growing city of Indianapolis. IHC, \nthe largest congregation in Indiana, has played an important role as \nthe spiritual home of the Jewish community in Central Indiana.\n  I strongly believe that a religious community cannot thrive without \nthe active participation of its members. Indianapolis Hebrew \nCongregation's long and distinguished history of significance in the \nIndianapolis community is the result of members' hard work, dedication, \nand enthusiasm for their congregation. This celebration provides a \nspecial opportunity to recognize the many members who have put forth \ntheir time and energy to serve the congregation throughout the last 150 \nyears.\n  I would like to extend to Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation my own \npersonal mazel tov on celebrating this simcha. I am hopeful they will \ncontinue to celebrate many more years of fellowship and service in the \nIndianapolis community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/02/senate-section/article/S12235-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMERICAN LEGION AUXILIARY POST 62\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to help \nindividuals with functional impairments and their families pay for \nservices and supports that they need to maximize their functionality \nand independence and have choices about community participation, \neducation, and employment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join Senator DeWine \nin introducing this bipartisan legislation to build on the promise and \npossibilities of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  Our bill, the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act--\nthe CLASS Act--will help large numbers of Americans who struggle \neveryday to live productive lives in their communities.\n  Too many Americans are perfectly capable of living a life in the \ncommunity, but are denied the supports they need.\n  They languish in needless circumstances with no choice about how or \nwhere to obtain these services.\n  Too often, they have to give up the American Dream the dignity of a \njob, a home, and a family--so they can qualify for Medicaid, the only \nprogram that will support them.\n  The bill we propose is a long overdue effort to offer greater \ndignity, greater hope, and greater opportunity.\n  It makes a simple pact with all Americans--``If you work hard and \ncontribute, society will take care of you when you fall on hard \ntimes.''\n  The concept is clear--everyone can contribute and everyone can win. \nWe all benefit when no one is left behind.\n  For only $30 a month, a person who pays into the program will receive \neither $50 or $100 a day, based on their ability to carry out basic \ndaily activities.\n  They themselves will decide how this assistance will be spent--on \ntransportation so they can stay employed, or on a ramp to make their \nhome more accessible, or to cover the cost of a personal care attendant \nor a family caregiver.\n  It will help keep families together--instead of being torn apart by \nobstacles that discourage them from staying at home.\n  The bill will strengthen job opportunities for people with \ndisabilities at a time when 70 percent are unemployed. They have so \nmuch to contribute and the bill will help them do it.\n  It will save on the mushrooming health care costs for Medicaid, the \nNation's primary insurer of long-term care services, which also forces \nbeneficiaries to give up their jobs and live in poverty before they \nbecome eligible for assistance.\n  The CLASS Act is a hopeful new approach to restoring independence and \nchoice for millions of these persons and enabling them to take greater \ncontrol of their lives.\n  It's time to respect the rights and dignity of all Americans, and I \nlook forward to working with Senator DeWine and other colleagues to see \nthis bill enacted into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the CLASS Act legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Summary of the DeWine-Kennedy CLASS Act of 2005--(Community Living \n                 Assistance Services and Supports Act)\n\n\n                          Purpose of the Bill\n\n       To help adults with severe functional impairments obtain \n     the services and supports they need to stay functional and \n     independent, while providing them with choices about \n     community participation, education and employment.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Currently there are 10 million Americans in need of long \n     term services and supports, and the number is expected to \n     increase to near 15 million by 2020.\n       Most private-sector disability or long-term care insurance \n     plans are constrained in the insurance protection they can \n     offer at an affordable price, and neither Supplemental \n     Security Insurance (SSI) nor Old, Age, Survivors, and \n     Disability Insurance (OASDI) programs have any benefit \n     differentials related to the extent and character of the \n     disability.\n       Thus, most Americans who have or develop severe functional \n     impairments can only access coverage for the services \n     critical to their independence (such as housing \n     modifications, assistive technologies, transportation, and \n     personal assistance services), through Medicaid. Their \n     reliance on Medicaid for critical support services creates a \n     strong incentive for them to ``spend down'' assets and remain \n     poor and unemployed. With Medicaid paying 50 percent of the \n     costs of long term services, increased expenditures on long \n     term services are expected to add $44 billion annually to the \n     cost of Medicaid over the next decade.\n\n\n                      Overview of the Legislation\n\n       The CLASS Act will offer an alternative path. It will \n     create a new national insurance\n\n[[Page S12240]]\n\n     program to help adults who have or develop functional \n     impairments to remain independent, employed, and stay a part \n     of their community.\n       Financed through voluntary payroll deductions of $30.00 per \n     month, without enrollment like Medicare Part B, this \n     legislation will help remove barriers to independence and \n     choice, e.g., housing modification, assistive technologies, \n     personal assistance services, transportation, that can be \n     overwhelmingly costly, by providing a cash benefit to those \n     individuals who are unable to perform 2 or more functional \n     activities of daily living.\n       The large risk pool to be created by this program approach \n     will make added coverage much more affordable than it is \n     currently, thereby reducing the incentives for people with \n     severe impairments to ``spend down'' to Medicaid. It will \n     give individuals added choice and access to supports without \n     requiring them to become impoverished to qualify.\n       The CLASS Act is an important step in the evolution of \n     public policy toward a new focus on helping individuals \n     overcome barriers to independence that they may confront due \n     to severe functional impairments. It is an important \n     extension of concepts embodied in the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and Ticket to Work and Work \n     Incentives Improvement Act of 1999.\n\n\n                         Specifics of the bill\n\n     Scope\n       The CLASS Act will establish a national insurance program, \n     financed by voluntary premium payments to be collected \n     through payroll withholding and placed in a ``National \n     Independence Fund.'' The Department of Health and Human \n     Services will manage the Fund as a new insurance program, and \n     may enter into contractual agreements with those entities \n     that states direct to assume administrative/program \n     implementation roles.\n     Enrollment in the Program\n       Any individual who is at least 18 years old and actively \n     working will be automatically enrolled, unless they opt out, \n     and pay their premiums through payroll deduction or another \n     alternative method. Any non-working spouse may enroll in the \n     program and pay their premiums through an alternative payment \n     procedure.\n     Triggering the Benefit\n       To qualify for CLASS Act benefits, individuals must be at \n     least 18 years old and have contributed to the program during \n     at least 5 years. Eligibility for benefits will be determined \n     by state disability determination centers and will be limited \n     to: 1. individuals who are unable to perform two or more \n     activities of daily living (ADL) e.g. eating, bathing, \n     dressing, or 2. individuals who have an equivalent cognitive \n     disability that requires supervision or hands-on assistance \n     to perform those activities, e.g. traumatic brain injury, \n     Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, mental retardation.\n     Benefits\n       To account for differences in independence support needs, \n     there will be two cash benefit tiers.\n       Tier 1 benefits $50/day, will be payable to eligible \n     individuals who are unable to perform 2 or more ADLs or have \n     the equivalent cognitive impairment.\n       Tier 2 benefits $100/day, will be payable to individuals \n     who are unable to perform 4 or ore ADL's or have the \n     equivalent cognitive impairment.\n       The monthly case benefit will be posted monthly to a debit \n     account or a ``Choice Account''. Individuals who do not use \n     the full monthly amount may roll it over from month to month, \n     but not year to year.\n       However, once an individual becomes ineligible for CLASS \n     benefits (by improvement in functional status or death), \n     CLASS Act benefits will cease. Any residual balance of \n     available services remaining on the individual's account will \n     not be payable. If an eligible individual does choose to move \n     into an institutional facility, CLASS Act benefits will be \n     used to defray those associated expenses.\n     Relationship of CLASS Act Insurance Program to Social \n         Security Disability Insurance\n       Eligibility for CLASS Act benefits will be independent of \n     whether or not an individual is eligible for SSDI, so \n     participation in the CLASS Act insurance program will not \n     impair an individual's ability to remain qualified for SSDI.\n     Relationship of CLASS Act Insurance Program to Social \n         Security Retirement Benefits\n       Similarly, eligibility for CLASS Act benefits will be \n     independent of retirement benefits eligibility.\n     Relationship to Medicaid\n       If an individual is eligible for CLASS Act benefits, and \n     are also eligible for the long term care benefit under \n     Medicaid, CLASS Act benefits can be used to offset the costs \n     to Medicaid, thus producing Medicaid savings for the state.\n     Relationship to Private Long Term Care Insurance\n       The ``Class'' program benefit does not replace the need for \n     basic health insurance--it provides a mechanism to pay for \n     those non-medical expenses that allow a disabled person to \n     remain independent,\n       The ``Class'' program benefit can be an addition to long \n     term care insurance. It provides a consistent, basic cash \n     benefit to glove with the insurance products that provide \n     more intense medical services over a shorter period of time.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kennedy today \nin introducing the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports \nAct--or the CLASS Act.\n  Unfortunately, most Americans are not prepared for the costs of long-\nterm services and supports when they arise. High premiums have \ndiscouraged many Americans from purchasing long-term care insurance in \nthe private market. Furthermore, underwriting practices have excluded \nindividuals with existing disabilities from purchasing plans.\n  Right now, 10 million people suffer from severe functional \nimpairments and by 2020 that number will have increased to 15 million. \nTherefore, in the next 15 years, we will experience a 50 percent growth \nin the number of persons with severe functional impairments. Some of \nthose people will be struck suddenly--through accidents or sudden \nillness. And the reality is that any one of us here today could face \nsudden impairment and disability. We won't see it coming until it \nhappens, and most of us will not be prepared to provide for necessary, \nlong-term care needs.\n  Some people may end up with a degenerative disease, such as \nParkinson's disease, which leads to increased impairments. They may \nknow now what their needs will be, but are unable to purchase private \ninsurance due to this pre-existing condition. Others will age and \ndevelop other physical or cognitive impairments, such as Alzheimer's \ndisease.\n  Although we know that age is inevitable, we are not properly \npreparing for this eventuality or the possibility of sudden accidents \nand many people are financially unable to purchase available insurance \ndue to the high price. However, the fact remains that millions of \nAmericans will need the services that the CLASS Act seeks to provide.\n  The CLASS Act will help Americans to remain independent in their \ncommunities by creating a new long-term care insurance program. This \nprogram will be available to all working Americans above the age of 18. \nFor only $30 per individual each month, and a minimum of 20 quarters of \npayments, the CLASS Act will help those who do not have adequate long-\nterm care insurance due to cost or current disability. This bill will \nallow people to choose the supports they need when and if they become \nseverely impaired. It will help them remain independent. It will help \nthem remain in their communities. It will help them remain with their \nfamilies.\n  This is a good bill. I thank Senator Kennedy for his work on this \nbill, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. \n        Lugar):\n  S. 1952. A bill to provide grants for rural health information \ntechnology development activities; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, as United States Senators, we are well \naware of the rising cost of health care and the difficulty of health \ncare access in rural areas. Through the improvement of health \ninformation technology, we will see overall productivity and quality \nimprovements to our health care system. New technologies make the \nsystem more efficient and effective by diagnosing diseases sooner, \nproviding preventive and ongoing managed care.\n  Today, I am proud to be joined by my friends, Senators Bayh, Cornyn, \nand Lugar, in introducing the Critical Access to Health Information \nTechnology Act to help Critical Access Hospitals compete for health \ninformation technology grants.\n  Our legislation would give smaller rural health hospitals a \ncompetitive edge for health information technology grants. A health \nsystem technology infrastructure should be encouraged and facilitated \nas broadly and rapidly as possible to help reduce medical errors, \nimprove quality of care and reduce rising health care costs.\n  A recent American Hospitals Association study shows that while 9 out \nof 10 hospitals are using or considering using health information \ntechnology\n\n[[Page S12241]]\n\nfor clinical uses, most cite cost as a major impediment to broader \nadoption, especially for small or rural hospitals. The study suggests \nthat the use of health information technology in caring for patients is \nevolving as hospitals adopt specific technologies based on their needs \nand priorities, size and financial resources.\n  The Critical Access to Health Information Technology Act creates a \ngrant program administered by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices in conjunction with State agencies for improving health \ninformation technology in our Nation's rural areas. In addition, this \nlegislation supports the next generation of coding system, ICD-10, that \nwill modernize and expand Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' \ncapacity to keep pace with changes in medical practice and technology. \nICD-10 was developed as an improvement to ICD-9 which has not been \nupdated since 1980. The adoption of ICD-10 will allow for far more \naccurate, detailed and descriptive coding, and will allow the system to \nadapt as future changes are warranted. The transition to ICD-10 is \ntime-sensitive, as the number of available ICD-9 codes is rapidly \ndwindling.\n  Earlier this Congress, I, along with Senator Pryor, introduced the \nbipartisan ``Rural Renaissance II Act.'' This is a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation, based on earlier legislation introduced last year, which \nwould establish a private-public partnership to provide bonds that will \nfinance grants that will fund key rural development projects to address \ncritical rural infrastructure problems. I am pleased that Chairman \nGrassley has agreed to include our Rural Renaissance Act II in his tax \nreconciliation package later this year.\n  These bonds will be made available to small rural communities of \n50,000 or fewer for: water and waste facilities, affordable housing, \ncommunity facilities, including hospitals, fire and police stations, \nand nursing and assisted living facilities, farmer-owned value-added \nagriculture or renewable energy projects, including ethanol, biodiesel \nand wind, distance learning and telemedicine and high speed internet \naccess and rural teleworks projects.\n  I urge my fellow colleagues to join me in ensuring Critical Access \nHospitals have the opportunity to keep pace with health information \ntechnology by supporting the Critical Access to Health Information \nTechnology Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1952\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title I of the Employee Retirement Security \nAct of 1974 and the Public Health Service Act to expand health care \naccess and reduce costs through the creation of small business health \nplans and through modernization of the health insurance marketplace; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, together with Senator Nelson of Nebraska and \nSenator Burns, I am pleased today to introduce ``The Health Insurance \nMarketplace Modernization and Affordability Act of 2005.'' This is a \nbipartisan effort aimed at relieving the worsening crisis of cost and \ncoverage in America's health insurance system.\n  As I speak today, we are nearing almost five years of double-digit \ngrowth in health insurance premiums--increases that have repeatedly \nexceeded more than five times the rate of inflation. Since 2000, for \nexample, group premiums for family coverage have grown nearly 60 \npercent, compared to an underlying inflation rate of 9.7 percent over \nthe same period.\n  Those hardest hit are America's small businesses and those \nindividuals outside of employer-provided insurance. These are the ones \nwith the least market leverage and the weakest ability to pool risk. \nAlready, among the very smallest of our businesses, those with fewer \nthan 10 employees, only 52 percent offer coverage to their employees.\n  As a former small business owner, I understand the difficulties these \nemployers face when trying to provide health insurance for their \nemployees.\n  A constituent of mine, Mitchell Blake of Jackson, WY recently told me \nhis story, and it illustrates what is happening to thousands of small \nbusinesses across America. Mr. Blake owns a small architecture firm \nwith eight employees. He believes, like so many small business owners \nacross America, that providing insurance for his employees not only \npromotes a healthy workforce but is simply the right thing to do.\n  In the nine years since his firm opened, the deductibles for \nemployees' health insurance quadrupled, co-pays rose by more than 35 \npercent, and monthly premiums grew by 20 percent. Since 2001, the \ncompany's profits have dropped by nearly one-third, due in large part \nto providing health insurance coverage.\n  I am realistic. The biggest drivers of health care costs are ones \nthat defy short-term solutions. These include advances in costly \nmedical treatments, Americans' continuing appetite for such treatments, \nlack of transparency in pricing, and an outdated third-party payment \nsystem that insulates consumers from seeing the true cost of care they \nreceive. Addressing these deep problems in a fundamental way will \nrequire years of effort and a great deal of political will.\n\n  And yet, like most members in this body, I am hearing an ever-growing\n\n[[Page S12243]]\n\nchorus of concern from my constituents about health insurance--and most \nespecially from small businesses.\n  America's families and small businesses don't want us to wait for the \nperfect solution or the perfect moment. They need real help, and they \nneed it now.\n  Recognizing this increasing concern, and as the new Chairman of the \nSenate's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, I have made \nit a priority in recent months to seek the counsel of stakeholders, \ncitizens, experts, and fellow members of Congress on how we might come \ntogether on a package of health insurance reforms we can realistically \nhope to enact in this Congress.\n  The most well known proposal now on the table is the approach known \nas association health plans, or AHPs. Under this proposal, which was \nintroduced in this Congress by Senators Snowe and Talent, qualifying \ntrade associations would be permitted to band together their members \nfor purposes of offering health coverage.\n  Association health plans hold significant promise--particularly in \nthe pooling of risk, economies of scale, and market clout they could \nlend to thousands of small businesses.\n  At the same time, however, the AHP bills in their current form may \nalso go too far in allowing some association plans to play by a \nseparate set of rules than those governing the rest of the small group \ninsurance marketplace--thereby tempting adverse selection and market \ndisruption. Another concern is the fact that the current AHP proposals \nwould shift primary oversight over many association plans away from the \nstates and move it to the federal government.\n  Regrettably, debate over these AHP pros and cons has hardened into a \npolitical and stakeholder stalemate--a stalemate that has helped block \nconstructive action on new health insurance reform for nearly a decade.\n  It is time we broke this logjam and moved forward.\n  Toward this end, I sincerely appreciate the hard work of Senators \nSnowe and Talent and other AHP proponents in working with me on \npossible compromise approaches. And similarly, I am encouraged by what \nappears to be a growing pragmatic spirit among traditional AHP critics.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is a compromise approach.\n  This legislation blends a modified version of the current Snowe/\nTalent AHP legislation with several additional reform initiatives \napplicable not just to association plans, but also to the wider health \ninsurance marketplace.\n  It is built around several fundamental principles, including: 1. \ngiving associations a meaningful role, but on a level playing field; 2. \nstreamlining the current hodgepodge of varying State regulation; 3. \npreserving the primary role of the States in health insurance oversight \nand consumer protection; 4. making lower-cost health plan options \navailable; and 5. achieving meaningful reform without a big price tag \nthat could cloud prospects for passage.\n  With regard to association-based health plans, this bill preserves \nmost of what is known as the ``fully insured'' component of the current \nAHP bill. That is, like the current AHP bill, my legislation would \nallow associations to independently pool their members for purposes of \nbuying health coverage, thereby giving them needed strength in numbers \nand bargaining power.\n  Unlike the current AHP bill, however, this legislation does not \ninclude the much more controversial option for associations to self-\ninsure. Primary regulatory oversight of coverage issued to associations \nwould remain at the state level and would not be transferred to Federal \ncontrol. Although far from perfect, our state insurance commissions are \nmuch closer to the real problems confronted by purchasers of insurance \nin their communities than would be a Federal agency in Washington.\n  Like the current AHP bill, this legislation would enable associations \nto take advantage of more streamlined rules in the areas of benefit \ndesign and rating. In an important departure from the current AHP bill, \nhowever, this greater streamlining would be made available not just to \nassociations, but also to other purchasers of insurance. This \nadjustment will go a long way toward easing critics' fears that the \ncurrent AHP bill would create an unlevel playing field and market \ndisruption.\n  In short, association-based plans should have the opportunity to \nharness the advantage of independent pooling and play a commercially \nmeaningful role in the coverage marketplace. However, the coverage \noffered to association members should be subject to underlying \nregulatory and consumer protection requirements substantially \ncomparable to those applicable to other entities offering similar \ncoverage.\n  In addition to addressing coverage offered through associations, the \nlegislation we are introducing today also makes several very important \nimprovements in the health insurance marketplace as a whole.\n  For example, this legislation would permit issuers of coverage, both \nto associations and others, to offer lower-cost health plans free from \nsome, though not all, of the current state benefit mandates that have \nproliferated over the past decade.\n  Under this bill, those mandates that are currently in place in at \nleast 45 States would continue in effect, but carriers would be \npermitted to offer plans that do not include other mandated benefits. \nThe intent of this provision is not only to enable the offering of more \naffordable plan options, but also to make it easier for carriers to \noffer coverage on a multi-state basis and in more markets.\n  This legislation would also set in motion a process to create greater \nharmonization in the current costly and competition-inhibiting \nhodgepodge of varying State health insurance regulation.\n  However, even as it moves the system to greater uniformity in the \nrules applied, this approach would also carefully retain the current \nstructure of State-based oversight and administration of insurance.\n  This harmonization approach is patterned in general terms after the \nprocess used in the early 1990s to achieve greater stability in the \nMedicare supplemental, Medigap, market.\n  The bill would establish a harmonization commission under the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to develop harmonized standards \nfor health insurance regulation. The commission would work in close \nconsultation with the NAIC and the States, and would consist of members \nrepresenting a full range of perspectives and stakeholders.\n  Upon issuance of model standards by the commission and their \ncertification by the Secretary, the States would have two years to \nadopt them. If a state did not adopt the standards within the required \ntimeframe, an insurer, following certain certification requirements, \nwould be permitted to sell insurance in that State following the \nharmonized Federal rules.\n  I want to take a moment to thank Senator Gregg, my predecessor as \nchairman of the HELP Committee. It is due in no small part to his \nefforts in the last Congress that health insurance market harmonization \nhas matured in the policy community as a needed and valuable step. I \nlook forward to working with him to make this and other aspects of this \nlegislation as effective as it can possibly be.\n\n  It is important to note that responsibility for oversight and \nmanagement of the insurance market would remain with the States. What \nwould change is that the rules being applied would become more uniform \nacross State lines. This will enable a wider range of plans to be \noffered, because the offering of insurance on a multi-State basis will \nbecome easier. Competition will improve and costs will go down as more \nplans enter more markets.\n  This bill reflects and incorporates much thoughtful input from those \non many sides of this difficult issue. Such input continues even as I \nspeak. Indeed, there are a number of important issues that remain to be \nworked on as we proceed with consideration of this bill.\n  For example, we will be continuing discussions on how to smoothe the \ninteraction between association-based plans and the individual \ninsurance market. Similarly, work remains to be done in the calibration \nof transition rules, including with respect to the handling of older \nblocks of business vis a vis new plan options that will arise under the \nnew system. Another issue deserving of further attention is the \nhandling of the way carriers can become licensed in multiple States, \nand\n\n[[Page S12244]]\n\nopportunities for making this process as smooth as possible while \nmaintaining the authority of State insurance commissioners.\n  I am open to suggestions, and I am open to compromise--but I am not \nopen to continued inaction.\n  My intention is for this bill to serve as a foundation for the swift \nfinalization and passage of a health insurance reform package that will \ndeliver real relief to America's small businesses and struggling \nfamilies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the legislation and the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Summary: Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability \n                              Act of 2005\n\n       The intent of the Health Insurance Marketplace \n     Modernization and Affordability Act of 2005 is to reduce \n     costs and improve access in the health insurance marketplace, \n     principally though not exclusively in the small group market.\n       This legislation addresses these goals by blending a \n     modified version of the current AHP legislation--S. 406, \n     introduced by Senators Snowe and Talent with several \n     additional reform initiatives applicable not just to \n     association plans but also to the wider marketplace.\n       The fundamental principle include: 1. giving associations a \n     meaningful role, but on a level playing field; 2. \n     streamlining the current hodgepodge of varying state \n     regulations; 3. preserving a strong state role in insurance \n     oversight and consumer protection; 4. making lower-cost \n     health plan options available; 5. achieving meaningful reform \n     without a big price tag clouding prospects for passage.\n       Title I, regarding Small Business Health Plans (SBHPs), \n     resembles the ``fully insured'' component of the S. 406, but \n     does not include that bill's more controversial provisions \n     permitting association plans to self-insure. Associations \n     will be permitted to pool independently from the underlying \n     small group market.\n       SBHPs may offer coverage free from many but not all benefit \n     mandates, which reflects a different approach but similar \n     intent to that included in S. 406. If a benefit mandate is in \n     place in at least 45 states, an SBHP must follow it, but it \n     may opt out of other mandated benefits. This approach \n     preserves the most widely agreed-upon mandates, but achieves \n     the goal of giving multi-state associations the uniformity \n     they need to operate effectively across State lines.\n       Associations wishing to establish an SBHP will follow rules \n     very similar to those for AHPs under S. 406, the bill \n     introduced by Senators Snowe and Talent. An SBHP must: 1. be \n     established for purposes other than health coverage; 2. have \n     been in existence for at least 3 years; 3. do not condition \n     association membership or coverage on health status; 4. \n     obtain Federal certification; 5. be governed by a board of \n     directors with complete fiscal control.\n       This bill also retains primary oversight and supervision of \n     insurance coverage at the State level, and does not shift it \n     to Federal oversight, as parts of S. 406 would require.\n       Title II, the Near-Term Market Relief section, provides for \n     certain near-term changes in insurance regulation aimed at \n     reducing costs and expanding access. Ultimately, some of \n     these provisions will be superseded by the wider regulatory \n     harmonization process provided in Title III. These provisions \n     will apply not just to association plans (SBHPs) but also to \n     policies sold to others.\n       Rating Relief: The first section of Title II deals with \n     rating relief. Under Title II, The National Association of \n     Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) model rules regarding rating, \n     the amount that premiums can vary from an insurer's base \n     rate, or average, that are now in effect in nearly half the \n     states would become the interim standard for rating. \n     Currently these NAIC rating rules are in effect in 24 states, \n     and about a dozen others are very close. The NAIC rules \n     require that premiums charged when the policy is issued \n     cannot vary more than +/- 25 percent from the base rate, and \n     +/- 15 percent upon renewal.\n       Insurers licensed in a given state will be permitted to use \n     the NAIC standard even if State law differs. A graduated \n     transition process will apply for States that currently have \n     rating bands significantly different from the NAIC model.\n       Lower-Cost Plan Options: The intent of the second provision \n     of Title II is to permit lower-cost plans to be offered that \n     are free from many of the current benefit mandates. Mirroring \n     the approach applied to benefit mandates for SBHPs in Title \n     I, if a benefit mandate is mandated in at least 45 States, an \n     insurer must offer it, but it may opt out of other mandated \n     benefits provided that the exercise of such opt-out is fully \n     disclosed in the policy. This approach preserves the most \n     widely agreed-upon mandates, but allows for greater \n     flexibility in the offering of more affordable coverage \n     options.\n       Title II, which addresses regulatory harmonization, \n     establishes a process intended to create greater uniformity \n     in the current costly and competition-inhibiting hodgepodge \n     of varying state health insurance regulation. However, even \n     as this moves the system to greater uniformity in rules \n     applied, it also carefully retains the current structure of \n     State-based oversight and administration of insurance.\n       This approach is patterned in general terms after the \n     process used in the early 1990s to achieve greater stability \n     in the Medicare supplemental, Medigap, market.\n       To achieve uniformity, this legislation establishes a \n     harmonization commission under HHS to develop uniform \n     standards for insurance regulation. The commission will work \n     in close consultation with the NAIC and the States, and will \n     consist of members representing: 1. State insurance \n     regulators; 2. insurers; 3. business/employer \n     representatives; 4. consumer advocates; 5. agents; 6. \n     providers; 7. high risk pool administrators; and 8. \n     actuaries.\n       The commission will address these areas of insurance \n     regulation: 1. rating; 2. consumer protections; and 3. access \n     to coverage, such as standards regarding issuance and \n     renewability.\n       Upon issuance of model standards by the commission and \n     their certification by the Secretary, the States will have \n     two years to adopt them. If a State fails to adopt the \n     standards within the required timeframe, an insurer, \n     following certain certification requirements, will be \n     permitted to sell insurance in that State following the \n     harmonized Federal rules, rather than that State's rules.\n       Responsibility for oversight and management of the \n     insurance market will remain with the States. What changes is \n     that the rules being applied will become more uniform across \n     State lines, thereby achieving a number of advantages, \n     including: 1. a wider range of plans offered, because \n     offering insurance on a multi-state basis will become easier; \n     2. improved competition and reduced costs as more plans enter \n     more markets; and 3. reduced administrative costs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1955\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       ``There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may \n     be necessary to carry out this subtitle.''.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ngood friend, Chairman Mike Enzi, in introducing the Health Insurance \nMarketplace Modernization and Affordability Act. This legislation will \nhelp bring much-needed relief to small businesses who are struggling to \nafford health insurance coverage for their employees.\n  The affordability of health insurance coverage is a major problem \nfacing America's businesses and consumers. According to the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation, health insurance premiums for businesses rose 9.2 \npercent last year. While health care cost increases have subsided \nsomewhat, premium increases for last year alone were more than 3 times \nthe growth in workers' wages and two-and-a-half times the rate of \ninflation.\n  This legislation helps address the problem of rising health care \ncosts. By providing small businesses with more ability to pool and by \nharmonizing and streamlining insurance regulations, this bill will help \nreduce the cost of coverage for small businesses. By lowering costs, \nthis bill holds promise in reducing the number of working Americans who \nlack health insurance coverage. Our legislation will help reduce costs \nin a balanced and carefully targeted manner while avoiding some of the \nproblems that other proposals have raised.\n  In contrast to other proposals, such as Association Health Plans \n(AHP), our bill retains State-based regulation and oversight. State-\nbased oversight and enforcement is critical to protecting consumers. \nUnlike other AHP bills, associations cannot self insure and be outside \nof State oversight. As a former insurance director, this issue is \ncritical for my support.\n  Moreover, the bill maintains a level playing field in the health \ninsurance marketplace by avoiding harmful provisions that would have \nled to rampant ``cherry-picking'' and adverse selection problems. The \nbill does not allow association health plans to abide by less \ncomprehensive rules and under minimal oversight by the U.S. Department \nof Labor--which would allow these plans to attract only young and \nhealthy groups while increasing costs for the vast majority of small \nbusinesses and their workers.\n  I applaud the effort of Senator Enzi and his talented staff and am \npleased to introduce the bill. However, I also recognize that is not a \nperfect solution; nor is it a panacea for all the problems facing our \nhealth care system.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Enzi to assure that the bill \npreserves comprehensive and high-quality benefits while, at the same \ntime, allowing small businesses to have access to affordable coverage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/02/senate-section/article/S12251-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12251-S12252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 294--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE \n RETENTION OF THE FEDERAL TAX DEDUCTION FOR STATE AND LOCAL TAXES PAID\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Clinton, \nMr. Corzine, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Feinstein, \nMr. Dodd, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Obama, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kohl, and \nMs. Stabenow) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S. Res. 294\n\n       Whereas no American should be unnecessarily or excessively \n     burdened with additional taxes;\n       Whereas the Federal income tax has grown more complicated \n     and unmanageable over time, imposing burdensome \n     administrative and compliance costs on American taxpayers;\n       Whereas on January 7, 2005, President George W. Bush \n     created the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform \n     (the ``Panel'') via Executive Order 13369;\n       Whereas the Panel was tasked with providing several options \n     for Federal tax reform that would simplify Federal tax laws, \n     retain progressivity, and promote long-run economic growth \n     and job creation;\n       Whereas in its final report, released publicly on November \n     1, 2005, the Panel recommended the complete repeal of the \n     Federal deduction for State and local taxes, as a central \n     component of both the ``Simplified Income Tax Plan'' and the \n     ``Growth and Investment Tax Plan'';\n       Whereas State and local taxes have been deductible from the \n     Federal income tax since the inception of the Federal income \n     tax in 1913;\n       Whereas eliminating the deduction for State and local taxes \n     would create a new form of double taxation at a time where \n     efforts are being made to reduce other forms of double \n     taxation, since repeal would require millions of taxpayers to \n     pay Federal taxes on income that is also taxed at the State \n     or local level;\n       Whereas Congress has recently taken steps to expand, rather \n     than cut back, the State\n\n[[Page S12252]]\n\n     and local tax deduction, by reinstating a deduction for State \n     sales taxes for some taxpayers (previously repealed as part \n     of the Tax Reform Act of 1986), as part of the American Jobs \n     Creation Act of 2004;\n       Whereas there is some concern, as noted by the nonpartisan \n     Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, that eliminating the \n     deduction could ``lower support for public services and lead \n     to a `race to the bottom' in terms of State and local \n     expenditures as States compete to have the lowest taxes in \n     order to attract higher-income households'';\n       Whereas the deduction for State and local taxes is not just \n     a concern for a small minority of taxpayers in the largest \n     States, as 22 States saw more than one-third of their \n     taxpayers take the deduction in 2003, the latest year for \n     which data is available (Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut, \n     Colorado, Oregon, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Virginia, Utah, \n     California, Georgia, New York, Wisconsin, Arizona, Rhode \n     Island, Michigan, Delaware, North Carolina, Illinois, New \n     Hampshire, Nevada, and Idaho (ranked in order of the \n     percentage of taxpayers affected));\n       Whereas in tax year 2003, 43,538,000 taxpayers in the \n     United States took advantage of the Federal deduction for \n     State and local taxes, deducting a total of $315,690,000,000, \n     thereby saving taxpayers in the United States approximately \n     $88,390,000,000 in Federal income taxes, assuming an average \n     marginal rate of 28 percent for taxpayers who itemize; and\n       Whereas in tax year 2003, the top 25 States ranked by the \n     number of taxpayers affected represented 77 percent of the \n     taxpayers affected nationally, and took 85 percent of the \n     total deductions for State and local

Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Obama, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \nKerry, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. \nSalazar) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nbill S. 1932, to provide for reconciliation pursuant to section 202(a) \nof the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. \nCon. Res. 95); which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On October 26, 2005, the Committee on Ways and Means of \n     the United States House of Representatives approved a budget \n     reconciliation package that would significantly reduce the \n     Federal Government's funding used to pay for the child \n     support program established under part D of title IV of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) and would \n     restrict the ability of States to use Federal child support \n     incentive payments for child support program expenditures \n     that are eligible for Federal matching payments.\n       (2) The child support program enforces the responsibility \n     of non-custodial parents to support their children. The \n     program is jointly funded by Federal, State and local \n     governments.\n       (3) The Office of Management and Budget gave the child \n     support program a 90 percent rating under the Program \n     Assessment Rating Tool (PART), making it the highest \n     performing social services program.\n       (4) The President's 2006 budget cites the child support \n     program as ``one of the highest rated block/formula grants of \n     all reviewed programs government-wide. This high rating is \n     due to its strong mission, effective management, and \n     demonstration of measurable progress toward meeting annual \n     and long term performance measures.''\n       (5) In 2004, the child support program spent $5,300,000,000 \n     to collect $21,900,000,000 in support payments. Public \n     investment in the child support program provides more than a \n     four-fold return, collecting $4.38 in child support for every \n     Federal and State dollar that the program spends.\n       (6) In 2004, 17,300,000 children, or 60 percent of all \n     children living apart from a parent, received child support \n     services through the program. The percentage is higher for \n     poor children--84 percent of poor children living apart from \n     their parent receive child support services through the \n     program. Families assisted by the child support program \n     generally have low or moderate incomes.\n       (7) Children who receive child support from their parents \n     do better in school than those that do not receive support \n     payments. Older children with child support payments are more \n     likely to finish high school and attend college.\n       (8) The child support program directly decreases the costs \n     of other public assistance programs by increasing family \n     self-sufficiency. The more effective the child support \n     program in a State, the higher the savings in public \n     assistance costs.\n       (9) Child support helps lift more than 1,000,000 Americans \n     out of poverty each year.\n       (10) Families that are former recipients of assistance \n     under the temporary assistance for needy families program \n     (TANF) have seen the greatest increase in child support \n     payments. Collections for these families increased 94 percent \n     between 1999 and 2004, even though the number of former TANF \n     families did not increase during this period.\n       (11) Families that receive child support are more likely to \n     find and hold jobs, and less likely to be poor than \n     comparable families without child support.\n       (12) The child support program saved costs in the TANF, \n     Medicaid, Food Stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and \n     subsidized housing programs.\n       (13) The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the \n     funding cuts proposed by the Committee on Ways and Means of \n     the House of Representatives would reduce child support \n     collections by nearly $7,900,000,000 in the next 5 years and \n     $24,100,000,000 in the next 10 years.\n       (14) That National Governor's Association has stated that \n     such cuts are unduly burdensome and will force States to \n     reevaluate several services that make the child support \n     program so effective.\n       (15) The Federal Government has a moral responsibility to \n     ensure that parents who do not live with their children meet \n     their financial support obligations for those children.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate will not accept any reduction in funding for \n     the child support program established under part D of title \n     IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 651 et seq.), or any \n     restrictions on the ability of States to use Federal child \n     support incentive payments for child support program \n     expenditures that are eligible for Federal matching payments, \n     during this Congress.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2364.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 297, submitted early \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 297) marking the dedication of the \n     Gaylord Nelson Wilderness within the Apostle Islands National \n     Lakeshore.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, earlier this fall, Senator Kohl and I \nintroduced a resolution marking the dedication of the Gaylord Nelson \nWilderness Area within the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Today, \nthe same day the Senate will officially pay tribute to Senator Nelson, \nwe proudly reintroduced our resolution.\n  On December 8, 2004, approximately 80 percent of the Apostle Islands \nNational Lakeshore in Wisconsin was designated the Gaylord Nelson \nWilderness. Although we did not formally celebrate the new wilderness \narea until August 8, 2005, we have been delighting in the designation \never since December of last year.\n  The designation of the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness within the Apostle \nIslands National Lakeshore on August 8, 2005, was a tremendous occasion \nfor both Wisconsin and the country. I was deeply honored to participate \nin the ceremony marking the creation of the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness. \nI knew Gaylord, and am proud to occupy his Senate seat. Like all of \nthose in attendance at the dedication ceremony, including Tia Nelson, \nGovernor Doyle, Congressman Obey, local officials, tribal chairs, and \nmany others, I was deeply saddened that Gaylord wasn't able to be \nsitting among us, having passed away on July 3, 2005.\n  However, I do believe that because the area, the magnificent \nApostles, and the wilderness designation we were celebrating were such \na part of Gaylord, he was in fact there with us that day, urging us to \nmark the achievement and to continue his life's work of building a \nnational conservation ethic. As we all know, while his record of \nachievements is long and impressive, it is Senator Nelson's passion and \ncommitment to protecting our environment that will remain the \ncenterpiece of his legacy. For this reason, Senator Kohl and I have \nsubmitted a resolution to bring recognition to Gaylord's unwavering \nefforts on behalf of the environment and to celebrate the dedication of \na wilderness area rightly named in his honor.\n  Gaylord so believed in his responsibility to the environment that he \nstarted a revolution that has inspired millions of people from across \nthe globe. The day he created in 1970--Earth Day--has become a cause \nfor celebration, education, and reflection for all. Simply stated, \nGaylord Nelson changed the consciousness of a nation, and quite \npossibly the world. He was a distinguished Governor and Senator, a \nrecipient of the Presidential Medal of\n\n[[Page S12281]]\n\nFreedom, and a personal hero of mine. Most importantly, he was the \nembodiment of the principle that one person can change the world.\n  August 8, 2005, marked the beginning of a new period for the Apostle \nIslands, and I could not be more proud of this. In 1998, Representative \nObey and I asked for a wilderness survey. Seven years later, we finally \ngathered to salute the awe-inspiring resource as well as the man who \ndedicated himself to protecting our environment, particularly those \nplaces where we humans are but humble visitors--wilderness areas. Let \nus not forget, however, that before we could talk about having a \nwilderness area within the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, we had \nto have a National Lakeshore. I am sure it will come as no surprise \nthat Gaylord was essential in the effort to recognize the Apostle \nIslands as a national treasure.\n  The wild and primitive nature of the Apostles and now the Gaylord \nNelson Wilderness has always been an attraction, not only for Wisconsin \nresidents but for people from across the globe. At the Apostles you can \nfind pristine old growth forests; wetlands that are home to an \nastounding ecological diversity; birds that travel long distances and \nuse the islands for respite; and amphibians, which can act as \nindicators of the park's environmental health.\n  It is a truly amazing place.\n  And people know it. In fact, just recently, the Apostles was rated \nthe No. 1 National Park in the U.S. by National Geographic Traveler. \nThe rating was based on a variety of factors, most notably \nenvironmental and ecological quality, social and cultural integrity, \nand the outlook for the future.\n  We have it all in the park--ecological and cultural resources \nintertwined with one another. The history of the islands is a history \nof people living off, and very much in balance with, the land and water \nsurrounding them. A visit to the Apostles and the Gaylord Nelson \nWilderness can be, if we let go of the trappings of modern society, an \nenlightening voyage that challenges us to think about those who came \nbefore us, those who will follow us, and the connections between us and \nthe natural resources we depend on for our survival.\n  The Ojibwae, who Wisconsinites know were the original inhabitants of \nthe Apostles, had great respect for the resources. They believed in \ntaking something only if they were giving something in return. The \nOjibwae people understood their dependence on the environment long \nbefore many others began contemplating such a relationship. \nUnfortunately, as a society, we have not always heeded their example. \nWe must be better stewards of our land, our air, and our water. Gaylord \npushed us toward that goal every day of his life. And, what better way \nto mark the dedication of the Wilderness Area named in his honor than \nfor each of us to dedicate ourselves to actively carrying his legacy \nforward. That is Gaylord's challenge for all of us.\n  So many people supported the creation of the Lakeshore and the \nwilderness area. The support has taken many forms--all of which have \nadded to the success of our park and the wilderness designation. I am \nespecially grateful for the families that have donated their \nproperties, many of which are filled with childhood and other cherished \nfamily memories, for the betterment of the whole Apostle Islands and \nnow the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness. Future generations whom none of us \nwill ever know will benefit deeply from their commitment to one of \nWisconsin's most treasured places.\n  Every time I visit the Apostles and pieces of what are now the \nGaylord Nelson Wilderness, I depart with a sense of inner peace and \nclarity. A New York Times journalist wrote about the Apostle Islands \nNational Lakeshore in 1972, saying he encountered a ``silence so \nintense you can hear it.'' I believe that what all those who visit the \nGaylord Nelson Wilderness are bound to hear through that ``intense \nsilence'' is Gaylord himself calling them to action.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nthereto be printed in the Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 297) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 297\n\n       Whereas the Honorable Gaylord Nelson, a State Senator, \n     Governor, and United States Senator from Wisconsin, devoted \n     his life to protecting the environment by championing issues \n     of land protection, wildlife habitat, environmental health, \n     and increased environmental awareness, including founding \n     Earth Day;\n       Whereas the Honorable Gaylord Nelson authored the Apostle \n     Islands National Lakeshore Act, which led to the protection \n     of one of the most beautiful areas in Wisconsin and \n     recognized the rich assemblage of natural resources, cultural \n     heritage, and scenic features on Wisconsin's north coast and \n     21 islands of the 22-island archipelago;\n       Whereas the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore was \n     designated a National Park on September 26, 1970;\n       Whereas, on December 8, 2004, approximately 80 percent of \n     the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore was designated the \n     Gaylord Nelson Wilderness;\n       Whereas the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness within the Apostle \n     Islands National Lakeshore provides a refuge for many species \n     of birds, including threatened bald eagles and endangered \n     piping plovers, herring-billed gulls, double-crested \n     cormorants, and great blue herons, and is a safe haven for a \n     variety of amphibians, such as blue-spotted salamanders, red-\n     backed salamanders, gray treefrogs, and mink frogs, and is a \n     sanctuary for several mammals, including river otters, black \n     bears, snowshoe hares, and fishers;\n       Whereas the official dedication of the Gaylord Nelson \n     Wilderness occurred on August 8, 2005, 36 days after the \n     Honorable Gaylord Nelson's passing; and\n       Whereas the Honorable Gaylord Nelson changed the \n     consciousness of our Nation and embodied the principle that 1 \n     person can change the world, and the creation of the Gaylord \n     Nelson Wilderness is a small, but fitting, recognition of his \n     efforts: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the Honorable Gaylord Nelson's environmental \n     legacy;\n       (2) celebrates the dedication of the Gaylord Nelson \n     Wilderness within the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore; and\n       (3) requests that the Secretary of the Senate transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of the \n     Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/02/senate-section/article/S12281-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 2005\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, as all Members of this body know, the \nFederal Government is about to begin one of the biggest expansions in \nFederal entitlement programs in our country's history. In a few weeks, \nthe senior citizens of our country will be eligible for a much-needed \nprescription drug benefit, and I rise to talk about that program \ntonight.\n  I am particularly troubled about the fact that the Federal \nGovernment, in launching this program, is not going to be a smart \nshopper. You would think, after Katrina, given the huge hemorrhaging in \nour Federal budget, this would be a top priority for the Federal \nbudget, to shop smart, to squeeze every possible bit of value out of \nthe money that is being spent for critical programs, such as purchasing \nprescription drugs for senior citizens. Unfortunately, that is not the \ncase. At a time when the costs for this program have escalated from \nabout $400 billion to over $530 billion, with a 10-year estimate for \nthis benefit projected to cost over $720 billion, what is locked into \ncurrent law is an inability to get the best value for the purchase of \nthose medicines.\n  It is well understood all across the country that anybody who goes \nshopping in the private sector tries to get the most for their dollar \nby stressing their bargaining power. Certainly, the senior citizens of \nthis country have a whole lot of bargaining power. You would think it \nwould be the position of the Federal Government to try to take \nadvantage of that bargaining power in order to strike the best deal for \nolder people and taxpayers. Notice that I emphasize the words \n``bargaining power''--not price controls, not rules set in Washington, \nDC, a one-size-fits-all approach, nothing that would discourage \ninnovation among pharmaceutical companies, but simply bargaining power. \nOf course, that is what all the smart buyers do in the private sector \ntoday.\n  Take, for example, a big timber company in my part of the world. They \nrepresent a lot of workers. They go out and bargain with pharmaceutical \ncompanies, insurance companies, and others. They get the most for their \ndollar. The small company, on the other hand, doesn't have that kind of \nleverage and, to a great extent in this country, individuals and small \ncompanies basically end up subsidizing the big companies and people \nwith clout in the marketplace. Again, nobody is talking about price \ncontrols. We are talking about economics 101. If you are buying in \nvolume, if you have the opportunity to use marketplace forces to get \nthe most for your dollar, you try to do it. You try to use the powerful \nforces of economics 101, which is the market power of bulk purchasing.\n  Unfortunately, that is not going to be done in the area of purchasing \nprescription drugs for older people in our country, beginning the first \nof the year. In fact, what the Federal Government is doing is \nessentially turning on its head the principle of smart shopping. What \nthe Federal Government would be doing, unless the Congress steps in, is \npretty much like somebody going to Costco and buying toilet paper one \nroll at a time. The Federal Government isn't using its bargaining power \nto hold down the cost of medicine. At a time when prescriptions are one \nof the fastest growing forces in American health care, that defies \ncommon sense.\n  Some errors are known as errors of omission; others are known as \nerrors of commission. The fact that the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices is prohibited from using the power of bulk buying to hold down \nthe cost of medicine for seniors is, in my view, one of the most \noutrageous errors of commission in the history of health care \nlegislation. The Medicare prescription drug statute didn't forget to \ngive the Secretary of Health and Human Services bargaining power to \nhold down the cost of medicine; the statute specifically told the \nSecretary he could not have such authority to get a fair deal for older \npeople. So what we have at a time when the cost of the program is going \nthrough the stratosphere, at a time when seniors are trying to decide \nwhether to sign up, is we have a statute that denies the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services the same marketplace tool that any consumer \nhas in our communities across the country--the power to leverage bulk \npurchasing to get a better price. Federal law now denies the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services what hundreds of other Federal officials \nhave--the power to get a better price for the taxpayer.\n\n  The Congress did not tell the Army they had to go out and buy one \ntent at a time for our soldiers in Iraq. The Congress didn't tell the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency they had to buy one mobile home at \na time for hurricane victims. But unbelievably, Congress told Medicare \nthey have to go out and buy one drug at a time as it relates to other \npeople. So Medicare can't do what any savvied shopper in our country \ndoes, which is use their leverage in the marketplace to get lower \nprices. I think it is outrageous to have this double standard that \nprohibits Medicare from doing what all the other consumers in America \ncan do, and it is time, in my view, to fix that.\n  Tomorrow, the Senate will have a bipartisan opportunity to do just \nthat. Senator Snowe and I, along with Senator McCain and Senator \nStabenow and a number of others, will offer an amendment that will lift \nthe outrageous restriction on the Federal Government's ability to \nbargain, and under our bipartisan amendment the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services would have the authority to negotiate for lower drug \nprices.\n  I particularly wish to thank Senator Snowe. She and I have worked on \nthis a number of years. Both of us voted for the prescription drug \nlegislation. We have the welts on our back to show for it, and even the \nnight of the vote we said we were going to come back and try to improve \nthis, particularly to improve it in a way that would make sense for \nolder people and for taxpayers. So we see our bipartisan amendment as \nan effort to follow up on the promise we made to our citizens back \nhome.\n  I thank Senator Snowe, who is always trying to find common ground, \nbipartisan common ground, which is, of course, the only way you get \nimportant work done in the Senate.\n  I also want to say a special thanks to Senator McCain, who is \nconstantly focused on ways to expose waste, get more for the taxpayer \ndollar, and also Senator Stabenow of Michigan. Senator Stabenow has \nspent enormous amounts of time on a whole host of issues advocating for \nolder people and the cost of prescription drugs, and I am convinced \nthat this issue would never have gotten the visibility and the \nattention that it warrants were it not for Senator Stabenow's focus on \nit.\n  I also would like to say the same about Senator Feinstein. She and I \nagreed on the night of the vote that we were going to join Senator \nSnowe in a bipartisan effort to get a fairer and better deal for older \npeople, and I thank her as well for all of her effort.\n  Now, Mr. President, the Snowe-Wyden legislation includes specific \nlanguage that prohibits price controls and the setting of prices in \nAmerica. This is something I feel very strongly about, and I know the \nPresiding Officer has a great interest in encouraging innovation and \nresearch. I think we all understand what is going on in the \npharmaceutical field. We are seeing breakthroughs every single day, and \none of the most important steps we can take in the public policy arena \nis to foster innovation and research even in my fair flat tax proposal \nthat I introduced this week, and I know the Presiding Officer has great \ninterest in tax reform, keeping the research and development tax break \nbecause it is important. So I don't take a backseat to anybody in terms \nof encouraging innovation and research, and one of the key ways to \npromote innovation and research is to avoid price controls, the setting \nof prices in Washington, DC, anything that would lead to policies that \nfreeze the Government's ability to encourage innovation.\n  So what we have done in this particular amendment is put in a \nstatutory restriction on price controls, on the setting of prices so \nthat it is clear to everyone in the Senate that all we wish to do in \nour bipartisan effort is to untie the hands of the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services and put Medicare in the position of being a smart \nshopper. I cannot for the life of me think why Medicare should not have \nthe same power to negotiate what other programs and governments have, \nthat others in the private sector would\n\n[[Page S12283]]\n\nhave, and with our bipartisan legislation, Medicare would have that \npower.\n  This is particularly important because savings from negotiations are \nonly going to come about as it relates to single-source drugs if this \nrestriction is lifted. Without it, it seems to me we will not have \nnegotiations for these single-source drugs where there isn't the kind \nof competition and marketplace forces. Many single-source drugs are \nparticularly important for older people. We are talking about drugs \nsuch as Lipator, Zocor, and Prevacid. Lipator, for example, was at the \ntop of the list of drugs most often taken by older people, and all of \nthe drugs I mentioned were in the top 20 in terms of drugs used by \nseniors.\n  So when it comes to savings--and this was noted by the Congressional \nBudget Office in a letter to me and Senator Snowe last year--it seems \nto me that you especially need the power to negotiate when you are \ntalking about single-source drugs. Given the importance of Lipator in \nthe marketplace, prevalence in terms of the older population, I hope \nthat as Senators look at this amendment, they will see the value of \ngiving the Secretary the power to negotiate. It is particularly \ncritical when it relates to single-source drugs.\n  In my view, it is disappointing that the way the underlying \nlegislation was drafted, the fundamental base bill is going to require \nmore than a simple majority for us to prevail. Certainly, there are a \nlot of special interests in this town that do not want the Federal \nGovernment to be a smart shopper. The number of lobbyists that are \nworking against this legislation, which I will tell you I think is just \nabout the most offensive restriction I have seen in health policy, the \nnumber of lobbyists working against our bipartisan amendment is just \nstaggering. And make no mistake about what the special interests who \noppose our legislation want to do. They would rather soak the taxpayer \nand add to the budget deficit than to have to negotiate with the \nFederal Government like all other businesses. They are basically \nsaying: Look, we are special. Don't require us to have to go out and \nbargain. We shouldn't have to do what everybody else does.\n  Everybody else in America who has marketplace clout is allowed to use \nit. That is what markets are all about. But because of the power of the \nspecial interests, this restriction prohibits Medicare from using the \nkind of marketplace forces that everybody else uses, and it is not \nright.\n\n  I am sure that seniors and their families across the country are \ngoing to be especially concerned about the fact that this legislation \nis going to increase their Part B premiums. But it seems to me that at \na time when their part B premiums are going to go up, when they are \ngoing to have to pay extra costs out of their pocket for copays and \ndeductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses, that alone would be a \nreason why we would look to give Medicare more bargaining power to hold \ndown the cost of this program.\n  Seniors are going to have less in their pocket to pay for \nprescription drugs and to sign up for this program. But the legislation \nwas carefully written to make it tough on us and to increase the number \nof Senators we would have to have to pass this legislation. We are \ngoing to need more than a simple majority, and I think it is \nparticularly unfortunate that at a time when seniors are going to see \ntheir Part B premiums go up, that we are not going to give them this \nopportunity to seek some real savings in what they have to pay for \nprescription medicine.\n  I hope that Senators are going to be supportive of this legislation. \nI am sure when a Senator goes home and discusses prescription drugs, \none of the first things that folks at home are going to ask is: How are \nyou going to keep the cost down? What are you doing, Senator, to hold \ndown the cost of medicine? The private sector is doing it, other \nGovernment programs are doing it; what are you doing, Senator, to hold \ndown the cost of medicine?\n  Tomorrow, the bipartisan group of Senators I mentioned--Senator Snowe \nleading our effort, myself, Senator McCain, Senator Stabenow, and \nothers--will be saying: Look, we have something that is going to \nprovide an opportunity for the Federal Government to be a smart \nshopper, to use its marketplace clout, and to hold down the cost of \nmedicine when seniors are seeing an increase in their out-of-pocket \nexpenses.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that there is going to be \nan 8.5-percent increase in the cost of this program, and the Government \nAccountability Office has shown that the prices for existing drugs are \nincreasing two and three times the rate of inflation.\n  This is a prescription for a program that does not work. That is a \nfailure, and I will tell you I don't want to fail our country's \nseniors. I voted for the prescription drug law. I want to make it work. \nBut I will tell you, I am very troubled about the prospect that if \nsteps are not taken to hold down the costs of this program, there is a \nreal prospect that a great deal of money will be spent on a relatively \nsmall number of people because we will not have the number of seniors \nsigning up that we need.\n  We need to make this program work. It is important. Prescription \ndrugs are a lifeline. Affordable prescription drugs are essential for \nthe Nation's older people. Too many of these drugs are simply priced \nout of the reach of older people.\n  At the end of the day, the bipartisan legislation that Senator Snowe \nwill offer with myself and our bipartisan group is simply common sense. \nLet's make Medicare a smart shopper by allowing bargaining power. Let's \nstop this idea of forsaking our ability to be a savvy shopper, and let \nus make sure that when Medicare goes out and tries to make sure that \nthe costs of this program are held down, that it has the tools it needs \nin its cost-containment arsenal to get the job done right and to make \nsure that the costs of this program, for both taxpayers and seniors, \nare held down.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Feinstein, \nDayton, Kohl, and Feingold be added as cosponsors of the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this bipartisan measure will be voted on \ntomorrow. My sense is that because the day will be very hectic, having \nto vote on many amendments, that there will not be much time for \nexplanation of this measure. Senator Snowe, Senator Stabenow, and \nothers who spent so much time on this issue are going to want to speak. \nI will tell the Senate tonight this is one of the most important issues \nto come up in a long time. This program will be one of the biggest, if \nnot the biggest, expansions of Federal entitlement policy we have ever \nseen. Why we wouldn't want to go about this right and make the \nGovernment a smart shopper, a savvy shopper, why we wouldn't want to do \nthat is beyond me.\n  What we have is an error of commission. What you saw is, in this \nlegislation, very powerful special interests said we want a unique set \nof rules to apply to us: We shouldn't have to negotiate, even though \neverybody else negotiates with the Government and the private sector; \ngive us a free ride; restrict, as a matter of law, the ability of the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to make sure that seniors and \ntaxpayers got a square deal.\n  That is not right. This is about common sense. This is about the \nFederal Government being a smart shopper. This is about standing up for \ntaxpayers and seniors.\n  I would like to wrap up tonight by reading a bit from the AARP letter \nof endorsement for the legislation. Mr. President, I am going to read \nbriefly from this letter, but I ask unanimous consent that the AARP \nletter endorsing the bipartisan measure to contain the cost of medicine \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                                 November 1, 2005.\n     The Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: AARP supports your amendment to the \n     Senate fiscal year 2006 Budget Reconciliation bill to provide \n     for the ability of the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     to participate in the negotiations between pharmaceutical \n     manufacturers and prescription drug plans under the Medicare \n     Part D program.\n\n[[Page S12284]]\n\n       Prescription drug prices continue to rise much faster than \n     the rate of inflation. AARP's latest Rx Watchdog report \n     released this week found that prices for nearly 200 of the \n     most commonly used brand name medications rose 6.1 percent \n     during the 12 month period from July 2004-June 2005. At the \n     same time, the rate of general inflation was 3 percent. These \n     drug price increases particularly hit older Americans, who \n     use prescription drugs more than any other segment of the \n     U.S. population.\n       In two weeks, millions of older and disabled Americans will \n     have the opportunity to choose prescription drug coverage as \n     part of their 2006 Medicare benefit options. The new Medicare \n     prescription drug benefit will help millions of beneficiaries \n     afford needed medications. Improvements to the Medicare \n     Modernization Act are necessary to strengthen the benefit and \n     the Medicare program. We believe the first step is to keep \n     the drug benefit affordable for beneficiaries as well as \n     taxpayers.\n       While the competitive structure already existing in the MMA \n     may help to bring prescription drug prices down, we believe \n     that giving the Secretary the authority to participate in \n     negotiations may also help to make prescription drugs more \n     affordable for Medicare beneficiaries.\n       We look forward to working with you and your colleagues on \n     both sides of the aisle to ensure that the new Medicare Part \n     D benefit remains affordable over time.

Sloane,\n\n                                            Sr. Managing Director,\n                                Government Relations and Advocacy.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the letter says, and I will read a bit of \nit:\n\n       AARP supports your amendment to the Senate fiscal year 2006 \n     Budget Reconciliation bill to provide for the ability of the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to participate in the \n     negotiations between pharmaceutical manufacturers and \n     prescription drug plans under the Medicare Part D program.\n       Prescription drug prices continue to rise much faster than \n     the rate of inflation. AARP's latest Rx Watchdog report \n     released this week found that prices for nearly 200 of the \n     most commonly used brand name medications rose 6.1 percent \n     during the 12 month period from July 2004-June 2005. At the \n     same time, the rate of general inflation was 3 percent. These \n     drug price increases particularly hit older Americans, who \n     use prescription drugs more than any other segment of the \n     U.S. population.\n       In two weeks, millions of older and disabled Americans will \n     have the opportunity to choose prescription drug coverage as \n     part of their 2006 Medicare benefit options. The new Medicare \n     prescription drug benefit will help millions of beneficiaries \n     afford needed medications. Improvements to the Medicare \n     Modernization Act are necessary to strengthen the benefit and \n     the Medicare program. We believe the first step is to keep \n     the drug benefit affordable for beneficiaries as well as \n     taxpayers.\n       While the competitive structure already existing in the MMA \n     may help to bring prescription drug prices down, we believe \n     that giving the Secretary the authority to participate in \n     negotiations may also help to make prescription drugs more \n     affordable for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n  Mr. President, there is a bit more to the letter, but I think the \nSenate can get the general drift.\n  The AARP, the organization that represents millions of older people, \nexplicitly tonight endorses our bipartisan amendment. They have pointed \nout that the cost of these medications, the ones that are so important \nto older people, are going up double the rate of inflation.\n  Let me emphasize that to the Senate. The drugs that seniors use, the \nprices are going up double the rate of inflation.\n  So we need some serious tools to contain these costs. At a time when \nthe Federal Government ought to be using more effective tools to hold \ndown the costs of medicine, we have locked into law a restriction on \nthe ability of the Government to do what smart shoppers in America do \nevery single day, and that is to use their marketplace clout, bulk \npurchasing power, to get the best value for them and their families. It \nis time to lift this outrageous, offensive restriction that is now in \nMedicare law that prevents the Federal Government from being a smart \nshopper. It is now time to stand up for taxpayers and stand up for the \nolder people in this country. The Senate will have a chance to do that \nwhen it votes on the bipartisan amendment tomorrow that has been filed \ntonight, will be offered tomorrow, by Senator Snowe, a bipartisan \ngroup. I hope my colleagues will support it resoundingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/02/senate-section/article/S12284-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
