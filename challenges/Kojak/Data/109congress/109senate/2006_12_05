Mr. President, I hope everyone has had a good Thanksgiving \nrecess--enjoyable, relaxing. We have a busy few days ahead of us as we \nhave our final week for the 109th Congress, and there are a number of \npriorities we need to address.\n  We have the Gates nomination. The hearing on that nomination began \nthis morning. It is our intent to have the Senate address and complete \naction on this nomination no later than this Friday.\n  We have a continuing resolution. I was just talking to the Democratic \nleader about that. The continuing resolution does expire at midnight on \nFriday. Absent action on any other appropriations, this continuing \nresolution will extend funding for Government operations into 2007, and \nit will not contain earmarks or policy initiatives.\n  Also on the agenda are various tax, trade, and health extenders. \nBipartisan Senate work has been spearheaded by Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus. They assembled a package of necessary tax, trade, and \nhealth policy extensions. That is being filed as we speak.\n  Fourth, yesterday Senate conferees were named to the United States-\nIndia civil nuclear cooperation deal. The burden now falls on the \nSenate and House conferees to conclude final work on this very \nimportant piece of legislation. It would implement a nuclear power \ntechnology sharing agreement with the United States and India. This \nmorning I talked with Prime Minister Singh of India, who underscored \nthe importance of this legislation.\n  Fifth, the Senate is also close to action on the bioterrorism bill, a \nbill we had worked on in a bipartisan way. This legislation will make \nimprovements and enhancements in our ability to anticipate and react to \nbioterrorism attacks--again a bipartisan priority. I very much hope we \nwill be able to finish that this week as well.\n  Sixth, we have the Vietnam trade agreement. If the House can act on \nthe Vietnam trade agreement, the Senate will act on that measure.\n  There are a whole range of other legislative initiatives that the \nSenate will consider as they do become available. These will include \nnecessary programmatic extensions as well as any cleared nominations, \nso we have a packed agenda.\n  Specifically for today, this afternoon we will begin with the time \nuntil 2 p.m. set aside for Senator DeWine. I will have a brief \nstatement. The Democratic leader will have a brief statement after my \nopening remarks and announcements this morning. Shortly after 2 o'clock \ntoday we will proceed to the consideration of the Agriculture \nappropriations bill. Following the statements from the bill's managers, \nSenator Conrad will be recognized to offer his amendment on \nagricultural disaster. It is expected a point of order will be raised \nto the Conrad amendment, and a vote on the motion to waive will occur \naround 5 o'clock this afternoon. That will be the first rollcall vote \nthis week. We have a number of items to address over the course of the \nweek, which I have outlined.\n  Mr. President, I do want to make a very brief statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11112-6", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11112-S11115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, there is a very common question I been \nasked over the last several days: During your 4-year tenure as majority \nleader, what has been the most constitutionally challenging issue \nconfronting the Senate?\n  I didn't have to think very long. I very quickly came to this whole \ntopic of judicial filibusters, which unfortunately reflected one of the \nmost difficult and challenging aspects of this institution over the \nlast 4 years; that is, the partisanship that would come to the surface \nand the obstruction that resulted from that partisanship. It was this \nunprecedented use of these filibusters, judicial filibusters, in the \nlast two Congresses that came very close to fundamentally disrupting \nthe Senate's relationship with the executive branch and the Senate's \nrelationship with the judicial branch. It impaired the Senate's ability \nto discharge a very basic constitutional obligation--to advise and \nconsent.\n  In the process, Senate traditions were damaged. I believe they have \nbeen resolved. I am very hopeful that this partisanship will not \nresurface in future Congresses. In those 214 years between 1789 and \n2003, exactly one judicial nominee was stopped by filibuster, and over \nthat period of 214 years that single case was a lonely historical \naberration. Until this Congress and the Congress right before that, the \nprevious Congress, which was my first as leader, we had this Senate \ntradition literally shattered and we saw in that one Congress, and it \ncontinued into this Congress; after 214 years of one blocked nominee by \nfilibuster, there were 10 in that very short period of time. So for \ndecades we have had two great Senate traditions that existed side by \nside: For one, a general respect for the filibuster itself, and the \nother, a consensus that judicial nominations brought to the floor would \nreceive an up-or-down vote.\n  Filibusters, of course, are periodically conducted on legislative \nmatters. Sometimes successfully and sometimes they are ended by \ncloture. However, filibusters on judicial nominees have not impeded \nthis basic constitutional responsibility of our Senate's advice and \nconsent, that important role in judicial nominations. In the \nexceedingly rare cases in the past where filibusters were attempted on \nthese nominations, very quickly cloture was always invoked with \nbipartisan support, support from both sides, and the filibusters \nceased.\n  But in the last Congress, the previous Congress, these judicial \nfilibusters became an instrument of partisan politics. As I said, I \nhope that such partisan politics can be set aside in the future.\n  Due to these filibusters--again, a whole series of them in the last \nCongress and this Congress--the Senate traditions were set aside. They \nwere set aside but then also they collided before they were set aside. \nIf matters were left to their own purpose, either the power to give \nadvice and consent would yield to the filibuster or the filibuster \nwould ultimately have to yield to advise and consent. So in response to \nthese tradition-shattering filibusters, we sought to create a \nprecedent. The precedent came to be known as the constitutional option, \nand that would guarantee a very simple principle, one which had been \nrespected over time by tradition here. And that is after substantial \ndebate each judicial nominee brought to the floor would get an up-or-\ndown vote.\n  Proceeding with the constitutional option was painful to many \nSenators, including myself, because of that respect for minority \nrights. But even\n\n[[Page S11113]]\n\nthese longstanding rights can take on new forms from time to time and \nbecome abused. That is exactly what happened in the last Congress. We \ncould not permit the filibuster, the judicial filibuster, to take root, \nto become the new precedent in this Congress and therefore, to restore \nconstitutional precedent, the constitutional option--putting it forth \non the floor, bringing it to the floor--became a necessary last resort.\n  It was fascinating because once we stood on principle and moved \ntoward that constitutional option, literally the night before we \ncarried it out, a compromise was reached and important Senate \ntraditions were restored. Senate traditions all of a sudden came back \nto what they had always been up until two Congresses ago, and that is \nthe filibusters would be confined to ``extraordinary circumstances.'' \nThat is an exercise of self-restraint, something, again, I encourage \nthis new Congress to adhere to in the future.\n  So after that, Democrats who would be voting against these nominees \nby continuing these filibusters did switch and did allow these nominees \nto, for the most part, pass.\n  If we had not put that constitutional option on the table, great \nnominees never would have been confirmed. But for the constitutional \noption, judicial filibusters would have become an ever more routine \npart of business on the floor and, but for the constructional option, \ndeal brokers would have had no deal to broker.\n  Because we acted, the sword of the judicial filibuster was sheathed. \nHighly qualified nominees who would have been blocked now sit on courts \nof appeals. Sam Alito, who was, in fact, himself subject of a failed \nfilibuster, now serves on the U.S. Supreme Court. The problem of \njudicial filibusters was of monumental importance. It affected the \ninternal functioning of the Senate, that relationship between the \nSenate and the Presidency and the relationship between the Senate and \nthe courts. It was the biggest challenge that I confronted as majority \nleader and was the issue of largest consequence for our constitutional \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, during my tenure as majority leader, the \nmost vexatious and constitutionally challenging issue confronting the \nSenate was judicial filibusters. This tactic threatened to disrupt \nfundamentally the Senate's relationship with coordinate branches of \nGovernment and to impair the Senate's ability to discharge its \nconstitutional obligation to advise and consent. In the process, Senate \ntraditions were damaged.\n  In the 214 years between 1789 and 2003, exactly one judicial nominee \nwas stopped by filibuster. That case occurred in 1968, when President \nLyndon Johnson nominated Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court. The filibuster that erupted was broadly bipartisan, \nmainly on ethics grounds, but many commentators worried about the \nconstitutional implications the filibuster presented. Chief among them \nwas the Senate majority leader, Mike Mansfield. In Senate debate on \nSeptember 25, 1968, he put this issue squarely:\n\n       I reiterate we have a constitutional obligation to consent \n     or not to consent to this nomination. We may evade that \n     obligation, but we cannot deny it. As for any post, the \n     question which must be faced is simply: Is the man qualified \n     for the appointed position? That is the only question. It \n     cannot be hedged, hemmed, or hawed. There is one question: \n     Shall we consent to this Presidential appointment? A Senator \n     or group of Senators may frustrate the Senate indefinitely in \n     the exercise of its constitutional obligation with respect to \n     this question. In so doing, they presume great personal \n     privilege at the expense of the responsibilities of the \n     Senate as a whole, and at the expense of the constitutional \n     structure of the Federal Government.\n\n  For 35 years thereafter, Senator Mansfield's words were given heed, \nand the Fortas case remained a lonely historical aberration. But in the \nlast Congress--my first as leader--the minority shattered Senate \ntraditions and filibusters blocked 10 nominees.\n  It began with the nomination of Miguel Estrada to serve on the Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia. Mr. Estrada epitomized the \nAmerican dream. An immigrant from Honduras, he arrived in America \nspeaking no English, but he graduated from Harvard Law School, and \nargued numerous cases before the Supreme Court while serving as a \nDeputy Solicitor General. The American Bar Association gave him its \nhighest recommendation and his confirmation by the Senate seemed \nassured.\n  But the confirmation vote never came. Each time we sought a consent \nagreement to limit debate, the minority leadership objected. In open \nsession, they remarked that no amount of debate time would be \nsufficient and that they would not permit the Senate to vote.\n  After 13 days, I filed a cloture motion to close debate. Every \nRepublican voted for it along with a handful of Democrats, but the \nminority held firm and we fell short with 55 votes. This process was \nrepeated on the Estrada nomination six more times. But the discipline \nimposed by the minority leadership never weakened and we never budged a \nsingle vote.\n  Debate was not the issue. Obstruction was the issue. Finally, to the \nshame of the Senate and the harm of the American people, Mr. Estrada \nasked President Bush to withdraw his nomination.\n  Before the last Congress, the record number of cloture votes on a \njudicial nomination was two and no nomination with clear majority \nsupport ever died by filibuster. The Estrada case rewrote that \ntradition, and for the worse. On Miguel Estrada, seven cloture votes \nwere taken, to no avail. He was a nominee who plainly could have been \nconfirmed, but he was denied an up or down vote.\n  And the Estrada case was just the beginning. After Miguel Estrada, \nnine additional nominees were filibustered and the minority threatened \nfilibusters on six more.\n  As the filibusters began to mushroom, Democratic Senator Zell Miller \nand I introduced a cloture reform resolution. Our proposal would have \npermitted an end to filibusters of nominations after reasonable and \nsubstantial debate. The Senate Rules Committee held a hearing on our \nresolution and reported it with an affirmative recommendation.\n  But the proposal languished on the Senate calendar, facing a certain \nfilibuster from Senators opposed to cloture reform. Quite simply, those \nwho undertook to filibuster these nominees wanted no impediments put in \ntheir way.\n  Consent orders had failed to resolve this issue, as had cloture and a \nrules change through the regular order. So we looked to the 2004 \nelections. And we made judicial filibusters an election issue in many \nStates.\n  Notwithstanding election outcomes strengthening the margin of the \nmajority, the minority dug in, saying that they had not filibustered \ntoo many nominees but too few. So even election outcomes failed.\n  When the present Congress convened last January, I was urged to move \nimmediately for a change in Senate procedure so that these \nunprecedented filibusters could not be repeated. But I decided on a \nmore measured and less confrontational course. Rather than move \nimmediately to change procedure, I promoted dialogue at the leadership \nand committee level to seek a solution to this problem. Rather than act \non the record of the last Congress, I hoped that the passage of a \nclearly won election and presence of new Democratic leadership would \nresult in a sense of fairness being restored.\n  Sadly, these hopes were not fulfilled. More filibusters were \npromised, not only against seven nominees President Bush resubmitted \nbut also against other nominees as then yet to be proposed. A renewal \nof filibusters against persons denied an up or down vote in the last \nCongress was a grave problem and would be reason enough for reform. \nThreatening filibusters against new nominees compounded the wrong and \nwas further reason for reform. My choice was stark: accept a new \ntradition of judicial filibusters or act to address them.\n\n  For many decades, two great Senate traditions existed side by side. \nThese were a general respect for the filibuster and a consensus that \nnominations brought to the floor would receive an up or down vote. \nFilibusters have been periodically conducted on legislation, sometimes \nsuccessfully and sometimes ended by cloture. However, filibusters have \nnot impeded the Senate's advice and consent role on nominations. In the \nexceedingly rare cases they were attempted, cloture was always invoked\n\n[[Page S11114]]\n\nwith bipartisan support and the filibusters ceased.\n  But in the last Congress, judicial filibusters became instruments of \npartisan politics. Organized and promoted by the minority leadership, \nthese filibusters proved resilient to cloture.\n  Due to these filibusters, the two great Senate traditions that used \nto coexist came to collide. If matters were left in this posture, \neither the power to advise and consent would yield to the filibuster or \nthe filibuster would yield to the power to advise and consent.\n  Until these judicial filibusters were launched, the Senate lived by \nthe principle that filibusters would not impede the exercise of \nconstitutional confirmation powers and that a majority of Senators \ncould vote to confirm or reject a nominee brought to the floor. The \nunparalleled filibusters undermined that tradition, denying nominees \nthe courtesy of an up or down vote. They represented an effort by a \nSenate minority to obstruct the duty of the full Senate to advise and \nconsent. The current minority claimed it had no choice but to \nfilibuster, because Republicans controlled the White House and Senate. \nBut the minority's conclusion defied history.\n  For 70 of the 100 years of the last century, the same party \ncontrolled the Presidency and the Senate, but the minority party \nleadership exercised restraint and refused to filibuster judicial \nnominees. The past half-century amply illustrates this point. During \nthe Kennedy and Johnson administrations, Democrats controlled the \nSenate, but the Republican minority leader Everett Dirksen did not \nfilibuster judicial nominees. While President Carter was in office, \nDemocrats controlled the Senate, but Republican leader Howard Baker did \nnot filibuster judicial nominees. For President Reagan's first 6 years, \nRepublicans controlled the Senate, but Democratic Leader Robert Byrd \ndid not filibuster judicial nominees. In President Clinton's first 2 \nyears, Democrats had the Senate but Republican leader Bob Dole did not \nfilibuster judicial nominees. During all those years, all those \nCongresses, and all those Presidencies, nominees brought to the floor \ngot an up or down vote.\n  Democrats argued that by curbing judicial filibusters, the Senate \nwould turn into a rubberstamp. But for more than two centuries, those \nfilibusters did not exist. Shall we conclude that for 200 years the \nSenate was a rubberstamp and only now awakened to its responsibilities? \nWhat of those minority leaders who did not filibuster? Were they also \nrubberstamps? Was Dirksen? Was Baker, Was Byrd? Was Dole? Could the \nminority be right that only through the filibuster may the Senate's \nadvice and consent check be vindicated? This was a novel conclusion and \nit stained the reputation of the great Senators that preceded us.\n  To make their case against curbs on judicial filibusters, the \nminority cited the 1968 nomination of Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, and Franklin Roosevelt's court-packing plan of \n1937. But use of these examples was an overreach and drew false \ncomparisons.\n  In 1968, Abe Fortas was serving on the Supreme Court as an Associate \nJustice. Three years earlier, he had been confirmed by the Senate by \nvoice vote, following a unanimous affirmative recommendation from the \nJudiciary Committee. Then Chief Justice Earl Warren announced his \nretirement, effective on the appointment of his successor. President \nLyndon Johnson proposed to elevate Fortas to succeed Warren.\n  The non-controversial nominee of 1965 became the highly controversial \nnominee of 1968. Justice Fortas was caught in a political perfect \nstorm. Some Senators raised questions of ethics. Others complained \nabout cronyism. Yet others were concerned about Warren Court decisions. \nAnd still others thought that with the election looming weeks away, a \nnew President should fill the Warren vacancy. But this political \nperfect storm was thoroughly bipartisan in nature, and reflected \nconcerns from certain Republicans as well as numerous southern and \nnorthern Democrats.\n  Senator Mike Mansfield brought the Fortas nomination to the Senate \nfloor late on September 24, 1968. After only 2 full days of debate, \nMansfield filed a cloture motion. Almost a third of the 26 Senators who \nsigned the cloture motion were Republicans, including the Republican \nwhip. The vote on cloture was 45 yeas and 43 nays, well short of the \ntwo-thirds then needed to close debate. Nearly a third of Republicans \nsupported cloture, including the Republican whip. Nearly a third of \nDemocrats opposed it, including the Democratic whip. Of the 43 negative \nvotes on cloture, 24 were Republican and 19 were Democratic.\n  Opponents of cloture claimed that debate had been too short in order \nto develop the full case against the Fortas nomination. In contrast to \nthe Miguel Estrada filibuster, no one claimed that debate would go on \nendlessly and that no amount of time would be sufficient. Indeed, those \nwho opposed cloture denied there was a filibuster at all.\n\n  So, the Fortas case was not analogous to the judicial filibusters we \nnow confront. Support for and opposition to Fortas was broadly \nbipartisan, a fact that stands in stark contrast to the partisan \nfilibusters that began in the last Congress as an instrument of party \npolicy. At most, it was opposition to one man, and was not an effort to \nleverage judicial appointments through the threat of a filibuster-veto. \nThe Fortas opposition came together in one aberrational moment. Nothing \nlike it had happened in the previous 180 years and nothing like it was \nrepeated for the next 35 years. Absolutely, it did not represent a \nsustained effort by a party minority to shatter Senate confirmation \ntraditions and exercise a filibuster-veto destructive of checks and \nbalances. No comparison can be made between that single aberrational \nmoment and the pattern of judicial filibusters we confronted.\n  The minority also contended that if Republicans moved against the \njudicial filibusters, we would follow in the footsteps of Franklin \nRoosevelt's attempt to pack the Supreme Court. But this was a \ncomparison without basis.\n  Frustrated by the Supreme Court's ruling unconstitutional several New \nDeal measures, President Roosevelt sought legislation to pack the court \nby appointing a new Justice for every sitting Justice over the age of \n70. In a fireside chat, he compared the three branches of Government to \na three horse team pulling a plow. Unless all three horses pulled in \nthe same direction, the plow could not move. To synchronize all the \nhorses, Roosevelt proposed to pack the court.\n  Roosevelt's effort was a direct assault on the independence of the \njudiciary and plainly undermined the principles of separation of powers \nand checks and balances. He failed in a Senate with 76 members of his \nown party.\n  No good analogy can be drawn between what Roosevelt attempted and our \neffort to end judicial filibusters. Unlike Roosevelt, Republicans were \nnot trying to undermine the separation of powers. And unlike Roosevelt, \nRepublicans were not trying to destabilize checks and balances, but to \nrestore them.\n  That the judicial filibusters undermined a longstanding Senate \ntradition is evident. But traditions are not laudable merely because \nthey are old. This tradition is important because it underpins a vital \nconstitutional principle that the President shall nominate, subject to \nthe advice and consent of the Senate. When filibusters are used to \nblock a vote, the advice and consent of the Senate is not possible.\n  A cloture vote to end a filibuster is not advice and consent within \nthe Constitution's meaning. Notwithstanding the minority's claim, \nnominees denied a confirmation vote due to filibuster were \n``rejected.'' Instead, what was rejected was the constitutional right \nof all Senators to vote up or down on the nominees.\n  To require a cloture threshold of 60 votes for confirmation disturbs \nchecks and balances between the executive and the Senate and creates a \nstrong potential for tyranny by the minority. A minority may hold \nhostage the nomination process, threatening to undermine judicial \nindependence by filibustering any appointment that does not meet \nparticular ideological or litmus tests.\n  The Constitution provides that a duly elected executive shall \nnominate, subject to advice and consent by a majority of the Senate. \nImplicit in that structure is that the President and the Senate shall \nbe politically accountable\n\n[[Page S11115]]\n\nto the American people, and that accountability will be a sufficient \ncheck on the decisions made by each of them. That was the system by \nwhich we Americans addressed nominations for more than two centuries, \nuntil the last Congress. But judicial filibusters would replace that \nsystem with one that gave the minority a filibuster-veto in the \nconfirmation process.\n  Trying to legitimize their judicial filibusters, the minority took to \nthe floor to extol the virtue of filibusters generally. And as to \nlegislative filibusters, I agree with them. But judicial filibusters \nare not cut from the same cloth as legislative filibusters and must not \nreceive similar treatment. So, I concur with the sentiments Senator \nMansfield expressed during the Fortas debate:\n\n       In the past, the Senate has discussed, debated and \n     sometimes agonized, but it has always voted on the merits. No \n     Senator or group of Senators has ever usurped that \n     constitutional prerogative. That unbroken tradition, in my \n     opinion, merely reflects on the part of the Senate the \n     distinction heretofore recognized between its constitutional \n     responsibility to confirm or reject a nominee and its role in \n     the enactment of new and far-reaching legislative proposals.\n\n  History demonstrates that filibusters have almost exclusively been \napplied against the Senate's own constitutional prerogative to initiate \nlegislation, and not against nominations. Judicial filibusters put \nfundamental constitutional values in jeopardy, hallowed principles of \nchecks and balances, the separation of powers and an independent \njudiciary.\n  Having exhausted all other alternatives and unwilling to acquiesce in \nthe judicial filibusters, we in the Republican leadership looked for a \nsolution. We recognized that article I, section 5 of the Constitution \nstates that ``each House may determine the Rules of its proceedings''. \nIn short, that means the Constitution gives the Senate the power to \ngovern itself. And we proposed to draw on that power to change how the \nSenate ends debate on judges. We called this the constitutional option, \nand we built support for it.\n  The Senate is an evolving institution. Its rules and processes are \nnot a straitjacket. Over time, adjustments have occurred in Senate \nprocedure to reflect changes in Senate behavior. Tactics no longer \nlimited by self-restraint became restricted by new rules and \nprecedents.\n  In response to the tradition-shattering filibusters, we sought to \ncreate a precedent. And that precedent would guarantee that after \nsubstantial debate, each judicial nominee brought to the floor got an \nup or down vote.\n  As I said, proceeding with the constitutional option was painful to \nmany Senators, including myself, because minority rights are deeply \nrespected. But even longstanding rights can take new forms and become \nabused. And that is what happened when judicial filibusters damaged \nSenate traditions. We could not permit the precedent of these \nfilibusters to take root. To restore Senate traditions, the \nconstitutional option became a necessary last resort.\n  As we moved toward a vote on the constitutional option, a compromise \nwas reached, and important Senate traditions were restored. Filibusters \nwere confined to ``extraordinary circumstances''--an exercise of self-\nrestraint. So some Democrats who had routinely supported the judicial \nfilibusters began voting for cloture.\n  Of this I am confident: but for the constitutional option, great \nnominees never would have been confirmed. But for the constitutional \noption, judicial filibusters would have become ever more routine. And \nbut for the constitutional option, deal brokers would have had no deal \nto broker.\n  Because we acted, the sword of the filibuster was sheathed. Highly \nqualified nominees who would have been blocked now sit on courts of \nappeals. And Samuel Alito, who was the subject of a failed filibuster, \nnow serves on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The problem of judicial filibusters was of monumental importance. It \naffected the internal functioning of the Senate, the relationship \nbetween the Senate and the Presidency, and the relationship between the \nSenate and the courts. It was the biggest challenge I confronted as \nmajority leader and the issue of largest consequence for our \nconstitutional system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11115-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in life we all have changes. They are so \ndifficult to accept. In the last month or so, I have had a lot of \nchanges in my life. One of the changes that has been so troubling for \nme is that we have lost a friend in the Senate. Ralph Waldo Emerson \nsaid:\n\n       Sorrow makes us all children again. [It] destroys all \n     differences of intellect. The wisest know nothing.\n\n  The family member we have lost is Mary Arnold. She was such a \nwonderful, pleasant, thoughtful, kind person. Anyone would recognize \nher even though they wouldn't know her by name, simply because of her \ndescription--beautiful white hair, elegantly dressed every day, a \nwonderful smile. She never drew attention to herself, but she was so \ngood for the institution. She sat right back here every day we were in \nsession.\n  She was the best when things weren't going so well. She was here for \nmore than two decades. She was the best when things were real \ntumultuous here on the floor. If somebody wanted an easel for a chart, \nthat was available. She directed the pages as to what they were \nsupposed to do and not do. She always did it with such a pleasantness.\n\n  I first met Mary Arnold when her daughter worked here. She was a \nRepublican floor person. She, like her mom, had this great, disarming \nsmile. I was not in the city when the funeral took place and was unable \nto attend, but I saw in the program a picture of the deceased Mary \nArnold. She looked exactly like her daughter. Exactly. She could have \npassed for her daughter.\n  She came to Washington over 40 years ago. Born in the late 1930s in \nJonesboro, Arkansas, she attended Memphis State University. She worked \nas a flight attendant--a stewardess, as they used to be called. All the \nstewards and stewardesses are very attractive people, but in the old \ndays that was a requirement. Stewardesses had to look real good; Mary \nArnold looked real good. I am sure she was a great flight attendant, a \nstewardess.\n  She worked for a number of Members of Congress, including Congressman \nHarvey of Indiana and Representative Zion. She worked for the Sergeant \nat Arms, of course.\n  She was a wonderful person. I had conversations with her. She loved \nanimals, especially the ugly little dogs people fall in love with, \nBoston terriers. She was in love with her Boston terriers. She was a \nwonderful person. Coming to the Senate today and not having Mary back \nthere is a tremendous loss to me and to the Senate. I want her \nwonderful daughter Mary Elizabeth to know she will be missed. Her \nspirit is something all in the Senate should have a little bit of. My \nthoughts are with Mary wherever she might be and my love and respect \nfor her family is paramount as a result of the wonderful person she \nwas.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as the Democratic leader has so eloquently \ndescribed, it is hard to imagine the smiles and the charm of Mary \nMiller Arnold will no longer grace the Senate.\n  I have had the opportunity to talk to her daughter Mary Elizabeth \nseveral times since her mom's demise. The love and the respect, that \nbond a mother and a daughter together share, is magnificent; it \nsparkles so much in her voice today.\n  Mary was a fellow Tennessean. She will be remembered most for her \nuncanny ability to very efficiently enforce the Senate rules at this \ndoor, without sacrificing at any point in time her unfailing, \nconsistent professionalism, her dedication, her polite demeanor.\n  The Senate simply could not function, we all know, without our staff \nand committed staff. We 100 Senators are, for the most part, the face \nof the Senate, but it is people such as Mary who are here, day after \nday, the cogs in the wheels behind it, who keep this Senate moving \nalong, keep it ticking.\n  She was the pulse of the Senate, in many ways. To Mary's friends and \nto\n\n[[Page S11116]]\n\nher family, let me say, our thoughts and prayers are with you during \nthese difficult days ahead. To quote Senator Byrd from the other day, \nshe was ``one of a kind.''\n  She had a tangible presence in the Senate. We are lesser now with the \nloss of her southern grace.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join with the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader in a tribute to Mary Miller Arnold who served us so \nwell in the Senate and recently passed away. We join in expressing our \ncondolences to Mary Arnold's family, her husband Ed, her son Edwin, \nJr., and her daughter Mary Elizabeth.\n  Her sudden and unexpected death comes as a shock to all of us as we \nreturn to the Senate Chamber expecting to see her smiling face as we \nhave for so many years. I am so used to seeing her sitting near the \ndoor on the bench where the Democratic staffers sit. What an impression \nshe made every single day I saw her. Perfect posture, impeccably \ndressed, every hair in place, always gracious, always professional, \ncarried herself with such dignity and grace.\n  Those who watch C-SPAN across America will know her instantly because \nshe was part of the Senate process, part of the Senate family. She sat \njust as straight, just as polished, even before the C-SPAN cameras. She \ndid this because of the respect she had for the Senate and for her \nrole, which was very important. She loved the Senate and everything it \nstood for. She considered it a privilege to work in the U.S. Capitol, \nas we all do, and especially on the Senate floor.\n  I didn't know until the other day that Mary actually began working \nfor a Republican Congressman from Illinois, Roger Zion. She moved to \nWashington in 1960 with her husband Ed, who had taken a job with a \ncongressman from Indiana. Her daughter Mary Elizabeth worked in the \nRepublican cloakroom for several years while she was a law student. As \nfor Mary's own political affiliation, I don't have any idea. She was a \ntrue professional. It is to her credit that she was in service to the \nDemocratic side of the aisle but had equal respect for both sides of \nthe aisle. She was beyond partisanship. She really was a part of the \nwhole Senate family. She treated everyone with such respect and \nprofessionalism, so gracious to junior staffers and pages and Senators \nalike.\n  She performed so many countless acts of kindness in the 21 years she \nserved here. People are now speaking out about those and I am glad they \nshared some of them. If a coworker needed a kind word, Mary was one of \nthe first. Once a coworker had a financial difficulty. Mary found out \nabout it and lent that person some money, then gently refused to accept \nfull repayment. She was such a good and generous person. Mary will be \nmissed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11116-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FINAL WEEK OF THE 109TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today we begin the final week, as I \nunderstand it, for the work created for the 109th Congress. There are \nonly a few days left to complete a mountain of work, 2 years of work, \nreally. The mission we have before the Senate these next few days is an \nimpossible mission. It is truly a mission impossible, but we have to \ntry.\n  The American people made it clear last month they want Members to \nwork together. The judgment was held on whether a one-party town works \nand the American people said no. We have to work together. We have to \nwork together this week and certainly when we come back after the first \nof the year.\n  To accomplish what needs to be accomplished in the next few days is \nmission impossible. We cannot get it all done. Appropriations bills, \nbudget, health care nominations, conference reports for all kinds of \nthings that, as I have said, somehow never make it to the other side of \nthe Capitol.\n  I told Democratic Senators gathered recently that many of them have \nnever, ever, participated in a conference, a conference between the \nHouse and Senate. Why? Because the Republicans would not hold them. We \nsimply did not have them. Some of the most memorable times of my career \nwere when I participated in conferences. A bill passed the Senate, a \nbill passed the House, you meet together, Democrats and Republicans, \nHouse and Senate, to work out the differences.\n  This administration and the Republican-dominated House and Senate did \nnot believe in that. They did not believe in 200 years of experience. \nThey did not hold conferences. They would bring a bill back that the \nRepublicans in the House and the Republicans in the Senate agreed upon. \nWe had to take it or leave it, period.\n  That is not the way it is going to be next year. We are going to have \nSenators participating in things that many of them have never \nparticipated in: a real live conference, where Democrats and \nRepublicans from the House and the Senate meet in a room and work out \nthe differences on a bill.\n  This year we have so much to do. And as I said, it is mission \nimpossible. If we had years left, if we had months left, if we had \nweeks left in the 109th Congress, maybe we could do something about it. \nBut we have days remaining to finish all the items I have mentioned, \nand many more.\n  I want to comment briefly. My friend, the distinguished majority \nleader, talked about the nuclear option. One reason we are here in the \nwaning moments of the 109th Congress trying to complete the work that \nneeds to be completed is because, again, the Republicans who control \nthe House and the Senate--but here in this instance the Senate--decided \nto do away with 200 years of experience in this Senate. It was decided \nby the Republicans--because there were 55 Republicans and 45 \nDemocrats--that they did not want the Senate to be the Senate. They \nwanted the Senate to be the House.\n  In the House of Representatives, if you have more than the other \nparty, you get whatever you want. That is not how the Senate has worked \nfor more than 200 years. The Republicans in the Senate in the 109th \nCongress said, we want another House of Representatives. They adopted \nthe so-called nuclear option. They were not getting enough judges, \nenough of their rightwing, ideological judges. They were not getting \nenough--but it was well over 100. I don't know how many it is now. They \nwere not getting enough. They wanted every one of them and they were \nwilling to throw the traditions of this Senate overboard.\n  One of the negative things that happened in my political career was \nhaving to oppose the nuclear option. I said at the time, I say today, \nthe most important thing I have ever worked on in my governmental \ncareer is the nuclear option because it was so anti-Senate, so \nantigovernment. I said in the Senate, why are you doing this? Why are \nyou doing this, my friends, the Republicans? It would take a miracle \nfor us to retake the Senate. As a result of the nuclear option and the \nother very bad things this Republican-dominated Senate did, the miracle \noccurred. One reason it occurred is because of the nuclear option. The \nAmerican people knew that was beyond the pale.\n  We want to get our work done this year. We are willing to work up \nuntil Christmas, if necessary. We want to finish what we have to \nfinish. I have talked to the majority leader. He knows the things I \nthink should be done, must be done. We are leaving many things undone. \nHowever, as I said before, it is mission impossible. We cannot do it \nall; there is simply not enough time.\n  We spent too much time on the nuclear option, on estate tax, on gay \nmarriage, on flag burning. The American people said, Why don't you work \non our issues? On November 7, they said, Work together on our issues. \nWe are committed to working together on the issues of the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11116-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I agree with my colleague, the Democratic \nleader, Senator Reid. We spend a lot of time making speeches in the \nSenate. Elected officials and Government officials and politicians \nacross America speak a lot to the American people. The American people \nhave an opportunity once every 2 years to speak to us. On November 7 \nthe American people spoke to the Members of Congress. The message was \nvery clear. It was a message calling for change and new direction.\n  Equally important, it was a message from the American people to the \nMembers of the Senate and the House, stop the infighting, roll up your \nsleeves, do your work, get your work done, and do something to help \nAmerica, help the families across America, who count on you to be \nresponsive to the costs of health insurance, the cost of gasoline, the \nissues that confront us in America.\n  That was the message of November 7, a message of change. And there \nwill be changes in Congress as a result of that election. That is why \nit was such a surprise for us to return to Washington at the end of \nthis session and to hear the Republican leadership in the House and the \nSenate announce that, frankly, they were going to adjourn without doing \ntheir work.\n  The Republican leaders in the Senate and the House have decided to \nrace for the exits. They have decided to leave without doing the most \nfundamental job Congress is expected to do; that is, pass the spending \nbills, pass the appropriations bills so our Government can continue to \nperform the valuable functions which are their responsibility.\n  To call this Congress a do-nothing Congress would slight Harry \nTruman's original 1948 do-nothing Congress. The congressional scholar \nThomas Mann pointed out that even that do-nothing Congress of 1948 did \npass the Marshall Plan, and that was certainly historic and noteworthy.\n  According to Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein, this Congress worked \nless than 100 days this year. It is like the average person who works \nacross America showing up for work 2 days a week. Would you expect to \nget a full paycheck, would you expect to get praise from your boss if \nyou worked 2 days a week instead of 5? The 100 days was less than any \nother Congress in our lifetimes. For at least 25 of those days, \nincidentally, there were no votes scheduled before 6:30 in the evening, \nso they were really more like half days or quarter days. Yet during \nthat period of time, this Congress refused to increase the minimum wage \nfor millions of American workers, who got up this morning, and every \nsingle morning, to clean the rooms and bus the tables and wash the \ndishes and prepare the food for America, at a minimum wage of $5.15 an \nhour.\n  For 10 straight years, this Congress has refused to give those \npeople, struggling at the lowest end of income in America, an increase \nin the minimum wage. And for 10 years, Congress has voted itself a pay \nraise during that period of time to the tune of $30,000, saying no to \nminimum wage workers and yes to Members of Congress--another \nillustration of how this Republican Congress lost its way and forgot \nthe values that should bind us together as Americans.\n  Well, the Democrats heard the message voters sent last month. We are \nready to work hard for the American people, as hard as they work for \ntheir own families. But let's be clear. It is not going to be easy to \nclean up the financial mess of 12 years of Republican control of \nCongress.\n  We wanted to start off the 110th Congress, the next Congress, by \nworking on urgent challenges, such as health care and making it more \naffordable, helping middle-class families pay for college, and we will \nfocus on those. But at the same time, we have to finish the unfinished \nwork of this Republican Congress.\n  The last time a new majority party took charge of both Houses, in \n1994, the Democrats passed every single appropriations bill by October \n1, which is the deadline. That marked the last time all these bills \nwere passed on time, by the way.\n  Now that the Democrats are taking over both Houses, will the \nRepublicans finish their work before leaving town? Sadly, they will \nnot. It is a fitting end to the do-nothing Congress. They will not only \ndo nothing this year, they will do less when it comes to meeting their \nconstitutional responsibility.\n  Refusing to work on this year's budget is just the tip of the \niceberg. The increase in our national debt left behind by this \nRepublican Congress and this administration and the deterioration of \nour fiscal health are a matter of public record. The President likes to \nsay we are on track to ``cut the deficit in half'' by the time he \nleaves office.\n  But, as Paul Harvey says, let's go to the rest of the story. First, \nthere was no national deficit when President Bush took office. \nPresident Clinton eliminated the deficit and we were paying down our \nnational debt.\n  Second, this year's $248 billion deficit, which the White House \npoints to as a source of pride, is still nearly as large as the largest \ndeficit under the first President Bush, which was, until this President \nBush, the largest deficit in U.S. history.\n  Third, and most important, that $248 billion figure for this year's \ndeficit is not a true reflection of fiscal reality. It does not include \nthe interest we have to pay on all of that borrowing, nor does it \ninclude all the funds that have been raided from the Social Security \ntrust fund that will have to be paid back. When you add up all of that, \nwe do not have a national deficit of $248 billion; our deficit is $546 \nbillion, more than twice what the President admits.\n  If you want to understand how big a hole the Republicans are leaving \nbehind after this Congress, look at our national debt. Why? Because \nwhen you sit down with your family's finances, what do you really worry \nabout? How many new charges you put on your credit card in the last \nmonth or the total amount you owe on that credit card? It is the total \namount of the debt that matters. The total amount of debt on our \nnational credit card today is $8.5 trillion--$3 trillion more today \nthan when President Bush took office 6 years ago. That is $30,000 in \ndebt for every man, woman, and child in America.\n  Think about this fact: Under President Bush, America has borrowed \nmore money from foreign governments to keep our ship of state afloat, \nborrowed more money than all of the Presidents in the history of the \nUnited States combined. And who are the creditors? China, Japan, many \nothers--the same countries that, sadly, are showing an advantage when \nit comes to trading with the United States.\n  The Nation's fiscal situation is difficult. If we continue to follow \nthe Republican playbook, it would only get worse. By 2011, the national \ndebt would grow to $11.6 trillion. That is nearly $40,000 in debt for \nevery American. It is a debt tax that is being left by this Republican \nCongress. We cannot sustain this level of debt. David Walker of the \nGovernment Accountability Office recently said:\n\n       The status quo is unacceptable and unsustainable, and \n     anybody who tells you--whether they be Republican, Democrat, \n     or Independent--that we can solve this problem without having \n     to reform entitlement programs, re-engineering the base of \n     discretionary spending, and have additional tax revenues--\n     anybody who says that we are not going to have to do all \n     three of those is not telling you the truth. It's as simple \n     as that.\n\n  The American people deserve honest budgeting and a restoration of the \n``pay as you go principle''--not more out-of-control deficits. The \nAmerican people deserve better than a Congress that votes itself a pay \nraise and continues to vote that the minimum wage stay without any \nincrease.\n  Americans want ethical standards for Congress that are tough and \nenforced, a plan to protect our country with the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations, help in paying for college for working families, lower \nprices for prescription drugs, Federal support for stem cell research, \na real national energy plan, and much more. They deserve a Congress \nthat works as hard as Americans work themselves.\n  Sadly, this Congress is going to be AWOL, absent without leave.

The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11118-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11118-S11125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Sergeant First Class Gregory Rogers\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor this afternoon \nto honor Army SFC Gregory Rogers. Gregory Rogers was from Deer Park, \nOH. He was killed on April 9, 2006, when a roadside bomb detonated near \nhis humvee in Iraq. He was serving in his third tour of duty in Iraq \nwith the 101st Airborne Division's 4th Brigade Combat Team. He was 42 \nyears of age when he died.\n  Gregory Rogers grew up in Deer Park and graduated from Deer Park High \nSchool. During his 22-year career in the Army, he received dozens of \nservice medals, including the Meritorious Service Medal and the Army \nAchievement Medal.\n  After high school, Gregory worked with his uncle in vending. Although \nGregory initially tried this career path, he could not ignore his \npassion--to serve in the U.S. Army. So he joined the military. His \nbrother Kevin recalls that ``It's what he lived for.''\n  A career soldier, Gregory played an integral role in the first gulf \nwar in 1991 and had also spent time serving in Afghanistan and in South \nAmerica. He was in the initial invasion force in Iraq and spent a few \nyears as a drill instructor and as an airborne Ranger, jumping out of \ncombat helicopters.\n  He was highly regarded by all who knew him. Army BG John Bartley \nsaid, ``We tried so hard to bring Gregory home unharmed. He will always \nbe in our hearts and prayers. He will always be an American hero.'' \nMany of Gregory's comrades wrote letters about him, calling him ``a \ntrue soldier in every sense of the word.''\n  Gregory's father, Luther Rogers, said this about his son's commitment \nto service:\n\n       Being a soldier was what he always wanted to do, and he \n     always did his job.\n\n  Gregory's brother Kevin echoed this sentiment, saying:\n\n       [Gregory] liked traveling the world; he was dedicated to \n     his country.\n\n  Gregory came from a large family and was extremely close to his \nfather and his mother Donna, as well as his two brothers, Jeff and \nKevin, and his sister Tammy. His brothers communicated with Gregory \nalmost daily through e-mails and instant messages. His older brother \nJeff wants Gregory to know that ``We're very proud of him, we miss him, \nand we love him.''\n  Although he intended to retire in 2003, Gregory received orders to \nstay in the service and ended up serving two additional tours of duty. \nHis brother Jeff remembers that ``[Gregory] believed in what he did--\n[and that was] making a difference.''\n  Once he completed his last tour in December 2006, Gregory was finally \ngoing to retire. He would be able to spend more time with the love of \nhis life, his wife Sandy, and their two daughters, Whitney and Chelsea. \nTragically, however, in 2005, Sandy died. Although she had suffered \nfrom type I diabetes since childhood, Sandy had just received a new \ninsulin pump and her sugar levels were coming under control. Connie \nRoot, a caretaker for Sandy during her illness, said her passing came \nas a shock. ``Greg loved his wife very much,'' recalls Connie, ``and he \ntook care of her and was always very supportive.''\n  Even in the face of his beloved wife's death, Gregory wanted to give \nhope to another family. Before his wife Sandy died, she and Gregory had \nagreed to donate her insulin pump to a child who needed it. Gregory \nwrote that if Sandy would have had the pump when she was a child, she \nwould still have been alive today. Beth Smith, a senior diabetes \nmanagement consultant for MedTronic, which manufactured insulin pumps, \nsaid that in the many years of working with diabetic patients, she has \nnever known anyone to donate a pump specifically to a child.\n  Before Gregory Rogers could choose a recipient for his wife's insulin \npump, and just 2 months after her death, he was deployed to Iraq. While \nthere, Gregory received information about Jessica Burkhart, a young \ngirl in need of Sandy's insulin pump, and he decided to donate it to \nher. He chose Jessica as the recipient of his wife's pump. Just 13 \nyears old, Jessica Burkhart had been diagnosed with type I diabetes and \nneeded the pump to regulate her blood sugar levels. Her family could \nnot afford a new pump, which costs around $6,000. When Jessica heard \nthe news that she would receive Sandy's insulin pump, she could not \nwait to thank the man who was giving her new hope in life. Jessica and \nGregory then became pen pals. In her first e-mail, an elated Jessica \nwrote:\n\n       Thank you so much for choosing me over so many people. \n     Thank you so much again.\n\n  Rogers responded a week later, writing:\n\n       I know you must hate shots. I know I hated my wife \n     struggling with her sugar and having to take sometimes up to \n     14 shots a day, so I know what a pain it must be.\n\n  It turned out that Jessica and Gregory shared something other than \nthe struggle against diabetes. They both loved softball. Gregory told \nJessica he loved the game and looked forward to coming home so he could \nplay again. In every e-mail, Jessica thanked Gregory for the pump. She \nupdated him on how it was already changing her life for the better. He \nalways signed his letters to her ``Your friend Greg.'' Gregory's father \nLuther learned about the donation after his son died. He said:\n\n       I'm really proud of my son for doing that.\n\n  Mr. President, Jessica Burkhart is just one of many who will miss \nGregory Rogers. No sacrifice was too great for the man who dedicated \nhis life to protecting his country, his family, and the life of an \nunknown child in one of his darkest hours.\n  He was a good son, husband, brother, and father. Though he will be \nmissed tremendously, he will never be forgotten.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Gregory's family in our thoughts \nand in our prayers.\n  (Mr. COCHRAN assumed the Chair.)\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Gordon G. Solomon\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fellow Ohioan and a brave \nMarine who gave his life in service to our Nation. On August 24, 2006, \nMarine SSG Gordon G. Solomon was killed by an improvised explosive \ndevice while conducting combat operations against enemy forces in the \nAl Anbar Province of Iraq. He was 35 years old.\n  Growing up in Fairborn, OH, Gordon was eager to begin serving his \ncountry in the military. He graduated from Fairborn High School in 1990 \nand joined the Marines in June of that same year. For Gordon, there was \nsimply no time to waste.\n  In April 2006, before leaving for Iraq, Gordon joined the 3rd \nBattalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, 2nd Marine \nExpeditionary Force, based out of Camp Lejeune, NC. Once in Iraq, he \nwas selected to work with the Iraqi Army as a part of the Military \nTransition Team.\n  As an infantry unit leader in charge of a platoon, Gordon left a \ngreat legacy. His heroism and leadership were evident to all, and his \nservice earned him many awards and medals. His decorations are too \nnumerous to list here, but they include a Purple Heart with a gold \nstar, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, a Combat Action \nRibbon, an Iraqi Campaign Medal, and a Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal.\n  Those who knew and loved Gordon will always remember him for his \ndedication to his friends. Back in 1920, MG John A. Lejeune stressed \nthe importance of camaraderie in the Marines Corps. He wrote that ``the \nspirit of comradeship and brotherhood in arms, which has traditionally \nexisted throughout the ranks of the Marines Corps, is a vital \ncharacteristic of the Corps. It must be fostered and kept alive. . . \n.''\n  Over 85 years later, those words still hold true today. Looking at \nthe lives of Marines, like Gordon, we can truly say that they have \nnever lost the spirit of comradeship and brotherhood. It is certainly \nalive today.\n  On September 8, 2006, Gordon's life was honored--along with six of \nhis Marine brothers--at a memorial service held at a chapel in Iraq. \nMore than 200 Marines and sailors attended the service, where the seven \nrifles were placed in front of the chapel, each inverted\n\n[[Page S11119]]\n\nwith the helmets resting on top. Identification tags for each Marine \nhung from the rifles.\n  Gordon's friend and fellow Marine, SSG Frank Lipcsak from Lima \nCompany, spoke about Gordon during the service. He remembered how \nGordon became known for always being a team player. That's simply the \ntype of person Gordon was--always willing to work with others, always \nwilling to do his best for the greater good. ``He and I became pretty \ngood friends in the short time that he was with us,'' the Staff \nSergeant recalled. ``When you talked to Gordon Solomon you were dealing \nwith a man, a Marine, and a staff non-commissioned officer--in that \norder.''\n  He also said that even after Gordon left Lima Company, he still made \ntime to come back and visit with his old company. This is what he said:\n\n       [Gordon] would come back to our company area from time to \n     time to hang out with us and see how things were going with \n     our Marines. I have faith that Gordon is in a better place. \n     He was our brother, and we miss him dearly. Our prayers are \n     with his wife, son, and the rest of his family.\n\n  At the memorial service, LT Todd S. Desgrosseilliers, the battalion's \ncommanding officer, spoke of the bravery and courage that Gordon and \nhis fellow fallen Marines exhibited.\n\n       Look no further for heroes. We know seven of them. . . . We \n     memorialize them because, in the end, they were true to their \n     word. They swore an oath that they would follow orders and \n     defend our Nation against all enemies foreign and domestic. \n     They gave a part of themselves to be a part of something \n     larger than themselves. We honor their sacrifice and their \n     courage in the face of danger. They will forever be with us.\n\n  Unquestionably, Gordon Solomon was a man who believed in the greater \ngood. He served America selflessly--more concerned for the safety and \nwell-being of others than for his own. He defined bravery and courage.\n  When I think of the sacrifice made by SSG Gordon Solomon, I think of \nwords once spoken by one of our country's greatest leaders, President \nDwight D. Eisenhower, when he said:\n\n       Neither a wise man nor a brave man lies down on the tracks \n     of history to wait for the train of the future to run over \n     him.\n\n  Indeed, Gordon Solomon never lied down on those tracks. Instead, he \nwas moving into the future, making history as he went. He was wise, and \nhe was brave. With his life and actions, he changed the world so that \nwe all live in a better and safer place. He did not sit idle. He did \nnot rest. Rather, he willingly chose to serve our Nation the best way \nhe knew how--as a United States Marine.\n  We are eternally grateful for the incredible service that Gordon \nprovided during his time with the Marines. It is clear that he had a \ngreat impact on the men and women with whom he served. A dedicated \nMarine, who loved his family and his friends, Gordon will be deeply \nmissed. His death is a loss to us all.\n  As 1LT Barry Edwards noted, ``[When] losing a Marine, especially a \nwell-decorated one like this, the loss will be felt by the unit and \nMarine Corp-wide.''\n  My wife, Fran, and I will continue to keep Gordon and his family in \nour thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                           Sergeant Adam Knox\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army Sergeant Adam \nKnox, who was killed on September 17, 2006, when his patrol encountered \nsmall-arms fire during combat operations in Baghdad, Iraq. Sergeant \nKnox was assigned to the 346th Psychological Operations Company, based \nin Columbus, OH. He was 21 years old.\n  Adam was born on January 26, 1985. As a life-long resident of the \nColumbus area, he developed strong relationships with his family and \nfriends. Friends describe Adam as a ``man's man,'' who loved rebuilding \nand taking care of cars, especially his prized possession--a Z28 Camaro \nthat he would ``scrub inside and out every weekend.'' Friends say that \nAdam's inclination to precision and order made him well-suited for the \nArmy.\n  Adam graduated from Westland High School in Galloway, OH, and shared \nwith his friends and family his love for the Ohio State University \nBuckeyes football team. In fact, Adam was probably one of the Buckeye's \nbiggest fans--he would cheer so loudly during football games that his \nfriends said ``people two counties over could hear him.'' Adam even \nmissed his homecoming dance at Westland High School to watch an Ohio \nState football game. While living in Columbus, Adam was also a \ndedicated worker at a Meijer store, Skyline Chili and, just before he \nmobilized with his unit, at a business-products wholesaler operation.\n  Adam loved his family and was very proud that his father, Jay Knox, \nhad served in the Army. In fact, it was his father's service and \ninfluence that played a major part in Adam's own decision to join the \nArmy Reserves in 2003, just after he graduated from high school. \nAlthough Adam's father Jay was sick with an inoperable spinal tumor \nwhen his son enlisted, he lived long enough to see Adam complete most \nof his training. After the loss of his father, Adam sought to continue \nhis father's legacy of fighting for our country.\n  In March 2006, Adam deployed with the 346th Psychological Operations \nCompany to Iraq. Part of the company's job is to help the United States \ndevelop relationships with the Iraqi people. Adam handed out candy and \nsoccer balls to Iraqi children, and he ate dinner with Iraqi officials. \nAdam loved his mission and truly believed in what the military was \ndoing in Iraq.\n  Indeed, Adam touched countless lives through his service to America \nand his support of the Iraqi people. Adam would often tell friends that \npeople should focus on the good that individual soldiers were doing in \nIraq. It was this optimism and strength that made Adam so special.\n  Even while serving in Iraq, Adam was still a die-hard fan of Ohio \nState football. During the Ohio State versus Texas game, he eagerly \nstayed up until 2 a.m., so he could watch. Adam also scheduled his \nleave around the Ohio State versus Michigan game, so he could be in \nColumbus at the time. Adam's goal was to attend The Ohio State \nUniversity after his military service. I am certain that Adam would \nhave reached this goal, and that his family and friends would have been \nvery proud.\n  The same qualities that made Adam an outstanding human being made him \nan exceptional soldier. He was a dedicated and courageous soldier, who \nwas greatly respected by his comrades. When his patrol team found a \nweapons cache, he was the first person to go through the entrance to \nthe building. Adam's fellow soldiers looked to him for his bravery and \nsupport.\n  Because of his hard work and commitment in the field, Adam was \nquickly promoted to Sergeant on September 15, 2006, after only three \nyears in the Army. He had told his mother that he had only about \nanother week left of dangerous missions in Baghdad, and then he would \nbe sent back to his unit to train other soldiers.\n  For his bravery and service to our Nation, Adam received multiple \nawards, including the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, National Defense \nService Medal, Iraqi Campaign Medal, and the Armed Forces Reserve \nMedal.\n  MG Herbert Shuler, who commands the Army's Psychological Operations \nand Civil Affairs and who served with Adam, said this about him: \n``Every generation has its heroes. Adam Knox is a hero for this \ngeneration.''\n  One of Adam's friends and fellow Marines, SGT Travis Watson, spoke at \na memorial service in Adam's honor in Iraq. And on an Internet tribute \nwebsite, Travis left the following message for Adam's family:\n\n       I send my sympathies for your loss of Adam. He was a dear \n     friend of all of us at the 346th, and he will be terribly \n     missed. I feel extremely fortunate to have spent the time I \n     did with him and to have deployed with him. He was a very \n     good soldier, and an even better friend.\n\n  Adam was an outstanding person--someone who was loved dearly by his \nfamily and friends, his fellow servicemembers, the children of Iraq, \nand simply anyone else who came in contact with him. Adam truly is a \nsymbol of bravery, sacrifice, and honor. We owe it to him to celebrate \nhis life--a life devoted to helping others and keeping us safe. It is \nin these good deeds that his memory lives on.\n  Adam Knox was a caring, brave, and selfless man. He will be \nremembered as a devoted son, a kind brother, and a beloved friend. The \nworld is a better place because of him.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Adam's mother Deborah and his \nbrothers Tom and Tony in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n[[Page S11120]]\n\n                         CORPORAL ROBERT WEBER\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a young Ohioan who lost \nhis life while serving our Nation on his second tour of duty in Iraq--\nArmy Corporal Robert Weber, from Western Hills. Corporal Weber was \nkilled on September 30, 2006, when his military vehicle overturned. He \nwas 22 years old.\n  Mr. President, as a soldier, Corporal Weber took great pride in \nreconstructing Iraq. He told his family that he and his fellow soldiers \nwere building schools, roads, and churches. He was a brave young man \nwho was deeply committed to serving and aiding our Nation. For his \ndedicated service in the Army and his unwavering courage, he earned the \ndistinguished Bronze Star Medal.\n  Robert, who was called ``Bobby'' by those closest to him, grew up in \nDelhi Township outside Cincinnati, as the only child of Cathy and \nMartin Weber. Robin McIntosh, a family friend, describes Bobby as, ``a \nsweet, caring young man, who died doing something he believed in. He \nknew the risks, but felt he was doing the right thing.''\n  Bobby was dedicated both to his family and to his country. His aunt, \nDebbie Niehoff, recalls that Bobby loved children and enjoyed spending \ntime with his younger relatives, wrestling and playing. They all looked \nup to him.\n  Bobby's love and dedication to children compelled him to dream about \none day becoming a history teacher. To pursue his goal, he enlisted in \nthe Army several months after graduating from Dater High School in \n2003. Mary Ann Ellis, an English teacher at Dater High School who \ntaught Bobby for 2 years, said she enjoyed his quiet nature and \nthorough work ethic. ``He was very giving, loving, and funny,'' she \ndescribed.\n  Fresh out of basic and advanced training in May 2004, Bobby was \nassigned to the artillery battalion of the 3rd brigade, based in Fort \nLewis, WA. Major Robert Bennett was the artillery battalion's \noperations officer at the time. He said this about Bobby:\n\n       Weber was one of those kids who never met a stranger in his \n     life. He was outgoing, very friendly. He was just a good kid. \n     He always wanted to be helpful.\n\n  Jason Thompson, who served with Bobby, described their time together \nin a message on an Internet tribute website:\n\n       [Bobby] was a very good man. I served with Weber in his \n     first tour to Iraq. He spent a lot of time on my truck as a \n     gunner. He had a wonderful sense of humor and always kept a \n     smile on my face. He will be missed.\n\n  Mr. President, between his first and second assignments in Iraq, \nBobby stopped by his old high school. By the stories he shared there, \nyou could tell that he really felt like he was doing the right thing. \nHis former teacher, Mary Ann Ellis, explained that ``he was very \nexcited about serving his country . . . and proud of the work he was \ndoing.'' Principal Beverly Eby remembers that during his visit, Bobby \nexplained to staff that the tour conditions were very hot, but that \n``he had found his place.''\n  While e-mailing his family back home, Bobby described his work in his \nsecond tour in Iraq as tougher and more dangerous. He worked as a \ngunner and was put in many difficult situations. But his positive \nattitude kept him--and his fellow soldiers--going. Major Robert Bennett \nrecalls one of his upbeat moments:\n\n       Even if we were in the field, [or] if it was raining like \n     crazy, up to our knees in muck and mud, he'd say ``Sir, it \n     rained about five percent less in my tent last night, so I'd \n     say things are looking up!''\n\n  Bobby was light-hearted and good-natured. He enjoyed teasing Major \nBennett about baseball. Bobby was a fervent fan of the Cincinnati Reds \nand never missed a chance to rib his senior officer about baseball. \nMajor Bennett remembers, ``He used to give me unending grief about my \nbeloved Chicago Cubs.''\n  Besides his passion for the Cincinnati Reds, Bobby also loved the \nmountains and talked about living there after this tour of duty was up. \nHis aunt Debbie remembers when Bobby first spoke of joining the \nmilitary. ``I wasn't thrilled about his decision,'' she said. ``But, he \nwas very adamant about serving his country.'' She remembers how proud \nBobby was of the rebuilding work he was doing with the Army.\n  Of course Debbie, as well as Bobby's other family and friends, will \nremember much more than just his bravery and service in Iraq. They will \nremember his good character and willingness to help anyone in need. \nDebbie remembers a snowstorm that hit during the 2004 Christmas season. \nBobby came over to her house and shoveled her driveway. Afterwards, he \nwent over to his aunt's neighbor, who was home with her two children, \nand did the same for her. But he didn't stop there. ``He worked all day \nhelping neighbors,'' Debbie recalls.\n  Bobby and his bright blue eyes are dearly missed. His bravery is \nmatched only by the size of his big heart. He was a good person, who \nwas full of life and had a passion to serve.\n  I think the marquee outside his high school on the day of his funeral \nsaid it best: ``Out of our lives. But not out of our hearts.''\n  Indeed, Mr. President, Bobby Weber will remain always in our hearts.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep his family and friends in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                     MASTER SERGEANT BRAD CLEMMONS\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of MSgt Brad Clemmons, \nfrom Chillicothe, OH. On August 21, 2006, Master Sergeant Clemmons died \nwhen his convoy in Iraq was hit by an improvised explosive device. At \nthe time, he had been serving in Iraq for only two weeks. He was 37 \nyears old.\n  Master Sergeant Clemmons was the husband of Rebecca and the devoted \nfather of Isabelle, Nicholas, and Zachary. He was also the son of David \nClemmons and Pamela Clemmons, and the brother of Amy, Shelley, and \nMichael Clemmons. He is also survived by his grandparents--Cecil and \nAnne Clemmons, and Richard and Marjorie Graves.\n  Two days before his death, Brad's wife Rebecca told him that he was \ngoing to be a dad for the fourth time. She remembers that Brad, a \ndoting father, was delighted by the news. It is, indeed, tragic that \nBrad did not live to see his new baby. However, the child is expected \nto be born in April, and Rebecca says it will be named Brad if it's a \nboy.\n  Even as a child, Brad felt drawn to the military. His childhood \nfriend Marcus Bost remembers the days when he and Brad would play war \ngames together; that is, if they weren't already busy chasing snakes or \ncatching crawdads in Stoney Creek. Brad's mother recalls that her son \nwould even pretend to make bombs out of tubes of Old Spice deodorant.\n  Explosives interested Brad. And it was this interest that led him to \na successful career in the military, where he an explosive ordnance \ndisposal craftsman--someone who helped diffuse bombs.\n  Brad entered the Air Force in 1987, after graduating from \nSoutheastern High School. He had signed up to join even before his 18th \nbirthday. According to his father, Brad had always known that the \nmilitary was going to be his career.\n  Brad was deployed to Iraq as a weapons intelligence flight team \nleader for the 354th Civil Engineer Squadron, based in Alaska. His work \nin Iraq was both critical and dangerous. According to LTC Frank \nFreeman, Brad's job was to lead his team in collecting crucial evidence \nand post-blast analysis of improvised explosive devices--IEDs--the \nnumber one killer in Iraq. Brad would then take what he learned and \nteach his fellow servicemen how to remain safe from IEDs.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Freeman particularly remembers Brad's leadership \ncapability. During a memorial ceremony for Brad in Iraq, he said the \nfollowing:\n\n       One of his best qualities was [Brad's] leadership. His team \n     couldn't wait to get back out after the incident, because \n     they know that is what Sergeant Clemmons would want them to \n     do. In times of war, we see human nature at its extremes. We \n     see it at both its absolute worst and absolute best. Today, \n     we honor one of the best. Brad was a true hero; a hero who \n     put service before self and died in the line of duty.\n\n  Lieutenant Colonel Stan Giles, a chaplain, also remembered Brad's \nextraordinary bravery, saying this:\n\n       Nearly 20 years ago, Brad entered perhaps the most \n     dangerous of all career fields. He became an instructor in \n     the most dangerous of all professions and then volunteered to \n     work in the most dangerous of all neighborhoods here in Iraq.\n\n  Brad spent nearly 20 years of his life serving our Nation in the Air \nForce.\n\n[[Page S11121]]\n\nWhen he died, he was on a mission to analyze two reported IEDs--simply, \nhe was working to keep his fellow servicemembers safe. For his bravery \nand dedication, Brad received both the Purple Heart and the Bronze \nStar.\n  Clearly, Brad was an exceptional Airman, but he was also an \nexceptional human being. Pastor F. Douglas Hudson is a reserve military \nchaplain in Rammstein, Germany, where Brad had once been stationed. \nHudson came to know both Brad and his wife Rebecca well, and baptized \ntheir daughter, Isabelle. Hudson recalls that he was always impressed \nby Brad's wit, knowledge, and devotion to his family. This is what he \nsaid about Brad:\n\n       He was always talking about training the soldiers and \n     getting them prepared for the worst-case scenario. If there's \n     one thing I can say about Brad, I'm not sure if he was afraid \n     of anything.\n\n  Brad was a wonderful man, completely dedicated to his family and \nthose he loved. His parents recall that he was an honors student who \nconsistently held himself to the very highest standards. Pam remembers, \n``He was one of the most honest people that I've ever met in my life.''\n  It was while serving in Germany that Brad met Rebecca--the love of \nhis life. She remembers that she was first drawn to Brad because of his \nway with children. ``He was Uncle Brad to everybody,'' she recalls. As \na couple, Brad and Rebecca were always happiest simply spending time \nwith family and friends, doing things like going to church or playing \nboard games.\n  Before Brad left for Iraq, Rebecca put her feelings into a poem she \ngave to him. This is what she wrote:\n\n       As you leave tomorrow, promise we won't be far apart.\n       As you leave tomorrow, promise the love will never part.\n\n  Brad kept this poem close to him until the day he died. According to \nRebecca, ``He didn't like you to know he was a sentimentalist. He \ncarried it around in his wallet.''\n  Brad will always be a hero to his family, not just because he served \nin Iraq, but simply because of his love and compassion. In Rebecca's \nwords, Brad ``was a great person. He was a great father, a great \nhusband--a dedicated father, dedicated to serving his country.''\n  Brad's mother remembers his last words to her--``That he loved me,'' \nshe said. She continued. ``And that's one thing that I always knew--\nthat his family and his country were uppermost in his life and God is \nnumber one. And my son is with God tonight.''\n  Mr. President, I was fortunate enough to attend the calling hours in \nBrad's memory. I am honored that I had the opportunity to meet his wife \nRebecca, his mother Pam and his father David. As I learned talking to \nthem, Brad Clemmons was, indeed, an exceptional human being, who was \nloved by his wife, his children, his parents, his family, his friends, \nhis fellow Air Force airmen, and anyone else who met him. His Aunt \nJackie Arbaugh remembers that he simply had a magnetic personality. As \nshe put it, ``He was a fine young man. He was just loved by everyone \nwho knew him.''\n  Brad Clemmons was a good person--someone who will always be \nremembered both for his laughter and his intelligence. Because he \nlived, our world is a better place. My wife Fran and I will continue to \nkeep his family in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                      Sergeant Justin Tyler Walsh\n\n  Mr. President, this afternoon I come to the Senate floor to pay \ntribute to a selfless marine from Cuyahoga Falls, OH--SGT Justin Tyler \nWalsh. Justin died on October 11, 2006, after he had been critically \nwounded by an improvised explosive device 1 week earlier in Al Anbar \nProvince in Iraq. Justin was 24 years of age at the time of his death.\n  Justin enlisted in the Marines shortly after graduating Cuyahoga \nFalls High School in 2001. Greg Roth, his advanced placement U.S. \nHistory teacher, said that Justin had talked about going into the \nMarines from the time he was a freshman. He had a great sense of humor \nbut a serious side as well. Roth said:\n\n       Justin [just] seemed to know what was important and what \n     wasn't. You're talking about a fantastic young man.\n\n  At Cuyahoga Falls High, Justin played football. He also wrestled. Don \nRoss was Justin's football coach there and remembers that Justin was \nextremely hard working. He recalls this about him:\n\n       Justin wasn't your biggest lineman, but he made up for his \n     lack of size with hustle. He always had a tremendous attitude \n     and always had a smile on his face. He was a great kid. As a \n     football coach, you don't always remember all your players. \n     But, he was one of those players who you always remember.\n\n  Justin was also involved in the school's student council and was a \nmember of the Latin Club, National Honor Society, and Fellowship of \nChristian Athletes.\n  Humanities teacher Joel Morgan remembers that Justin was a focused \nyoung man who led by example.\n\n       I remember his leadership skills in the classroom. He did \n     it in a way that the other students didn't know he was doing \n     it. If you needed him to bail you out of a quiet, \n     nonparticipating event, you could count on Justin to get the \n     conversation going.\n\n  Upon entering the Marines in 2001, Justin trained to become a \nnuclear, biological, and chemical defense specialist. He was deployed \nto Kuwait as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom on January 9, 2003. He \nserved for 6 months in his first deployment and returned to Iraq less \nthan 1 year later for his second deployment. It was during this \ndeployment that he was promoted to the rank of sergeant.\n  Still, Justin pushed himself further. He requested a lateral move \nwithin the Marine Corps to the Explosive Ordinance Disposal field where \nhe would be working on bomb disposal.\n  Justin quickly learned the new skills needed for this job and \ngraduated from EOD school in November of 2005. Eager to continue his \nservice and to utilize his new training, he left for his third Iraq \ndeployment in August 2006. During this time, he conducted numerous EOD \ncombat missions where he rendered safe roadside bombs. Ultimately, \nthough, this was the work that would take Justin's life.\n  On October 5, 2006, Justin was disassembling a roadside bomb, working \nto ensure the safety of his fellow marines, as well as other military \nand civilian personnel. A second roadside bomb in the area detonated, \ncritically wounding Justin. He received medical care both in Iraq and \nGermany before being transferred to the National Naval Medical Center \nin Maryland.\n  Justin died from his wounds on October 11, 2006, with his family and \nclose friends by his side. His father James said his son was proud to \nbe a marine, and he was glad Justin passed away in the country that he \ndied fighting for.\n  After his death, Justin was honored by his alma mater during their \nhomecoming football game. His jersey number, No. 56, was painted in the \nend zones and his picture appeared on a giant poster with a banner \nreading ``Fallen Hero.''\n  Those who knew Justin weren't surprised that his leadership skills \nand selfless nature transferred over to his career as a member of the \nU.S. Marine Corps. One friend recalled this about him:\n\n       Justin had every opportunity to do other things in his \n     life, and he chose to do this. There aren't many kids who \n     want to be a bomb specialist, especially for the Marines.\n\n  His brother James said that Justin chose a dangerous position in the \nEOD unit because ``he felt he could save some marines' lives by doing \nthat.'' James recalled that:\n\n       Justin took his job very seriously. But as far as life \n     went, he enjoyed life. He lived in the moment.\n\n  He was also selfless. Justin was constantly concerned about the well-\nbeing of others, more so than his own. Kara Desmarais, whose husband \nwas stationed with Justin in North Carolina, shared this memory of \nJustin:\n\n       At our cookouts, he was helping me in the kitchen--mostly \n     telling stories or the latest gossip to make me laugh--on the \n     grill helping my husband, or playing with the kids to help \n     out. We are going to miss his funny stories, his laugh, his \n     smile, and, most of all, his friendship.\n\n  SGT Jeremy McAbee wrote the following on a tribute Web site to \nJustin:\n\n       Thanks for leading the way and bringing out my true colors. \n     You were always a hero to me, even when I pinned sergeant on \n     you.\n\n  Justin is truly a hero. With his selfless courage, leadership, and \nservice, he was the model of what every parent dreams their child will \nbecome. Today we remember the sacrifices of this fine marine and \nresolve that his life will not be forgotten but rather emulated by all \nwho are left behind to cherish his memory.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Justin's father James, his mom \nand his\n\n[[Page S11122]]\n\nstepfather, Terry Walsh-Silvey and Thomas Silvey, brother James, and \nsister Heather in our thoughts and our prayers.\n\n\n                      Captain Matthew C. Mattingly\n\n  Mr. President, this afternoon I wish to speak in the Senate to honor \nthe life of Army CPT Matthew C. Mattingly from Reynoldsburg, OH. \nCaptain Mattingly, a decorated officer, commanded Troop A of the 1st \nSquadron, 17th Calvary Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division based out \nof Fort Bragg, NC. On September 13, 2006, he was killed when direct \ngunfire struck a reconnaissance helicopter he was copiloting near \nMosul, Iraq. He was 30 years old.\n  Growing up in Reynoldsburg, Matt, as his family and friends called \nhim, loved sports, particularly softball and football. And according to \nhis father Dennis, he had a passion for flying ever since he was a \nsmall boy. As a student at Reynoldsburg High School, Matt proudly wore \nNo. 63 as a member of the football team. Dan Hoffman, the former \nprincipal of Reynoldsburg High, recalls this about Matt:\n\n       He was a top-flight kid, the kind of kid you would want \n     defending your country--a solid kid from a solid family.\n\n  After graduating from high school, Matt attended Xavier University, \nwhere he seized the opportunity to serve his country by joining the \nReserve Officers' Training Corps, ROTC. One of Matt's classmates wrote \nthe following in a message posted to an Internet tribute Web site in \nMatt's honor:\n\n       Matt always had a smile on his face and was always having a \n     good time. He loved life, and he loved the Army. I have no \n     doubt that Matt was as superior an officer as he was a \n     superior cadet. I will miss him very much.\n\n  Matt graduated from Xavier University in 1998, after which he was \ncommissioned as a second lieutenant and went into the Army. In 1999, he \nsuccessfully completed aviation officer basic training.\n  Matt was a committed and dedicated soldier. In 2002, he served in \nBosnia with the 25th Infantry Division as part of the NATO \nstabilization force. In 2003, he deployed to Iraq and served with \ndistinction in the 4th Infantry Division. During his first deployment, \nhis actions earned him the Bronze Star and an Air Medal with Valor \nhonor for his bravery and for his heroism. In 2004, Matt was assigned \nto the 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade and returned to Iraq.\n  According to his father, Matt was planning on making the Army his \ncareer. Family friend, Beverly Denney, said that Matt saved the lives \nof several soldiers on the ground during the battle with his \nhelicopter--the battle in which Matt tragically lost his life. In \nBeverly's words, Matt ``was a very kind, considerate, respectable young \nman. He was truly always thinking about others.''\n  COL Kelly Thomas is the commander of the 82nd Combat Aviation \nBrigade. This is what Colonel Thomas had to say about Matt:\n\n       This is a huge loss. I've known Matt since he was a \n     lieutenant in Sarajevo. He was a professional warrior, a \n     combat veteran, a caring troop commander. He was a dynamic \n     officer. He served his squadron and nation doing what he did \n     best, leading and caring for his troopers.\n\n  For his brave actions in Iraq, Matt was awarded the Purple Heart.\n  Matt had another love besides the military, a love that was strong, \nand that was for Alicia Burke. This past July, before being deployed to \nIraq for a second time, Matt became engaged to Alicia, a captain in the \nAir Force. She was truly the love of his life.\n  Matt's family and friends fondly remember his wonderful sense of \nhumor. At the funeral, his sister Michelle read a letter from a first \nsergeant who had served with him. In the letter, the first sergeant \nremembered how he would puzzle all day over something Matt had said \nthat morning that seemed particularly smart, only to have Matt tell him \nthat evening that he just made it up.\n  Those who knew Matt will always remember how he liked to sing karaoke \nand that he was a fan of the Ohio State University Buckeyes. His sister \nMichelle will remember him as the best brother she ever could have \nhad--a childhood rival and then a friend and then a role model.\n  Army Captain Mattingly truly was an extraordinary American. He was a \nman who loved God, family, and country. Selfless and humble, Matt put \nthe needs and concerns of others above his own.\n  Sergeant First Class Martinez served with Matt in both Texas and \nHawaii. He remembers Matt's caring nature and will always treasure a \nspecial hat he gave him. The sergeant said this about his friend:\n\n       I'd served with Captain Matthew Mattingly while at Fort \n     Hood, Texas, and in Hawaii, while he was my platoon leader, \n     my mentor, and most of all, my friend. . . .We did learn a \n     lot from each other and even though I'm dealing with this \n     great loss, I'm also celebrating his life and treasuring all \n     the great moments we'd shared. . . .I do promise that you \n     will never be forgotten.\n\n  Motivated by a sense of honor and duty, Matt always tried to do what \nwas right and not what was always necessarily easy. We are eternally \nthankful for Matthew's enduring convictions, his character, and for his \nservice.\n  I conclude with the words of Matt's sister, Michelle, who wrote the \nfollowing in tribute to him:\n\n       It is overwhelming to know how much Matt was loved by the \n     Army and to know the love from Ohio was the same. I wanted to \n     thank his troop and Officer Quinn for bringing my brother \n     home. My brother loved flying and his family even when we \n     weren't there. The only thing that saddens me is that Matt \n     never got to have a family. He would be a great dad. But \n     knowing that the 1-17 Cavalry was his family gives me great \n     peace. Thank you so much.\n\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Matthew's family--his father and \nstepmother, Dennis and Barbara Mattingly, his mother and stepfather, \nRandi Mattingly and Ron Fridley, his sisters Michelle, Kethryn \nMattingly, and his fiancee, CPT Alicia Burke--in our thoughts and in \nour prayers.\n\n\n                      Corporal Timothy David Roos\n\n  Mr. President, this afternoon I would like to pay tribute to Marine \nCpl Timothy David Roos from Delhi Township, OH. On July 27, 2006, \nCorporal Roos was killed when an improvised explosive device detonated \nwhile he was conducting combat operations in the Al Anbar Province in \nIraq. He was 21 years old at the time and just a month away from \nreturning home to Ohio.\n  Timothy was a vehicle commander for the 2nd Platoon of the 3rd \nBattalion, 8th Marine Regiment. He joined the Marines with his cousin \nJeffrey. He had wanted to be in the Marines ever since he was a very \nsmall boy. Timothy's father Rick had also served as a marine and had \nspent time in Vietnam. His dad remembers how Timothy and his brother \nAdam would always play in the woods as boys. As Rick recalls:\n\n       Timothy always had my old uniforms on, and that's what he \n     wanted to be: A marine.\n\n  Timothy's family remembers him as a brave young man who was so proud \nto be a marine. ``He loved doing his job and loved the Marine Corps,'' \nhis father said.\n  His brother Adam recalls this about Timothy's career as a marine:\n\n       Tim was a great marine. He loved his job. He loved doing \n     it. There really wasn't much that Tim wasn't proud of about \n     his service.\n\n  Since joining the Marines in 2003, Timothy had faced major attacks \nseveral times. He was deployed to Haiti in the year 2004 and came under \nfire twice in Iraq in 2005. Just this past May, Timothy's humvee ran \nover an IED that exploded. All of the marines in the vehicle escaped \nuninjured.\n  After the humvee incident, Timothy told a Marine Corps news \npublication that working as a marine could be frightening. This is what \nhe said:\n\n       The explosion shattered all of the glass in the vehicle, \n     popped all 4 doors open, and sent shrapnel ripping through \n     the engine. It's scary, and if you are not scared, there is \n     something wrong with you. But it is our job, so you've got to \n     do it.\n\n  Those were very brave words from a young man who was only 21 years \nold.\n  Timothy graduated from Oak Hills High School in Bridgetown in 2003. A \ndedicated swimmer, he still holds some of the local records. Before \ngraduating, Timothy also attended Diamond Oaks Vocational School in \nDent, OH, where he studied automotive technology and was active in \ntheir Reserve Officer Training Corps Program.\n  Along with the rest of his family, Timothy was an avid fan of the \nGreen Bay Packers football team. The day before he was killed, he spoke \nwith his father, and they made plans to see a Packers game and to go \ncamping.\n  Timothy was scheduled to return to Ohio on brief leave so he could \nsee his wife of 3 years, Sara, and their newborn daughter Annaliese, \nwho was born just 2 weeks before he died. Tragically, Timothy never had \nthe chance to--never had the chance to hold his baby girl.\n  His brother Adam recalls that Timothy was ready to be a dad. He was \nexcited and a bit nervous. Timothy's\n\n[[Page S11123]]\n\nbrother-in-law Brian Pearson remembers how important family was to him. \n``He was very much looking forward to coming home and seeing his \ndaughter,'' he says.\n  Days after Timothy's death, ``It's a girl!'' signs were still posted \naround the house. As his wife Sara recalls:\n\n       He was all about having a baby from day one. He was just so \n     excited, so excited to be a father.\n\n  Sara was indeed the love of Timothy's life. They had been sweethearts \never since their time together at Delhi Junior High School when they \nsat next to each other in their eighth grade math class. Sara fondly \nremembers their school days together and the time when Timothy \ntransformed from a quiet boy into a tall man. As she recalls:\n\n       My jaw hit the floor when I realized who he was. He was \n     skinny and as handsome as could be.\n\n  Timothy and Sara were made for each other. They so enjoyed their time \ngrowing up together. Sara often laughs about their punk phase when the \ntwo of them sported dyed hair and pierced ears. Outside of the \nclassroom, they often attended concerts together. Sara once commented:\n\n       I don't think a lot of people really believe you find your \n     soulmate when you're 17, but we did. I doubt many people ever \n     have what we had.\n\n  Timothy and Sara were married just a month before he left for boot \ncamp in North Carolina. While home on leave in March 2006, Timothy \nvisited his old high school. His former teachers there remember him so \nwell. As the school's public relations coordinator Rebecca Beckstedt \nsaid:\n\n       He felt very connected to the students and staff at Great \n     Oaks. There's nothing harder for a school to lose than a \n     student. It's heartbreaking.\n\n  Those who knew Timothy will always remember him for the way he made \neveryone laugh. At school he had a reputation of being a great kid with \na great sense of humor. As his brother Adam said at Timothy's funeral:\n\n       He was hilarious. He was always doing something goofy.\n\n  Timothy's dedication and sacrifice continue to be an inspiration to \nthose who knew him. Even though he had survived previous attacks and \nwas well aware of the dangers of life in a combat zone, he often spoke \nof reenlisting. In the words of his brother: ``That's why he's my \nhero.''\n  Adam also knows his brother Timothy died doing what he wanted to do--\nserving our Nation. In Adam's words:\n\n       Deep, deep in Timothy's heart, that's what he wanted to do.\n\n  The hundreds of people lining the Delhi Township streets to watch \nTimothy's funeral procession were equally moved. As the procession \npassed, 8-year-old Vincent Neely commented that he, too, wants to be a \nmarine when he gets older. ``It's the biggest sacrifice anyone can make \nfor anything,'' he said.\n  His family friend Diane Heileman said:\n\n       It really gets your heart when you know we lost another \n     one, but if it weren't for them, we wouldn't all be here--our \n     freedom, they're protecting all of us.\n\n  Indeed, our world is simply a better place because he lived. He was a \nyoung man who genuinely loved life and had compassion for others. His \ndedication to his family, his friends, his fellow marines, his local \ncommunity, and his country is inspiring.\n  Let me conclude by mentioning, as I was preparing to speak today in \nhonor of Timothy, I saw in his biography that he had served in Haiti. I \nrecalled when I was there visiting our marines. I went back to some \nphotographs that were taken during a trip that Fran and I took there in \n2004. When we were there, we made a point of visiting with the Ohio \nmarines who were serving in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. I went back through \nthe individual pictures we took of them and I found one. I found one \nthat I had taken of Timothy. Here is the picture. I am privileged to \nhave had a brief meeting with Timothy in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. I saw \nthen firsthand the differences our troops were making in Haiti. I know \nthe Chair in his travels and the other Members of the Senate have seen \nwhat I have seen when we have seen our troops overseas. They are the \nbest. They are people who are making a difference every single day. \nTimothy made a difference in Haiti. He made a difference in Iraq. He \nmade a difference wherever he served. Of that, Mr. President, I am \ncertain.\n\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Timothy, his wife Sara, their \ndaughter Annaliese, his parents, Rick and Janice, and his older brother \nAdam in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n            Private First Class James P. ``J.P.'' White, Jr.\n\n  Mr. President, this afternoon I would like to pay tribute to a \nremarkable young man, Army PFC James P. ``J.P.'' White, Jr., from Huber \nHeights, OH. On August 11, 2006, Private White was killed in \nAfghanistan when enemy forces attacked his platoon with rocket-\npropelled grenades and small arms fire. He was just 19 years of age at \nthe time of his death.\n  Mr. President, it is impossible to make sense of the death of anyone \nso young. J.P. lived a great deal of life in his all too brief 19 years \non this Earth. It is important that we recognize that he died for \nsomething he believed in, doing an important job he loved. J.P.'s \ngrandmother Amy Phipps perhaps said it best:\n\n       J.P. always, always wanted to join the Army. He thought he \n     should protect us by fighting the terrorists. I'm proud of \n     everything he has done. We were very blessed. He gave his \n     life for us.\n\n  J.P. was indeed a blessing to all who knew him and to those of us who \ndid not. He was one of those special and courageous individuals who \nspent his life defending others. And for that, we owe him and his \nfamily a debt of gratitude which we simply will never ever be able to \nrepay.\n  Growing up in a family with a rich military tradition, J.P. knew \nearly on he wanted to serve his country, and he nourished that desire \nevery chance he got. At Wayne High School he joined the Reserve \nOfficers Training Corps where he rose to the rank of cadet captain and \nclass leader his senior year. He captained the Armed Exhibition Drill \nTeam, a unit that he led to within a single point of a trophy in local \ncompetition. His friend and teammate, Joshua Shea said:\n\n       J.P. was disciplined. He knew what he was doing.\n\n  For all of his focus and determination, J.P. was also a very fun-\nloving person. Like other teenagers, he enjoyed computers, video games, \nand hanging out with his friends. Many of his friends remember him \nplaying a game which they had improvised. It involved bouncing a \nracquet ball off a wall using only a player's head. Not surprisingly, \nJ.P. referred to it as ``head ball.'' One of J.P.'s friends, Casey \nSullivan, said that underneath the disciplined Army soldier was a big \ngoofball at heart. His friends loved him dearly.\n  Upon graduation from Wayne High School in 2005, J.P. immediately \nenlisted in the Army. J.P.'s father James said that they discussed at \nlength his decision to join, but there was never a moment's hesitation \non his son's part. As James put it simply: ``He was sure.''\n  J.P. joined the military along with a childhood friend, Marine LCpl \nRyan Pennington. The two kidded each other all the time about who had \njoined the better branch of the military. Between a committed Army man \nand a committed marine, I am not sure this was an argument they would \never resolve, but both knew what it meant and understood what it meant \nto serve.\n  Ryan recalled that J.P. was extremely committed to serving and was \nprepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.\n\n       I know J.P. knew the risks. We all do, and we accept them.\n\n  In July of 2005, J.P. shipped out for boot camp at Fort Drum in New \nYork. He completed basic and advanced training at Fort Benning, GA, to \nbe an infantryman. He was a member of the 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry \nDivision, 3rd Brigade Combat Team for the 10th Mountain Division. In \nMarch of 2006, his platoon was deployed to Afghanistan as part of \nOperation Enduring Freedom.\n  Serving in the field and frontline is precisely what J.P. had \nenvisioned when he was growing up. According to his high school ROTC \ninstructor, SGT Michael Cannon:\n\n       J.P. probably could have had any job in the Army. He didn't \n     want a desk job. He was doing exactly what he wanted--combat \n     and convoy operations.\n\n  After several months of deployment, J.P. returned home for his sister \nApril's high school graduation in June\n\n[[Page S11124]]\n\n2006. Tragically, this would be his last time with his family and \nfriends at home. He left on Father's Day.\n  Before leaving, J.P. and his father talked about the war and his \nexperience of fighting for our country. In spite of all the danger, \nJ.P. was resolute in his commitment to the fight for freedom. His \nfather said:\n\n       He never feared going back. He just told me he was doing \n     his job. He was proud to serve his country. I believe that \n     he's a great hero.\n  News of J.P.'s death this past August came as shock to all his family \nand friends. When his father got word, he knew that there was no way he \ncould tell J.P.'s other relatives in Illinois over the telephone. \nInstead, he got in his car and drove his family the 4 hours from Huber \nHeights, OH, to Mount Pulaski, IL, to deliver the news in person.\n  ``It was a long ride to be driving and crying,'' his father said. \n``He was a wonderful kid--very well behaved and well respected.''\n  J.P.'s life and sacrifice were honored at a funeral on the morning of \nAugust 21st at St. Peter Catholic Church in Huber Heights. Reverend \nDarrell Perry presided over the ceremony. He closed by reminding \neveryone that ``J.P. gave his life doing what he believed in.''\n  With flags flying at half staff throughout Huber Heights, a \nprocession took J.P. to his final resting place at Dayton's National \nCemetery, where he was buried with full military honors. During the \nprocession, 30 Patriot Guard Riders from across the State of Ohio \njoined J.P.'s family. These men came from all over on their bikes to \nserve as part of a color guard for J.P.\n  Bryan McCoy, one of the Patriot Guard Riders who joined family and \nfriends at the service, traveled all the way from Akron to pay his \nrespects to J.P. and his loved ones. ``I'm too old (to join the \nfighting overseas),'' he said. ``I just want to offer my support.''\n  At the Cemetery, BG Joe Orr presented J.P.'s family with the Bronze \nStar on his behalf for bravery, heroism and meritorious service.\n  ``He's going to be very, very sadly missed,'' said J.P.'s grandmother \nAmy. ``But we know he's in God's arms.''\n  Yes, J.P. is in God's arms and in the hearts and minds of all who had \nthe good fortune to have known him.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep J.P.'s parents, James and Robin, \nhis sisters April and Denise, and all his family and friends in our \nthoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                  LANCE CORPORAL TIMOTHY MICHAEL BELL\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fellow Ohioan who was killed \nwhile serving in Iraq--LCpl Timothy Michael Bell, Jr., from West \nChester. Lance Corporal Bell was killed in Iraq, on August 3, 2005, \nwhen a roadside bomb exploded underneath his military vehicle. He was \n22 years old.\n  Timothy Bell--``Tim'' to family and friends--was a man who greatly \nrespected his country--a man who was proud of every day he served our \nNation as a Marine. As Greg McDaniel, Pastor at Impact Baptist Church, \nsaid about Tim:\n\n       He loved the Marine Corps. [Tim] always said, ``I want to \n     be a [Marine].'' The day he graduated from boot camp, he told \n     his mother, ``This is why I was born. This is my destiny.''\n\n  From the time he was 6 years old, Tim knew that he wanted to be a \nMarine. His room was full of Marine posters and memorabilia, and a \ncamouflage Marine blanket even covered his bed. For Tim Bell, there was \nnever any question of what he wanted to be when he grew up.\n  Most Ohioan's know Tim's family as a baseball family. His uncle Buddy \nwas a star player for the Cleveland Indians and the Cincinnati Reds, \nand I remember his grandfather Gus was a star player for the Reds when \nI was a kid. Buddy currently manages the Kansas City Royals. Tim's \ncousins, David and Michael Bell, also played Major League Baseball.\n  But, there is another uniform that has been very important in the \nBell family--and that is the uniform of the U.S. Marine Corps. Two of \nTim's uncles and an aunt wore the Marines' uniform. While many boys \ndream of becoming professional athletes, Tim saw his relatives in their \nmilitary uniforms and decided that he wanted to be just like them--that \njoining the military was going to be his dream. Tim's admiration for \nthese family members, including his grandfather, who had served in the \nNavy, compelled him to follow in their footsteps.\n  Those at Lakota East High School, where Tim graduated in 2003, \nremember that Tim always displayed a strong affinity for military \nservice. In fact, he enlisted even before he graduated. Principal Ruth \nBarber said that ``when Tim settled his mind on being a Marine, he \ncouldn't wait to serve his country.''\n  When the news came that Tim was shipping overseas, his family and \nfriends remember that he was excited to go. When his parents dropped \nhim off in Columbus for training with Lima Company, Tim told them that \nthis was simply what he was born to do.\n  Before leaving for Iraq, Tim gave his father something special for \nsafekeepking--his Marine Corps ring. ``Wear this until I come home,'' \nhe told his dad. Well, Mr. President, Tim Bell, Sr. wore that ring \nevery day his son was in Iraq--and will continue to wear it every day.\n  Tim's discipline was extraordinary. Not only did he undergo military \ntraining, but he also had a black belt in judo. He did not express \nfear, and he never doubted his purpose as a marine.\n  During one phone call home, Tim proudly told his father that their \nbattalion commander had said they were the most active company since \nthe Vietnam War. According to his dad, ``They were busy every day \nfighting. Every day.''\n  Tim was scheduled to return home in September 2005. He was thinking \nof buying a motorcycle was looking forward to visiting family in Kansas \nCity. Nothing was more important to Tim than family. While at Marine \nbase camp, he would call his father about once a week. He would relive \nthe excitement of his adventures over the phone, but also always took \nthe time to ask how his parents and siblings were doing.\n  ``It seemed he was more concerned about me than himself,'' his dad \nrecalls. ``The concern was how everybody was doing. Every conversation \nI had with him ended with `I love you dad' and `I love you Timmy.' \nEvery conversation. I am going to miss those calls.''\n  Tim's dad went on to say:\n\n       My son was a brave and wonderful man. All he ever wanted to \n     do was be a Marine. He felt like it was an extremely \n     important job. I was fortunate to get to tell him that I \n     loved him every week when he called.\n\n  Tim's stepmother Vivian said this about Tim:\n\n       Tim is a hero and we are proud of him. He liked to live and \n     just do what he wanted to do. He didn't think about danger or \n     anything like that or consequences. When he wanted to do \n     something and thought it was something worth doing, he just \n     stuck to it.\n\n  In addition to the weekly phone calls home, Tim also exchanged e-\nmails and instant messages over the computer with his sister Jamie. He \nshared with her his plans to return to Iraq for another tour of duty. \nHe believed strongly in his role in Iraq.\n  ``He was there for a reason,'' his dad said. ``Everybody needs to \nknow that. And it's not just my son--it's all the young men and women \nover there. They're over there for each and every one of us.''\n  On a night shortly after Tim's death, the Kansas City Royals honored \nhim with a moment of silence before the game. The stadium announcer \nasked everyone to remember the United States Marines from Lima Company \nwho had been killed in Iraq. He particularly asked the stadium to \nremember the sacrifice of Tim Bell, the nephew of Royals manager Buddy \nBell.\n  According to Mike Sweeny, the team captain for the Royals, the moment \nof silence for the slain marines had a special meaning for them. ``It \nwas the most meaningful moment of silence I've had since we resumed \nplay after 9-11,'' he recalled.\n  Tim Bell lived the Marine credo--he was always faithful--faithful to \nhis family, faithful to the Marine Corps, and faithful to our country. \nHis father described him as the ``last of the John Waynes, but \ntougher.'' Tim loved the Marines and the reason they serve.\n  We celebrate the life of this brave young man and honor his \ndedication to preserving our freedom and liberty. Fran and I continue \nto keep the family and friends of LCpl Timothy Bell in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n\n\n                        Major Michael D. Stover\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow Ohion--Marine \nMAJ\n\n[[Page S11125]]\n\nMichael D. Stover from Mansfield. Major Stover died on June 3, 2006, \nwhile serving his second tour of duty in Iraq. He was the executive \nofficer for the Marine Wing Support Squadron 374, based in Twentynine \nPalms, CA. He was 43 years old.\n  Major Stover is survived by his sister and his brother-in-law, Cheryl \nand Kim Meister, and by his brother, retired MAJ Edward Allen Stover. \nHe also leaves to cherish his memory many nieces and nephews, aunts, \nuncles, and cousins. He is proceded in death by his parents LaVern \n``Smoky'' and Doris Stover.\n  Michael Stover craved adventure from the time he was a boy. His \nsister Cheryl remembers that her baby brother's nickname was \n``Monkey,'' ``because he was always falling out of trees, breaking his \narm, riding bicycles and flying over the handlebars and ending up in \nhospitals.'' Michael grew up an avid outdoorsman, joining the Boy \nScouts and quickly rising in their ranks. He wrestled while in junior \nhigh and always sought out physical activities that pushed him as an \nindividual.\n  In 1980, Michael graduated from Malabar High School in Mansfield. \nMichael was an excellent student and though there were many career \npaths he could have chosen, his older sister and brother weren't \nsurprised when he decided to enlist in the Marines. They had watched \nhim grow up and knew that the Marines provided the kind of adventure \nand physical challenge he had always loved. As his sister Cheryl \nexplained: ``Anything that was exciting or extreme, Michael had to be \ninvolved in.''\n  Although Michael's parents--aware of their son's love for books and \nliterature--were initially skeptical of his decision to become a \nMarine, it quickly became a source of pride for them. Michael remained \nclose to his family throughout his time in the service, calling and \nwriting frequently.\n  After enlisting, Michael reported for recruit training at Parris \nIsland in January 1981. This was only his first step in a military \ncareer that exemplified the core Marine values of honor, courage, and \ncommitment.\n  Books and reading had always been important to Michael, and as a \nMarine he was able to use his talent for writing and communicating. He \nwas designated a Public Affairs Marine and underwent training at the \nDefense Information School, where he learned how to tell the stories of \nthe U.S. Marine Corps. He then completed an enlisted tour with the \nFleet Hometown News Center in Norfolk, VA, which sends out press \nreleases on Marine achievements.\n  According to his brother Edward, Michael hadn't joined the Marines \nintending to make the military his career. But, he fell in love with \nthe service and decided to stay so that he could become an officer. He \naccepted a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps Marine Option \nscholarship and was released from active duty so that he could attend \nthe Ohio State University.\n  Not surprisingly, Michael was a leader at OSU. He became a \nresidential assistant, a position in which he was an important role \nmodel for incoming freshmen. It was his job to guide those younger than \nhe and used his Marine training to do it. His residents looked up to \nhim, not only as a resource, but also as a friend and even a big \nbrother.\n  Michael graduated from OSU in 1990 with a bachelor of arts degree in \njournalism. He was then commissioned as a Marine Corps 2LT and became a \nlogistics officer in an engineer support battalion--eventually serving \nas platoon and then company commander.\n  After then being promoted to Captain, Michael served as a logistics \nofficer while also attending the Amphibious Warfare School from July \n1994 to June 1997. From 1998-2005, he then served in different \ncapacities in California, Hawaii, and Arizona. Throughout these years, \nMichael was a leader and an educator for young marines, helping to \nshape and mold the following generation.\n  Lieutenant Chris Kaprielian was just one of the many young marines \nwho Major Stover inspired. This is how he described his former \ncommander:\n\n       [Major Stover] was like a father to our [operations] \n     section. The amount of knowledge he brought in from his prior \n     experiences in the Marine Corps was incredible. Like a \n     father, he looked out for the men in his command. And like a \n     father, he was very demanding.\n\n  He particularly remembers Major Stover's commitment to duty. ``We all \nworked really long hours,'' he said, ``but he was there before anyone \nelse and stayed even later. I never knew anyone who worked as hard as \nhe did.''\n  Michael was serving as the executive officer for the Marine Wing \nSupport Squadron 371 when the squadron was deployed to Iraq in February \n2005. After returning to the United States the next September, he was \nthen temporarily assigned to another squadron in October. The Marine \nWing Support Squadron 374 was preparing to deploy to Iraq--and Major \nStover was needed to help prepare the marines for war.\n  His sister Cheryl remembers his exact words. ``It's my job,'' he \nsaid. ``If I don't go, young Marines will be dying. I can go and \nprevent their deaths.'' No other words better represent Major Stover's \nselfless and compassionate commitment to the young men and women whom \nhe could train to become excellent marines. With his actions, he was \nsaving lives every day.\n  The day Michael died, our Nation tragically lost a wonderful brother, \na caring mentor, and a truly outstanding marine. At the time of his \ndeath, Michael had been recently selected for promotion to the rank of \nlieutenant colonel. His brother Edward--a retired major with the Ohio \nNational Guard--knew it was a promotion that he richly deserved. It \nwould have been the first time that Michael outranked his older \nbrother. Edward eagerly anticipated his brother's promotion. ``You'll \nnever know how proudly I looked forward to that time,'' he said.\n  Major Stover's 26-year career of leadership and fortitude earned him \nmore decorations and honors than I can name here. They include the \nMeritorious Service Medal, three Navy and Marine Corps Commendation \nMedals, and the Iraq Campaign Medal. But his best reward, perhaps, is \nsimply the respect and admiration felt by all who knew him.\n  At Michael's funeral, numerous mourners gathered to pay their \nrespects to the departed marine, paying tribute to the lifetime he \nspent teaching the young marines who would come after him. Reverend \nDavid Pound said that Michael ``took great pride in the young Marines \nthat he could teach and develop.'' And, LTC Phillip Woody, Michael's \ncommanding officer, said this:\n\n       The only way for a mortal man to be immortal is to teach. \n     Those you teach will remember you forever. Mike will be \n     remembered forever. It was an honor to call him a friend. It \n     was an honor to call him a comrade.\n\n  The world is a better place since Michael Stover has been in it. He \nwas a brave man, with a genuine commitment to service, leadership, \neducation, and excellence. His dedication to his country was tremendous \nand his commitment to his fellow service members was unparalleled. My \nwife Fran and I continue to keep his family in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask I be allowed to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11125-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11125-S11127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RETIRING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to our colleague \nfrom Ohio, spending his few minutes in the Senate talking about brave \nmen and women who serve our country. It is the mark of our colleague \nfrom Ohio, the kind of person he is--not just the kind of Senator he \nis--that he would come to the floor of the Senate in his last few days \nas a Member of this institution and focus on others, focus on those who \nhave given the ultimate for their families, for our country and for our \nfuture. It shows us, once again, that Senator DeWine is the consummate \nSenator.\n  I am here this afternoon to recognize and thank and pay tribute to \nour colleagues who will be leaving the Senate. They are a varied group. \nAgain, I can think of no finer example of this group of public servants \nthan one of Senator DeWine's last speeches in the Senate to recognize \nothers.\n  I thank you, Senator DeWine, for your service.\n  As we recognize, it is a distinct privilege and high honor to serve \nour country. It is a distinct privilege and high\n\n[[Page S11126]]\n\nhonor to serve our country in any capacity, and certainly none higher \nthan in uniform. But it is especially important we recognize those who \nhave given years of their lives, sacrificing their families, their own \ntime, to help make a better world for all of us. I know of no capacity \nin which we serve our country that has given those who have had this \nrare opportunity to serve in the Senate anything more noble than trying \nto shape a better world from this Senate.\n  These individuals who will leave the Senate, some on their own terms, \nsome on the terms of the election, but, nonetheless, in their own \nspecific way have contributed a great deal to this country.\n  I take a few minutes to recognize each. I start with our colleague, \nyour dear friend, former lieutenant governor, the senior Senator from \nOhio. I need not tell the distinguished Presiding Officer what Senator \nDeWine has meant to his State and to this country. I had the privilege \nof serving on the Intelligence Committee with Senator DeWine for 4 \nyears. I have teamed up with Senator DeWine over the years on many \nlegislative matters. I don't know of an individual who cares more, \ncontributes more, to what they believe, than Senator DeWine. His years \nof service in the House, the Senate, and as lieutenant governor are to \nbe recognized. We should thank him and tell him that we will miss him \nand we will especially miss a friend.\n  Senator Paul Sarbanes, the longest serving Senator in Maryland, \nserving five terms in the Senate, was elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in 1970. I first got acquainted with Senator Sarbanes \nnot as a Senator but as a young staff member, chief of staff to a \ncongressman from Nebraska, John McCollister, who also had been elected \nto the House in 1970.\n  I have had the privilege of serving on two committees for the last 10 \nyears with Senator Sarbanes--on the Foreign Relations Committee and the \nCommittee on Banking. His courtesies to me, his sharp, defined \nintellect, his ability to dissect problems and focus on a resolution, \nwill be greatly missed in this institution. We wish the Sarbaneses \ncontinued success and a little rest.\n  Senator Jim Jeffords, from Vermont. Not many former chief justices of \ntheir State have served in this Senate. He is one. Senator Jeffords, in \nhis long, distinguished service to our country, served as Chief Justice \nof the Vermont Supreme Court, served in the House of Representatives, \nand then served here in the Senate. He served our country in the U.S. \nNavy. Jim Jeffords' life has been about service.\n  I had an opportunity to get acquainted particularly with Senator \nJeffords and work closely with him on the Individuals with Disability \nEducation Act, IDEA. There has been no one in this Senate over the last \n25 years more committed to education for our young people than Jim \nJeffords. We will miss Jim Jeffords.\n  Senator Conrad Burns. The best thing we can say about Senator Burns \nis he married a girl from Nebraska. His wife Phyllis is from North \nPlatte. Senator Burns represents some of the best the West has to \noffer. He will be the longest serving Republican Senator in Montana \nhistory. His background is varied: distinguished entrepreneur, \nbroadcaster, and that which he is most proud of, a U.S. marine.\n  I have had the honor of working with Senator Burns on a number of \nbills and occasions, many related to agriculture and the cattle \nindustry. For Senator Burns' service to our country, we thank him. We \nwill miss him.\n  Senator Rick Santorum one of the leaders of the majority in the \nSenate the last few years, from Pennsylvania, came to the Senate in \n1994 and helped shape a different agenda. He believed fervently in the \npower of the institution to change the world and felt deeply about \nissues.\n  I served on the Committee on Banking with Senator Santorum for many \nyears and came to respect the junior Senator from Pennsylvania. I have \na high regard for his ability to work through the big issues.\n  For service to our country, both the House and the Senate, thank you, \nSenator Santorum. We will miss you.\n  Senator Linc Chafee. Senator Chafee comes from a long line of public \nservants from the State of Rhode Island. The name ``Chafee'' is a \nfamous name in this institution. His father John Chafee was one of the \ngreat Senators in this Senate in the 20th century. Linc picked up where \nhis father left off.\n  I had the opportunity to serve with Senator Chafee on the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. We sat next to each other for many years. \nHe had a keen ability to cut through the fog, the nonsense, the \nsuperficial, the obsequious, and get to the real issues. We will miss \nthat ability. We will miss that laser. I am sorry to see Senator Chafee \nleave. He will continue to serve his country in many areas as he has \ndone before his service in the Senate.\n  Senator George Allen. We will miss footballs. Many of my colleagues \nreceived footballs. He was a quarterback for the Cavaliers at the \nUniversity of Virginia and he could throw almost as well as even a \nNebraska quarterback.\n  Senator Allen, for a very young man, has a very distinguished record \nof public service, serving as the Governor of the great State of \nVirginia, serving in the House of Representatives, serving in the U.S. \nSenate. I served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with Senator \nAllen for many years, and I will miss his ability to say it clearly and \nplainly. And his leadership position within the Republican majority, \nwhich he served so ably, will be missed.\n  Senator Mark Dayton from Minnesota, a neighbor. I served on two \ncommittees with Senator Dayton, the Rules Committee and the Foreign \nRelations Committee. He is a unique individual who served in many ways, \nbeginning with his service to Senator and then Vice President Walter \nMondale. Senator Dayton has a rich history and understanding of this \ninstitution and his State. We will miss Senator Dayton's character, his \nability to also cross party aisles and help resolve the issues of our \nday.\n  Senator Jim Talent from Missouri has had 14 years of service in the \nHouse and Senate. I worked very closely with Senator Talent on his \nbill, the Combat Methamphetamine Act. I believe it is one of the most \nsignificant, relevant, important bills to pass the 109th Congress. He, \ntoo, will be missed. No one worked harder than Jim Talent for the \ninterests of his State. He understands agriculture, he understands \nenergy like very few in his State. He began his service to his country \nand to the State of Missouri at the age of 28, when he was elected to \nthe House of Representatives. We will continue to hear more from Jim \nTalent.\n  I conclude my recognition of our colleagues who will be leaving us at \nthe end of this Congress by recognizing our leader, Senator Bill Frist, \nfrom Tennessee.\n  Senator Frist has been referred to, as we all are, in many ways and \nin many terms. ``Renaissance man'' has been one of those terms that \nhave described Bill Frist. This is a unique individual. This is a man \nwhose life has much been about serving others.\n  For his leadership in the Senate during a very difficult time, this \nbody owes him a great deal of thanks and gratitude. He will go on to \ncontinue to do significant things with his ability, his talent, his \nlife, and we wish him well. We will miss him. We will miss his ability \nto, in an always steady way, help reach a consensus.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, it is not easy to put one's self on the \nfiring line and offer one's self as a candidate for any office. It \ntakes a certain amount of courage and, I suspect, a little dose of \ninsanity. But nonetheless individuals who believe deeply enough to \ncommit themselves to a cause greater than their own self-interests need \nto be recognized. Having nothing to do with me or you or any one \nindividual, but it is the essence of our country, it is the very fabric \nof our democracy that makes it all work and probably gives rise to, \nmore than any one reason, why we have been such a successful nation for \nover 200 years--because people from all walks of life, in every \ncommunity, in every State, offer themselves for office. Whether it is a \nmayor, a Governor, city councilman, county official, a sheriff, these \nindividuals deserve recognition.\n  We all make mistakes. That is who we are. But in the end, it is not \nunlike what Teddy Roosevelt once referred to in his magnificent quote \nabout the man in the arena. And it is the man and the\n\n[[Page S11127]]\n\nwoman in the arena who change our lives. It makes a better world that \nshapes history, that defines our destiny. And for these individuals who \nwill no longer have that opportunity to serve our country in the \nSenate, we wish them well, we thank them, and we tell them we are proud \nof them and their families and wish them Godspeed.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11127-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I am pleased to bring H.R. 5384, \nthe fiscal year 2007 Agriculture appropriations bill, to the Senate for \nits consideration. It was written after carefully examining the \nadministration's budget proposal, holding a number of hearings, and \nreceiving significant input from Senators and other stakeholders. It \nwas approved unanimously by the subcommittee on June 20 and reported to \nthe Senate by the full committee on June 22. The bill is the product of \na completely bipartisan effort.\n  I thank Senator Kohl and his excellent staff for their hard work. We \nhave established a pattern of bipartisanship in this subcommittee which \nwe are delighted has continued on in this bill as well.\n  The bill is commonly known as the Agriculture appropriations bill, \nbut its impact goes far beyond the farms and ranches of the United \nStates. The largest portion of the funding in this bill goes to \nnutrition and food programs for mothers and children, low-income \nindividuals, and senior citizens. It also funds the agencies which \nconduct vital agricultural research, protect America's food and drug \nsupply, conserve soil and water resources and wildlife habitat, and \npromotes the economic development of rural America. It is, indeed, a \nfar-reaching measure.\n  The bill the Senate is now considering totals approximately $98.3 \nbillion in mandatory and discretionary funding. Of this amount, $18.2 \nbillion is for discretionary funding, fully utilizing the 302(b) \nallocation which we were given.\n  To touch on a few of the highlights, specifically, the bill increases \nfunding by 5 percent for the land grant colleges, historically Black \nland grant institutions, Hispanic serving institutions, forestry \nschools, and the National Research Initiative. This is the first \nsubstantial increase in the formula funds since I took over the \nchairmanship of the Agriculture Subcommittee in these areas.\n  It restores funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program to \n$108.3 million and funds the Women, Infants, and Children Program at \n$5.264 billion, fully meeting the estimated caseload requirements. It \nallows the enrollment of 250,000 acres in the Wetlands Reserve Program \nand restores the Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative.\n  Further, it provides for new research into renewable energy and $25 \nmillion in renewable energy loans and grants. It fully funds the \nPresident's request for avian influenza at USDA and FDA. It maintains \nthe safest food supply in the world by fully funding the Food Safety \nInspection Service.\n  And it speeds the approval of generic drugs to the marketplace by \nincreasing the Office of Generic Drugs at the FDA by 10 million.\n  All in all, I believe this is a bill Members can be proud of, and I \nam happy to bring it to the floor.\n  At this point, I am happy to yield so we can hear from the \ndistinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, with whom we have \nworked so close over these last 4 years, Senator Kohl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Thank you, Mr. President and Chairman Bennett.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 5384, which is the fiscal year 2007 \nappropriations bill for Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related \nAgencies.\n  This year, the Agriculture Subcommittee received an allocation of \n$18.2 billion. While this was an increase of approximately $1.1 billion \nover last year, the increase was largely absorbed by scorekeeping \nadjustments driven by the 2006 budget reconciliation bill. However, the \nincreased allocation, while certainly not a windfall, was certainly a \nhelp in writing a good bill, allowing us to restore programs the \nadministration proposed to eliminate and provide other critical \nprogrammatic increases.\n  I believe that Senator Bennett and his staff did an excellent job of \nbalancing limited funding with important priorities, and I strongly \nencourage all Senators to support this bill. I will briefly discuss \nsome of the highlights of the bill.\n  Avian flu, while it has not maintained the level of public attention \nthat it commanded earlier this year, is nevertheless, still a threat to \nour agricultural sector and to public health, and this bill provides an \nincrease of more than $110 million in various accounts for research, \nregulatory programs, and vaccine-related funding for highly pathogenic \navian flu. This funding is essential to helping prevent the spread of \navian flu, as well as increasing research in order to contain it where \nnecessary.\n  The Food Safety and Inspection Service, charged with ensuring that \nthe United States continues to have the safest food supply in the \nworld, received the full funding amount requested by the President. \nThis includes increased funding for food safety inspections, the food \nemergency response network, and information technology costs.\n  The Food and Drug Administration received an increase of \napproximately $100 million above last year's level, including increases \nof more than $5 million for food defense, nearly $4 million for drug \nsafety, and $50 million for pandemic flu preparedness.\n  I thank Senator Bennett for working with me on one of my highest \npriorities for this bill, to give the Office of Generic Drugs at FDA a \n$10 million increase over the President's budget, which brings total \nfunding for the Office of Generic Drugs to nearly $40 million, and \ntotal funding for generic drug approvals within FDA to nearly $75 \nmillion. I believe this increase is an important step and I will \ncontinue to work to ensure that FDA has the resources necessary to \ndecrease the growing backlog of generic drug applications within the \nFDA and to make lower-cost generic drugs available to consumers as \nearly as possible.\n  In the area of nutrition, the bill provides $5.264 billion, an \nincrease of $64 million above the President's request, for the Special \nSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children,WIC, \nProgram. This will fully fund WIC; and the committee did not accept the \nPresident's plans to limit WIC eligibility and to reduce funding to \ncarry out the program. The bill also restores funding for the Commodity \nSupplemental Food Program, which the President proposed to eliminate.\n  For the foreign assistance programs, the committee included an \nincrease of $86 million for international humanitarian food \nassistance--providing U.S. commodities to fight hunger throughout the \nworld--under Public Law 480 title II. With major crises facing us \nthroughout the world and emergency relief demands continuing to rise, \nit is extremely important that this program is funded at the highest \npossible level. Mr. President, $100 million is provided for the \nMcGovern-Dole Food for Education Program. This program provides what is \noftentimes the only meal a child receives in a day, and is used to \nencourage children, especially girls, to come to school in developing \ncountries.\n  In conservation accounts, no limitation is provided on the \nConservation Security Program or the Wetlands Reserve Program. The \nNatural Resources Conservation Service also received a slight increase. \nFunding for Conservation Operations was increased by $4 million over \nlast year's level; Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations received \nover $62 million; the Healthy Forests Reserve Program received $5 \nmillion; and funding for Watershed Surveys and Planning, the Watershed \nRehabilitation Program, and Resource Conservation and Development was \nmaintained at last year's level.\n  Agricultural research accounts within USDA also received an increase \nof approximately $30 million. This includes increases for both \ncompetitively\n\n[[Page S11141]]\n\nawarded research grants and formula-based funding for land grant \nuniversities and minority serving institutions.\n  In rural development, the Rural Community Advancement Program \nreceived an increase of nearly $20 million over last year's funding--\nand $114 million over the President's request--to provide assistance \nfor infrastructure and essential community facilities in rural \ncommunities. This includes restoring significant cuts for water and \nwastewater utility systems in rural communities. The Renewable Energy \nProgram was funded at twice the level proposed by the administration, \nallowing for critical work on ethanol and other alternative fuels. The \ncommittee did not accept the President's proposal to eliminate the \nsection 515 Direct Rental Housing loan program which since 1963 has \nprovided construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing for \nrural families and elderly residents with very low to moderate incomes. \nThat administration budget submission is the first proposal to dispose \nof this program since its inception.\n  Overall, as I said earlier, I think that Senator Bennett has done a \ngood job in making sure that this bill balances limited funding and \nmultiple priorities. I would like to thank Senator Bennett, for putting \ntogether an excellent bill, as well as Fitz Elder, IV, who has done a \nsuperb job during his first year as clerk of the subcommittee, Dianne \nPreece, Stacy McBride, and Graham Harper. Senator Bennett has assembled \na smart, hard-working staff who are always professional and work \nseamlessly with my staff, something for which I am very grateful. I \nstrongly support this bill, and I encourage all Senators to vote in \nfavor of it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kohl for his comments and \nonce again pay tribute to the spirit of bipartisanship he and I have \nbeen able to maintain. I appreciate his kind words about the staff and \nthe attempts we have made to integrate both staffs so we have had the \nkind of professional result to which he has referred.\n  Now, pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement that is in place, I \nunderstand the first order of business will concern agricultural \ndisaster assistance. So I now ask further unanimous consent that once \nthe Conrad amendment is offered to the Agriculture appropriations bill, \nthe time until 5 o'clock be equally divided in the usual form, with a \nvote occurring in relation to the Conrad amendment at 5 o'clock today, \nwith no second-degree amendments in order to the amendment prior to the \nvote. Now, I would add that we do expect a budget point of order to be \nraised, and therefore the vote is likely to be on the motion to waive \nthe budget, assuming that is done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see \nSenator Conrad is in the Chamber prepared to discuss his amendment and \nexpect that probably will take the remainder of the time until we come \nto the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, the chairman and \nranking member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, for the \nmany courtesies extended to those of us who are seeking to get a vote \non disaster assistance this year. My colleagues, the chairman and \nranking member, Senators Bennett and Kohl, have been generous and kind \nwith respect to allowing this amendment to be considered, and we deeply \nappreciate it. We certainly will not forget it.\n  The matter before the body is the fundamental question of whether \nthere is going to be disaster assistance to this Nation's farmers and \nranchers this year.\n  I also thank Senator Frist for allowing us to take up the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill today, allowing me to offer this amendment to \nprovide agricultural disaster assistance for our farmers and ranchers. \nIt took a bit of a struggle to achieve this result, to get this \nopportunity, but Senator Frist has been exceptionally kind throughout \nthis discussion and willing to have the Senate discuss this matter.\n  Some of my colleagues may ask: Senator, the majority has already \nindicated they do not intend to finish appropriations bills so what is \nthe point of this vote?\n  Well, that is a good question. When we sought this vote, we did not \nknow that the Agriculture appropriations bill would then not be \ncompleted. We did not know that there was going to be an intention to \nstop work on appropriations bills, to leave that all until next year. \nWe did not know that. So we were working in good faith to put this \nbefore the body as a matter that is urgently needed by tens of \nthousands of farm families all across America. So why go on with the \ndebate and the vote today if this bill is not going to be completed? \nThere is one very good reason: Depending on how close this vote is, \nfarmers and ranchers and their bankers will at least have an idea of \nwhether there is the prospect for disaster assistance next year. It is \ngoing to require a supermajority vote today for us to prevail because \nthe other side is going to offer a budget point of order. That is their \nright. If we are close to the 60 votes, then farmers and ranchers can \nassume there is a pretty good likelihood of disaster assistance next \nyear. If we are not close to 60, then they will be safe in concluding \nthe prospects, although still possible, are certainly more remote.\n  Why is this important? Because literally tens of thousands of farm \nand ranch families will not be able to go on without disaster \nassistance. In my own State, the independent bankers of North Dakota \nwere meeting in my office when Mr. Hubbard, chief economic adviser, \ncame to see me on a separate matter. I asked Mr. Hubbard to go into the \nconference room to listen to these independent bankers, 11 or 12 of \nthem from across the State of North Dakota. They told Mr. Hubbard \nclearly and directly: If there is no disaster assistance forthcoming, 5 \nto 10 percent of the farm and ranch families in North Dakota will be \nforced off the land. That is how serious the current circumstance is. \nIt is why we come on an emergency basis for this funding.\n  Let me indicate that this disaster approach will cost $4.8 billion. \nThat is much less than disaster packages in 2000 and 2001, about a \nthird of what disaster packages were in those years. But it is \ncritically important. Why? Because in 2005 and 2006, we had a series of \nnatural disasters across this country that were not covered in any way. \nThe last disaster package that actually went through only applied to \nhurricanes. Those who suffered from drought, from flooding, were \nexcluded. They were given no help.\n  Let me show the headlines from my State from last year: ``North \nDakota Anthrax Outbreak Grows''; ``Rain Halts Harvest''; ``North Dakota \nReceives Major Disaster Declaration''; ``Heavy Rain Leads to Crop \nDiseases''; ``Beet Crop Could Be Smallest In 10 Years''; ``Crops, Hay \nLost to Flooding''; ``Area Farmers Battle Flooding, Disease''.\n  These are only a handful of the headlines from that year. Here is a \npicture of a farm. Last year I flew over southeastern North Dakota, and \nit looked like a giant lake because farm after farm looked like this--\nwater from one horizon to the other. In the southeastern part of North \nDakota, there was massive flooding. A million acres were prevented from \neven being planted. Hundreds of thousands of additional acres were \nultimately drowned out. In other words, they could plant, they did \nplant, and then the crops were drowned out.\n  This was a devastating year for thousands of farm families. I had a \nyoung farmer, one of the best in our State, come to a farm meeting I \nheld. He told me: Senator, unless something happens, a lot of my \nneighbors are going to be gone, because we have had such an \nextraordinarily unusual weather cycle in North Dakota.\n  That young man told me he has not had a normal crop in 6 years. He is \nnot alone. I don't know whether it is global climate change or this is \nsome very unusual weather pattern, but something is happening in my \nState, something that is dramatic and unusual and devastating to \nthousands of agricultural producers. We have a lake in North Dakota \ncalled Devil's Lake. Devil's Lake has risen 26 feet in the last 8 \nyears. Devil's Lake is three times the size of the District of \nColumbia, and that lake\n\n[[Page S11142]]\n\nhas risen 26 feet in the last 8 years. I don't know how one would \ndescribe this, but it is outside any experience I have had to have a \ngiant lake rise 26 feet.\n  Three years ago in a small town in eastern North Dakota, we had 18.5 \ninches of rain in a 24-hour period, in a place that only receives that \namount of moisture in a year. Something extraordinary is happening. The \nquestion is, will there be any Federal response or are we going to say, \nTough luck, you are on your own, you are out?\n  Irony of ironies, after the massive flooding of last year, after the \nextended flooding in eastern North Dakota of the last 7 or 8 years, \nthis year drought struck, the third worst drought, according to \nscientists, in our country's history. That is what happened this year. \nAnd so instead of headlines about flooding, this is the headline: \n``Dakotas `epicenter' of a drought-stricken nation.'' This is a report \nfrom the Grand Forks Herald, one of the major newspapers of our State; \nin fact, a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper for covering the disastrous \nflooding of 1997, which many will recall, when we had the spectacle of \na fireman chest deep in water fighting a fire. The 1997 flood was the \nworst flood in 500 years in eastern North Dakota. And now that \nnewspaper is reporting on the ``epicenter of a drought-stricken \nnation.''\n  They say here more than 60 percent of the United States is in \ndrought. And we can see the epicenter is in South Dakota. But we are by \nno means alone because right down the center of the country, right down \nthe heartland of America, is terrible drought this year, the third \nworst drought in our history.\n\n  ``Experts say dry spell third worst on record.'' The only worse \ndroughts were the horrendous droughts of the 1930s, which we refer to \nnow as the Dust Bowl, and the extended drought of the 1950s. Some who \nare listening may ask, why haven't we heard about this? Why hasn't this \nbeen on the national news?\n  I think we all know why. Go back to 2005 and 2006. The disasters that \nwere in the news were Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. That is what was in \nthe news. And we have responded to those disasters. We have not \nresponded to this disaster because, frankly, it has gotten very little \nattention.\n  This will be the last opportunity for the Senate to act on this \nimportant issue. Producers across the country can look to this vote \ntoday and be able to determine whether the prospects are hopeful. If we \nget close to the 60 votes or hopefully achieve a 60-vote hurdle, then \nthe possibility of disaster assistance next year is brightened. If we \ndo not come close, then tens of thousands of farm families are going to \nbe at their bankers in the coming weeks, and they are going to be given \nthe grim news that they are done; they are finished; they will not be \nable to continue.\n  For over a year I, along with many Senate colleagues from both sides \nof the aisle, have been coming to the floor of the Senate seeking to \npass disaster assistance for our farmers. Today I come with a bill \ncosponsored by 27 of my colleagues and myself. That makes 28 of us. On \na thoroughly bipartisan basis, we have joined to urge our colleagues to \nconsider disaster assistance. Last spring, as part of the hurricane \nsupplemental, the Senate approved an agricultural disaster package for \nthe 2005 crop year. That measure was later dropped in conference due to \nopposition from the administration and House leadership. The amendment \nI am offering today is similar to the bipartisan disaster relief \nlegislation I introduced on September 28 of 2006.\n  The need for this amendment is compelling. I think my previous \nremarks made clear why it is so important in my State. It is not just \nmy State. It is North Dakota, Montana, Minnesota, South Dakota, \nWyoming, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado. There are many States \nthat have been affected. In my State, in July I went on a drought tour \nwith my colleague Senator Dorgan and our Congressman. This is my home \ncounty. This is a cornfield in July. You have heard the old saw that \ncorn should be knee high by the Fourth of July. You can see there is \nalmost nothing coming up. It is a moonscape. This is what southern \nNorth Dakota looked like this year, absolutely devastated.\n  I even went to a farm where they had irrigated corn. The farmer took \nme out and we started peeling the ears. And on irrigated corn, the \nkernels hadn't filled. Why? Because in one day, it was 112 degrees in \nmy hometown. I am not talking about the heat index; I am talking about \nthe actual temperature--in one day, 112 degrees.\n  When I say North Dakota is not alone, this is from the Drought \nMonitor from July 25 of this year. The yellow areas are termed \nabnormally dry; the tan areas are moderate drought; the darker tan, \nsevere drought; the red is extreme drought; the dark brown is \nexceptional drought. You can see that we have had drought throughout \nthe heartland of America--as I have indicated, the third worst drought \nin our Nation's history.\n  Others are communicating with us, telling us of the urgent need for \nthis assistance. We received a letter from 32 of the major farm \norganizations in America saying pass this disaster assistance. Let me \nread you the letter:\n\n       We write to respectfully urge you to support agricultural \n     disaster assistance for the 2005 and 2006 production years. \n     While many of us are hopeful that even more can be done to \n     provide disaster-related assistance, we believe the \n     bipartisan Conrad amendment, and other such amendments that \n     would make disaster assistance even more inclusive, should be \n     approved by Congress this year.\n       As you may know, a large coalition has been seeking \n     disaster assistance for more than a year. The coalition is so \n     large and united because last year 88 percent of U.S. \n     counties were declared disaster areas by USDA. This year, \n     more than 66 percent have received that same designation.\n       With wide support earlier this year, the Senate approved a \n     disaster assistance package. Unfortunately, the provision was \n     changed in conference and the final language only assisted \n     rural residents who were victims of hurricanes, not those who \n     were victims of other natural disasters, such as drought and \n     flooding. While many of us believe that even more needs to be \n     done--and would be supportive of additional assistance--we \n     nevertheless want to ensure that the Conrad amendment is \n     approved.\n       Quite simply, a disaster is a disaster. We urge you to \n     support the Conrad disaster amendment and oppose a budget \n     point of order against the amendment. Congress should do all \n     they can to provide victims of natural disaster with the \n     assistance that they need and deserve this year.\n\n  My amendment incorporates many of the provisions already approved by \nthe Senate. But I have made several modifications to address the \nobjections raised by the administration. The economic assistance \nprovisions to help program crop and dairy producers offset rising \nenergy costs in 2005 have been dramatically reduced. Payments will only \nbe made to producers who can demonstrate they suffered reduced income \nin 2005 compared with 2004, and the provision requires that those who \nwish to receive these direct payments forego the crop disaster payments \nthe amendment makes available for 2005 and 2006.\n  The administration has stated that we need to wait until harvest is \nconcluded. The harvest is over for 2006 and the losses are real and \nsignificant throughout many parts of the country. Crop and livestock \nproduction loss provisions contained in the original legislation are \nretained and will apply for both 2005 and 2006.\n  For those who say you don't have to have a loss to get assistance--\nwrong. Nobody gets a dime who has not suffered a material loss. In \nfact, crop producers must have a loss of at least 35 percent before \nthey get a thing. Let me repeat that. Crop producers will have to have \na loss of at least 35 percent before any of these provisions take \neffect for them.\n  The livestock compensation program will only be made to producers \nwhose operations are in counties designated as disaster areas by the \nSecretary and who can demonstrate that they suffered a material loss. \nThe provision also contains modest funding for conservation programs to \nhelp restore and rehabilitate drought and wildlife losses on grazing \nlands, and the provision assists small agriculturally dependent \nbusinesses that have been dramatically hurt as a result of these \nnatural disasters.\n  Because of the modifications, the cost of providing disaster \nassistance for 2005 and 2006 has been substantially reduced, from $6.7 \nbillion in previous provisions to about $4.8 billion in this amendment. \nSome have suggested that this amendment will result in farmers becoming \nmore than whole and that crop insurance is adequate to address the \nlosses our producers have sustained during the last 2 years.\n\n[[Page S11143]]\n\n  Nothing in this debate has disturbed me more than people making that \nargument because it is apparent that they simply don't know how crop \ninsurance works. They simply don't understand the formula that applies.\n  I wanted to provide a specific example to show my colleagues what is \ngoing to happen to a typical farmer under the provisions of this \nlegislation. In North Dakota, the average wheat yield is 34 bushels to \nthe acre. The average harvest price is $4.57 a bushel. So per acre, a \nfarmer could have expected, in a normal year, to get $157.21 an acre. \nNow, this year, if they would have a 50-percent loss, their market \nincome would be reduced to $78.60. With their insurance indemnity, if \nthey bought coverage at one of the most generous levels--the 75 percent \nlevel--they would get a $27 insurance payment. Under my legislation, \nthey would get an additional $7, for a total of $113, compared to what \nthey could have expected in a normal year of $157. They are losing \n$44.21 per acre in a normal year. They are still down 28 percent, even \nwith this disaster package. For those who suffer a 75-percent loss--let \nme say I have many in my State who suffered a 75-percent loss--they \nwould get $39.30 from the market. They would get an insurance payment \nof $54.18.\n  Under this legislation, they would get an additional $19.50, for a \ntotal of about $113--still losing $44 an acre, still at a loss of \nalmost 30 percent.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wonder if we can set a timeframe on \nspeaking. Would it be possible for us to ask unanimous consent that \nafter the Senator completes his statement, the other Senator from North \nDakota be recognized and then I be recognized?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we already have a unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am talking about time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have an order. As I understand it, the order is to be \nmy opening statement, followed by Senator Dorgan for what time he will \nconsume, followed by Senator Landrieu for 10 minutes. Is that not \ncorrect, I ask the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So we have a unanimous consent agreement in place. I \nthink we should follow that. In terms of time, I have maybe 5 minutes \nleft in this opening statement and Senator Dorgan needs probably 20 \nminutes and then Senator Landrieu is scheduled for 10, if that is of \nassistance to the Senator. That would indicate that we have about 40 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Of course, we usually go back and forth in a debate of \nthis nature. But since that is the order, that is fine.\n  I ask unanimous consent that after the Landrieu statement, I be \nrecognized for an equal amount of time consumed by the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, again, I want to indicate the facts. For \nthose who have said crop insurance is the answer, crop insurance will \nkeep these people from dramatic losses--wrong. That is not true. This \nbill will not prevent farmers from dramatic losses. If they have had a \n50-percent loss, even with this legislation, they are going to lose \nnearly 30 percent. If they have had a 75-percent loss, even with this \nlegislation, even with crop insurance, even with buying up to the level \nthat is the most frequent level that farmers buy, they will have a loss \nof nearly 30 percent.\n  This program is not going to make farmers rich or even make them \nwhole. But it will make the difference for thousands of farm families \nwho otherwise may be forced off the land. Farmers and ranchers need \nassistance for the 2005 and 2006 natural disaster losses, and they need \nit now. If these emergencies are not dealt with, tens of thousands of \nfarm families and Main Street businesses will suffer, many irreparably.\n  I have had farm meeting after farm meeting all across my State. \nFarmers and their families have told me that if assistance is not \nforthcoming, this will be their last year. I am not talking about a \nfew, I am talking about thousands in my State. As I have indicated, \nNorth Dakota, unfortunately, is not alone. This is a drought that has \nbeen devastating to the heartland of America. That is why there are 28 \nsponsors of this legislation on a fully bipartisan basis.\n  Let me conclude by saying that some have said--I know we will hear \nthis from the chairman of the Budget Committee--this is a budget \nbuster. Now, he knows--and everyone who follows the budget process \nknows--we do not budget for natural disasters. There is no line item in \nthe budget for natural disasters--none. Natural disasters are handled \non an emergency basis. That is what we are seeking--emergency funding \noutside of the budget because there is no budget for natural \ndisasters--none, zero. If there is going to be any assistance, it is \ngoing to have to come as it typically has, by an emergency declaration.\n  To uphold an emergency designation requires a supermajority vote in \nthe Senate. It requires at least 60 percent to support that designation \nof emergency. So those who say it is a budget buster--wrong. There is \nno budget line item for natural disasters--none. The only way there is \nsupport for natural disasters is through an emergency declaration over \nand above the rest of the budget. Why? Because decisions have been made \nin the past that you cannot predict disasters by their nature. You \ncannot say a drought is going to happen or a hurricane or a flood is \ngoing to happen. Those are acts of God. They are acts that are \nunpredictable and, therefore, are not budgeted for. Perhaps they should \nbe. Perhaps we should at least make an estimate, based on previous \nexperience, of what natural disasters cost. But it is not done. So if \nthere is going to be any assistance forthcoming for the tens of \nthousands of people who have been hurt, this is the chance this year to \nsend a signal of help, a signal of hope, a signal that we will stand \nwith these farm and ranch families and help them in their time of need.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5205\n\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I send my amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5205.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \namendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, my colleague Senator Conrad \nhas described this amendment very well. I appreciate his leadership, as \ndo other Members of the Senate.\n  For those of us who care about the future of family farming, this is \na very important issue for us. I am pleased to be here today to be a \ncosponsor of this amendment to provide disaster aid to farmers.\n  Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys in the 1930s in one of their songs \nhad a refrain that I have often used on the floor of the Senate: The \nlittle bee sucks the blossoms and the big bee gets the honey; the \nlittle guy picks the cotton and the big guy gets the money.\n  It hasn't changed much over 70 or 80 years. Somehow the big interests \nalways have their day in the Congress. It wasn't too many months ago \nthat they had their day. There was a little provision tucked in a bill \nthat passed the Congress that said to the largest corporations in \nAmerica: When you repatriate the income you have earned from abroad, we \nwill give you a big deal. You get to pay an income tax rate of 5\\1/4\\ \npercent. I think that was worth about a $100 billion tax cut to the \nbiggest economic interests in this country.\n  It was done without a lot of debate. There is plenty of money to give \na $100 billion tax cut to the big interests, but now it is time to talk \nabout working families, family farmers, small producers.\n  The big interests get their day. Now we are talking about the people \nwho shower after work rather than before work. We are talking about the \npeople\n\n[[Page S11144]]\n\nwho go out and work all day. They grease combines. They plow the \nfields. They milk cows. They do chores. Then, at the end of the day, \nthey take a shower and clean up because they worked hard all day. They \nand their families live under a yard light hoping they are going to be \nable to make a living. Often they plant a seed and hope it grows. They \nwonder whether they are going to have disease that will destroy their \ncrop. Perhaps hail will destroy their crop. Maybe it will rain too \nmuch, or maybe it won't rain at all. Maybe if they get a crop, avoiding \nall those diseases and natural disasters, including weather disasters, \nmaybe if they get a crop and they haul it to the elevator, it is \nworthless because that price has collapsed.\n  Yet that family living on the farm takes all of those risks by \nitself, and sometimes it doesn't work out for them.\n  This country for decades--for decades--has always said to family \nfarmers who live out there alone in the country: When things happen \nthat are tough for you--natural disasters, collapse in prices--we want \nto help you; we want to offer you a helping hand. We have always said \nthat in the form of disaster aid.\n  It used to be that the disaster aid came in the regular farm bill \nbecause we had a disaster title in that bill. That has been changed. So \nnow each year we have to come and plead for disaster help when a \ndisaster occurs that hurts families living out on the farms in this \ncountry.\n  What has happened this year? Here is a satellite description of what \nhappened in our country. This is July, I believe, of this year. The red \nin this satellite photo shows the drought. The red shows the destroyed \nforage. One can see the epicenter of this drought is right up in here, \nbut the drought occurs in a wide area of this country. Look at the \nepicenter of this drought.\n  Let me read something that comes from a rancher right up here, right \nin the epicenter of the drought. He says in a letter dated July 12:\n\n       The grass is so dry that it breaks off when the cows walk \n     on it. The cricks and dams, they're all dried up. We're going \n     to have to sell some of the cows pretty soon so we can try to \n     save the rest of them. If you can do anything to help us out, \n     we would really appreciate it.\n\n  ``If you can do anything to help us out, we would really appreciate \nit.'' Did anybody get an appreciative note from those who were saved \n$103 billion by getting a 5\\1/4\\-percent income tax break? Did anybody \nget a note of thanks? Did anybody else get to pay a 5\\1/4\\ income tax \nrate? Nobody in America gets to do that. But the biggest economic \ninterests got to do that last year because this Congress was generous: \nLet me give you a big tax cut of $103 billion. Now we are talking about \na few billion dollars that would reach out and help families--yes, the \nsmall producers--reach out and help families over troubled times. That \nis what this is about.\n  Let me describe a little of the history of this situation. Three \ntimes the Senate Appropriations Committee on which I serve has approved \namendments to provide disaster assistance. Three times I have offered \nthose amendments, and three times they have been accepted. Last \nDecember, 1 year ago, during the conference committee on the fiscal \nyear 2006 Defense appropriations bill, I offered a disaster amendment. \nThe Senate conferees--both sides, Republicans and Democrats--agreed to \nit and accepted it. The House conferees, at the request of President \nBush, objected to it because President Bush said he would veto the bill \nif it was part of the bill.\n  In June of this year again, the full Senate approved an amendment \nthat was on the Katrina-Iraq supplemental bill, which I included in the \nAppropriations Committee. Let me mention that in both cases, my \ncolleague Senator Conrad played quite a significant role in helping to \ndraft the amendment. He serves on the Senate Agriculture Committee, and \nI serve on the Appropriations Committee. We used the Appropriations \nCommittee as the mechanism by which we have tried to get this done.\n  Three times the Appropriations Committee in the Senate has passed \namendments that I have offered to provide disaster relief. The first \ntwo occasions were occasions in which the White House objected. The \nPresident actually said, and his advisers said, they would recommend \nthat he veto legislation that would provide disaster help for family \nfarmers.\n  In June of this year, I attached the other disaster package. It is \nthe one Senator Conrad and a large group of us--Republicans and \nDemocrats--put together. That is what is on the floor of the Senate \nright now, to be amended by the new disaster package my colleague \nSenator Conrad offers this afternoon, which I fully support.\n  So this is not a new subject. No one should come to the floor of the \nSenate surprised. We have dealt with this subject before. The Senate \nhas approved it before by a fairly significant margin. We have been \nblocked in two conferences with the House of Representatives because \nthe White House decided to block that help.\n  Let me describe a couple of pieces of history about drought. It is \nnot a new thing to have a weather disaster wipe out family farmers \nacross this country. One can see the epicenter up in the northern Great \nPlains, but one can see the destroyed forage in a wide band in the \nheartland of our country.\n  Some while ago, we saw the tracking and the description and the \nphysical damage of Hurricane Katrina. It occurred right down here in \nthe gulf. It hit this land with devastating force, unbelievable force, \nand it destroyed a lot of things. Our hearts were broken as we watched \nwhat happened in the gulf.\n  Part of what the hurricane destroyed was the crops that family \nfarmers had down in these fields. They got washed away and destroyed \ncompletely. The Congress passed legislation that said to those farmers: \nYou lost your crops due to a weather-related disaster, and here is some \ndisaster aid. The Congress said to these farmers: You lost your crops \ndue to weather, we are going to help you.\n  These farmers have lost their crops due to weather. They are just in \na different part of the country. No, it is not a hurricane, it is a \ndrought. This had a name; this didn't. Is there a difference? These \nfarmers write to us and ask: What is the difference? We had a weather-\nrelated disaster that wiped out everything we had--all the feed, all \nthe crops. We had to sell our cows because if you have a cow and you \nhave no feed, that cow is going to market. We lost everything, they \nsay.\n  How is it you help farmers in one part of the country who suffered an \nentire loss of their crops due to a hurricane and then turn a blind eye \nto farmers in other parts of the country who lost their crops due to \ndrought and other weather-related disasters? How do you justify that, \nCongress?\n  The answer is there is no justification for that. When we decide we \nare going to help--and we should, and I have always supported that, \nduring tough times we are going to help family farmers--then we must \nreach out to all the farmers in this country who suffer these \ndevastating losses.\n  I am not interested in sending financial help to farmers who didn't \nhave these losses. They are just fine. That is not what we are here \nabout today. Today we are about the issue of trying to reach out a \nhelping hand to those farmers who suffered a weather-related disaster \nand suffered losses.\n  Franklin Delano Roosevelt went out in the country during disasters, \nand he actually had a tough time traveling. He traveled by train. He \nshowed up in my part of the country on a drought tour. Then he showed \nup in Huron, SD, on a drought tour. Let me read what the President \nsaid. The reason I say this is we asked the President to come out and \ndo a drought tour this past year, or one of his underlings to come out \nand do a drought tour. In 1936, Franklin Delano Roosevelt did a drought \ntour. He stopped in Huron, SD, and here is what he said:\n\n       No city in agriculture country can exist unless the farms \n     are prosperous. We have to cooperate with one another rather \n     than buck one another. I have come out here to find you with \n     your chins up looking toward the future with courage and \n     hope, and I'm grateful to you for the attitudes you are \n     taking.\n\n  He was on a drought tour speaking from a platform on the back of a \ntrain.\n  He was also in Devils Lake, ND, August 7, 1934. Let me tell my \ncolleagues what he said about a drought tour, this President who took a \ntrain around the country. He said:\n\n       I cannot honestly say my heart is happy today because I \n     have seen with my own eyes\n\n[[Page S11145]]\n\n     some of the things I have been hearing and reading about a \n     year or more.\n\n  A growing drought that was eating the crops and destroying the crops. \nHe said:\n\n       But when you come to the water problems up here, you are up \n     against two things. In the first place, you're up against the \n     forces of nature. The second, you're up against the fact that \n     man, in its present stage of development, cannot definitely \n     control those forces.\n\n  The fact is, the President went on a drought tour and said: We want \nto help family farmers. It is not much different than what we say \ntoday. This is important.\n  Let me show a photograph of a North Dakota family farmer. He allowed \nme to show this photograph on the floor of the Senate. This is a \npicture of one of the ranchers, these ranchers who, in many cases, had \nto sell their entire herds or parts of their herds because they had \nnothing to feed their cows. As I said before, if you have cows and you \ndon't have feed, those cows are going to go to market and be sold. That \nis what has happened.\n  This is Frank Barnick. Frank and his wife and son raise cattle in \nGlen Ullin, ND. In this picture, he is walking in a crick bed that \nnormally would provide water for his cattle. As one can see, it looks \nmore like the surface of the Moon. There is no grass there, no water \nthere. Frank says:\n\n       It's the worst drought I've ever seen. You do a lot of \n     praying wondering how you're going to get through it.\n\n  One of the issues about getting through these tough times is the \nissue of what is Congress prepared to do. What is the better instinct \nof those who serve here? I have served in Congress for some long while, \nand I have always been proud of being willing to vote for emergency \nlegislation to help people in need. It doesn't matter where it is for \nme. If it is a hurricane that hits the South in the gulf coast, a \nhurricane that hits Florida, I want to be there with my vote to say \nthis country wants to say to you, victims of hurricanes, weather-\nrelated disasters: You are not alone. You are not alone because this \ncountry cares about you. I have always been proud to cast those votes. \nI never had a second thought about them, and I never wondered very much \nwhether we should. It is part of the better nature of this country to \nreach out to people and say: You are not alone and we want to help you.\n\n  I think of all of the things that we have done in this Congress in \nthe last couple of years to help people. We go all around the world. It \nis an enormously generous country. We do a lot of things to help with \neverything virtually everywhere, and that is very important and I am \nsupportive of that. But I think it is very important as well that we \nhelp people here at home and that we say to people here at home with \nrespect to problems here at home that they are important to us, that \nwhat is happening in America is important to us as well.\n  Last year, we had people in the northern part of our State who woke \nup one morning to find that they had a million acres, a million acres \nof their ground--these are family farmers who had planted in grains--\nwashed away and gone and could not be replanted. We had another million \nacres that could never be planted. We are talking about 2 million acres \nof ground because of torrential rains that were destroyed with respect \nto their productivity to raise a crop, and those family farmers sitting \nout there with that 2 million acres were left to wonder: What next? \nWill I be able to continue to farm? Will I and my spouse and my son and \ndaughter be able to continue to own this farm?\n  Well, we have had torrential rains and flooding that devastated a \nregion of our State, and then we have the epicenter of the drought, as \nI have just shown, that is almost unbelievable.\n  My colleague, Senator Conrad, and I and a Congressman took several \ndrought tours, and I have never seen anything like it. When you lose \nyour crop or you lose your pasture and you have no capability to feed \ncattle or to plant a seed or harvest a crop, is it exactly the same \ncircumstance which that family faces as the circumstance faced by a \nfamily farmer in the gulf region in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana? Of \ncourse it is. It is exactly the same.\n  So my colleague today brings a piece of legislation to the floor that \nwe have worked on and tried to perfect that does, as best we can, say \nto family farmers: Here is a package of disaster relief. No, it is not \ngoing to make anybody whole. This is not a massive package that \neverybody is going to be happy with, but at least it says to those \nfarmers: We want you to have a chance to continue farming.\n  On a couple of occasions I have described the value of this, the \ncultural value of even caring about farming. Some people say: So what. \nLet the market system work. If a family is too small to make it and it \nfloods and they can't get a crop and they are broke, tough luck. So \nlong. See you in town someplace. Somebody else will farm that land.\n  We, over some 5, 8, 10 decades in this country have known better than \nto take that attitude. Rodney Nelson, a writer from my State and a \nrancher from out near Almont, ND, wrote a wonderful piece about \nfarming. And he asked a question which is important for people in this \nChamber to ask. He asked the question: What is it worth? What is it \nworth, he asks. What is it worth for a kid to know how to weld a seam? \nWhat is it worth for a kid to know how to plow a field? What is it \nworth for a kid to know how to hang a door? What is it worth for a kid \nto know how to grease a combine? What is it worth for a kid to know how \nto change the oil in a tractor? What is it worth for a kid to know how \nto teach a calf to suck milk out of a pail? What is it worth for a kid \nto know how to brand? What is all that worth? What is all that worth?\n  There is only one place in America where they teach all that. Read \nthe history of the Second World War and see all those young men that \nmarked off America's farms that could fix anything, drive anything, do \nanything all around the world. There is only one place they teach that, \nand that university exists on America's family farms. So what is that \nworth to this country? Does it matter that families live under the yard \nlights out in the country on our farms? Does it matter? It does to me. \nIt does to me.\n  No, they are not big interests. I understand that. They are small \nproducers. But they deserve a voice in this Chamber. They deserve their \nday. They deserve the debate about their value and their worth to this \ncountry. I guarantee you the big interests get their day virtually \nevery day in these Chambers.\n  This is a day to talk about what it is worth. What is it worth for \nthis country to say to family farmers: You matter and you are not alone \nwhen trouble strikes. What is that worth for this country?\n  That is why we offer this amendment today. It is important. In March \nand April as we prepare for a new year in the Congress and work on \nappropriations bills and so on, there will be farmers who will learn \nwhether they are able to plant another crop or whether they are going \nto be kicked off the land. They and their families will learn: Does \ntheir dream continue or is it over? And it will depend in large part on \nwhat this Congress does on this issue. We should not consider this some \nsort of idle exercise.\n  It is true that amending this Agriculture appropriations bill is not \ngoing to apparently produce this product by the end of this week. But \nthis Agriculture appropriations bill, one way or another, is going to \nend up in some kind of an omnibus bill in February or early March. I am \nan appropriator. I am on the committee. And we are going to do some \nkind of an Omnibus appropriations bill, and I will do everything I can \nto see that this kind of disaster package is included in it. Putting it \nin this Agriculture appropriations bill today is the first step in \ntrying to insist that this, too, be a priority for our country.\n  Let me say to my colleague, Senator Conrad, I appreciate working with \nhim on this and many others, and underscore the point that he has made \nrepeatedly: This is not partisan, it is bipartisan. We have aggressive, \nstrong Republican supporters and Democratic supporters to this \nprovision. It is important to understand that. This is about our \npriorities. It is always about priorities, what is important and what \nis not important. And so I congratulate and thank the chairman of the \nsubcommittee and the ranking member, Senator Bennett, Senator Kohl, and\n\n[[Page S11146]]\n\nthank all of those who have joined in a very substantial bipartisan \namendment to once again say to this country and this Chamber that \nfamily farmers matter to this country. And when they are in trouble, we \nneed to reach out to say to them: You are not alone. The best, most \neffective way to do that today is to pass this amendment, and I hope we \nwill do that by the end of this day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan, who \nhas been such a leader on this issue for our farm and ranch families \nand who has repeatedly offered disaster legislation on the \nappropriations bill and has repeatedly passed it on the appropriations \nbill. In fact, there is, in the underlying appropriations bill of the \nAgriculture Committee, disaster assistance. The problem is, though, it \nonly covers 1 year, and we now know we have had 2 years of remarkable \ndisasters.\n  While we are waiting for Senator Gregg to come to the Senate floor, I \nthought I would just take a moment to read from some of the letters \nfrom farmers in my State, the things that they have written me. This is \na letter from last year, the flood year. This is what the man wrote:\n\n       The rains began in earnest the last days of May 2005. Our \n     crops were in the ground so the majority of the input costs \n     for the crops were already realized. We received 25 inches of \n     rain in 33 days. The attached pictures show the result. In \n     our local town residents were going up and down the streets \n     in boats.\n       We did our very best to cope with expenses but with the \n     increased energy prices and the loss of crop income, we and \n     all the other producers in our area lost the battle. Our farm \n     had financial reversals in the amount of $110,000. We carry \n     crop insurance but this program does not begin to cover our \n     risks.\n       In speaking with loan officers at 2 of our local banks I \n     was told that First National Bank expects to restructure 60 \n     percent of their ag loans. State Bank estimates restructuring \n     75 to 80 percent of their loans. This is serious business in \n     agriculture.\n\n  He closed by saying:\n\n       Please support disaster relief currently working its way \n     through Congress. If you do, you will literally be the \n     difference between me being able to continue to produce food \n     and fiber for this great Nation and not being able to \n     continue this production.\n\n  A second letter from a man this year:\n\n       I farm and ranch with my father and mother and this is the \n     second year in a row that our neighbors and ourselves have \n     endured natural disasters. When I say disaster, I mean 25 \n     inches of rain in the month of June alone, and complete crop \n     loss. I farm approximately 630 acres myself, and I did not \n     harvest a single kernel of grain from any of it. The rivers \n     started to run the 3rd of July and pushed across 80 acres of \n     my alfalfa field, killing approximately 40 acres.\n       Enclosed are pictures to give you an idea of what the \n     conditions were like. The pictures look as though they could \n     have been taken after Katrina, but we know otherwise. Those \n     people need assistance for a complete loss. What we had here \n     was not as catastrophic on a widespread manner, but \n     destruction of crops was there. Please assist us. Thank you \n     for your time and any assistance you might provide.\n\n  This is another letter. This letter is from this year. And, remember, \nlast year we had this incredible flooding, and now this incredible \ndrought.\n\n       We are writing to ask for your help. We were burnt out this \n     week by a prairie fire on the Standing Rock Reservation. We \n     lost 5,000 acres of pasture. We don't know how we are going \n     to feed our cattle this winter, as we have lost our winter \n     grazing.\n       This, on top of the drought here in south central North \n     Dakota, we don't know how much more we can contend with. We \n     planted wheat, but have nothing to harvest this year due to a \n     lack of rain, and crop insurance will barely pay our input \n     costs, so there will not be any income from a crop this year.\n       As for buying feed for cattle, hay will cost approximately \n     $100 per ton with trucking. We will also need to purchase \n     supplement and corn. This is in addition to the high cost of \n     electricity, fuel, and propane.\n       We don't know how much more we can endure. We don't know \n     why our country helps other nations, but not our own people, \n     and especially the farmers. Other nations give nothing back.\n       Selling the cattle is not the answer either. As a result, \n     there will be no income. Please let us know if there is any \n     assistance for us.\n\n  And another letter. This is from the head of a bank, the Commercial \nBank of Mott, ND, near where Senator Dorgan grew up:\n\n       Attached are six agricultural operations associated with \n     the Commercial Bank of Mott. Five of these businesses are \n     located in Hettinger County and one in Grant County. Over the \n     course of the last two weeks, these producers have come to \n     the bank to discuss their financial position. The projections \n     attached have been assembled to reflect accurately each \n     producer's current standard.\n\n  As you review each and every projection, it is apparent that all of \nthese producers were dramatically affected by the drought of 2006. At \nthis writing, without any government intervention or disaster aid, it \nappears that three of these producers will be going out of business. \nThey simply cannot absorb losses of this magnitude.\n\n       The last spreadsheet attached shows that the six producers \n     have collectively lost $875,000 in this year.\n\n  Six producers losing $875,000.\n\n       We are here today because you have asked us to come. We now \n     ask you to support agriculture and to help provide these \n     producers with a fair and equitable disaster program. I might \n     add, the program is needed now.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if my colleague would yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. In the context of how much money is required to try to be \nhelpful to family farmers as they struggle through this weather-related \ndisaster period to determine whether they are actually going to be able \nto continue farming, I noticed a story the other day--I believe it was \nyesterday--which stated that we now have 100,000 private contractors we \nare paying in the country of Iraq. We are passing pieces of legislation \nhere in the Congress, hundreds of billions of dollars of supplementals, \nemergency supplementals. My understanding is that we are going to be \npresented with another emergency supplemental for $120 billion.\n  In terms of what one spends, at least with respect to helping farmers \nwho have gotten hit with tough times, you know what you are doing and \nwhere it is going to go.\n  The point I am making is, isn't it the case that in the context of \nall of this, we are not talking about a great deal of money, but in \nthis case we are talking about a lot of people who will be directly \nhelped, and it likely will determine whether many of them will be able \nto continue working on the family farm and operating the family farm? I \nunderstand this is an expenditure of money, but to the extent that we \nhave emergencies bantered around here virtually all the time, it really \nis an emergency when a weather-related disaster hits--really hits--and \ndevastates a region. That really is an emergency, to determine whether \nyou are going to be able, or willing, to help families in deep \ntrouble. Isn't it the case that this is not a substantial amount of \nmoney, given all the other things we have decided to very quickly say \nyes to?\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to my colleague, this equals about 10 days of \nexpenditure in Iraq, based on what we are told the supplemental will be \nand what is already in the budget. So this is modest compared to \nprevious disaster packages. It will not make farmers whole.\n  As I have indicated in the examples I have provided, farmers who had \na 50-percent loss will still have a 28-percent loss in economic terms, \neven with this package. A farmer who has lost 75 percent, even with \nthis package and with aggressive crop insurance, will still have a 28-\npercent loss as well.\n  This is a defining moment for thousands of people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation \nrelative to time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire controls 60 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I \ndo feel it is uniquely ironic that the first amendment offered--and \nthis was the first amendment offered after the election--would increase \nthe debt of this country by $4.9 billion; that it would abandon the \nbudget and essentially say we should spend additional funds and pass \nthose costs on to our children.\n  Throughout the election cycle, I think I heard a great deal about \nfiscal responsibility. I especially heard it from the other side of the \naisle, about how we as Republicans have been profligate allegedly. \nMaybe those were just words, because the first formal action taken by \nthe other side, which is now moving into the majority position, is to \nspend $4.9 billion which we do not have on an emergency which is \ndeclared in the agricultural community, and which funds are, in many \ninstances, not even emergency related if\n\n[[Page S11147]]\n\nyou were to define a traditional emergency.\n  It is hard to understand how we can want to increase the debt on our \nchildren in this manner. Clearly I think it is inconsistent with what \nthe American people asked for when they voted in the last election. I \nthink they asked that we have a reasonable approach to fiscal policy, \nthat we start spending within our means, and that we stop passing on to \nour kids the costs of today. This is a cost of today.\n  This amendment should have been handled in the regular order of the \nappropriations process. It should have been handled by being offset or \nby a reduction in expenses somewhere else, or it should have been \nhandled within the spending cap which was proposed for the agricultural \ncommunity. It is not. It is an emergency which is a designation placed \non it basically for the purposes of avoiding the obligations of the \nbudget.\n  Let me ask, is it really an emergency that we spend $24 million \nprovided solely to the sugar beet producers rather than giving them the \nassistance through the crop disaster program? That is an earmark, that \nis not an emergency.\n  Is it really an emergency to spend $3 million specifically providing \nsugarcane growers in Hawaii nondisaster assistance? It is simply an \nearmark. A $95 million payment to dairy producers for losses? Earmark. \nWhat about $6 million provided for a flood area in North Dakota? An \nearmark. Or $1 million for a land replacement and retention program? An \nearmark. Or $10 million for the purposes of a watershed project in \nanother State? An earmark. These are not emergencies. This is simply an \nattempt to get votes. That is the way it works around here. You get a \nbig chunk of money, you put an ``emergency'' title on it, and then you \nrun around and adjust the spending in that amount of money so you can \npass it and avoid the 60-vote point of order. Logrolling is the term \nthat historically has been applied to that. People don't remember that \nterm, but that is what it is historically.\n  The irony is, of course, the underlying bill already had $4 billion \nof emergency money designated in it which should not have been \ndesignated, but that money wasn't allocated in a way that the sponsors \nof this bill felt comfortable enough with to get the 60 votes, so they \ntook that money and cleared it with this money and basically added $4 \nbillion to the debt.\n  When we say added to the debt, what we are saying basically is our \nchildren are going to have to pay for it. Our children are going to \nhave to pay tomorrow for costs that are going to benefit a small group \nof farmers today. That cost should have been borne by expenditures \nbeing reduced today or expenditures being reallocated today. It should \nnot be borne by throwing it on the deficit and making our kids pay for \nit.\n  There are some other things in this declaration of additional deficit \nspending of $4.9 billion which are questionable. For example, dairy \nfarmers and certain crop programs can receive this payment for \nproduction if they can show they had a loss in 2005 net farm income \ncompared to 2004. There is no requirement that loss be shown related to \nanything that had to do with an emergency; it could be that they became \ninefficient, ineffective, or simply didn't know what they were doing \nand made mistakes. But they are going to get paid for not making as \nmuch money in 2005 as they did in 2004. It has nothing to do with an \nemergency. It is only if they can show they didn't do as well in 2005 \nas they did in 2004, they are going to get tax dollars.\n  There are a lot of businesses in this country today that did not do \nas well in one year as they did in the next year. Are we to declare \nthat every one of those businesses should get emergency funds simply \nbecause they had a difference between their income in one year from the \nnext year? The fact may be that the difference in income was because \n2004 was a great year, as it happened to be, and 2005 wasn't a great \nyear. It was a good year, a very good year in many farm communities, \nbut the difference is now going to be picked up by the taxpayers. So \nessentially there wasn't a lot of incentive to do better in 2005 than \n2004. Essentially we are saying to those folks who worked harder and \nwere more productive and did have a better year in 2005 than 2004: \nSorry, your activity wasn't relevant. The person who didn't work as \nhard as you, who wasn't as productive as you, maybe ran his farm more \npoorly than you, we are going to pay him the difference in income from \n1 year to the next. That is classic 1930s Government, I guess, if you \nbelieve in that theory of governance, the theory that people should be \npaid for doing a lousy job and not being productive.\n\n  This amendment in and of itself represents a 23-percent increase in 1 \nyear in the subsidies for farm programs in this country; 23 percent. \nThat is a huge 1-year shot of expenditures. It is rather dramatic, to \nreflect the fact it is in relationship to the emergency process when \nthere is no relationship; they are disjointed here. There is some, but \nit is primarily disjointed.\n  The way this amendment is structured, the way this language is \nstructured, under the traditional crop insurance program a person is \nsupposed to buy crop insurance. Under this bill, if you do not buy crop \ninsurance you are still going to get paid. In fact, they are no longer \nsubject to the percentage cap, which is the traditional way. So you \ncould actually end up making more under this program, under these \nproposals, with a crop loss than you would make if you had actually \nbrought your crops in on target.\n  It is inconsistent with marketplace economics, as is the concept that \nyou would get paid for having a bad year, the difference between a good \nyear and a very good year.\n  The contrast is pretty significant because what they have done is \nreversed what has been a historical factor with our agriculture bills, \nwhich is that you include in most of the agriculture disaster bills \nthat come through this body--in fact, all of them--that they have \nincluded a percentage cap and a requirement to purchase crop insurance. \nThis bill rejects both of those concepts, which is sort of even a \nbigger grab at the taxpayers' wallet.\n  This bill affronts the sensibilities of fiscal responsibility. I \nmean, the idea that you would spend $4.9 billion outside the budget as \nthe first act of the Congress, after returning from an election when \nthe American people said get your fiscal house in order, is an affront \nto the election process. It is like saying there was no election. \nPeople didn't have anything to say in the last election about fiscal \nresponsibility; it was all about other subjects. I disagree with that.\n  This sets a very bad tone, in my opinion, for the next Congress. This \nis truly the first act of the next Congress, whether we are going to \nlive within the budget for the fiscal year under which the next \nCongress is going to function. Under this proposal, we are not only \ngoing to not live within it, we are going to make a joke out of it. We \nare going to spend $4.9 billion, much of it earmarked--not much of it \nbut a significant amount of it earmarked--much of it reorganized so it \nis structured in a way that benefits folks who may not have had a \ndisaster at all and much of it structured in a way that rejects what \nhas been the historical approach toward farm disasters, which is it has \nto have a relationship to a percentage cap and to production and to \npurchasing of crop insurance.\n  It is terrible, fiscally. It is bad policy from a farm standpoint, \nalso. It is essentially an attempt to build a coalition of 60 votes, \nwhich 60 votes will then represent a raid on the Treasury on behalf of \nan interest group, an interest group which has compelling arguments but \nwhich is still an interest group and is difficult to defend in the \ncontext of fiscal responsibility.\n  That being the case, this proposal is subject to a point of order. If \nthe Senator from North Dakota is ready, I will make the point of order \nnow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to raise the \npoint of order at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, pursuant to the fiscal year 2006 budget \nresolution, I raise a point of order against the emergency designation \nof the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 402 of House \nConcurrent Resolution 95, the concurrent resolution on the budget for \nfiscal year 2006,\n\n[[Page S11148]]\n\nI move to waive section 402 of that concurrent resolution for purposes \nof the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays at the designated time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I now yield to the Senator from Oklahoma such time as he \nmay desire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first, I compliment my colleagues from \nNorth Dakota. They have described a very real problem in farm country. \nWestern Oklahoma and north central Oklahoma have been plagued by \ndrought. Much of the wheat crop could not be planted last year because \nthere was no soil moisture in which to plant it. The problem they are \ndescribing is a very real problem. The emotional context in which they \nput it is a very true indication of the plight of some of the farmers \nfrom Oklahoma and throughout the country.\n  When you look at agriculture in our country, what we find is it is \nbasically undercapitalized. If the average farm was about 1,800 acres, \nthe average farmer could take 2 terrible crop years and still be OK, \nstill have his assets, still have the ability to come back and earn \nagain. We have great commodity prices right now. The problem is there \nwere no crops to take advantage of those great product prices.\n  The idea that we ought to be about helping our farmers is a correct \nidea. I applaud both Senators from North Dakota for their persistence \nin bringing up this issue. As a matter of fact, I think this issue is \nso important to the real problems that are out there because I don't \nsee how we can leave here on Friday, which everyone is planning on \ndoing, and not address this issue.\n  There is a lot I disagree with in this bill. The Senators from North \nDakota know that. I have expressed it. I am going to outline some of \nthose.\n  If this election taught us anything, it is that the American \ntaxpayers want us to put good value with what we do.\n  A couple of facts: This bill can be paid for. It is not. This \namendment is not paid for. But it could be. As a matter of fact, I \nwould bet that after this election we have a consensus within the \nSenate to pay for it. Let me give you some examples how we pay for it.\n  I know the Senator from North Dakota has another which I didn't think \nof, but I know several on this side would probably agree it is a great \npay-for. There is $8.13 billion in unobligated balances in the \nAgriculture Department right now. That money could be used to pay for \nthis, and then in the reappropriations process that we start in \nFebruary we could come back through, recognizing that we are using $4.8 \nbillion of that money to pay for this.\n  One of my problems with the Agriculture appropriations bill that this \namendment is going to be attached to is there is $800 million worth of \nearmarks, most of which come out of the very services the farmers are \ndependent upon to grow a good crop. A lot of it comes out of ARS, the \nvery thing we shouldn't be taking money out of, but yet we have $758 \nmillion worth of earmarks that aren't necessarily a priority for our \ncountry or the farm communities but are a priority in terms of the \npolitical benefits that it gives the Members of this body and the \nHouse.\n  This is a fine-print page of all the earmarks in this bill. Most of \nthe American public, when they look at it, 50 percent of these projects \nthey would have trouble stomaching saying this is a priority at this \ntime. There is no attempt to eliminate the earmarks to pay for this, \nwhich would pay 20 percent of this Agriculture bill disaster amendment \nwe have before us.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one moment?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am very much in sympathy with the Senator on the notion \nof paying for this. In fact, I spent much of the morning trying to \nfigure out a way I could offer a pay-for which I think the Senator and \nI might agree with and I think most of the body would agree with. It \nwould more than pay for this. I have been advised by legal counsel that \nif we offer a pay-for in the context of this bill and this amendment, \nwe would then be subject to rule XVI. Under rule XVI, any Senator can \nraise it and the amendment would fall with no vote. So we are in a very \nunfortunate circumstance. We can't offer a pay-for.\n  Let me be very direct about what the pay-for is which I would have \noffered today if I weren't prevented by the rules from doing so. It \nturns out the Interior Department failed in contracts with oil \ncompanies to provide for royalties when oil prices went above a certain \namount. Oil prices are above that amount today. The loss to the \nTreasury, I am told, is in the range of $11 billion. That would pay for \nthis twice over. Unortunately, we can't offer our proposal and the \nSenator can't offer his without being subject to rule XVI. I wanted to \nsay that for the Record. I appreciate very much that the Senator knows \nI wish to pay for this as well. We have a way to do a pay-for, but I am \nprecluded by the rules from offering it.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I reclaim the floor.\n  Let me talk again about some of the problems that are behind the bill \nas it is presently written. We are never going to have a crop insurance \nprogram in this country that will ever work if we keep bailing people \nout who fail to buy crop insurance. Granted, there is a change in this \nbill from what it was. It was 35 percent or 40 percent available to \nthose who didn't buy crop insurance. Now we have cut it to 20. But we \nare still sending a signal that you don't have to buy crop insurance, \nbecause even if you do not, we are going to be there with the money. \nThat is exactly the wrong signal. If we want to have a crop insurance \nprogram to work, we have to have the discipline to say if you choose \nnot to buy it and we had this available to you, then in fact you are \nnot going to get the benefit.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield on that point without interfering \nwith the Senator's time?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will take this on my time.\n  The Senator makes a very good point. In previous disaster bills, \nthose that did not have crop insurance got 45 percent of the prevailing \nprice. Under this bill, we have dropped that dramatically to 20 \npercent. Why? The Senator asks a very good question. Frankly, the \noverriding reason is there are certain crops for which crop insurance \ndoesn't work at all, largely specialty crops in this country for which \nthe crop insurance program badly needs reform. I think most of us from \nfarm country would agree on that. There are real problems with crop \ninsurance. Crop insurance for specialty crops was never written in a \nway that makes any economic sense, or in many cases covers the crops at \nall. That is why we still have a provision that gives some assistance \nto those who do not have crop insurance.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reclaiming the floor again, the point is \nhad we not given 45 percent before, many of these would have bought \ncrop insurance. The very fact that we are going to go out and give \nmoney to people who had an opportunity to protect their losses and \nchose not to, we are sending a signal that we are going to get less \nparticipation in crop insurance, not more. What we want is a crop \ninsurance program that will work and which has the incentive so that \nmany farmers say, Uncle Sam isn't going to come; I have an opportunity \nto protect myself and I am going to buy it. Does it cost me something? \nSure.\n  The second point I was going to make relates to the chart which the \nSenator from North Dakota showed which showed the amount of losses. \nWhat he didn't say is that farmers also had the opportunity to buy a \nmuch higher level of coverage which they chose not to do. But it is out \nthere. Had they done this, their losses would have been far less than \nthey are today. Economically, they have to make a decision. I am not \nagainst helping those who are in need today. But I think there are \nthings which could perfect the amendment which I hope the Senators from \nNorth Dakota would consider. We have had two great production years in \nthis country where net farm income has been as high as it has been \nexcept this last year. We are going to be calculating off a base of the \nhighest that we had. That is number one.\n  Number two, there is nothing in this that looks at net assets of a \nfarmer because farmers who in fact are capitalized to the degree that \nthey can take a\n\n[[Page S11149]]\n\ntough year--we are going to pay them, too. The American people have \nkind of spoken in November. Use common sense. Give us value for our \ndollar. The very well-to-do farmer who is very well capitalized we are \ngoing to bail out as we are going to bail the guy who is not, and he is \nthe one who doesn't need bailing out.\n  What I want to see us at some point go to in the future with our farm \nprograms is how we increase the capital of the individual farmers where \nthey are capitalized to the level where they can in fact hit a bump in \nthe road and still make it; can in fact hit 20 bumps in the road, and \nwe know what that is. I have the studies. It is a minimum of 1,800 \nacres and the capital to supply the equipment to farm such 1,800 acres.\n  The other thing in this bill is the duplication of programs that are \nalready out there. That is $300 million to help small businesses who \nsupply the farm community. That is what the Small Business \nAdministration is all about. We are going to turn around and give \n$80,000 to small businesses. We have a program for that. Yet we are \ngoing to turn around and create another Government program that is \ngoing to say you didn't have to be a good businessman if there is a \nlittle bit of a dent in the crop year; all you have to do is come and \nbe bailed out, too, instead of taking a program that we need to make \nbetter, that sends a signal to the farmers, saying we are going to help \nyou when you need help, but you have to be responsible in terms of crop \ninsurance. We will let the other branch of the Government that has \nthese areas covered be made available and we will help nurture the \nstaff there.\n  One other area that kind of drives me crazy with this amendment is we \nare adding staff to the Department of Agriculture. They have 95,000 \nemployees. Not all of those are in agricultural production. They have \nseveral thousand contract employees, and we are going to add employees \nto implement this.\n  I tell you that from my visits around Oklahoma, there are more than \nenough people at FSA and all the different branches and all the \ndifferent organizations associated with the Department of Agriculture \nto implement this now. We don't need to add people. What we need to do \nis get the money to the people who need it. And we can do that. All we \nhave to do is have good management and good direction.\n  I abhor the fact that we steal money from ARS for earmarks to help us \npolitically but hurt the very people that we say we want to help with \nthis amendment.\n  I think it is also wrong to take money from AFS which deals with \nbovine encephalitis and bird flu. We are taking money and time away \nfrom that agency to pay for earmarks. That is wrong. We shouldn't be \ndoing that. If we are going to have earmarks, let us take it from some \nplace that is not going to undermine the very farmers we say we are \ntrying to help.\n  We have a ton of cattle in Oklahoma, and I know we do all through the \ncentral Midwest and in the upper plains, that have been markedly harmed \nby the drought.\n\n  We need to be careful with the precedent we set here. We are slowly \nmoving in a direction to make all production agriculture similar to \nwhat we have done with crop insurance agriculture. I think we need to \nhave the patience to say how do we do this in a way that does not \ncreate another expectation of bailing someone.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire was very correct when he talked about \nwhat this bill is going to do in terms of busting the budget. I am \ngoing to be voting to sustain the point of order because I don't think \nwe should be doing it that way.\n  I want to be very clear. That doesn't mean I think we should not be \ndoing something to help farmers. I also will say very insistently that \nif this Congress goes home without addressing this issue on a \nfreestanding bill for agriculture assistance, I think we will have let \ndown the American people. I know we will have let down the American \nfarmer and rancher.\n  I think we ought to consider looking at the adjournment resolution \nand mount an opposition to this if this issue is not addressed before \nwe go home. I think we can work behind the scenes to pay for this. I \nthink we can work behind the scenes to change it where we can build the \nsupport for it, and I think we can work behind the scenes to give \nsomething to the President that he can sign and start implementing the \nmonth of December into January, and farmers will know whether they are \ngoing to plant a corn crop in March or a wheat crop next fall if they \nhaven't been able to plant one this year.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. Certainly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma, makes some \nimportant points. He talks about the need to have patience. One of the \nissues for all of us is we are about out of patience on this issue. The \nfact is it has been almost a year and a half trying to move this the \nthird time--not just this but a different variation of this--trying to \nfind a way to help those producers who are hurting. Patience is a \nvirtue, but sometimes we run out of patience, and we are near that end.\n  With respect to the question of payment limits and so on, I agree \nwith the Senator. Senator Grassley from Iowa and I have coauthored \namendments--and we will again offer amendments on the floor of the \nSenate--to establish payment limits in the farm bill. My colleague \nSenator Conrad has been an active supporter of that. We don't have \ndisagreement on those kinds of issues. I think the crop insurance \nprogram, while important, has never been sufficiently contracted to \nreap prices and replace disasters when a real disaster strikes. That is \npart of the issue here. These aren't just bad rains or high winds; \nthese are real disasters when you see the epicenter of a drought that \ndestroys all of the farmers. I am sympathetic. I understand what the \nSenator from Oklahoma is saying. I hope he understands patience is not \ninexhaustible when producers are wondering whether they and their \nfamily are going to be able to continue. I am talking about a lot of \nfamilies who are struggling very hard.\n  Let me say finally the sentiments of the Senator from Oklahoma about \ntrying to help family farmers is very much, in sync with the sentiments \nof Senator Conrad and others. We very much want this Congress to reach \nout a helping hand to those farmers who risk losing everything if we \ndon't help them some, and say, You are not alone, we are going to help \nyou. That is what we are trying to do here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the overall point of all this is we can do \nthis the easy way or we can do this the hard way. The hard way is what \nthe American people expect us to do--and the hard way is paying for \nthis. The easy way is not to pay for it. The easy way is to walk out of \nhere this Friday having maybe passed your amendment or not. It is not \ngoing to make any difference in terms of the farmers because it isn't \ngoing anywhere. We have already been told that. The hard way is to make \nthe tough choices about the priority of the Government spending of this \ncountry and say the farmers ought to be prioritized at this point in \ntime. We are going to do the hard work to make the cuts somewhere else \nto pay for it.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a brief point?\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me make my point. I will yield in a minute.\n  What we are doing, if we pass this without offset, we are taking out \nthe good old politician credit card saying we don't have the guts to do \nit the right way, we don't have the stamina to do it, we don't have the \ncourage to do it. By the way, grandchildren, here you go. Back in 2006, \nwe couldn't do the right thing, we didn't have the courage to do the \nright thing, and we are charging it to you. And besides charging it to \nyou, we will charge the interest from the time now until you are 40 \nyears of age, so you are paying 40 percent or 50 percent regular, \nmiddle-income-America taxes because that is the only way we will get \nout of this.\n  Three points, and then I am finished.\n  There are things that need to be changed in the bill that send the \nwrong message, especially on crop insurance. We will never get crop \ninsurance fixed if we keep sending the message we are sending with this \namendment.\n  No. 2, there are other organizations within the Federal Government \ndesigned to help small businesses. We ought to use them rather than \ncreate another one.\n\n[[Page S11150]]\n\n  The third point, we ought to pay for it. We as a Congress do not have \nthe courage to stand here and fight and say we are not going home until \nwe have taken care of this problem for the farm community in America \nand done it right--not limiting payments but looking at payments as a \npercentage of your net assets rather than having a fixed dollar amount. \nWe don't have the courage to do that for the American people.\n  That is what the American people rejected in this last election. They \nwant Congress to stand up and fight courageously for the values they \nuse every day in their homes and their jobs when they have to make \ndecisions. They have to decide on priorities. We will walk out. There \nisn't going to be any aid for the farm community. Come back in \nFebruary. When we do it again, it probably isn't going to get paid \nfor--either the Agriculture bill, for $4 billion in the original \nAgriculture bill, or this one probably won't get paid for, and we will \nslip them a credit card and say: Timeout; we will not make the tough \nchoices; we did not have the courage to fight for your future.\n  By the way, the exit polls at the last election show that 57 percent \nof Americans do not believe their kids will have it as good as we have \nit today. If we keep doing this, they won't. It is our obligation to \nstart acting and doing what we say on the campaign trail. We are \ninterested in securing the future for the next generations of this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I don't have disagreements about the issue of the pay-for \nhere, and I think my colleague has already described he has a provision \nthat would pay for this. There is a rule XVI against it if he puts it \nin this bill. I suggest perhaps we do a unanimous consent on the pay-\nfor. If he doesn't, I know a politician who will easily pay for it. I \nwill do a unanimous consent to pay for it. It will be objected to, \nregrettably.\n  These things ought to be paid for. The first time we suggest this is \nwhen a family is in trouble on the farm. We have had hundreds of \nbillions of dollars come through here with hardly a blink, none of it \npaid for. That ought to change. I am with the Senator from Oklahoma. \nLet's try to change that.\n  The fact is, this does not have a pay-for, not because Senator Conrad \ndoesn't want it there or I don't want it there; it ought to be there. \nWe have the device by which this can be paid for. There is a rule \nagainst it, but we ought to do a unanimous consent to describe the fact \nthat it will be objected to, but we want it paid for.\n  Mr. COBURN. I agree with the Senator. He knows my record. I have not \nvoted to not pay for anything in this body. I don't believe we borrow \nthe future of our children to take care of our present-day needs.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. On the question of paying for it, I have complete \nagreement with the Senator from Oklahoma. I wish the rules permitted us \nto offer an amendment to pay for it.\n  No. 1, on the question of requiring--that we have dropped the crop \ninsurance requirement, we did because it cost money. It is the scoring \nrules around this place that don't make much sense to me. When we \nsubmitted it to CBO, they said if you have a crop--I submitted it with \nthe crop insurance requirement in it, and they said if you do that, it \ncosts $40 million.\n  No. 2, there is a payment limit in this legislation. It is an $80,000 \npayment limit. There is a gross income test in this legislation.\n  We tried to address some of the things the Senator is concerned \nabout, and he is right about those things. We have tried to address it \nwith a payment limitation--$80,000--with a gross income test, which is \na little different from a net asset test, but it tries to get at the \nsame point the Senator is making.\n  I say to the Senator on the question of the small business economic \nloss grants, the Senator cited the $300 million that was in the \nprevious legislation. We cut that to $100 million. We left it in there \nfor this reason. We have heard from crop sprayers all over the country, \nat least the drought-stricken area. In the heartland of the country, \nthey have reported they have gone to the SBA. They told them they have \nsuffered such devastating losses, they are not eligible for SBA, they \nare out. That is the reason the $100 million is left. It really is for \nthose who are most directly affected by a dramatic falloff in acreage. \nThis started with a company in North Dakota that called me. The acreage \nthey were spraying was reduced 80 percent this last year. Their losses \nwere staggering. If there is not something like this, they are out at \nSBA. Then we started research in other States and found the same thing. \nThat is the reason for that.\n\n  I go back to the question of providing some assistance to those who \ndidn't buy crop insurance because I basically agree with the Senator's \npoint. We do have this fundamental problem of crop insurance not being \npractical and not being available, in many cases, for the specialty \ncrop people. We did try to get at the point the Senator is making by \ndramatically reducing what they get.\n  Under previous disaster bills, they would get 45 percent of \nprevailing prices. In this disaster bill, we have dropped that to 20 \npercent. We didn't think it was fair to eliminate it given the fact we \nhave not crafted a crop insurance program--especially that the \nspecialty crop people could have available to them--that is \neconomically viable.\n  I thank the Senator very much for his courtesy.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from North Dakota for \ntheir effort.\n  This bill coming to the floor, the underlying bill--not this \namendment--the emergency money could have been offset when it came \nthrough the appropriation process, and it wasn't. It was just put in. \nWe don't want to make the hard choices. We don't want to pay for them. \nThat has to change in the future.\n  My hope is we will give some consideration because as things stand \nand look now, we are not going to have an emergency bill with which the \nagricultural community that has been so hurt by the drought this past \nyear and year and a half is going to have something to hang their hat \non come the first of the year. I look forward to working with the two \nSenators from North Dakota to try to accomplish that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have not had a chance to respond to my \ncolleague, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget. The Senator \nfrom South Dakota has been waiting patiently, but if he would not mind \nif I took 2 minutes to respond to Senator Gregg.\n  The chairman of the Committee on the Budget said: Look, this doesn't \njust respond to natural disasters; this is a series of earmarks. I say \nto my colleague, there are no earmarks here. There is nothing \nindividual Members put in this bill. I drafted this bill. I drafted it \nin broad consultation with Members of this Senate. There are no \nearmarks in the sense of what typically is in an appropriations bill \nwhere individual Members put in provisions that have never been on any \nlegislation before.\n  One would be hard pressed to point to a single provision in this bill \nthat has not been in previous disaster legislation. One would be hard \npressed to find a single provision here that has not been in previous \ndisaster legislation, in fact, in a far more generous way than is in \nthis bill. In 2000, we had a disaster bill that cost $14 billion. The \nnext year, in 2001, it cost between $11 and $12 billion. This disaster \nbill is for 2 years, and it is $4.8 billion. On a comparable basis to \n2000 and 2001, that was a total of $25 billion for 2 years, and this is \n$4.8 billion for 2 years. The truth is, we have cut, cut, cut to be \nfiscally responsible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time does the Senator require? I advise the \nSenator we have 23 minutes remaining on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 21\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. THUNE. I will try to do it in 5 minutes. I thank the Senator for \nyielding.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from North Dakota to the Agriculture appropriations bill. I \nhave been\n\n[[Page S11151]]\n\nlistening to the discussion in the Senate between my colleagues from \nNorth Dakota and my colleague from Oklahoma over the whole issue of \nwhether this ought to be paid for and how it is paid for. Frankly, I am \nwith all of you--I will stay here as long as is necessary to get this \ndone. If we can come up with a mechanism that doesn't run into an \nobjection that allows us, by unanimous consent or whatever mechanism is \nnecessary, to pay for it, I am for that because I agree entirely. I \nhappen to think if there is a mechanism whereby we can offset this, we \nought to make every effort we possibly can to do that.\n  However, if you look at the impact the drought had on the Dakotas \nthis year--it has been described on the maps shown earlier this day as \nthe epicenter--the bull's-eye of the drought across this country, and \nthe upper Midwest, the upper Plains States, South Dakota and North \nDakota in particular, have been crippled by it. It was not just a 1-\nyear event but a multiple-year event. It has been successive years, \nyear after year after year, of drought. This last summer in particular \nwas dreadful for producers across South Dakota. It was the hottest July \nin 70 years. The rainfall accumulations we received this year were \nlower than the average during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n  I traveled my State of South Dakota on numerous days in the month of \nJune. I visited Sully County in the middle of our State. In the month \nof July, I was in Walworth County in the middle of our State. In the \nmonth of August, Senator Johnson and I went on a five-county tour in \ncentral South Dakota. Everywhere we went, the story was the same: The \ndrought had destroyed our crops; destroyed the wheat crop; it wiped out \nmuch of the corn crop. Cornstalks, where there should have been corn \ngrowing, were very short. And even cornstalks that were a little taller \nthan that, when you would look further--took a closer look--there were \nno ears on the cornstalks. Where there were soybeans that should have \nbeen lush and thick, they were not. Where there should have been hay \nand grass, there was not. And now, this fall, where there should have \nbeen cows, there aren't any because producers have had to sell their \nherds.\n\n  We have a practice in the Senate and the Congress of responding when \na disaster strikes an area of the country. All of us voted to support \nthe people in the gulf area who were impacted, just devastated by the \neffects of the hurricanes. We do not have hurricanes in the Midwest. We \nhave droughts. And it does not happen overnight. It is not a 24-hour \nnews cycle. It is not something that gets the same focus or attention. \nBut it has the same effect in terms of the way it affects people's \nlives.\n  If you look at droughts, you might describe them as slow-motion \ndisasters, but the economic impact on farmers, ranchers, small \nbusinesses, and rural communities is just as devastating. In the \naftermath of one of the worst drought conditions since the Great \nDepression, the people of the Midwest are looking for us in Washington \nto provide assistance.\n  I am in agreement with my colleagues who have argued we ought to be \nlooking at how we can, in farm bills, design programs that will \nanticipate these things so we do not have to continue to do it on an ad \nhoc basis. I, for one, hope in the next farm bill we will be writing \nnext year that we can insert provisions that would accomplish just \nthat. But the reality is, we have had year after year after year of \ndrought. We have written a bill that, as my colleague from North Dakota \nhas noted, addresses some of that problem, not on a level that has been \naddressed in previous years. The whole issue of crop insurance is \naddressed in here. I think that is a good idea. We ought to encourage \npeople to buy crop insurance. This does do that. It reduces the payment \nthat would be made available to those who do not buy crop insurance.\n  But the simple reality is, we need to do something to respond to what \nis a very devastating and real disaster for the people of South Dakota \nand other States in the Midwest whose futures are dramatically impacted \nby the drought we have experienced in this last year.\n  Agriculture is the backbone of our State's economy. That is true in a \nlot of the States in the Midwest. I would hope, before we leave this \nyear, we can get this issue addressed, whether that is in the form of \nemergency relief such as this that is fashioned today or, as my \ncolleague from Oklahoma has suggested, some sort of offset. Whether \nthat takes unanimous consent, I am for that. I am all for that.\n  But the simple fact is, we need to respond. We need to do it in a \ntimely way. I hope, before we leave today, we will be able to get an \naffirmative vote in support for farmers and ranchers and small \nbusinesspeople and citizens in the rural economy across this country \nwho have been devastated by one of the worst drought disasters \nliterally in the last century.\n  Mr. President, I understand my time has expired, so I yield back to \nthe Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, we have other \nMembers who have said they are coming, but if the Senator would like to \ntake an additional 2 minutes, I would be happy to grant it to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding additional \ntime because I do not think that oftentimes we give enough attention on \nthe floor to the effect this drought has had on the agricultural \neconomy or the conditions our farmers and ranchers are facing in many \nof the Midwestern States. And we need to have a good, robust debate \nabout the future of agriculture and how we anticipate, in the future \ndealing, with this type of disaster.\n  But, as I said before, it is important for us to respond in the same \nway we did when the gulf area was hit by the hurricanes, to make sure \npeople of this country understand that when disaster strikes, the \npeople in the Congress are hearing their voices and are willing to take \nthe necessary steps to provide assistance.\n  I also note, because it has been stated earlier today, the \nAgriculture Department does have a lot of unobligated funds on hand. \nOne of the reasons they do is the payments that are normally made under \nthe farm bill have not been made. So there are a lot of unobligated \nbalances there because countercyclical payments and loan deficiency \npayments have not been made.\n  I had suggested, in the previous iteration of this a few years back, \nthat we use those savings, those offsets, to apply them to disaster \nrelief. They say for scoring purposes that does not count. But the \nreality, again, is that when you look at the balances that are \navailable at USDA, they are in a position to respond. This is a $4.8 \nbillion, $4.9 billion disaster bill that applies, as the Senator from \nNorth Dakota noted, to 2 years, 2005 and 2006.\n  It seems to me at least that this is a minimum level of effort we \nought to make to respond to the disaster in the Midwest and provide \ndirect assistance to our farmers and our ranchers and our small \nbusinesses.\n  So, again, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to support the vote on \nthis when it comes up. I hope we can get a good, strong vote out of the \nSenate and ultimately act on the underlying bill, send it to the House, \nand get it on the President's desk, so we can get disaster assistance \nout there.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by \nSenator Conrad to provide agricultural disaster assistance. I would \nhave preferred that we had found a way to pay for this in the normal \nbudget. But the Conrad amendment is an appropriate response to the \nsevere drought and other weather-related disasters this year. Even in \nareas like western Wisconsin, which were significantly impacted but \nmissed the most brutal conditions, many farmers have been pushed to the \nbrink. Just as we did for the farmers devastated by hurricanes on the \ngulf coast, we should provide a helping hand to farms and rural \ncommunities that have been overwhelmed by this extreme weather.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment offered \nby the senior Senator from North Dakota, Kent Conrad, to H.R. 5384, the \nFiscal Year 2007 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \nAdministration, and Related Agencies Appropriations\n\n[[Page S11152]]\n\nAct. I am proud to have joined Senator Conrad, as well as the senior \nSenator from Hawaii, Dan Inouye, to provide much needed relief to \nagricultural communities across our nation in need of assistance.\n  This legislation is important to the agricultural industry in the \nState of Hawaii, in particular the County of Hawaii which was \nsignificantly impacted by the October 15, 2006, earthquake. I was in my \nhome State during this earthquake measuring 6.7 in magnitude and \npresent during aftershocks that were felt days after the initial \ntremor. A few hours after the earthquake occurred, I spoke with Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, FEMA, Director David Paulison to ensure \nthat FEMA was ready to support State and local response and recovery \nefforts in Hawaii. In addition, the day after the earthquake I toured \nthe Big Island with Senator Inouye, the National Guard, and State Civil \nDefense to assess the resulting damage.\n  While I am pleased that Federal, State, and local agencies have been \nable to work cooperatively to provide public and individual assistance, \nthe needs of our agricultural community must not be ignored. Irrigation \nsystems damaged by the earthquake are the sole source of water for a \nmajority of farmers and members of rural communities in this region. In \naddition to the economic impact, it is imperative that we recognize \nthat the livelihoods of these hard working individuals have drastically \nbeen impacted by the earthquake. It is for this reason I join my \ncolleagues in supporting this amendment which would provide $3 million \nto the Farm Service Agency, FSA, for its Emergency Conservation Program \nto repair broken irrigation pipelines and damaged and collapsed water \ntanks. Of this amount, $2 million will go toward repairing the damages \nto stone fences on cattle ranches in the Kona and Kohala areas, and \nanother $1 million is needed under the Emergency Loan Program to cover \nlosses of agricultural income. The amendment also provides $2 million \nto the Big Island Resource Conservation and Development Council to \nrepair of the Kohala Ditch system that was also severely damaged by the \nearthquake; and $10 million to the Natural Resources Conservation \nService, NRCS, Emergency Watershed Protection Program for the repair of \nthe Lower Hamakua Ditch and the Waimea Irrigation System/Upper Hamakua \nDitch--which were heavily damaged by the earthquake and are negatively \nimpacting the farming community on the Big Island.\n  I commend Senator Conrad for his dedication and commitment to our \nNation's farmers and ranchers. This amendment is necessary to ensure \nthat they may continue to provide U.S. agricultural products, and I ask \nmy colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to again speak in \nsupport of the Emergency Farm Relief Act--this time as an amendment to \nthe fiscal year 2007 Agriculture appropriations bill. I want to start \nby thanking my colleague Senator Conrad for all of his hard work and \nhis continued leadership in trying to get this relief to our farmers \nand ranchers.\n  Mr. President, this Congress has dragged its feet long enough. It is \nwell past time for us to provide this relief for our Nation's farmers \nand ranchers--many of whom have suffered through multiple years of \ndrought.\n  Now I know that some in this Congress and in the administration have \nquestioned the need for emergency farm relief. But I have to wonder \nwhether those individuals have seen the many fields in Nebraska that \nweren't even worth harvesting because the drought had killed off the \ncrop.\n  I wonder if they have talked to the farmers and ranchers who are \nbarely hanging on to their farms and ranches because of this multiyear \ndrought and Congress's failure to provide relief.\n  And, I wonder if they have even seen their own statistics. Last week \nUSDA released a report that stated that net farm income will have \ndropped by 20 percent this year in comparison to last year. This \nincluded a $4.7 billion drop in the value of livestock production.\n  Nebraska farmers and ranchers are estimated to have lost over $340 \nmillion just this production year due to the ongoing drought \nconditions. Nebraska farmers have also had to spend an extra $51 \nmillion in energy costs as their irrigation pumps ran longer than usual \nthis year because of drought conditions.\n  And the Drought Monitor at the University of Nebraska continues to \nshow that much of Nebraska is still suffering from severe to extreme \ndrought.\n  Yet even the Secretary of Agriculture continues to question the need \nfor disaster relief and this Congress stubbornly refuses to provide \nrelief to those farmers and ranchers that have been harmed by this \nparticular natural disaster.\n  And that, I think, is one of the most frustrating aspects about this \ndebate over emergency farm relief. Congress and the administration seem \nto have no problems providing relief for other natural disasters like \nhurricanes. In fact, earlier this year we provided billions of dollars \nfor Hurricane Katrina relief.\n  But even then, our attempt to provide emergency disaster relief to \nfarmers and ranchers was substantially reduced and those farmers and \nranchers unlucky enough to be hurt by drought were left behind and not \ngiven any relief.\n  I do not understand why this Congress is willing to help farmers \ndamaged by hurricanes and is at the same time unwilling to help farmers \nthat are damaged by other natural disasters such as drought. Both are \nnatural disasters and both cause widespread economic harm.\n  That is why for the last few years when I talk about the drought I \nalso talk about how I decided to nickname the drought ``Drought \nDavid.''\n  I gave it a name in the hope that it will help people realize that it \nis a natural disaster just like a hurricane even if it doesn't command \nthe same types of headlines and television coverage.\n  A drought, unlike a hurricane or a flood, is a slow-moving disaster \nthat can go over a course of years. In some cases Drought David is \ncelebrating its fifth birthday. In other places it's celebrating its \nseventh birthday.\n  By giving it some identity, I had hoped to attract the same kind of \nattention that very often is given to hurricanes, which are named. And \nI had hoped that with that attention, this Congress would provide \nrelief like it does for hurricanes.\n  Naming the drought was meant to help my colleagues focus on this \nbeing a natural disaster, with devastation of major economic \nproportions to large areas within our country and help them understand \nthat it can have the same impact in terms of economic loss that very \noften a hurricane will cause in its wake.\n  I cannot overemphasize to my colleagues that the losses suffered and \nthe losses we are asking relief for are those caused by a natural \ndisaster.\n  These losses are due to events beyond the control of our farmers and \nranchers. And that is why this Congress needs to provide relief, just \nas it does for losses caused by other natural disasters.\n  We cannot prevent drought. But Congress can help when a drought \ndevastates large portions of our country.\n  And I remind my colleagues that failure to provide this needed relief \nthreatens many small, rural businesses and communities and it threatens \nour nation's food and fuel security efforts.\n  This amendment will provide relief to farmers that have suffered \nproduction losses in 2005 and 2006 and it will also provide relief to \nlivestock producers that have suffered losses in both years. And I urge \nmy colleagues to support this relief.\n  I also want to remind my colleagues that this Congress can help in \nother ways, too. One of which is to provide farmers, ranchers and other \nagribusinesses with information for smart planning.\n  To that end, I also urge this Congress to take up and pass S. 2751, \nmy NIDIS legislation, that will create a National Integrated Drought \nInformation System.\n  The NIDIS bill will help create a drought ``early warning system'' \nthat will be capable of providing accurate and timely information on \ndrought conditions so State and local officials can plan for and \nmitigate the effects of drought.\n  An ``early warning system'' will give producers information they need \nto make planting and other decisions. They can use the information to \nlimit their risk, thus limit their losses.\n\n[[Page S11153]]\n\n  Unfortunately, due to the lack of a national drought policy, there \nhas been no development to date of a coordinated, integrated drought \nmonitoring and forecasting system.\n  With better research and better tools for planning and mitigation, we \ncould significantly reduce losses and ultimately the need for large \nemergency disaster aid packages.\n  It is important to keep in mind that for every $1 we invest in \nmitigation and preparedness, we can save $4 in reduced impacts when the \nnatural disaster occurs. And my NIDIS bill will invest $59 million over \nthe next 6 years to help with mitigation and preparedness.\n  But that is what we are working on to help with droughts in the \nfuture. Today we must focus on providing relief for the devastating \nimpacts that Drought David has caused the last two growing seasons.\n  Congress must do both: we must provide relief for the damages \nsuffered now and we must provide for better planning and mitigation for \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, this Congress cannot be excused for its failure to \nprovide this much-needed relief. I urge my colleagues to support our \nnation's farmers and ranchers by supporting this emergency farm relief \namendment.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to \ndiscuss a critically important issue to Washington's farmers and \nranchers--disaster assistance.\n  I support the agriculture disaster assistance legislation that is \nbefore us here on the floor and am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthe bill.\n  Washington's agriculture economy is supported by small and medium-\nsized family farms. Our farmers are a key economic engine for the \nstate, producing more than 300 different commodities on 15.3 million \nacres valued at over $6.4 billion every year. And in our state, \nagriculture alone supports more than 300,000 good paying jobs.\n  Washington's farm families understand hardship. They understand that \nwhen you are in the business of farming, you have good years and you \nhave bad years.\n  Recent years have been particularly hard for them. Many are \nstruggling just to make ends meet as they face low commodity prices, an \ninflux of commodities grown abroad, and high fuel and fertilizer prices \nstemming from the hurricane disasters of last year.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years, many producers have also had to cope \nwith crops lost to adverse weather. Over the last three crop years, \ninclement weather, wildfires, and flooding have exacerbated the already \ndifficult challenges farmers in my state face.\n  In 2004, 32 of Washington state's 39 counties received disaster \ndeclarations. In 2005, it was 13 counties.\n  So far this year, 24 counties in the State have received disaster \ndeclarations.\n  Once assessments have been completed on the damages sustained from \nrecent flooding throughout Puget Sound and across the Olympic \nPeninsula, I am confident even more counties will receive declarations.\n  This year many producers lost their crops or had their crops severely \ndamaged due to adverse weather. Others lost livestock or had herds \ndisplaced due to wildfires.\n  This summer, I visited with farmers in central Washington after the \nregion sustained significant crop losses from hail, wind, and rain in \nJune and July.\n  I saw firsthand the damage that many of Washington's apple, pear, and \ncherry orchards incurred. I saw the fruit that was no longer \nsalvageable. I saw the losses that these orchards sustained.\n  Individual orchards throughout much of the tree fruit-growing regions \nin north central Washington state--in counties like Chelan, Douglas and \nOkanogan--lost significant portions of their crop. Some farms were \ndecimated by the storms and lost their entire harvest.\n  These losses threaten the continued viability of many of these family \nfarms and orchards.\n  The losses also affect the rural communities and economies these \nfarms help support. Agriculture is the primary, and in some cases the \nonly, economic driver in many rural communities throughout Washington \nstate.\n  Packing houses, processors, dusters, shippers and other small \nbusinesses depend on the harvest almost as much as the producers \nthemselves. Many of these businesses had to lay off hundreds of workers \nthis year because there simply was no fruit to pick or pack.\n  The agriculture disaster legislation currently before the Senate \ncontains important provisions that will provide desperately needed \nrelief for our farmers and ranchers as they begin to recover during \nthis difficult time. It also contains economic assistance grants to \nhelp the small businesses that support our farming communities.\n  We must act now to provide assistance and ensure the continued \nviability of American farmers and farm families who lost their crop to \ndisaster. Without it, many will not survive.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me today in making a commitment to help \nour farm families and the communities in which they live by providing \nthem the assistance they desperately need.\n  Voting for the Conrad amendment is to vote for funding that will come \nto your state and help your farmers stay viable. I urge my colleagues \nto support the Conrad amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, is the Senator from Louisiana seeking \ntime? Not on this matter?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Minnesota, does he \nseek time?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am advised I only have 13 minutes. The Senator from \nMontana is here as well. Would the Senator from Montana like time as \nwell?\n  Mr. BURNS. No, thank you. I appreciate the Senator asking.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask the Senator from Minnesota, how much time would you \nlike?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Six minutes, probably less.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am glad to yield the Senator from \nMinnesota 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota \nfor his leadership on agricultural disaster assistance.\n  I wish to let this body know what assistance means to Minnesota's \nfarmers by reading a few excerpts from letters I have received from \nproducers in my State. I have been on the floor a number of times about \nthis issue. We need to get it done.\n  One man starts out saying, ``I am a struggling young family farmer in \nNorthwest Minnesota,'' and registers his plea:\n\n       We were counting on some help this summer to cash flow for \n     the year after last year's devastating floods. We are now \n     attempting to work with our banker to increase our operating \n     credit limit, refinance our machinery, or refinance our land, \n     just to make ends meet till we can harvest our crop. Please \n     do not give up on this issue.\n\n  This urgency is repeated again and again in the letters I receive and \nconversations I have. Another Minnesota farmer writes there is an \n``urgent need for ag disaster assistance for our family farmers \ndevastated by weather disasters in 2005 and 2006. My family has farmed \nin Minnesota since 1882 and we need ag disaster assistance now. Please, \nplease help us.''\n  These are heartbreaking stories. These are real emergencies for our \nfarmers. These folks need our help or they will be put out of business, \nplain and simple.\n  And the need for agricultural disaster assistance is great. \nMinnesota's farmers have had to fend for themselves in the face of real \nnatural disaster--first, against record flooding in 2005 and now \nagainst record drought in 2006.\n  In the sugar sector alone, revenue was reduced by $60 million in \nMinnesota in 2005, thanks to this natural\n\n[[Page S11154]]\n\ndisaster. In one county, crop loss exceeded $52 million and farmers \nwere prevented from planting over 90,000 acres thanks to saturated \nfields. Now, thanks to one of the worst droughts ever experienced in \nthe Great Plains, Minnesota farmers have experienced hundreds of \nmillions of dollars of crop loss in 2006.\n  But it is not just about statistics. It is about farmers enduring \npersonal struggles whom I have met all over the State. It is about \nfarmers calling my office, desperate to save the family farm. Farmers \nare losing their operations, pure and simple. The producers who will \nnot be coming back to the fields next year thanks to catastrophic \nweather are not just losing a business, many are losing a family \ntradition. We are losing a way of life. We are losing some of the heart \nand soul of America and of Minnesota.\n  I am concerned about the comments of some of my colleagues. My \ncolleague and friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, indicated that \nthe separate disaster assistance for sugar beets is akin to earmarks. I \nwant to state that is not the case. It is not about porkbarrel \nspending. I think what some folks fail to recognize is that due to the \nnature of the sugar program, they don't get direct payments. It cannot \nbe structured in the same way as other production loss assistance for \nother crops.\n  If you look at what has been laid out, we have been trying to be very \nfocused and very clear. This is not about excess. This is about keeping \nfamilies alive. This is about keeping farming alive. Some of the \nfamilies have farmed for almost 100 years. With all due respect, these \nfaulty characterizations do not do our farmers justice.\n  Another farmer in my State gets at the crux of this amendment when he \nwrites:\n\n       Maybe the farmers in this area should have applied to FEMA \n     for hurricane relief--it seems that hard working people in my \n     community are looking to their government for help and \n     getting ignored.\n\n  It is not that this Congress has refused to pass agricultural \ndisaster assistance. We have provided $1.6 billion in emergency \nagricultural assistance. Of course, none of the farmers in Minnesota \nwill benefit from this assistance because they do not own a farm in one \nof the Gulf States. Congress has not provided a dime for farmers \nsuffering from natural disasters outside of the gulf region.\n\n  I have stood on this floor supporting our farmers in the Gulf States. \nI support us doing what we need to do to lift them up. I think it would \nshock many Americans to learn that natural devastation must come in the \nright package to be worthy of Federal aid. The message being sent is \nthat record flooding and drought do not count. That is not a good \nmessage.\n  Again, I have traveled to the Gulf States. I have seen the hurricane \ndamage firsthand. And you should see the devastation here. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota has done a good job of making it real. Seeing it. And \nit is real. We cannot put one region against the next. This is about \nAmerica doing the right thing. That is what we should be doing on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  The core of this issue is about equity and fairness for all regions \nthat are suffering. And to the thousands of Minnesotans whose very \nlivelihoods have been jeopardized, and those losing their farms due to \nlast year's disastrous weather, withholding assistance is nothing short \nof cruel. We can do better. We should do better. I urge my colleagues \nto support this assistance package.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5151\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues' indulgence to speak \non another very important topic, another amendment filed under this \nbill. And the topic is sky-high prescription drug prices and the \nability to temper those prices, to bring them down, to some significant \nextent, through what is called reimportation, allowing all American \nconsumers a fair, safe opportunity to buy prescription drugs from \nCanada or other countries.\n  I filed this amendment, amendment No. 5151, on this Agriculture \nappropriations bill with my colleague from Florida, Senator Nelson. I \nthank him for all of his work and support on this amendment and on this \nissue.\n  This follows up on work earlier this year, when we successfully \npassed an amendment on the Homeland Security appropriations bill. That \nwas a breakthrough vote, particularly on the floor of the Senate, to \nallow Americans greater access to those safe prescription drugs from \nCanada at much more reasonable prices.\n  Our amendment on the Agriculture appropriations bill would go a \nlittle further still and expand those opportunities for Americans to \nbuy safe, yet affordable, prescription drugs through reimportation from \nCanada.\n  First, let me step back and speak about the need for this in general \nbecause there is a significant need. At a time when pharmaceutical \ncompanies are making record profits, the cost of prescription drugs--\nmany of which are necessary to keep seniors and other Americans healthy \nor sometimes, in fact, alive--is skyrocketing. And these are the very \nsame medicines that are sold at a fraction of the U.S. cost a few miles \nnorth of our border in Canada.\n  With all that going on--again, in the context of sky-high, record \npharmaceutical company profits--Americans are deeply skeptical. I am \nhere to say that Americans should be.\n  Opposing the right of an American to buy a small amount of \nprescription drugs--approved medication they intend to use for \nthemselves--does not make sense to the average American. Yet that is \nstill, to a large extent, our policy.\n  Many of my colleagues have spoken passionately on this floor, the \nfloor of the Senate, about their own neighbors' stories, about how \nfolks in their States have had to go to cheaper markets, such as \nCanada, to afford their prescriptions.\n  In September, my colleague from Michigan spoke of her bus trips with \nher constituents up to Canada to get these more affordable \nmedicines. She traveled there by bus with her constituents, and they \nwere able to get safe, FDA-approved drugs at a fraction of the cost in \nthe United States. She told us about her constituents who were able to \nbuy the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor for about 40 percent less \nthan the U.S. price, the ulcer medication Prevacid at 50 percent less, \nand antidepressants such as Zyprexa at 70 percent less.\n\n  In June, another colleague from North Dakota spoke eloquently of the \nneed to allow reimportation of safe drugs as a way to pressure U.S. \npharmaceutical companies that manufacture these very same drugs--our \ncompanies are the source of the same drugs--to lower prices in the \nUnited States.\n  I have spoken over and over again about my neighbors in Louisiana, \ntheir struggles, in many cases, to afford these lifesaving and life-\nsustaining drugs, being torn by various needs--to pay the rent, the \nfood bill, the gasoline bill, energy costs--and yet have to pay sky-\nhigh pharmaceutical costs. Clearly, one part of the solution is \nreimportation, allowing all Americans to buy safe prescription drugs \nfrom other countries such as Canada.\n  As I said, I am proud to be joined by Senator Nelson of Florida on \nthis amendment. He joined me several months ago on a similar amendment \nwhich we offered to the Homeland Security appropriations bill. It \npassed overwhelmingly with 72 votes, a strong consensus show of support \non the Senate floor. That amendment was very simple. It said: We are no \nlonger going to let the border security bureaucracy of the Federal \nGovernment use taxpayer money to take away those cheaper prescription \ndrugs many Americans go into Canada to buy and bring back to their \nhomes. We are going to let those Americans do that because that is fair \nand right. We were only talking about Canada. We were only talking \nabout taking them back across the border in quantities that are for \ntheir personal use, not to go into business to be a middleman selling \ndrugs to other consumers but for their personal use. That amendment not \nonly passed by a strong vote in the Senate, but it remained in the bill \nthrough the entire process.\n  After a lot of fighting, a lot of discussion and argument and work on \nthis crucial issue, we were able to retain an important version of that \namendment in the final version of the Homeland\n\n[[Page S11155]]\n\nSecurity appropriations bill. President Bush signed it into law. Now we \nhave made that important change that says Americans can go into Canada, \nbuy those safe, cheaper prescription drugs for their personal use and \nbring them back without border security agents taking them away, \nconfiscating them, and having them out the cost, trouble, and time of \ntheir trip.\n  Today Senator Nelson and I offer amendment No. 5151 to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill. Of course, that bill covers the FDA as \nwell. This amendment builds upon our earlier work and our earlier \nsuccess and applies that same policy to the Food and Drug \nAdministration, which is another enforcement arm of the Government on \nthis topic. Again, it is simple. We are simply saying: Our taxpayer \ndollars should not be used to confiscate those prescription drugs \nbought by Americans in Canada. Just as it should not be used to \nconfiscate them at the border as Americans cross back across the border \nto their home country, so, too, that bureaucracy, those taxpayer \ndollars, should not be used to confiscate drugs when they come from \nmail order or Internet sales. That is exactly what our amendment is \nabout--Canada only, personal use only, a thoroughly reasonable, \nstraightforward provision to honor the American people and give them \nthis limited yet reasonable and important mechanism to get cheaper \nprescription drugs from elsewhere.\n  I am very hopeful that either this week or in the near future this \nsort of provision will pass, particularly given the strong vote we had \non the earlier Vitter-Nelson amendment. I am also hopeful that in the \nnext Congress we will be able to pass a full-blown reimportation bill \nto allow broad-based reimportation of safe, cheaper prescription drugs \ninto this country. That is needed by Americans, particularly seniors, \nacross the land. It is a fair and reasonable approach. It is not a \nmagic wand, not a silver bullet. It won't solve the challenge of very \nhigh prescription drug prices overnight or alone. But it can and will \nbe an important and significant part of the solution.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Nelson of Florida \nand many others on this vitally important effort. I look forward to our \nwork on this amendment to the Agriculture appropriations bill. I look \nforward to our following up on the success we had with our amendment to \nthe Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n  Most of all, I look forward to passing a broad-based reimportation \nbill early in the next Congress to give Americans what they deserve--\nthe opportunity, the freedom to buy safe, cheaper prescription drugs \nfrom other sources, Canada, other countries, including by mail order \nand the Internet. This will give Americans access to cheaper drugs. \nPerhaps even more importantly, it will break down that system that \nallows pharmaceutical companies to charge dramatically different prices \nin other countries versus ours. Of course, we pay the highest prices by \nfar.\n  I look forward to that continuing work. I look forward to those \nvictories, because the American people are waiting for it, counting it, \ndepending on it. We can do this with major safety provisions built in \nto make sure these drugs are safe and reliable, as advertised.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, may we have a report on how much time \nremains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 4\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from New Hampshire has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to advise me after I have \nused 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are about to have a consequential vote. \nThe question before the body is whether the Senate believes disaster \nassistance ought to be provided to this Nation's farmers and ranchers--\nwhat is now reported to be the third worst drought in the Nation's \nhistory. Right down the center of America, we have had a blistering \ndrought. The results: farm fields that look like moonscapes and \neconomic losses that are stunning and ruinous.\n  In other disasters, Congress has responded, especially disasters that \nhave gotten more attention. Perhaps because this disaster is right in \nthe heart of America, where most of the national news media is not \nheadquartered, this disaster has not gotten the attention so many other \ndisasters have.\n  Make no mistake, this disaster is no less devastating. People's \neconomic lives are on the line. We understand full well that this will \nnot be decided today because our friends on the other side, who are in \nthe majority still, have determined not to finish work on the pending \nappropriations bills. They are leaving that to next year. So this work \nwill not be complete. But this vote remains important because it will \nsignal to the Nation's farmers and ranchers whether there is hope that \nhelp is on the way. If there is no hope and there is no help, we are \ngoing to see literally tens of thousands of farm and ranch families \nforced off the land. That is clear.\n  This is a fiscally responsible package. Some have said it is a budget \nbuster. They know, as all of us in this Chamber know, there is no \nbudget for natural disasters--none. That is because it is hard to \npredict what natural disasters will occur. So every natural disaster \nmust be dealt with on an emergency basis. That is why it requires a \nsupermajority vote. That is the question that is before the body this \nafternoon.\n  This bill costs $4.8 billion for relief for 2005 and 2006. It is a \nfraction of what disaster relief was for the years 2000 and 2001. That \ndisaster package was $25 billion. This is less than one-fifth that \namount.\n  In answer to the question some colleagues have raised, there are \npayment limitations--an $80,000 payment limitation. There is a gross-\nincome test. On the question of those who grow the grains we consume as \na nation, let me just say, you have to have at least a 35-percent loss \nbefore you get anything. Nobody with no loss gets a dime under this \nproposal.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to waive the budget point of order so we \ncan send a signal to the Nation's farmers and ranchers that help is on \nthe way.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum and ask that the time be equally charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the order is for the vote to occur at 5 \no'clock; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given an \nadditional 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me just point out that 32 major farm \norganizations have asked this body to support my amendment and also to \nsupport a budget waiver, if it is raised, against the amendment. That \nhas already been done. So that will be the key vote. What is essential \nis that we get 60 votes, or close to it, so that farmers know there is \na possibility of disaster assistance. There are 32 national \norganizations, including the National Farmers Union, American Farm \nBureau, Farm Credit Council, the Sugarbeet Growers, Soybean \nAssociation, and the American Corn Growers Association. It also has the \nNational Association of State Departments of Agriculture. The \ncommissioners of agriculture from all 50 States have come forward and \nsaid: Please pass this legislation. It also includes the Barley \nGrowers, the Farmer Cooperatives, National Farmers Organization, Milk \nProducers, the Sunflower Association, the\n\n[[Page S11156]]\n\nRice Belt Warehousers, the Fertilizer Institute, U.S. Dried Peas and \nLentils Council, U.S. Beet Sugar Association, U.S. Canola Association, \nand Women Involved in Farm Economics. They all say unanimously that \nthis legislation is important and it is important now.\n  To those colleagues or their staffs who are watching the final \nminutes of this debate and discussion who are wondering, Gee, does this \ndo what the critics say; does it unjustly enrich someone; let me say \nthat the answer to that is an emphatic no. This example I have prepared \nshows, in North Dakota, what a farmer would get in a typical year on an \nacre of wheat, which is $157. With a 50-percent loss, he gets $78.60 \nfrom the market, $27 in insurance premium, and $7 for this amendment, \nfor a total of $113. He would still be left with a 28-percent loss. For \na farmer who has a 75-percent loss of his crop, he would get $39 from \nthe market, $54 in insurance premium, $19.50 from this amendment, for a \ntotal of $113, leaving him or her with a loss of 28 percent as well. \nPeople are not being unjustly enriched and they are not being made \nwhole. We are simply offsetting some of the dramatic losses people have \nreceived as a result of natural disaster--the third worst drought in \nour Nation's history.\n  I don't know how much more clear I can be. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment. In our part of the country, we have supported \nevery region when they have had disasters. We were the first to sign up \nafter Katrina for aid to them and the Gulf Coast States. We recognized \ntheir loss. We were among the first to sign up to help Florida in the \nterrible losses it has suffered. We were among the first to sign up \nwhen California experienced terrible losses as a result of natural \ndisasters, whether it was wildfires, mud slides, or any of the rest. We \nhave had a disaster in our part of the country now. We are asking our \ncolleagues to help us. We will remember those who helped, just as we \nhave helped others in their time of need.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 4 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand we are, by a previous order, \nto vote at 5 o'clock. There appears to be 4 minutes remaining. I ask \nunanimous consent to speak during that time if no one else is present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I only wanted to follow Senator Conrad and \npoint out that this amendment is truly bipartisan. Those who have \nwatched this debate will recognize we have had Republicans and \nDemocrats come to the floor of the Senate to say this is an important \namendment. They support it, and they hope the Senate will pass it.\n  I want to point out again that this is the third time we have brought \nthis to the floor of the Senate. On two other occasions, it passed the \nSenate and had gone to conference. On both of those occasions, it was \nblocked in conference with the U.S. House. It was blocked by the House \nconferees. I believe on both occasions I asked for a vote of the Senate \nconferees, and the Senate conferees insisted on their position. So it \nis not a weak will here with respect to disaster assistance for farmers \nthat exists. It is a very strong will, and the Senate has expressed \nitself previously on two occasions.\n  On the third occasion in the Appropriations Committee, we had a \nunanimous vote--by unanimous consent in the Appropriations Committee--\nto add the disaster legislation earlier this year. That bill has not \npreviously come to the floor but not because we have not tried. We have \npushed and pushed to get that bill to the floor of the Senate. Only \nnow, in what is the last week of the session, have we managed to get \nthe bill on the floor and, by consent, offer an amendment.\n  So I think it is important to understand that we have been trying for \na long while to get this amendment fully debated, get it through the \nSenate and back to conference with the House.\n  It appears now that, whatever may happen on the floor this afternoon, \nthis is likely to be a part of an omnibus appropriations bill at some \npoint in late January or, likely, mid-February. Time is very short. \nSomeone used the word ``patience'' earlier today. Boy, we have had a \nlot of patience in dealing with this issue. There is broad, bipartisan \nsupport for it--or there has been at least. We have been waiting and \nwaiting, and it has been blocked in the Senate from bringing this to \nthe floor. Finally we are here today.\n  This is not an idle matter for a lot of American families. For many \nfarm families, the decision will be a decision about whether they will \nbe able to continue living on and working on their family farms. For \nthose who don't know about them, those who never lived on a farm and \ndon't know what they do on a family farm, don't understand the risks \nthat are taken on a family farm, there are ways they should avail \nthemselves to find out. It is an important part of this country.\n  The network of farm families that are spread across the prairies and \nlands of this country and produces the foodstuffs, raises cattle, \nplants and harvests crops, takes all the risks, is an unbelievable \ngroup of Americans, and in many ways they are America's all-stars, the \nentrepreneurs who risk everything virtually every year. When real \ntrouble comes--a natural disaster--the best instinct of this Chamber \nhas always been to say to them: We want to help you. That is all we are \nsaying with this amendment. We want to help family farmers have a \nchance to continue to stay on the lands. My hope is we will give broad, \nbipartisan support for this legislation today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 5 p.m. having arrived, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act point of \norder with respect to amendment No. 5205. The yeas and nays have been \npreviously ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. \nChambliss), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), and the \nSenator from Utah (Mr. Hatch).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) and \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nDelaware (Mr. Biden) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 57, nays 37, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 271 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--57\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--37\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chafee\n     Coburn\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Frist\n     Gregg\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Pryor\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Sununu\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--6\n\n     Biden\n     Brownback\n     Chambliss\n     Dodd\n     Graham\n     Hatch\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 57, the nays are \n37. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained. The emergency designation is removed.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S11157]]\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I raise a point against the pending amendment because it \nwould cause the subcommittee to exceed its allocation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfalls.\n\n\n                      FUNDING FOR SPINACH GROWERS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank \nSenator Kohl for his stewardship of the Agriculture appropriations \nbill. His work on this bill will provide funding to support our \nNation's farmers and consumers, and I support those efforts \nwholeheartedly.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, and I \nwould like to take a moment to engage our colleague from Wisconsin in a \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank my colleague for her kind words and would be happy \nto engage in a colloquy with the Senators from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. A few months ago, nearly every grocery store in the \ncountry was advised not to sell fresh spinach due to confirmed \nincidents of E. coli bacteria coming out of California. The impact of \nthis outbreak was devastating: it sickened nearly 200 people, killing \n3. It also resulted in more than $70 million in economic losses to \nspinach growers.\n  As you know, one of the many responsibilities of the FDA is to \noversee the safety of fruits and vegetables. In my State, where more \nthan half of all fresh fruits and vegetables are grown, this is clearly \nan enormous task and one that requires advanced scientific methods for \ndetection and response.\n  Unfortunately, the FDA does not have that kind of presence in the \nWestern United States to conduct and carry out the necessary scientific \ntesting and outreach that we should expect. There are currently three \nFDA food safety research centers in the Nation: one in Maryland, one in \nIllinois, and one in Mississippi. None of these centers is connected \nwith the vital and dominant food systems in California, which greatly \nimpairs the FDA's effectiveness in addressing the food safety and \nsecurity research, teaching, and outreach needs in the Western United \nStates.\n  Last year we provided funding to establish an FDA Western Center for \nFood Safety to serve the vast agricultural food safety needs of the \nWestern United States. This center would be collocated with the Western \nCenter for Food Safety and Security at the University of California at \nDavis, a place where the FDA would benefit from the synergy of working \nin an academic research environment with university scientists and with \nuniversity extension specialists who already have the critical \nrelationships with farmers that the FDA needs to be effective. \nUnfortunately, this funding was not agreed to by the House conferees.\n  The University of California at Davis already has a facility for the \nFDA scientists to move in to. This year I am once again seeking your \nassistance for a modest appropriation to begin the development of this \nFDA presence to serve the food safety needs of the vast agricultural \nregions in the Western United States and the consumers across the \ncountry who depend on a safe and reliable food supply.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, first I would like to thank the chairman \nof the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Kohl, for \nworking with Senator Feinstein and me on these important food safety \nprojects.\n  As Senator Feinstein has already explained, a recent E. coli outbreak \nin spinach produced in California has reminded us of the critical \nimportance of food safety and public health scientific research. We \nhope that with a renewed focus on providing food safety scientists with \nthe proper tools, we can learn more about how to control the impact of \nfuture E. coli outbreaks and protect the Nation's food supply from all \nfood-borne illnesses.\n  To accomplish this goal, the Agricultural Research Service, ARS, is \nready to begin work on a leafy green food safety research program that \nwill help inform the choices producers and regulators make to secure \nthe safety of the leafy vegetable food supply. With the necessary \nfunding that we hope can be provided in conference for these important \ngoals, ARS will complete the ongoing process of expanding its small \nexisting vegetable food safety program and produce applied science that \nthe Nation's growers can use to help keep their products safe.\n  After all of the work done in recent years to get Americans to eat \nmore fruits and vegetables, taking no action to prevent food safety \nscares like the recent E. coli outbreak in spinach will threaten to \ndepress consumption and reverse progress made to encourage healthy \neating choices. With a renewed focus on food safety science, we can \ncreate an atmosphere for increased consumer confidence and at the same \ntime strengthen public health protections.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate the remarks of the Senators from California \nand assure them that I will work to address these items.\n\n\n                         VHS Testing Facilities\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, as you know, the Animal Plant and \nHealth Inspection Service, APHIS, issued an emergency order on October \n24, 2006 which prohibited the importation of 37 species of live fish \nfrom two Canadian provinces and the interstate movement within the \neight Great Lakes States. APHIS issued this order with the intention of \nstopping the spread of viral hemorrhagic septicemia, VHS, within the \nGreat Lakes States which has been linked to fish kills. On November 14, \n2006 APHIS modified their emergency order to allow the interstate \nmovement of live fish within and from the Great Lakes States provided \nthe fish have tested negative to VHS. I appreciate the concerns APHIS \nhas about the spread of this virus and their concern about protecting \nthe Great Lakes from this virus. I share the goal in restoring and \nprotecting our Great Lakes. I too am deeply concerned about the \nnegative effects associated with the spread of this virus within the \nGreat Lakes and its potential impact on our fishing and aquaculture \nindustry. It is very important that we take responsible steps forward \nin limiting the spread of this virus which could impact the region. The \ncommercial and sport fishing industry in the Great Lakes is a $4 \nbillion industry and is a source of pride in our region.\n  I am concerned, however, that this emergency order does not \nadequately take into consideration the economic concerns of the region. \nThe Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the aquaculture industry \nin the region have all expressed that this order will adversely affect \nbusinesses and the State's ability to stock Lake Erie. The Ohio \nDepartment of Agriculture has indicated to me they are not equipped to \ntest for this disease at this time and that the cost could be \napproximately $200,000 to update their labs to meet the demands of the \nAPHIS order. It is critical that we be able to provide the Great Lakes \nStates the ability to begin testing in order to comply with the APHIS \norder in a timely manner. Funding will be needed to meet these demands. \nWithout this assistance, the aquaculture industry will suffer. Because \nI believe this issue can be resolved in conference, I have introduced, \nbut will not offer, an amendment to provide funding for the Great Lakes \nStates to help them set up facilities to test fish for VHS. The \nchairman and ranking member are aware of this important issue and share \nmy concerns about the problem facing the Great Lakes States today. It \nis my hope that we can work together during conference negotiations on \nthe FY2007 Agriculture Appropriations bill to find relief for the Great \nLakes States in this matter.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Senator Voinovich has stated, the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's Animal Plant Health Inspection Service emergency Federal \norder banning the interstate shipment of several species of fish is \nhaving a crippling effect on Ohio's aquaculture industry. While my \ncolleague and I recognize APHIS' attempt to stop the spread of a \ndamaging disease and their readiness to make amendments to the \nemergency order, many Great Lakes States, such as Ohio, lack sufficient \ntesting programs and facilities to fully comply with the new testing \nregulation.\n  It is appropriate to make our Senate colleagues aware of this issue \nduring FY2007 Agriculture appropriations debate, as resources are \nneeded to assist State and Federal agencies to establish additional \ntesting facilities, monitor the spread of VHS throughout the region, \nand conduct research on the disease. At this time, it is difficult to\n\n[[Page S11158]]\n\nfully quantify the financial needs of the entire Great Lakes region in \nlight of these new amendments. The aquaculture industry operates on a \nshort time-frame, and our aquaculture producers and sportsmen need \nassistance, or their livelihoods will be in jeopardy. Mr. President, \nSenator Voinovich and I are committed to working with APHIS officials \nand State departments of agriculture and departments of natural \nresources to provide them with resources to resume commerce responsibly \nand combat this disease. We are hopeful that FY2007 Agriculture \nappropriations conference negotiations will provide an opportunity to \nallocate much-needed funding to Ohio and other Great Lakes States.\n  Mr. KOHL. As ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee and a member of the Great Lakes Task Force, I share in my \ncolleagues' efforts to restore and protect the Great Lakes. I am aware \nof the risks associated with the spread of this virus within the Great \nLakes and understand the need to limit its spread. It is my hope that \nwe can help the Great Lakes states address this challenge and enhance \ntheir ability to ensure the safe movement of live fish within the \nregion. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this issue.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I recognize the concerns the distinguished Senators from \nOhio have about protecting the Great Lakes and their efforts to balance \nthe environmental and economic needs of the region. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on this Issue.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the chairman and ranking member and look \nforward to working on this effort during conference negotiations.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate the chairman's attention and collaboration \non this issue.\n\n\n                Delaware Agricultural Museum and Village\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss \nwith my friends, the Senators from Utah and Wisconsin, an important \nproposal that will enhance Delaware's economy by promoting agri-tourism \nand our agricultural heritage.\n  As we all know, Senator Bennett, the chairman, and Senator Kohl, the \nranking member, of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee have the \ndifficult job of managing funding priorities for the Nation's \nagriculture spending and do a superb job in that role.\n  I bring to my colleagues' attention an important proposal that merits \nserious consideration--the Delaware Agricultural Museum and Village, \nwhich interprets and preserves the story of Delaware's past and \npromotes an understanding of the vital role agriculture plays in our \ndaily lives.\n  This is a vital cultural resource center that presents the history \nand function of American agriculture. It is very important that the \nAmerican people, and especially our youth, understand the source of \ntheir food supply. This is especially so in view of such critical \nissues as childhood obesity, food safety, and the continuing loss of \nfarmland to development.\n  Each year the Delaware Agricultural Village hosts thousands of school \nchildren and tens of thousands of tourists. These visitors experience \n19th century farming life and witness the evolution of American \nagriculture. The school children of Delmarva benefit from the summer \ncamps, field trips, and educational programs provided by this facility. \nThese activities help our children understand and appreciate the joys \nand struggles of farming life in the past as well as today. This \ninstitution is a great demonstration of the valuable role that farming \ningenuity and technological innovation play in dairy, poultry farming, \nand rural life in Delaware and across the country.\n  Every year 25,000 people visit this center, and between 6,000 and \n9,000 school children participate annually in field trips, summer \ncamps, and other activities. The village serves all of the Delmarva \nPeninsula and receives visitors from across the Nation. Last week, the \ncenter hosted a school from as far away as Texas.\n  Specifically, the funds requested will be combined with additional \nfunds from private individuals, businesses, and other government \nsources to ensure the Delaware Agricultural Museum and Village will be \nable to better serve their agri-tourism and educational guests. Every \nyear it seems the facility is asked to do more and more. These \nadditional funds will help provide additional space and more \naccommodating facilities while avoiding construction of an entirely new \nbuilding.\n  I and the rest of the Delaware congressional delegation are very \nsupportive of this program and seek the support of the bill managers in \nasking the Department of Agriculture to consider and assist this \nproject with resources available in the Rural Development mission area. \nWe also request that the managers help support this item in the \nconference committee on the Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  So, with this background, I ask my friends from Utah and Wisconsin \nwhether it is correct that the Delaware Agricultural Museum and Village \nwill be considered in the conference between the House and Senate on \nthis bill?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, The Senator from Delaware has obviously \nmade a very strong case for this important educational resource center \nin Delaware, and it is apparent that the Delaware Agricultural Museum \nand Village provides an important contribution to Delaware's economy \nand its agri-tourism and agriculture industry. I yield to my \ndistinguished colleague, the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. I agree with my colleague, the chairman of our \nsubcommittee. This project appears to be a well-established enterprise \nworthy of consideration for rural development program assistance, so we \nthank the Senator for his work in this regard.\n  Mr. BENNETT. In response to the Senator's question concerning this \nproposal, I am confident that this request will receive very careful \nconsideration by the Senate conferees.\n  Mr. KOHL. I concur with the distinguished subcommittee chairman.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank my friends for taking a moment to discuss this \nmatter with me. I urge my colleagues who will be negotiating these \nprovisions with the House to carefully consider the benefits of this \nproposal. I thank them in advance for any assistance they may render.\n\n\n                               penicillin\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue that \nI believe needs attention during debates on the Agriculture \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2007. Antimicrobial drugs that are \nused to treat human diseases are being used at an alarming rate in \nlarge-scale animal production. There is growing evidence of an \nincreased human health risk as a result, specifically the development \nof antibiotic resistance.\n  Penicillin is a very important antimicrobial drug. It is an essential \ntreatment for serious human diseases and infections, such as \nMeningococcal meningitis and strep throat. Since its discovery in 1928, \nit has been estimated that penicillin has saved nearly 200 million \nlives. Overuse of this drug in agriculture could cause humans to build \nup resistance to penicillin, limiting our treatment options during \nhealth outbreaks.\n  According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, livestock producers \nin the United States use an estimated 24.6 million pounds of \nantimicrobials on healthy animals every year. Furthermore, the overall \nuse of antimicrobials for nontherapeutic purposes has risen by nearly \n50 percent since 1985.\n  The World Health Organization outlined recommendations for healthy \nlivestock production without the use of antimicrobials in the report \n``Overcoming Antimicrobial Resistance'' in 2000. The report illustrated \nthose farmers who stopped ``relying on antimicrobials as growth \npromoters in livestock have experienced no economic repercussions--\nprovided that animals were given enough space, clean water, and high-\ngrade feed.'' These living conditions are also crucial in avoiding the \nspread of diseases.\n  I was pleased that in July 2000, the Food and Drug Administration, \nFDA, announced its intention to ban the use of fluoroquinolone for \npoultry production due to increasing evidence of antibiotic resistant \nCampylobacter cultures. Campylobacter infects over 2 million people \neach year, particularly babies under 1 year old and young adults, and \nit is a leading cause of diarrhea and food-borne illness.\n\n[[Page S11159]]\n\n  In 1999, more than 11,000 people infected with Campylobacter were \nreceiving less effective or ineffective treatment with \nfluoroquinolones, up from 5,000 people just one year before. Scientist \nlater discovered the fluoroquinolone-resistant strand of Campylobacter \nfound in humans was the same as those found in animals. Concerns over \nthe emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria led the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC, to oppose approval of \nfluoroquinolones for animal use.\n  The fact is diseases that were once easily treated and cured by \nantimicrobial drugs are becoming more difficult to treat. Resistance to \nthese drugs has been linked to the overuse of these drugs in animal \ntreatment. The Food and Drug Administration, FDA, has recently \nexpressed concerns regarding the overuse of penicillin in the feeds of \nthe animals humans consume. In a May 2004 a statement to manufacturers \nof veterinary penicillin, the FDA stated that their products could play \na role in building up human resistance to this drug, as penicillin is \noften used in animals to induce animal growth and prevent diseases.\n  I share in the FDA's concern regarding growing resistance to \nantibiotics like penicillin, and I believe that we should not use these \ndrugs in animal feed without fully understanding the impact on human \nhealth. I believe it is important for the Center for Veterinary \nMedicine to conduct more research on the effects of penicillin in \nanimal feeds, and encourage funding to be added for this purpose. Doing \nso would shed much needed light on how widespread use of these drugs in \nfeed can affect treating human infections.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator for her attention to this issue. I \nappreciate all of the important facts she has raised, and look forward \nto working with her.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I have an amendment to offer to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007. My amendment \ncalls for the Center for Veterinary Medicine to study the effects that \ncertain uses of penicillin in animal feeds have on the human immune \nsystem.\n  Antimicrobial drugs that are used to treat human diseases are being \nused at an alarming rate in large-scale animal production. There is \ngrowing evidence of an increased human health risk as a result, \nspecifically the development of antibiotic resistance.\n  Penicillin is a very important antimicrobial drug. It is an essential \ntreatment for serious human diseases and infections, such as \nmeningococcal meningitis and strep throat. Since its discovery in 1928, \nit has been estimated that penicillin has saved nearly 200 million \nlives. Overuse of this drug in agriculture could cause humans to build \nup resistance to penicillin, limiting our treatment options during \nhealth outbreaks.\n  According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, livestock producers \nin the United States use an estimated 24.6 million pounds of \nantimicrobials on healthy animals every year. Furthermore, the overall \nuse of antimicrobials for nontherapeutic purposes has risen by nearly \n50 percent since 1985.\n  The World Health Organization outlined recommendations for healthy \nlivestock production without the use of antimicrobials in the report \n``Overcoming Antimicrobial Resistance'' in 2000. The report illustrated \nthose farmers who stopped ``relying on antimicrobials as growth \npromoters in livestock have experienced no economic repercussions--\nprovided that animals were given enough space, clean water, and high-\ngrade feed.'' These living conditions are also crucial in avoiding the \nspread of diseases.\n  I was pleased that in July 2000, the Food and Drug Administration, \nFDA, announced its intention to ban the use of fluoroquinolone for \npoultry production due to increasing evidence of antibiotic resistant \nCampylobacter cultures. Campylobacter infects over 2 million people \neach year, particularly babies under 1 year old and young adults, and \nit is a leading cause of diarrhea and food-borne illness.\n  In 1999, more than 11,000 people infected with Campylobacter were \nreceiving less effective or ineffective treatment with \nfluoroquinolones, up from 5,000 people just 1 year before. Scientists \nlater discovered the fluoroquinolone-resistant strand of Campylobacter \nfound in humans was the same as those found in animals. Concerns over \nthe emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria led the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC, to oppose approval of \nfluoroquinolones for animal use.\n  The fact is diseases that were once easily treated and cured by \nantimicrobial drugs are becoming more difficult to treat. Resistance to \nthese drugs has been linked to the overuse of these drugs in animal \ntreatment. The Food and Drug Administration, FDA, has recently \nexpressed concerns regarding the overuse of penicillin in the feeds of \nthe animals humans consume. In a May 2004 statement to manufacturers of \nveterinary penicillin, the FDA stated that their products could play a \nrole in building up human resistance to this drug, as penicillin is \noften used in animals to induce animal growth and prevent diseases.\n  I share in the FDA's concern regarding growing resistance to \nantibiotics like penicillin, and I believe that we should not use these \ndrugs in animal feed without fully understanding the impact on human \nhealth. I believe it is important for the Center for Veterinary \nMedicine to conduct more research on the effects of penicillin in \nanimal feeds, and encourage funding to be added for this purpose. Doing \nso would shed much needed light on how widespread use of these drugs in \nfeed can affect treating human infections.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this important \namendment.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, although it does not appear that we will be \nable to complete action on the Agriculture appropriations bill this \nevening, I would like to take a quick moment to thank Senator Bennett \nand his staff for their hard work. I have had the pleasure of serving \nwith Senator Bennett on this subcommittee for the last 4 years, and \nevery year he and his staff have worked very hard to write a \nresponsible, bipartisan bill that spends the American citizens tax \ndollars wisely. They have also worked very closely with my staff, and I \nremain grateful for that. Once again, I would like to thank Fitz Elder, \nwho did a great job in his first year as clerk, Dianne Preece, Stacy \nMcBride, and Graham Harper. Senator Bennett, you have an exemplary \nstaff, and I am grateful for all of their, and your, hard work and \nprofessionalism.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would first like to applaud and thank \nthe senior Senator from Mississippi and chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Cochran. Because of his leadership, the Committee on \nAppropriations reported each of the 12 appropriations bills to the \nSenate before the August recess, while also shepherding the passage of \na supplemental appropriations bill in the spring for the war in Iraq \nand the lingering effects of Hurricane Katrina. This is the earliest \nthe committee has reported all its bills since 1988. I believe the \nAppropriations Committee to be one of the most difficult committees to \nchair in the Senate, and Chairman Cochran has done a marvelous job. \nDuring his tenure, he has worked diligently to maintain regular order, \nand once again this year he made sure the committee met its \nresponsibilities.\n  I also would like to thank my staff and the staff of Senator Kohl. \nSpecifically, I would like to thank Galen Fountain, Jessica Frederick, \nBill Simpson, and Tom Gonzales of the minority staff and Fitz Elder, \nDianne Preece, Stacy McBride, and Graham Harper of the majority. A \nspecial mention goes to Hunter Moorhead, who ably assisted in the \ndrafting of this legislation before leaving the subcommittee staff to \ntake a position at the White House. These individuals work in a truly \nbipartisan manner, and I thank them for their hard work this year.\n  Shortly, the Senate will vote in relation to the agricultural \ndisaster amendment, and the Agriculture appropriations bill will come \nto a premature end. It was the first appropriations bill to be reported \nto the Senate this year, and it will likely be the last to be \nconsidered by the Senate in the 109th Congress. While I would prefer a \nvote on final passage, we will have to finish the fiscal year 2007 \nAgriculture appropriations bill in the 110th Congress.\n  I wish Senator Kohl Godspeed as he takes over the helm of the \nsubcommittee in the next Congress. It has been my pleasure to work with \nhim over the last 3 years.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11160-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11160]]\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the appropriations bill covering the Departments of Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education. It had been my hope that before we \nfinished our work in the 109th Congress we would address an \nappropriations bill on the very important subjects covered by those \nthree major departments--the Department of Labor, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, and the Department of Education. It appears \nat this juncture that we will not be taking up that bill, and I think \nit is very regrettable. Conceivably we could still act, having the \nbalance of this week, and we could be in session next week, but I \nunderstand that does not appear to be the will of the Senate to \nproceed. It is unfortunate because there are a great many priorities \nwhich ought to be revised in that budget, which approximates $147 \nbillion.\n  We have had a decrease in funding for cancer. As tough as that malady \nis in the United States, and as many people as it claims, we now find \nthat we have $50 million a year less for the National Cancer Institute.\n  We find that there has been a decrease in the funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health generally, which is unacceptable. Senator \nTom Harkin and I, as chairman and ranking--we change gavels from time \nto time on that, and we are about to do so again, but we called it a \nseamless exchange of the gavel--have worked with leadership to increase \nthe funding for the National Institutes of Health from $12 billion in \n1995 to the current recommended funding level of $28.5 billion. \nEnormous advances have been made in combating Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, \nheart disease, cancer, and so many other maladies.\n  We need to reevaluate many of the other programs in the health field, \nand in education funding for GEAR UP mentoring program. We need some \nrescission in appropriations on No Child Left Behind. We need revisions \non worker safety. It is totally unsatisfactory to leave the 109th \nCongress with our having completed action on only 2 of 12 \nappropriations bills. Ten bills are unattended to. Only the Department \nof Defense appropriations bill and Homeland Security will have been \nacted upon, which is not adequate for our responsibilities on these \nvery important subjects.\n  We had a series of hearings to investigate and inquire into how we \nought to spend the money for the Department of Education. Now we are \nnot permitted to act on those recommendations and to reassess the \npriorities and the interests of the American people. Chairman Regula of \nthe House of Representatives and I have tried to conference on an \ninformal basis. But I think it is most unfortunate that we are not able \nto complete this bill.\n  It is my hope that we will take up the bill early in the 110th \nCongress. The new majority leader has outlined an ambitious work \nschedule. This ought to be a priority item to take up.\n  I have been on the Appropriations Committee for all of my tenure in \nthe Senate, ending my 26th year. We need to do better when we take a \nlook at the appropriations process next year.\n  Similarly, it had been my hope that we would have moved on the \nlegislation to provide protection for civil liberties on the \nsurveillance program put into effect by the President, which is \ndesigned to protect America from another terrorist attack and to \nbalance security interests versus privacy interests.\n  When this program was disclosed on December 16 of last year, almost a \nyear ago, we moved ahead in the Judiciary Committee to have a series of \nhearings to try to find a way to have judicial review in accordance \nwith the tradition and concept in the United States, having the \nimpartial magistrate between the Government and the person subject to \nsurveillance, to search and seizure, or to wiretapping. The initial \nlegislation would have given that authority to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court, which was selected because of the expertise that \ncourt has and because they can maintain secrecy. In my legal opinion, \nthere is no doubt that the administration program violates FISA, the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But the President has asserted \nthat there was article II power, inherent powers as Commander in Chief, \nwhich warrants this program without--justifies this program without \nwarrants.\n  I cosponsored legislation introduced by the senior Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, which would extend the time for retroactive \napproval by the FISA court in 3 to 7 days and would increase the \nresources so that according to General Alexander, the head of NSA, \nthere were such resources to have individualized warrants for calls \noriginated in the United States and going outside the United States. \nAccording to General Alexander and the National Security \nAdministration, and General Hayden his predecessor, there are too many \ncalls coming from outside and in to have individualized warrants. But \nit would be an enormous step forward for civil liberties to have the \nindividual warrants for calls originating in the United States and \ngoing out.\n  As to the calls originating outside the United States and coming in, \nlet's have the judicial determination made as to whether the President \nis correct that he has article II powers. That can only be determined \nby the court, weighing the invasion of privacy on the one hand against \nthe interests of security on the other.\n  The legislation which I introduced, S. 4051, modifies earlier \nversions, modifies the so-called Feinstein-Specter bill by recognizing \nthe changing circumstances where a number of district courts have taken \nup the issue in the U.S. District Court in Detroit to declare the \nsurveillance program unconstitutional. It is now in the Sixth Circuit.\n  Let the process proceed to have the adjudication as to whether the \nPresident is right that there are article II powers or whether there is \na violation.\n  The legislation which I have introduced, S. 4051, on November 14, \nprovides further for mandatory review by the Supreme Court and \nexpedited review. If we would focus on this issue, we could come to \ngrips with it and we could legislate. Every day that passes there is \nincursion on civil rights and constitutional rights because there are \nwiretaps which are not supported by affidavit or probable cause and \ncourt authorization. We have it within our power to alter that today if \nwe would come to grips with the issues on all the calls originating in \nthe United States and going out and then, to repeat, to allow the court \nto decide whether the President is correct on whether calls outside \ncoming in are covered by his article II powers.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will be taken up early in the \nnext session because we ought to come to grips with the balance of \nrights versus security.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11161-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11161]]\n                              HEDGE FUNDS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, earlier today the Judiciary Committee \nheld a hearing on hedge funds and what is happening in that important \narea where we now find that we have an area in the securities field \nwhich involves some $1.3 trillion, some 30 percent of the stock \ntrading, and no regulation. The Judiciary Committee held hearings \ncontemporaneously with the consideration of Sarbanes-Oxley and that \nlegislates in the field to deal with criminal sanctions for insider \ntrading violations. The issue which we took up in some detail in the \nJudiciary Committee today involves allegations that there was insider \ntrading, a matter yet to be resolved. But out of the Judiciary \nCommittee inquiry, draft legislation has been circulated which has \nthree very important provisions.\n  First of all, on criminal jurisdiction there are Federal decisions \nwhich have precluded the Department of Justice from collaborating with \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. The draft legislation which has \nbeen circulated would authorize that. There is no reason the SEC and \nthe Department of Justice should not be able to collaborate when they \nfind evidence of criminal conduct to act to prosecute.\n  The second provision of the draft legislation would authorize more \ncompensation for whistleblowers. The fact is, the SEC is doing very \nlittle by way of encouraging whistleblowers to bring forward insider \ninformation and to stop insider trading. The legislation would \nauthorize the Attorney General to provide for compensation up to 30 \npercent for whistleblowers from a penalty, fines or settlement, and \nalso protection for the whistleblowers.\n  The third provision in the draft legislation which has been \ncirculated would provide for regulations on small investors who do not \nhave the sophistication to conduct due diligence and also for pension \nfunds which are invested in hedge funds.\n  The testimony of the attorney general from Connecticut, Richard \nBlumenthal today went into some detail about how the failure of \nAmaranth recently, which amounted to some $6.5 billion, touched pension \nfunds and many of the small investors.\n  We have circulated this legislation, and we will be asking for \ncomments. I thought I would describe it very briefly this afternoon. It \nwill be introduced formally as soon as we have had an opportunity to \nget comments from interested parties.\n  (The remarks of Mr. SPECTER pertaining to the introduction of S. 4081 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson).

Mr. President, one of Congress's most fundamental duties is \nto make careful choices about how to spend the taxpayers' dollars. We \nare now over 67 days into the fiscal year. The Senate has passed only 3 \nof the 12 appropriations bills. Only two of the bills have been signed \ninto law. The operations of government for 13 of the 15 executive \nbranch Cabinet departments are being funded by a very restrictive \ncontinuing resolution. This dismal performance is not the result of the \nwork of the Committee on Appropriations. The Committee on \nAppropriations did its work and on a bipartisan basis reported all 12 \nof its bills by July 26. Chairman Cochran did an outstanding job in \nleading the committee. Yet the appropriations process, once again, has \nfallen victim to politics.\n  Before the November election, the Senate majority leadership decided \nthat the Senate should not be given an opportunity to debate critical \nissues facing the Nation, so 8 of the 12 bills never came before the \nSenate. When it comes to the funding bills for domestic agencies, with \nthe exception of Homeland Security, the majority leadership--and I say \nthis respectfully--is apparently satisfied with a mindless continuing \nresolution. When it comes to the education of our children, the health \nof our elderly citizens, the ability of our deteriorating \ninfrastructure to sustain a growing economy, the majority leadership \napparently wants no debate, just a rubberstamp of a formula-based \ncontinuing resolution for 13 of the 15 departments.\n  The majority leadership made a specific choice to delay bringing the \ndomestic appropriations bills to the floor because it wished to avoid \nan open debate in the Senate about many issues confronting Americans in \ntheir daily lives.\n  The President submitted a budget for domestic programs that cut \nfunding by $14 billion below the level necessary to keep pace with \ninflation. The President's proposal to increase fees on our veterans \nfor their health care is indefensible. The White House proposed cuts in \neducation and in programs to fight crime. The President's budget is not \nsustainable. Yet behind closed doors the majority leadership inserted \nan $872.8 billion cap on spending at the level proposed by the \nPresident's budget. This was done by jamming a cap on spending in an \nunamendable conference report intended to provide disaster relief for \nthe victims of Hurricane Katrina and to fund the efforts of our troops \nserving heroically in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  To avoid debate on the domestic appropriations bills, the Senate \nmajority leadership kept the Senate operating at a snail's pace all \nsummer. In July, the Senate had rollcall votes on just 9 days. In \nAugust, we voted on only 3 days. How about that? In September, we had \nvotes on just 10 days. So in the 3 months in which the Senate should \nhave been in overdrive to finish the appropriations bills, we had votes \non only 22 days. That is a pathetic, a sorry performance.\n  Why? Apparently the majority wants to avoid debate about its broken \npromises concerning the No Child Left Behind Act. The President's \nbudget proposed the largest cut to education funding in the 26-year \nhistory of the Education Department--a $2.1 billion or 4 percent \nreduction. This is a nonsensical squandering of the future of our \nchildren, the American people's children.\n  The Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill underfunds the \ntitle I program, the cornerstone of the No Child Left Behind Act, by a \nwhopping $12.3 billion. Rather than increasing funding to meet this \ncommitment, the bill freezes funding for this program. As a result, \nthis bill leaves behind 3.7 million students who could be fully served \nby title I if the program were funded at the level promised by the No \nChild Left Behind Act. I offered an amendment in the committee markup \nto increase title I funding by $6.1 billion, half of this year's \nshortfall. What happened? The Republican majority rejected it. Was the \nSenate, the full Senate, given an opportunity to debate the need to \ninvest in the education of our children? No. Let me repeat: Was the \nSenate given an opportunity--I am talking about the whole Senate, the \nfull Senate--to debate the need to investigate the education of the \ncountry's children? No.\n  In June, the FBI released its violent crime figures. The FBI found \nthat murders in the United States jumped 4 percent last year, and \noverall violent crime was up by 2.5 percent for the year, the largest \nannual increase in crime since 1991. Yet what happened? The President \nproposed to cut law enforcement grants to State and local governments \nby $1.2 billion and to eliminate the COPS hiring program. Was the \nSenate given an opportunity to debate how best to respond to the \nlargest annual increase in crime in 15 years? No.\n  On July 19, the Commissioner of Social Security wrote to me a letter \nin which she stated that the level of funding in the Labor-HHS bill \n``would require employee furloughs of approximately 10 days Agency-\nwide.'' That is what she said: ``would require employee furloughs of \napproximately 10 days Agency-wide.'' Has the Senate, the full Senate, \nthe 100 Members of the Senate, had a chance to debate whether our \nelderly citizens want long lines at our Social Security offices? No.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency projects that our communities \nneed in excess of $200 billion for clean and safe drinking water \nsystems. Yet the Interior appropriations bill would cut funding from a \nlevel of $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2005 to $687 million in fiscal \nyear 2007, a cut of 38 percent. Has there been any debate in the Senate \nabout the need for safe and clean drinking water in our communities? \nHas there? The answer is no.\n  If there is one lesson we all should have learned from Hurricane \nKatrina,\n\n[[Page S11162]]\n\nit is that there are consequences to starving Federal agencies. FEMA, \nwhich performed marvelously after the North Ridge earthquake, the \nMidwest floods, and the September 11 attacks, simply was no longer up \nto the task when Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast last year.\n  Now, which other Federal agencies are going to be the next FEMA? I \nwonder. I wonder which other Federal agencies will be the next FEMA. \nCould it be the Food and Drug Administration? Has the Senate had an \nopportunity to debate whether FDA has the resources and the leadership \nit needs to make sure we have safe food and safe drugs? I will ask the \nquestion, again. Has the Senate, the full Senate, had an opportunity to \ndebate whether FDA has the resources and leadership it needs to make \nsure we have safe food and safe drugs? No.\n  The cost of attending a public 4-year college has increased 32 \npercent since the beginning of this administration. Yet the maximum \nPell grant award has not been increased since 2002. Has the Senate \ndiscussed the wisdom of making it harder for our children to afford a \ncollege education? Hear me. No.\n  On the heels of the first cut to funding for the National Institutes \nof Health since 1970, the President proposed level funding of NIH in \nfiscal year 2007. As a result, the total number of NIH-funded research \nproject grants would drop by 642 or 2 percent below last year's level.\n  The President's budget would cut funding for 18 of the 19 Institutes \nof Health. Funding for the National Cancer Institute would drop by $40 \nmillion, and funding for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute \nwould drop by $21 million. Has there been a debate about the wisdom of \nthese cuts? No.\n  When the Congress returned to session after the elections, Senator \nHarry Reid and I urged the Senate Republican leadership to complete the \nfiscal year 2007 appropriations process prior to adjourning sine die. \nApparently, this request fell on deaf ears. Even with the elections \nover, the Republican leadership could not bring itself to govern, to \nmake choices.\n  Instead, apparently, the House Republican leadership has decided to \nsend the Senate a third continuing resolution that will last until mid-\nFebruary--mid-February. Instead of making careful choices, they, \napparently, have chosen to punt--to punt--the funding decisions for 13 \ndepartments, for over $463 billion of spending, to the next Congress.\n  What a sad mess. What a sad mess.\n  Under the continuing resolution, 500,000 veterans will have to wait \nlonger for their health care or not get health care at all. Lines at \nour Social Security offices will get longer. Our elderly will find it \nmore difficult to get answers to their questions about the new \nprescription drug benefit or about their retirement benefits. \nCommitments to address our clogged highways with more funds for highway \nconstruction will have to wait. Efforts to protect the food supply will \nbe undermined by furloughs of meat and poultry inspectors. This is no \nway--this is no way--to do our Nation's business.\n  When I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee from 1989 to \n1994, and in 2001, the Senate debated and passed every appropriations \nbill but one. And it takes persistence, determination, and a commitment \nto the Senate to debate and approve all of the bills. Chairman Cochran \nhas that determination, and he was successful last year in bringing \nevery bill to the Senate floor. However, the majority leadership, \napparently, does not value that persistence, that hard work, that \ndetermination. Apparently, in an election year, the only thing of value \nwas the politics of the moment.\n  Mr. President, the irresponsible actions of the Republican leadership \nare setting the stage for the beginning of the 110th Congress next \nyear. In January, the new Congress will be faced with approving funding \nfor 10 leftover bills for fiscal year 2007, a large war supplemental, \nand 12 bills for fiscal year 2008. Where the Republican leadership \ncould do no more than pass two annual appropriations bills all year, \nthe Democrats will be expected to pass 22 annual bills and a \nsupplemental.\n  And this will be a huge, a huge--I would say a whopping--challenge. \nHowever, in the bipartisan tradition of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to meet this challenge.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia yields.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11162-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11162-S11163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          2007 APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to address my serious concern \nabout our movement toward a decision to adjourn the 109th Congress \nwithout completing our work on the remaining 2007 appropriations bills \nand to recognize, also, my friend and senior Senator from the State of \nOhio, Mr. Mike DeWine.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, the fiscal year 2006 appropriations \nexpired on September 30, 2006. And with the exception of the \nDepartments of Defense and Homeland Security, the Federal Government is \ncurrently operating on its second temporary continuing resolution, set \nto expire on December 8, 2006. We now intend to enact a third \ncontinuing resolution to fund the Government into February 2007.\n  Passage of a long-term continuing resolution, as some have advocated, \nmeans the Federal Government will work without a budget for at least 5 \nmonths into the current fiscal year, without knowing what spending \nlevels will be approved for discretionary programs. Federal Departments \nand agencies will be forced to oversee programs and manage employees \nwithout knowing whether they are overspending their fiscal year 2007 \nbudgets.\n  This approach toward managing our Nation's checkbook is indicative of \nCongress's attitude toward fiscal discipline and is a serious problem. \nOther Senators have spoken about how serious the problems are. And \nSenator Byrd did a very good job of outlining the serious impact that \nour not passing our appropriations on time is going to have on some of \nour Departments in the Federal Government. And earlier, Senator Specter \ndid the same thing. We are aware of the problems it is going to create \nfor the management of our Government.\n\n  Operating without a budget impacts our effectiveness in fighting the \nwar on terror. It affects our ability to maintain and improve our \ntransportation infrastructure and enhance our educational system. And \nit further contributes to the public perception that Congress has no \nappreciation of the importance of good management and the importance of \nhiring the right people with the right knowledge and skills at the \nright time and at the right place.\n  This is not a good record for either side of the aisle. And with due \nrespect to the senior Senator from West Virginia, I think it cannot be \nlaid at the feet of the Republicans; it should be laid at the feet of \nboth Republicans and Democrats. This is not a partisan issue. Congress \nhas the power of the purse, but we are not the best stewards of the \ntaxpayers' money if time after time we pass omnibus bills without even \nknowing what is in them, and if, again and again, we fund programs \nwithout knowing how these programs are performing.\n  Managing by continuing resolution is inherently wasteful and \ninefficient. It results in spending disruptions and chaos in the \noperations of Federal programs and dramatic productivity slowdowns. We \nhave no appreciation of what not having a budget for 5 months has on \nthe various Federal agencies that are supposed to be providing services \nto the people of our country.\n  In recent years, many Federal Departments have taken positive steps \ntoward streamlining their budgets and tightening the reins on their \ndaily operations--conduct that ought to be rewarded. Instead, \nDepartments are forced to thin their staffs and put critical projects \non hold when Congress fails to pass appropriations bills on time, \nplacing an unnecessary strain on the relationship between Congress and \nthe administrative branch of Government.\n  Such a funding shortfall is expected to have particularly adverse \neffects on human capital-intensive agencies, such as the Government \nAccountability Office, where attracting and retaining good employees is \ncritical to running a competitive and productive organization.\n  Agencies such as the GAO have made it very clear that without a \nbudget,\n\n[[Page S11163]]\n\nthey risk losing top-quality personnel. They are unable to properly \nrecognize and reward individuals for good service--a problem that \nthreatens the efficiency of their day-to-day activities and hampers the \nimage of the Federal Government. As an employer, we want to get people \nto come on board, and we cannot pass our appropriations.\n  This added pressure on human capital is not limited to the GAO. In \nfact, there are lots of similar agencies, such as the SEC, the FBI, and \nthe IRS, which experience the same problem. According to a report in \nCongress Daily, the Social Security Administration maintains it will \nhave to furlough every employee if its regular appropriations are not \nsigned into law. I think that may be a big exaggeration, but it has a \nreal impact on the operations of that agency.\n  Many companies with Government contracts are laying people off \nbecause they are not sure that the contracts will be renewed because of \nthe budget process. And I know this from a member of my family who was \nlaid off a year ago. Because we did not pass the budget on time, the \ncompany said: We don't know whether we are going to have the contracts. \nSeventy people lost their jobs while they waited around to find out \nwhether the appropriations were going to be passed and how it impacted \non the operations of NASA Glenn in Cleveland.\n  Sometimes programs are ineffective, and their budgets should be \nreduced or eliminated. By resorting to a continuing resolution, \nineffective programs continue to operate, despite poor performance \nresults. For example, the House would have terminated 53 programs, for \na savings of $4 billion. But under a continuing resolution, we cannot \neven discuss whether these programs deserve to be terminated. \nLiterally, dozens of unauthorized programs continue to be funded.\n  On the flip side, the appropriations process has expanded beyond the \nbudget domain to include shaping and authorizing policy. This is \nespecially the case with Foreign Operations programs. It then becomes \neven more important to enact the Foreign Operations appropriations bill \nbecause it is the way we modify foreign aid and foreign policy \ninitiatives.\n  One such instance is the Transformational Diplomacy Program at the \nState Department, which would allow for the repositioning of American \ndiplomats to essential locations and for the movement of public \ndiplomacy centers to smaller posts outside of foreign capitals.\n  But it is not just the Federal Government that suffers. States, \ncounties, and cities all depend on funding from Washington. If you are \na county commissioner or you are a mayor and you have Federal programs \nand you are not sure what you are going to be getting, that causes a \nmajor problem for your respective agency.\n  When Congress fails to enact appropriations on time, highways, \nemergency preparedness, and economic development programs are all \nneglected, and Congress creates a new burden for Governors, mayors, and \nlocal officials. Maintaining and improving America's transportation is \nvital to our economy, the environment, and the welfare of the American \npeople.\n  The Interstate Highway System is one of the country's greatest public \nworks projects, but it requires Federal investment. States plan their \nhighway construction programs for the coming year based on anticipated \nFederal funding set by SAFETEA legislation. If Congress fails to pass \nthe 2007 Transportation appropriations bill on time, States will have \nreduced Federal funding and are going to be forced to delay \nconstruction projects for the upcoming year.\n  In my home State of Ohio, for instance, construction cost increases \nin inflation have already forced the Ohio Department of Transportation \nto cancel and postpone nearly $450 million in new highway projects. \nAdding a continuing resolution to this current slowdown will simply \nexacerbate the problem and result in further delay and further \nconstruction problems, if we don't pay any attention to that. That is \ngoing to impact the contracts they would like to let. That is why our \nStates and workers cannot afford for us to ignore our budget \nresponsibilities.\n  It is incredible to me, as someone who has been a mayor and Governor, \nthat the U.S. Senate has not completed its appropriations work. As a \nmayor and Governor, the law mandated that we get our appropriations \ndone by the end of the fiscal year. I am sure the Presiding Officer, \nwhen he was a member in the State of Georgia Legislature, saw that they \ngot their appropriations done on time. In Ohio, once in a while we had \nto put a cloth over the clock for a couple of days. The fact is, we got \nit done.\n  I know I am not alone in my frustration. In fact, Thad Cochran, \nchairman, calls it irresponsible. He is the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. It is irresponsible; I second that. It is \nabsolutely irresponsible.\n  Let's look at our record on the path of fiscal irresponsibility. In \nfact, in 25 of the past 30 years, Congress has failed to enact all the \nappropriations bills by the start of the fiscal year, which is a major \nresponsibility, to get the budget passed and get the appropriations \nbills done on time. The last time Congress enacted all appropriations \nbills by September 30 was 1997. And for 17 of the past years, Congress \nhas had to combine two or more appropriations bills together in an \nomnibus or minibus legislation. Given the facts, it is an indication to \nthe American people that we are not doing our job. We are not being \nresponsible.\n  We send a signal to those in the Federal Government that we don't \ngive a darn about how, when we don't do our jobs, they can't do theirs. \nCongress may hold the power of the purse, but we undermine our \ncredibility by starving good managers and agencies of necessary \nresources and by turning a blind eye to failing programs. This is about \nmore than allocating funds. It is about good management, and it is \nabout good public policy. All of us on a bipartisan basis should pledge \nthat we are going to get the appropriations bills done for 2008 on time \nand that next year we are not going to have a repeat performance of \nwhat we are experiencing this week in the Senate.\n  I think if you talk about the frustration of the American people in \nterms of Congress and our responsibility to them, you can only conclude \none thing if you were out there watching this. Folks are saying: They \ncan't even get their appropriations bills done on time. That is a sad \ncommentary. Let's start out next year on a new leaf. Let's all pledge \nto do this, both Republicans and Democrats. Let's say we are going to \nget this job done. I know some people have a problem with the process \nand some of the porkbarrel and the rest of it, but let's start out and \nsay we are going to get it done, bring it to the floor, debate it, and \nget it done on time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11163-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11163-S11165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MIKE DeWINE\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about our senior \nSenator from Ohio, Mike DeWine. Let me begin by saying this is a speech \nI hoped I would never have to give. For many in this Chamber, winter \ncame a little early this year. A blizzard of political change swept \nthrough the country and, unfortunately, many were unable to weather the \nstorm; in my particular case, in our State, through no fault of their \nown.\n  Mike DeWine was one of the most effective legislators we have in the \nU.S. Senate. He was a victim of this storm. I am deeply saddened that \nour respective colleagues will not be joining us when we congregate \nagain for the 110th Congress. Mike's tireless commitment to \nlegislating, his willingness and ability to work with both parties, and \nhis ingenuity will be sorely missed by everyone in the Senate and the \nState of Ohio.\n  Mike has served the people of Ohio for more than 30 years, beginning \nas an assistant county prosecutor in 1992. He served as Green County \nprosecutor for 4 years, State senator for 2 years, Congressman for 8 \nyears, and he was my Lieutenant Governor for 4 years when I was \nGovernor of Ohio. And, of course, he has served us for 12 years as our \nU.S. Senator. He is one of the most effective and least partisan \nMembers in this body.\n  During campaign season, some of our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle kept asking me: How is Mike doing, how is he doing? Frankly, \nI think they were secretly hoping his poll numbers would be strong \nenough that he would not become a target. Unfortunately,\n\n[[Page S11164]]\n\nthose numbers never got up to that place, and he ended up being a \ntarget.\n  Far too many Members see differences between Republicans and \nDemocrats as an unsurpassable deep divide. Not Mike DeWine. Over and \nover again, Mike built bridges between our parties, and he got things \ndone for America and for Ohio. Janet and I feel like Mike and his \nwonderful wife Fran are part of our family. After working with Mike for \nthe past 16 years, I can tell you that there is something special about \nhim. In fact, right from the start, I knew there was something \nrefreshingly different about Mike DeWine.\n  The inception of our friendship came in 1990, when Mike and I were \nboth running in the Republican primary for Governor of Ohio. It was a \ncrowded field with Mike, Bob Taft, and I vying for the Governor's slot. \nIt was then we really got to know each other. We talked about what \nwould be the best for Ohio and for the Republican Party and, quite \nfrankly, for our respective political futures. We decided to combine \nour efforts as running mates, and Mike agreed to run as my Lieutenant \nGovernor.\n  I knew this was a very tough decision for Mike because he wanted to \nbe Governor and was giving up a very safe congressional seat to run for \nState office. At that moment, I knew I had a first-rate partner, a man \nwith great character and humility as well as unique political poise and \npromise. Both of us knew we had a long, tough race ahead of us with no \nguarantees. This was not a layup shot. There was a real question of \nwhether we were going to be successful. He had given up a safe seat in \nthe U.S. Congress, with a big family. But we had a great time running \nfor State office. Mike had an opportunity to connect with the State as \na whole. I remember when he and Fran packed the kids in the van and \ntraveled every inch of Ohio, becoming intimate with the Appalachian \neast, its manufacturing north, and its interior farmland.\n  We went on to win the general election and, as I like to say, \ntogether we did it. Together we won the election, and together we \ncharted a new course for Ohio.\n  As Lieutenant Governor, Mike took over the State's criminal justice \nagencies, where he led the fight against crime and illegal drugs. It \nwas a relief to have Mike as my partner when we had the Lucasville \nriots which broke out on Easter Sunday in 1993. It was the largest \nprison disturbance in the history of the United States, generating a \ngreat deal of national tension. Mike's background in criminal justice \nand his close relationship with law enforcement helped us respond \nquickly and effectively. It could have been a tragedy, but fortunately, \ntogether, and with the help of the Holy Spirit, we made it through.\n  In 1992, when the Ohio Republican Party needed a challenger to run \nagainst the famous astronaut and giant in Ohio politics, John Glenn, \nMike was the obvious choice. He and Fran worked tirelessly to win that \nseat. Unfortunately, victory was not in the cards that year but triumph \nwas imminent. Two years later, Mike became a U.S. Senator and our party \nswept the State, just as the Democrats did this year in Ohio. Mike \nreturned to Washington as a U.S. Senator with more perspective, more \nexperience, and more insight into the challenges facing Ohio than when \nhe left the Congress as a Member of the House of Representatives. \nWithout a lot of fanfare, he quietly went to work.\n  Of course, Mike has been shaped by many things. It is impossible to \ntalk about his achievements in public service without mentioning the \nterrible misfortune he and Fran experienced back in 1994. I will never \nforget the day Mike and Fran lost their daughter Becky. I am familiar \nwith the tremendous pain they suffered. The day that changed their \nlives sticks in my memory, much like the day Janet and I lost our \ndaughter Molly. Mike translated the love he and Fran had for Becky into \nhis work in the Senate. He became a champion for our youth and for \nthose who cannot represent themselves. That is why today I am hard \npressed to think of anyone who has not been helped by Mike DeWine.\n  His legislative achievements, which span both domestic and foreign \npolicy, reflect his effectual and compassionate nature. Mike has shown \ntremendous dedication toward improving the safety of our highway \nsystem. He not only amended the 2005 highway bill to make preferences \nfor highways noted as being unsafe, but he also allocated more than $56 \nmillion of SAFETEA-LU, intended for improving highway safety.\n  He succeeded in getting further testing and approval of medications \nfor children. He helped establish a national toll-free poison control \nhotline. He acted on behalf of the children of U.S. servicemembers to \nmake sure they had access to affordable health care. And he has stood \nup for foster children to make sure they are protected and to help them \nfind adoptive parents.\n  Time after time, Senator DeWine has protected Ohio. He was a critical \nvoice in passing the Senate pension bill which helped ensure that \nworkers' futures in Ohio are on better footing. He is a cosponsor of \nthe Health Partnership Act because he understands how important health \ncare reform is to Ohioans and to this country. He helped ensure that \nour fire departments are better equipped to fulfill their missions as \nfirst responders.\n  During the BRAC process, he worked to keep Federal facilities, such \nas Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton and the Defense Finance \nand Accounting Center in Cleveland and Columbus, open and operating. \nAnd he led a new mission for Ohio's NASA-Glenn in Cleveland. Today \nthese facilities are thriving and contributing to Ohio's aerospace \nindustry and national defense. I don't think there was a State in the \ncountry that benefited more from the BRAC process than Ohio, and it is \nattributable to the outstanding leadership Mike DeWine gave all of us \nin terms of that BRAC process.\n  Mike has also been a friend of the Jewish community and has made it a \npriority to help stamp out antisemitism and intolerance in America. He \nplayed a pivotal role in helping disclose previously classified \ndocuments about Nazi aggression, legislation that made those records \navailable to the public through the National Archives and Records \nAdministration. Today, thanks to Mike, doctors, nurses, and aid workers \nare more prepared to confront the global AIDS epidemic.\n  Mike has carried a heavy burden while he has been in the Senate. He \nsits on the Judiciary Committee, the HELP Committee, and the \nIntelligence Committee. He also sits on one the most prestigious \ncommittees in the Senate, Appropriations. In fact, Mike was the first \nOhioan in 50 years to sit on Appropriations. His position of \nleadership--and the resources he has been able to bring back to Ohio--\nhas made a tremendous difference for our State and a tremendous \ndifference in the lives of the people of our State. I used to joke with \nMike that my job as the debt hawk was to make sure we didn't spend the \nmoney. But once we decided we were going to spend it, his job was to \nmake sure Ohio got its fair share. And boy, did he do a good job.\n  These are just a handful of examples where my close friend and \ncolleague Mike DeWine has made a difference. His legislative \naccomplishments and his legacy of principled public service have had a \ndeep impact on all of our lives. The Senate will suffer a loss without \nMike. But he will not slip out of the Senate. He will walk out these \ndoors with his head held high because he can feel good about all he has \ngiven to the people of Ohio and to the United States of America. He has \ntruly made a difference in their lives.\n  Married for more than 39 years, Mike and Fran are parents to 8 \nchildren and grandparents to 10. They have been blessed with much \nhappiness and success, and they have carved out many meaningful paths \nduring their life together.\n  While Mike will be missed, I am confident that he and Fran will begin \nsomething new in this next chapter of their lives. We have both been \ngiven so much. I believe that God does have a plan. Sometimes we are \nnot sure about what it is, but God does have a plan.\n  I am reminded of one of my favorite verses from the Bible, Proverbs \nchapter 3, verses 5 and 6:\n\n       Trust in the Lord with all your heart; and learn not unto \n     your own understandings. In all your ways acknowledge Him, \n     and He will direct your path.\n\n  Mike will be missed. But I know the Holy Spirit will continue to \ninspire\n\n[[Page S11165]]\n\nMike and Fran as they embark on a new journey together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine, \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend--the now junior \nSenator from Ohio, who in January will become the senior Senator from \nOhio--for those very generous and kind comments.\n  George Voinovich and I first got to know each other in 1989. I will \nnot repeat the story the Senator recounted, but we got together and \nformed a partnership that has lasted until today. I gave up my run for \nGovernor and joined with George as his Lieutenant Governor candidate. \nWe won and, as they say, the rest is history. George was a great \nGovernor for 8 years. I was his Lieutenant Governor for the first 4 of \nthose years. We worked very closely during that period of time, of \ncourse, and after I went to the Senate, when he was still Governor. We \nhave worked even closer since he has been a Senator from Ohio. So I \nthank him. George Voinovich and Janet are dear friends. They are people \nwhom we care very much about. George is a great public servant, and I \nappreciate him very much and am touched, frankly, by his very kind \ncomments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11165-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11165-S11173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      specialist allen james knop\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today in \nremembrance of a brave Ohioan from Willowick--Army SPC Allen James \nKnop. On November 23, 2005, Specialist Knop died while serving our \nNation in Iraq. He was serving with the 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry \nRegiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, based at \nFort Campbell, KY. He was 22 years old.\n  Specialist Knop is survived by his mother Eileen D'Ercole, his father \nWilliam Knop, and his siblings Brandon, Rachel, Max, Natalie, and \nAlison.\n  Allen graduated from North High School in Eastlake, OH, in 2002. He \nloved sports--especially golf. His mother Eileen remembers that Allen \nwas extremely charismatic and that he willingly would make sacrifices \nthat helped others. She said, ``Blessings come from the heart, and my \nson had the most wonderful heart of anyone I know.''\n  As a high school student, Allen developed a strong work ethic. He \nrelished responsibility. His father William does masonry work and often \nwould hire Allen during his summer vacations. William said, ``[Al] \nwould work with me in the summer. He was strong. He was thin. And, he \nwas fast. Sometimes my guys would come up to me and say, `Hey! That kid \nworks harder than we do!' ''\n  Allen's father remembers that it was the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, that motivated his son to enlist in the Army \nimmediately after high school. William worried about the decision, but \nwas deeply impressed by Allen's responses to his questions. This is \nwhat Allen said: ``Just think, Dad. If everyone thought like you, there \nwouldn't be anybody over there fighting now.'' Recalling this \nconversation, William said, ``That's probably the bravest thing I've \never heard anybody say.''\n  Al's mother Eileen remembers how proud her son was to be in the Army. \nShe said, ``He could have gone to any college in the country, but he \nchose to join for a cause he truly believed in.''\n  His father also recalls that Allen didn't have any delusions about \nwar. He understood the danger of combat, but willingly enlisted because \nhe felt such pride in our country. That is simply the kind of person he \nwas.\n  Allen spent 13 months on combat duty in Iraq--and then reenlisted. \nHis second tour began in August of 2005. His father said that ``that \ntour was hard on him, but he was so proud to serve that he re-enlisted \nto go back. It meant everything to him. He was a true patriot.''\n  Still though, Allen knew that re-enlisting worried his family--and \nnothing meant more to him than his family. So he decided to use a \nfamily golfing trip to get a few laughs with them before he left. He \nshowed up dressed in a light-blue leisure suit and talked his younger \nbrother Max into dressing up like Johnny Cash, the Man in Black. \nWilliam always laughs at the memory. ``It's Al,'' he said. ``Always \ngoofing around. . . . That's one of the best memories I'll have of \nhim.''\n  It was during this same golf outing that Allen gave his brother Max a \nspecial gift. Even though Allen was careful with money and didn't like \nto spend it freely, he had recently bought an expensive new golf set \nand driver for himself. William remembers, however, that when Allen \nsaid goodbye and went to drive away, he stopped, turned around, and \nsummoned his brother Max. This is how William describes what happened \nnext:\n\n       So he got out of the car and walked over to [me]. He had \n     that driver with him and he said, ``Here, Max. Keep an eye on \n     this until I get back.''\n\n  Allen's family and friends will always remember him as someone who \nwas extremely generous, caring, and selfless. Once, during his first \ntour of Iraq, Allen got a pass to come home for a visit. But he didn't \nuse it for himself. Instead, he gave it to a fellow soldier whose wife \nand children were eager to see him. His mother Eileen remembers, ``It \nbroke my heart, but he did what was right. How could you argue with \nthat?''\n  Hundreds of friends, colleagues, and family members attended Allen's \nfuneral, which took place on a snowy day in Ohio. U.S. Army Staff \nSergeant Christopher Davis, Allen's squad leader during his 2003 tour \nof duty in Iraq, spoke at the service. This is what he said of Allen:\n\n       Rest assured, he will live forever in the tales of heroism \n     that we brothers will tell. . . . Today, Al's band of \n     brothers are here to pay tribute to one of our own.\n\n  Staff Sergeant Davis also recalled that while Allen exhibited \ntremendous leadership abilities, he also had the ability to make his \nfellow soldiers laugh and possessed a unique ``light-heartedness and \nboundless energy.'' He said this of Allen:\n\n       He was a fierce fighter, and he was quick with a joke. Our \n     unit suffered some very difficult times, but Al was like a \n     beacon. He was the only one that could make me laugh.\n\n  During the funeral, Pastor Larry Bogenrief spoke of Allen's strong \nfaith in God and his commitment to military service. He said that he \n``was a young man who found a cause he was willing to put his life on \nthe line for.'' The Pastor also recalled conversations between Allen \nand his mother Eileen about the dangerous conditions in Iraq. He \nremembers how Allen would say, ``We've been through some pretty close \nscrapes, Mom. Keep praying for us. I know God is watching over us.''\n  U.S. Army BG Michael J. Lally III, also spoke at the funeral. ``He \nwas a born leader,'' he said of Allen. ``He had integrity, and he knew \nwhat was right.''\n  Mr. President, Allen Knop will never be forgotten by the friends and \nfamily who all loved him so much. He was simply fun to be around. His \nstep-mother Francine Knop remembers he was so close to his family and \nalways happy when with them. She said, ``We were absolutely a close \nfamily. He was with us during a lot of good times.''\n  Allen's father remembers the joy with which his son lived. He said, \n``Oh, [Al] was always joking, always pulling pranks. He was just a \nhappy-go-lucky guy, and he would do anything in the world for you.''\n  Allen was close to his grandmother, Alberta Knop. She lived down the \nstreet from him, and he'd often ride his bike to see her. ``He was just \nsuch a good boy, just a good person. He's just such a sweetheart,'' she \nsaid. ``He's my hero. I'm very, very proud of him.''\n  Mr. President, I conclude my remarks with the words of Allen's \nfather. This is what he said:\n\n       I want people to know my son was a brave and honest man, \n     and he was loved by so many people--but nobody more than by \n     his father.\n\n  Mr. President, Allen Knop lived his life with a selflessness that is \nrare. His loss is truly a loss for each and every one of us. My wife \nFran and I will continue to keep his family in our thoughts and in our \nprayers.\n\n\n                         SERGEANT DAVID KREUTER\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to remember a brave Marine and a fellow \nOhioan who gave his life in service to our Nation--Marine Sergeant \nDavid Kreuter, from Cincinnati. On August 3, 2005, Sergeant Kreuter was \nkilled when a roadside bomb exploded under his amphibious assault \nvehicle. He was 26 years old.\n  Throughout his life, David loved everything about the outdoors. He \nenjoyed camping and joined the Boy Scouts as a child. From the time he \nwas a small boy, David had an extraordinary sense of adventure equal \nonly to\n\n[[Page S11166]]\n\nhis sense of humor. He was simply the kind of person who was always \nbringing a smile to the face of others.\n  Mark Wiete, one of David's former Boy Scout troop leaders, remembers \nthat David was always making everyone laugh. ``He was always doing \nfunny voices,'' he said. ``He was very animated.'' And according to his \nfather, Ken, David simply ``brightened a room when he came in, and it's \nthat kind of spirit you can't replace.''\n  David graduated in 1997 from St. Xavier High School, where he ran on \nthe cross-country team. After graduation in 1998, he joined the Marine \nReserves. His godfather Norm Clarke remembers David's determination to \nalways be the best. ``David wanted to do the toughest thing there is,'' \nhe said, ``and the Marines represented that.''\n  As a Reservist, David attended Ohio University and then graduated \nfrom the University of Cincinnati in 2004, with a Bachelor of Science \ndegree in Criminal Justice.\n  In September 2004 after graduating, he married his college \nsweetheart, Chrystina. Chrystina truly found the love of her life in \nthe dedicated and fun-loving David. He was her rock of stability.\n  David had always made everyone in his life laugh. It was no different \nwith his fellow marines in Iraq. With friend LCpl Tim Bell, a fellow \nOhioan who was killed that same day alongside David, he was always \ncracking jokes. Despite being overseas and fighting in one of the most \ndangerous places in the world, David remained a good-natured prankster, \nsomeone who could always make his marine brothers smile.\n  Being a marine meant so much to David. When his tour of duty ended in \nIraq, he was hoping to attend Officers' Training School and make the \nmilitary his career. His friends and family remembered that he loved \nevery part of being a marine--from the uniform he wore to working the \nmost dangerous missions in the most insecure part of the world. ``He \nwanted to be the best,'' his father Ken remembers. ``He wanted to do \nthe hardest thing possible. As far as we can tell, he was involved in \njust about every major mission or event over there.''\n  David consistently volunteered for his unit's most dangerous \nmissions, even though he knew he might not return. But, you see, David \nbelieved in what he was doing and that he was fighting for what he \nbelieved was right. During phone conversations with his mother Pat he \ntold her that he could see his marines making such a positive \ndifference in Iraq.\n  David was passionate about his marines and passionate about his own \nunit. But he was also passionate about his family. He grew up with \nloving and devoted parents, and his two younger sisters, Kristin and \nLaura, adored him, even though he teased them endlessly.\n  Tragically, David was just beginning his own family when he was \nkilled. According to his mom, ``He was going to be a really good \nhusband and a good father.'' He and Chrystina had been married less \nthan a year, and she had given birth to their son Christian just 7 \nweeks before his death. David was looking forward to his return so that \nhe could meet his son for the first time. In one of his last letters \nhome to his sister Laura, he wrote the following:\n\n       No matter what, I think we should be home by the first week \n     of October. I will see you then and we can talk about \n     Halloween costumes for Christian.\n\n  David was never able to meet Christian in person, but the 7 weeks \nbefore his death were full of love and devotion for his son. On \ntelephone calls with Chrystina, David would listen joyfully to the \nsound of his newborn son's peaceful breathing.\n  At David's funeral, the Rev. Tim Williams read a letter Chrystina \nwrote to David after his death. ``I promise you,'' she wrote, \n``Christian will know you every day of his life and how much you love \nhim. You paid the ultimate price to protect him.''\n  After David's death, there was an amazing outpouring of love and \nsupport for his family. One night they returned home from his \nvisitation services, after spending hours meeting with friends and \nstrangers, to find that their neighbors, along with the Oak Hills High \nSchool football team, had lined the streets of Miami Township, OH, with \nmile after mile of luminaries. At David's funeral, hundreds of mourners \nattended to pay their respects.\n  I never met David, but I was honored to be asked by the family to \nspeak at his funeral. Everyone I met that day had countless stories \nabout his wonderful sense of humor, his charisma, his devotion to \nfamily, and his devotion to country.\n  Indeed, David was the model of what a marine should be. No matter \nwhat challenge he was faced with, he always gave it his best. Once he \nstarted something, he wouldn't quit. He was committed to the values of \nfreedom and democracy--the values that we all hold dear, and, in the \nend, he gave his life so that those ideals will be preserved for all of \nus. David was a marine through and through--completely dedicated to his \nmission and to the belief that what he did was right.\n  When I think of David's life, it reminds me of something President \nDwight David Eisenhower once said:\n\n       Only our individual faith in freedom can keep us free.\n\n  David truly had that faith in freedom and fought so hard to protect \nit. He didn't fight because he had to; he volunteered. He served in \nIraq because this is what he believed in, and because of what he did \nour world has been made a better place. It is a safer place, both for \nus and for our children.\n  Christian Kreuter will grow up in a better world because of his dad. \nHe will be proud of his dad, just as all of us are.\n  My wife Fran and I will continue to keep the family and friends of \nMarine SGT David Kreuter in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                Sergeant First Class Daniel B. Crabtree\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute this evening to a fellow Ohioan, \nArmy National Guard SFC Daniel Brian Crabtree from Canton, OH. On June \n8, 2006, Sergeant Crabtree died in Iraq when a roadside bomb detonated \nnear his vehicle. He was 31 years of age.\n  Born in Columbus, Dan, as his family and friends called him, grew up \ndreaming that some day he would become a soldier. His mother Judy \nremembers coming home one afternoon to find her 13-year-old son on the \nphone with a strange adult. That adult was an Army recruiter, and Dan \nhad signed up to join the service in 4 years. ``He was just a born \nwarrior,'' Judy remembers.\n  Even as a boy, Dan displayed uncommon bravery and courage. His \nlongtime friend Steve Hodges remembers one night in particular when he \nand some others were making noises outside a camping tent in which Dan \nwas sleeping. Of those sleeping in the tent, Dan was the first to come \nout to see what the noise was. ``Even then,'' Steve said, ``you would \nrecognize the military man Dan was to become.''\n  Dan simply could not wait to help defend his Nation. The only thing \nthat stopped him from serving in the first gulf war is he was too young \nat the time, even though he tried to get his mother to sign papers \nallowing him to serve.\n  Dan joined the Army Reserves in 1992 when he was a junior at Lake \nHigh School in Hartville, OH. After graduating the following year, he \ntransferred to the Ohio Army National Guard as an administrative \nspecialist. He later trained as a military police officer and served \nthe 135th Military Police Company in Brook Park. Along the way, he \nearned his associate degree in criminal justice from the University of \nAkron.\n\n  Dan's entire life was devoted to protecting others. Before defending \nhis country overseas, he worked as a police officer guarding us at \nhome. He was an officer in the Cuyahoga Falls police department for 9 \nyears where he was assigned to the patrol division and was a member of \nthe SWAT team and Honor Guard. Before that, Dan had worked with the \nHartville police department for more than a year.\n  Dan's fellow officers remember him as a dedicated officer who was \nvery comfortable patrolling the streets. They also remember him as a \n``sweet-hearted'' man who would do anything for his fellow officers and \nhis friends.\n  ``He was young and ambitious, just a good guy,'' recalled Hartville \npolice chief George Dragovich. ``He did a great job.''\n  Although Dan loved being a police officer, family and friends say \nthat military service had always been his passion, particularly the \nSpecial Forces. He signed up for the Special Forces just 2 weeks before \nthe terrorist attacks on September 11 and joined the\n\n[[Page S11167]]\n\n19th Special Forces Group of the Ohio National Guard in March 2002. He \ngraduated from the vigorous Special Forces qualifications course in May \n2004, finally earning that coveted green beret.\n  Family and friends remember that Dan's determination to succeed in \nthe Special Forces was unmatched. No one worked harder. When Dan was \ntraining for the qualifications course, he was also working night \nshifts as a police officer. But simply being tired wasn't going to keep \nhim from his dream. Instead, he would go for 15-mile runs with a \nbackpack strapped to him--a backpack filled with several pounds of \nrock.\n  As an adult, Dan was very much the boy he had once been--eager to \nserve his Nation. ``At the time, he seemed excited to go over,'' \nHartville police sergeant Dan Stiles said, remembering the time Dan was \npreparing to go to California to train for urban combat before being \nsent to Iraq. ``He was ready to go.'' When he left for Iraq, his fellow \npolice officers gave him a parting gift--a medal of St. Christopher, \nthe patron saint of travelers.\n  Dan loved the work he was doing with the Special Forces in Iraq. His \ncivilian knowledge and experience with weapons uniquely qualified him \nfor his mission--and that mission was the development and \nimplementation of a SWAT training program for the Iraqi police force in \nAl Kut. In addition, Dan simply had a knack for teaching. Even with the \nmembers of his own unit, he always took the time to explain things. He \nwas patient and understanding and so very knowledgeable.\n  A young soldier who trained with Dan in the United States remembers \nhis kindness:\n\n       He always stopped and took the time to talk to me. . . . He \n     answered my questions no matter how stupid they were. That \n     was Dan. He was what being a Special Forces soldier is all \n     about.\n\n  But Dan was more than a knowledgeable comrade and teacher to his \nfellow soldiers. He was also a good friend, one who will be remembered \nwith laughter and smiles. His fellow soldiers from the 19th Special \nForces Group particularly remember Dan's first jump with the elite \ntroops after he successfully completed the qualifications course. He \nlanded badly, breaking his leg in the fall. One of his friends rushed \nover to make sure he was OK, only to find that Dan was lying there \nlaughing, even while grimacing from the pain.\n  That was typical of Dan. That is what friends and family tell. He \nsimply loved being in the Army. He believed in his mission. According \nto a fellow member of his unit, Dan ``died doing what he liked to do.''\n  Dan's death was a terrible blow felt by his entire community. More \nthan 500 mourners, many of whom were uniformed police officers from \nHartville and Cuyahoga Falls, attended his funeral to pay their \nrespects to the fallen soldier. Volunteers from nearby police stations \ntook over police officer duties in Cuyahoga Falls so that almost the \nentire department could attend the services.\n  As Cuyahoga Falls police chief John Connally said:\n\n       We are just crushed. Everyone at the department is in \n     shock. . . . We're going to miss him for a long time.\n\n  Those who attended the service remembered Dan's dedication to the \nmilitary. Rev. Robert Baker said this:\n\n       No one ever went up to Dan and said, ``Join the Army, join \n     the Special Forces.'' It was in his heart. He was a man of \n     uncommon valor and invincible courage.\n\n  Hartville police officer John Norman said that his friend was living \nhis high school dream by serving as a member of the Special Forces. \n``This is what he wanted,'' Officer Norman said.\n  Dan also will be remembered as a devoted husband and a father. He \nloved his wife Kathy and missed her when he was away. According to \nOfficer Norman, Dan was planning to take some vacation time after he \nreturned from Iraq so he could be a stay-at-home dad for several weeks \nto help Kathy. ``He was going to basically put the rest of his life \ninto his wife and family,'' he recalls.\n  Steve Hodges, Dan's longtime friend, read a letter at his funeral \nthat he addressed to Mallory, Dan's young daughter. In his letter, \nSteve remembered the proudest moment in Dan's life had been when \nMallory was born. He told her about the things her father had loved, \nsuch as playing soccer, Atari video games, and Axis and Allies, a World \nWar II strategy game.\n  Steve told her that her father had been a ``brave and kind'' man, \nsomeone who deeply loved to help people and deeply loved his country. \nSteve also read the following words about Dan:\n\n       He was worried, Mallory, for your safety. He wanted the \n     best for you--for you to be happy, for you to be able to \n     enjoy the freedoms he loved so much.\n  Mr. President, Dan Crabtree will be remembered and missed by all who \nknew him. They will laugh at the memorable things, the funny things he \nsaid and did, and they will remember his smile. They will remember that \nhe was a fitness fanatic who practiced kung fu and that he had one of \nthe largest ``Star Wars'' collections in Ohio, a collection including \neverything from action figures to DVDs of the movies themselves. Most \nof all, they will remember the devotion and loyalty Dan had for his \nfamily, for his Special Forces, and for his Nation. Dan dedicated his \nlife to serving our country. His actions have earned him more medals \nand awards than we can list tonight, including the Meritorious Service \nMedal, the Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart.\n  I conclude with words from a statement released by Dan's family. This \nis what Dan's family wrote:\n\n       Dan was proud of the career he built in the Army. He was a \n     loving husband, a dedicated and proud father, and a caring \n     son. He was also a soldier who unwaveringly placed our \n     country before himself. Dan was honored to serve with his \n     fellow soldiers, proud to serve in the United States Army, \n     and grateful to be an American.\n\n  Mr. President, Fran and I will continue to keep the family of SFC \nDaniel B. Crabtree, his wife Kathy, his daughter Mallory, his parents \nRonald and Judy, his brother Bill, and his sister Debbie in our \nthoughts and our prayers.\n\n\n                  Lance Corporal Brian Paul Montgomery\n\n  Mr. President, this evening I would like to pay tribute to my fellow \nOhioan, Marine LCpl Brian Paul Montgomery from Willoughby. On August 1, \n2005, Lance Corporal Montgomery, age 26 at the time, gave his life in \nservice to his country when insurgents in Iraq ambushed his sniper \nunit. He was serving with the Marine Reserve's Third Battalion, 25th \nRegiment from Brook Park, OH.\n  His family and friends will remember him most for his contagious \nsmile and his patriotic sense of duty. His father Paul describes him as \nsomeone who was ``very selfless.'' Everyone who knew Brian agrees that \nhe died doing what he wanted to do, which was serving his country as a \nmember of the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  Brian graduated from South High School in Willoughby in 1998. He then \nwent on to become a political science major at Cleveland State \nUniversity and planned to have a career in law enforcement. At the same \ntime, he was running a small video store in Willoughby with his wife \nPamela.\n  After the terrorist attacks of September 11, Brian strongly felt his \ncountry was calling him to duty, so he joined the Marine Corps Reserves \nthe next year.\n  Brian was close to his younger brother Eric, who had idolized his \nprotective older brother while growing up. As young men, the two would \nbecome something more than brothers--they would become barracks mates \nin Iraq. Eric decided to enlist in the Marines when word started \ncirculating that Brian's unit would be shipping to Iraq. Eric said:\n\n       The first time I saw my brother in his dress blues, I \n     wanted to do this with him. If my brother was going to Iraq, \n     I was going to serve with him.\n\n  In January 2005, Brian and Eric were deployed together in the same \nunit. While at their base camp in Iraq, they would have long talks \nabout the importance of family, country, and service. Brian told Eric \nthat he had a responsibility to their parents to get him home safe. He \nsaid:\n\n       I know you will take care of my wife and son if I don't \n     make it, so I have to get you home.\n\n  No one was more proud than Brian Montgomery to be a marine. His wife \nremembers how he loved to show off his marine tattoos in bars. Brian's \nfriend Lesley Bolden, who worked in his video store, remembers that a \nmarine was something he always wanted to be.\n  In Iraq, even though Brian had been trained as a mortar man, he \nvolunteered for sniper duty. Talking to his\n\n[[Page S11168]]\n\nfather on the phone, however, Brian always downplayed the danger: ``I'm \ngood to go,'' is the most he would say, but his father knew the truth. \n``Keep lying to me, Brian,'' he would say. ``We can talk about it when \nyou get home.''\n  When Brian died, he died alongside five other members of his sniper \nunit. They were really a close-knit group--friends, comrades, and \nbrothers. I would like to share the words of SGT Brian Casagrande, who \nserved with the snipers of the 3-25. This is what he said about Brian:\n\n       I recall on numerous occasions after returning from a \n     mission Brian would find Eric to make sure he was OK. \n     `Monty,' as we called him, would argue a point he didn't even \n     believe, just for the sake of debate.\n\n  After Brian's death, Eric's marine brothers rallied around him in \nsupport. Eric said that:\n\n       From the moment I found out, I couldn't go anywhere without \n     another Marine grabbing me. That was their brother, too.\n\n  Their father Paul remembers how much being a marine meant to Brian. \nHe said:\n\n       Even though we've had a great loss, it's still very \n     comforting to know he was doing something that he believed \n     very deeply in.\n\n  Brian was an outstanding, dedicated, heroic marine. But even more \nimportantly, Brian Montgomery was a loving family man who was devoted \nto his wife and son Alexander. His wife remembers that she knew she was \ngoing to marry him the very day they met. Brian was quite simply the \nlove of her life. She said:\n\n       You never believe in love at first sight until it happens \n     to you.\n\n  Their son was born a few months before Brian was deployed to Iraq and \nmarked his first birthday just 2 days after Brian was killed. Held in \nhis grandfather's arms, he wore his own Marine dress blue uniform to \nBrian's funeral.\n  Brian's wife Pamela says that every day she will tell Alexander about \nhis dad. She went on to say the following:\n\n       I'll just tell him what a great man that Brian was, and \n     he's a hero. What he did for his country, for his family, for \n     every American citizen, we will never forget. He'll be proud \n     of his dad.\n\n  At a church funeral service in Brian's honor, his father remembered \nhow Brian always put others before himself, how as a small boy he had \nrushed to help a 5-year-old friend who had fallen and skinned his knee. \nHe also remembered how the shock of the September 11 terrorist attacks \nprompted Brian to join the Marines. In Paul Montgomery's words, Brian \nsimply ``had a deep conviction that he needed to protect his country.''\n\n  During the funeral, his brother Eric led mourners in a 2-minute \nstanding ovation in Brian's honor. He said that ``Brian will always be \nright here with me, with all of you.''\n  Eric is currently attending the U.S. Naval Academy so he can become a \nMarine officer. In his brother's memory, he got a tatoo that Brian had \nalways wanted. It reads: ``Never left. Never forgotten.''\n  Indeed, Brian Montgomery will never be forgotten. I had the honor of \nattending calling hours for Brian. I was able to meet the family and \nfriends for whom he fought. Brian's stepmother Loren was making a giant \nscrapbook for him when he died. It was filled with the mementos of \nBrian's life. In it is a picture of the January day that he shipped \nout. He is cuddling newborn Alexander. There was a giant smile across \nhis face. As Loren said:\n\n       I never got to finish it for Brian. I will have to finish \n     it for Alexander now.\n\n  In her husband's memory, all Pamela asks is that we support all of \nour servicemembers. She says:\n\n       We need to honor our servicemembers every single day. If \n     you see one, salute them. Or stop in the recruiting office or \n     the VFW and thank them.\n\n  Pretty good advice, Mr. President.\n  Brian Montgomery was a young man with a deep commitment and resolve \nfor service--a young man with an abiding love and dedication to his \nfamily, community, and country. Brian was the model of what we all hope \nour young men and women will become.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep the family of Brian Montgomery in \nour thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                      Lance Corporal Devon Seymour\n\n  Mr. President, this evening I would like to pay tribute to a great \nsoldier and fellow Ohioan, Marine LCpl Devon P. Seymour from St. \nLouisville, who lost his life on July 9, 2005, when an improvised \nexplosive device exploded near his military vehicle in the Al Anbar \nProvince of Iraq. Devon was only 21 years of age at the time.\n  Devon was a young man who always knew that he would one day join the \nmilitary. As a boy, his favorite clothes were khakis and camouflage, \nand he was an avid collector of model airplanes. During high school, he \njoined the Civil Air Patrol Cadet Program and attended National Guard \nsummer camps.\n  His mother Janet says she always knew her son would one day serve his \ncountry in the military. According to her, Devon was more interested in \nmilitary life than he was in sports. She tried to persuade him to join \nthe Air Force or the Army, but he was passionate about being a marine. \nIn her words:\n\n       Devon was a stubborn kid, but he was proud, and I was proud \n     of him. I wish I could tell him that now.\n\n  From an early age, he displayed the dedication and responsibility \nthat would make him an outstanding marine. His father James remembers \nhow determined his son was to get a dog. He recalls:\n\n       Devon wanted a dog, so what he did was he cut pictures out \n     of magazines. Every time you opened a door, there would be a \n     picture of a dog.\n\n  It was that same tenacity Devon brought with him into the military, a \ncareer he loved. As his friends have said, the military was just in his \nblood. His father James was a warrant officer in the Army National \nGuard, and his uncles were military men as well.\n  James said that his son decided to become a marine during his senior \nyear of high school after the terrorist attacks of September 11. He \nbelieved so strongly in the cause that he talked to a recruiter right \nafter 9/11 but was turned away because he was only 17 years of age at \nthe time.\n  ``He took his birth certificate in, but he was too young,'' James \nrecalls. The 17-year-old Devon was told to wait until his birthday that \nNovember.\n  Devon joined the Marines shortly after graduating from Utica High \nSchool in 2002. His decision did not come as a surprise to Timothy \nBarrett, who is the principal at Utica.\n\n       Devon was doing it not because his dad did it, but because \n     it was the right thing to do. I am sure he had pretty strong \n     convictions about being part of the fight in Iraq and helping \n     secure freedom there.\n\n  While waiting to be deployed to Iraq, Devon worked with a tractor \nsupply company in Newark, where he was both a valuable employee and a \njokester. According to the manager Dave Butler, he ``soon blossomed \ninto a treasured and dedicated employee.''\n  Devon was deployed to Iraq in February of 2005 and was assigned to \nthe Weapons Company, 3rd Battalion, 25th Marines, out of Akron, OH. He \nwas placed on active duty just 8 months after his father James returned \nfrom having served in Afghanistan.\n  Before leaving, Devon talked to a friend, retired school teacher Ron \nThompson. Ron remembers the final conversation very well, and this is \nwhat Ron said:\n\n       What was going on seemed to be the right thing, and Devon \n     thought he was prepared. He knew it was a job that had to be \n     done. He always struck me as that kind of person--always \n     doing the right thing. I was very proud of him.\n\n  From Iraq, Devon often called Dave Butler at the Tractor Supply \nCompany and other coworkers. According to Dave, Devon never complained. \nIn fact, the day before he was killed, he called his mother to wish her \nwell after her birthday. Janet said he told her about a fierce \nsandstorm and that conditions were bad. But he also defended the \nmission. ``He believed in the cause,'' she recalled. During the phone \ncall, he also assured his mother that he was fine. ``Don't worry, \nMom,'' he said. ``But I've seen a lot.''\n  His mother also remembers that he believed in what he was doing. This \nis how she explained his dedication:\n\n       Before Devon left, he said that the Iraqi people had been \n     bullied around and didn't have anyone to stand up for them. \n     He said that was their job, to stand up for them, and he was \n     there to do it.\n\n  Janet added:\n\n       He was one of the good and decent people willing to help \n     somebody. He was certainly worth knowing.\n\n  Devon is missed by all who knew and loved him. His community rallied\n\n[[Page S11169]]\n\naround his family as well as the families of the other marines who were \nkilled alongside him. ``His death was a tragic loss,'' said his former \nprincipal, Timothy Barrett. ``When it's one of your own, it hits home a \nlittle closer. This is the first one from our high school to be killed \nin service. It gives you a deeper appreciation for freedom when it is \none of your own who paid the ultimate price.''\n  Mr. President, Devon's father James remembers the fine young man his \nson became. ``He was a good kid,'' he said. ``He was very proud to be a \nMarine. And, I should say, we were very proud of him.''\n  The world is a better place because Devon lived in it. A young man \nwith a great sense of compassion, a tremendous dedication to his \nfamily, community, and country, he is missed by all who knew and loved \nhim.\n\n\n             Machinist's Mate Second Class Joseph A. Ashley\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fellow Ohioan and a brave \nseaman--Machinist's Mate 2nd Class Joseph Allen Ashley, from \nManchester. Machinist's Mate Ashley died on January 9, 2005, when the \nnuclear submarine he was serving on--the USS San Francisco--collided \nwith an undersea mountain. He was 24 years old. He is survived by his \nparents Vicki and Daniel Ashley, and two brothers Daniel Jr. and \nBenjamin.\n  Joey--as family and friends called him--attended Manchester High \nSchool where he was a percussionist in the marching band and a member \nof the Boy Scouts. Joey always had a huge smile on his face when he was \non the field beating his drums. Those who knew him remember that \nbeaming smile most and how he loved being in the spotlight.\n  ``[Joey] liked to stand out in a crowd,'' said his brother Benjamin. \n``Dan and I are the quiet ones. Joseph would more likely do the talking \nfor us both.''\n  His brother Dan Jr. remembers that Joey thought of himself as a \n``good ol' Southern country boy,'' swaggering about in cowboy hat and \nboots. Joey even modeled the horn on his green jeep from his favorite \nT.V. show--The Dukes of Hazzard. When he honked, the song ``Dixie'' \nblared loudly enough to announce his presence all across town.\n  Everyone always knew when Joey was around. Once, when he was \nstationed overseas, his father Dan honked the horn to see if it still \nworked. Before Dan knew it, people were calling him to see if his son \nwas home.\n  After high school, Joey attended Stark State College of Technology \nfor a year and took welding classes. He passed both the welding \ncertification exams and the Navy entrance test in 2001. His father Dan \nhad served 8 years in the Navy, and his mother Vicki remembers how \nexcited Joey was to follow in his dad's footsteps. When he signed up, \nhe told her, ``Mom I passed the Navy test; I'm going to do what daddy \ndid.'' According to his mom, Joey ``always excelled in what he did.''\n  Joey was planning a career in the Navy, the service he loved. He made \nhis rank in minimal time, and his enthusiasm and ability earned him the \nJunior Sailor of the Year Award at the Guam Naval base. His crewmates \nnoticed his obvious talent for repairing machinery and his affinity for \nThe Dukes of Hazzard, and gave him the nickname ``Cooter,'' after the \nshow's mechanic.\n  Family was incredibly important to Joey. He frequently called home to \ncheck up on his parents and brothers and to let them know he was doing \nokay. He often swapped stories with his grandfather, who had also been \nstationed in the South Pacific during his time with the United States \nArmy in WWII. During each phone call, Joey always made it a point to \ntell his family how much he loved them. That's simply the kind of \nperson he was.\n  His faith was also important to Joey, and he found a church to attend \nwherever he was based. In Ohio, he was a member of both the Canal \nFulton Baptist Church and the Akron Baptist Temple, and frequented \nother churches in the area, as well. And wherever he was, he had a \nsmile for everyone he met.\n  Joey's mother describes her son with the following words:\n\n       When he had his heart set on something, he would try his \n     best to get it done. I always told him to do what he wanted \n     in life, but to be the best at it and to always try his \n     hardest.\n\n  Joey did, indeed, achieve his best, and lived his life to the \nfullest. The day he died, his family lost a loving son and the Navy \nlost a brave sailor. He was an excellent submariner, and a valued \nmember of what is a truly unique brotherhood. The moment Joey earned \nhis dolphin pin--which symbolized his fitness to serve on a submarine--\nhe joined an elite family of explorers and warriors--our Navy's \nsubmariners.\n  When I think about Joey and his service and dedication to our \ncountry, I am reminded of words that Sir Winston Churchill once said:\n\n       Of all the branches of men in the forces, there is none \n     which shows more devotion and faces grimmer perils than the \n     submariners.\n\n  Certainly, Joseph Ashley was the embodiment of those words. He was a \nbrave sailor, devoted to his family, the Navy, and our Nation. He will \nnever be forgotten. Family, friends, and fellow submariners from around \nthe world have recognized his passing by leaving comments on his \nInternet tribute page. There are literally hundreds. The following \nwords come from one of these tributes, written by a crewmate of Joey's \non the USS San Francisco:\n\n       . . . I am completely honored to have served with such a \n     great man, a loving person, a hardworking individual, and \n     especially a friend. He has touched my soul, as well the rest \n     of the crew, forever.\n\n  Joey's father said that his son died doing what he loved--serving his \ncountry. ``This is what he wanted to do,'' he said.\n  Joey was buried next to his great-grandfather and namesake, who had \nalso been a veteran. At the funeral, the Dixie horn on his green jeep \nplayed one last time for him.\n  Joey left a lasting impression on all who knew him. No one was a \nstranger to him. His crewmates will remember his ``wicked Michael \nJackson'' impersonation--which one friend describes as ``moonwalking in \ncowboy boots.'' Manchester High School has established a scholarship in \nhis honor. And most important, his family will always remember his \nsmile, his warmth, and his enthusiasm.\n  I conclude by sharing the words of Reverend Dallas R. Billington, who \nspoke at Joey's funeral. Here is what he said:\n\n       I want you to know what Joey has done for you. He gave his \n     life so you can live in freedom.\n\n  Machinist's Mate 2nd Class Joseph Ashley served for us in foreign \nwaters and patrolled our shores to keep us safe. We will remember him \nalways.\n  My wife Fran and I will continue to keep Joey's family and friends in \nour thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                    Sergeant David R. Christoff, Jr.\n\n  Mr. President, tonight I rise to pay tribute to a fallen hero who \ngave his life in service to this Nation--Marine Corps Sgt David Russell \nChristoff, Jr. from Rossford, OH. Sergeant Christoff was killed in Iraq \non May 22, 2006, from wounds he received when a roadside bomb exploded \nwhile he was on foot patrol. He was 25 years old.\n  David Christoff was deeply devoted to our country. During his time in \nthe Marines, he had toured the world with assignments in Australia, \nThailand, Korea, Kuwait, and the Marshall Islands. At the time of his \ndeath, he was serving his second tour of duty in Iraq.\n  David had distinguished himself during his first deployment to Iraq, \nearning himself three commendation medals and the Purple Heart. One \nday, the young marine had been walking behind a truck full of troops \nwhen a roadside bomb went off. David's step-father, Jim, said that ``he \nrisked his life quite a bit to pull a number of people away.''\n  David had also fought bravely through the Fallujah streets and was \nawarded a Purple Heart during his first tour for the shrapnel wounds he \nreceived during that battle. Despite these awards and honors, David \nnever wavered in his desire to continue serving his country. He always \nfelt that there was more he could do.\n  After returning to Ohio on leave in February 2005, David decided to \nleave his company--which was headed to Afghanistan--so that he could \njoin one that was going to Iraq--and that was the Hawaii-based 3rd \nBattalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division. David simply \ncouldn't wait to return to the job he had been doing in the Middle \nEast.\n\n[[Page S11170]]\n\n  His mother Amy remembers that David believed he was making a positive \ndifference. He felt a sense of duty to use his combat experience to \ntrain younger marines, as others had done for him. Amy said, ``They \nwere there to help train him, and he wanted to be there for the younger \nMarines, also.''\n  A 1999 graduate of Shawnee High School--where he played golf and was \na media center aid--David was a hero to those who knew him. The day \nafter the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, he left his job in \nconstruction and enlisted in the Marines. Like countless other brave \nindividuals, he felt compelled to help our Nation. He died doing what \nhis family said he loved--and that was defending his country.\n  David's faith in the Marines was as great as his faith in America. \nHis grandmother Ann remembers this about David:\n\n       David was very smart and got good grades and worked his way \n     up to sergeant very quickly in the Marines. He was always so \n     sure that was what he was supposed to be and that was what he \n     was supposed to be doing. He thought as long as the Marines \n     were over there fighting we could all sleep good at home.\n\n  Bob Willman, a former Clark-Shawnee Superintendent, remembers David \nas a young man who was well-spoken, liked, and respected. It didn't \nsurprise him that David joined the Marines. He said that ``David was \nloyal to his family, to his classmates, to his school, and obviously, \nto his country.''\n  When David enlisted, he made his intentions clear to his family. \n``After 9/11, he wanted to protect everyone,'' said his aunt Bethann. \nAnd his father David Sr. said that therefore ``the only thing he could \ndo was join the military. He does things all the way.''\n  Students, friends, and family all have such fond memories of David \ngrowing up. He love playing golf and also liked all kinds of music--rap \nwhen he was younger and classic rock most recently. He had big plans \nfor his future, hoping for a career in law enforcement. But, after the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, he knew that his career could wait. \nHis country simply needed him more.\n  I would like to share David's own words, from a 2002 interview with \nThe Toledo Blade. This is what he said:\n\n       I don't want my brother and sister to live in fear. I want \n     to fight and defend the greatest country in the world.\n\n  David truly was a hero to his family. He was given leave to fly home \nin February 2005--and ended up saving his father's life by driving him \nto the hospital when David Sr. was suffering a heart attack. ``He came \nhome to save my life,'' his father said. ``Just having him here [safe] \nand not in Iraq saved my life.''\n  David was a hero to his fellow Marines, as well. Corporal J.J. \nAguirre, a fellow marine and friend, remembers what the marines in \nDavid's squadron had to say about the young sergeant: ``The guys would \nbe like, `Man, I'd follow that guy anywhere. If he said lay down here \nand open a field of fire with no cover, I'd do it.'''\n  SGT Hector Zelaya remembers that he found a brother in David--not \njust a friend:\n\n       I've been through everything with him, from the beginning \n     of boot camp to (school of infantry), from the Philippines \n     and Korea and Thailand to Fallujah. He's my little brother. \n     He was a true leader, and he had the confidence to stand \n     alone.\n\n  Branden Skabla was David's best friend--they called themselves \n``brothers from different mothers,'' and David was the godfather to \nBranden's son. The boys had grown up together and decided to join the \nMarines on the very same day. It was a day Branden will never forget. \nThey were working a construction job together when the news of the \nSeptember 11 attacks reached them. The young men looked at each other, \nand simply knew that their country needed them.\n  Branden will never forget his friend. ``It can't be real, but I know \nit is,'' he said. ``I keep waiting for that phone call from him to tell \nme that he's coming home. I'll be waiting for that phone call for the \nrest of my life.'''\n  Branden was with David's father when David's belongings arrived. \nIncluded were two letters, one to each of David's parents. In the \nletters, he asked family and friends to pray for those still serving \nour country overseas.\n  David was buried with full military honors in Arlington Cemetery. \nThere was also a service in his honor in Ohio. At that service, David's \nparents were each presented with a Purple Heart medal. David, who \njoined the Marine Corps in 2001, had been awarded eight medals during \nhis time in the Marines.\n  David Christoff, Jr. was a young man with a sincere dedication to our \ncountry, a compassion for others, and a love of life and liberty. He \ndeeply believed in America, in his fellow Marines, and in his family. \nHe was motivated by a single desire--the wish to protect those he loved \nmost.\n  My wife Fran and I will continue to keep David's father, David Sr., \nhis mother and step-father Amy and Jim Hogan, his brother Michael, and \nhis sister Lauren in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                     Master Sergeant Robert H. West\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow Ohioan--Army \nMSG Robert H. West from Elyria. Master Sergeant West was killed in \nBaghdad on May 14, 2006, when an improvised explosive device detonated \nnear his armored vehicle. He was serving with the 1st Battalion, 312th \nRegiment, 4th Brigade, 78th Division, based at Fort Bragg, North \nCarolina. He was 37 years old.\n  Master Sergeant West is survived by his wife Jeannie and their \ndaughter Shelby, his mother Mary Heaton, and many loving aunts, uncles, \nand cousins.\n  Bobby--as he was known by family and friends--dedicated his life to \ntraining the young soldiers who would follow in his footsteps. When he \nwas killed, he was serving his second tour of duty in Iraq and was \nhelping train the new Iraqi police force. He had volunteered for the \ndeployment because he felt his country needed him and because the \nmilitary was a job he loved and wanted to do well. According to his \naunt Bonnie, Bobby believed strongly that he had the experience and \nknow-how needed to train Iraqi police officers. ``He wasn't afraid,'' \nremembers Nora Hudson, another aunt of Bobby's. ``He said, `I'm a \ntrained professional, it'll be all right.' ''\n  Bobby graduated from Elyria Catholic High School in 1987, where he \nplayed on the legendary 1984 state championship football team. He was \nalso involved in choir, baseball, and the ski club.\n  Lou Rotunda, Bobby's former basketball coach at Elyria Catholic, \ndescribed him as ``a quiet, great kid. He was just a fantastic \nperson.''\n  After graduating, Bobby enlisted in the Army in 1988. He was \noriginally assigned to the armored cavalry. From there, he served for 6 \nyears as drill instructor. Later, he transferred back to cavalry and \nserved as a tank commander during his first deployment to Iraq in 2003 \nand 2004. A member of a Division experienced in training Army \nreservists, Bobby then returned to Iraq for a second deployment to help \ntrain the new Iraqi police force.\n  Bobby loved the camaraderie of Army life. Sergeant 1st Class Gerry \nGalloway, who was traveling with Bobby when the fatal attack occurred, \nhad first met him several years ago at Fort Knox in Kentucky. In his \nwords, Bobby was a ``great NCO, great leader, good decision-maker, \n[and] good friend. I would follow him anywhere.''\n  Joseph McFarlane, who served with Bobby, wrote the following about \nhim in an email message posted to an Internet tribute Web site:\n\n       Thank you, Bobby, for being a great mentor, peer, and most \n     of all, friend. It hurts me as I write this message and my \n     prayers go out to your loved ones left behind. You have \n     impacted so many young men in your service to this nation. A \n     true Hero, I will miss you always.\n\n  When Bobby was killed, he was riding in a humvee, alongside 45-year-\nold CWO John W. Engeman, who was also killed in the attack. The two men \nwere close and had been good friends ever since meeting 3 years prior. \nBoth deployed voluntarily.\n  ``They loved what they did, and they were good at it,'' said Bobby's \nwife Jeannie, speaking of the devotion both men felt for the Army and \nfor their country--a devotion that was just in their blood. According \nto Donna, John Engeman's wife, ``It's just what they did. They were \njust very quiet and very privately dedicated to what they did.''\n  Fort Bragg's Main Post Chapel held a memorial service in memory of \nboth Bobby and John. Over 200 mourners attended--most of them soldiers \nwearing\n\n[[Page S11171]]\n\nthe lightning patch of the 78th Division on their uniforms.\n  Bobby enjoyed many things, including football, golf, hunting, and \nother sports. He had plans of someday possibly becoming a county \nsheriff's deputy. The most important thing in his life, though, was \nalways his family. He loved spending time with his loved ones. He \nmarried Jeannie--the love of his life--in 1989. His mother Mary, in the \nwords of his Aunt Bonnie, ``was gold to him.'' And to Bonnie, herself, \nand her children, Bobby was like a son and a brother. She said,\n\n       We had a special bond, and it grew stronger through the \n     years. No matter how many times he was in and out, he always \n     gave me a big bear hug and a kiss.\n\n  Bobby was close to his cousins, as well. John Shreve, Jr., wrote the \nfollowing about his cousin:\n\n       Bobby brightened every life he touched. You were much more \n     than a cousin to me. You will be greatly missed by all. You \n     are my hero.\n\n  Bobby's family remembers him as a funny guy, whose off-hand comments \nand sunny disposition could brighten even the worst mood. ``People were \ndrawn to him, especially kids,'' said his Aunt Tammi. ``They wouldn't \nleave him alone!''\n  Those who knew Bobby describe him as someone who could make you laugh \nuntil you cried--until your cheeks hurt. He loved his family and he \nloved being a soldier. His colleagues will always remember his \nfriendship, his experience, and his sense of humor. Bobby was a mentor \nto many soldiers and drill sergeants throughout his life and has \ninfluenced countless young men and women in their service to our \nNation.\n  Because of his courage and leadership, Master Sergeant West was a \ntrue hero to all who knew him. He was a man who lived his life with \ngreat love for and commitment to his family and friends--a man who \ndedicated his life to protecting others. With his actions, Bobby truly \nmade this world a better place.\n  My wife Fran and I will continue to keep the family of MSG Robert H. \nWest in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                     Specialist Anthony D. Kinslow\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow Ohioan--Army \nSpecialist Anthony D. Kinslow, from Westerville, who died on June 13, \n2005, when his military vehicle came under attack in Iraq. He was \nserving with the 2nd Battalion, 17th Field Artillery Regiment, 2nd \nBrigade, 2nd Infantry Division from Fort Carson, Colorado. He was 21 \nyears old.\n  Anthony was a young man liked and respected by all who knew him. He \nattended Big Walnut High School, where he was in Roy Merchant's \nmythology class. Roy remembers Anthony as a good student, always quiet \nand polite. And Anthony's friends and family describe him as gentle, \nbookish, and gentlemanly.\n  He was kind--someone who was always considerate of others. His was a \ncalming presence, some have said. According to his mother Kathleen, the \nonly time she ever saw him intense was when he was writing.\n  A family friend remembers the type of good, hard-working person that \nAnthony was. As she put it, ``he was a very kind, nice person. He \nworked through high school. Some of the nicest seem to be the ones who \ngo.''\n  Anthony had strong ties in his community, where his grandfather had \nbuilt the house where he lived. Neighbors say that some members of \nAnthony's family had lived there for at least 40 years.\n  Anthony graduated high school in 2002 and enlisted in the Army in May \n2004. He was first stationed in South Korea, where he saw the rain and \nlightning of the monsoon season. He was then redeployed to Kuwait and \nthen shortly afterward to Iraq.\n  Before being deployed to Iraq, Anthony had worked in the local Waffle \nHouse restaurant. It was here that he met his girlfriend Nichole. \nAlthough no date had been set, the two were planning on getting married \nwhen Anthony's deployment was finished. Heather Potts recalls that \nAnthony was always sending Nichole flowers while he was home--sometimes \nfour times a week. She said, ``Our living and dining room and kitchen \nwere always filled with flowers.''\n  Heather wrote and sang a song entitled ``Come Back to Me'' for \nAnthony when he returned home on leave in January 2005. She said, ``I \nwas so scared he wouldn't come back.''\n  Anthony was very close to his family. He adored his brothers and \nsisters, while growing up, and cradled his nieces and nephews as an \nadult. As his mother said, ``We all thought that when he passed away, \nhow sad it was that he wouldn't have children.''\n  Anthony was completely devoted to his family and friends. Whenever \nthey needed him, he was simply there for them. This same selfless \ndevotion characterized his service in Iraq. One of his Army comrades \nwrote the following to Anthony on an Internet tribute website:\n\n       You were my friend and brother through thick and thin. You \n     were always there for me when I needed a hand. We had many \n     great times over the last year, regardless of the \n     circumstances. I miss you much already, and I only wish you \n     were here now.\n\n  Another soldier from Ohio died along with Anthony on June 13, 2005--\nand that was SGT Larry Kuhns from Austintown. Sergeant Kuhns' sister \nSarah left the following message on that same Internet tribute Web \nsite:\n\n       My brother Sergeant Larry Kuhns served with Anthony, and \n     they both fell together. Ever since that day, I have felt \n     lost and alone. I am truly sorry for your loss. My brother \n     talked about Kinslow and thought he was a brave man. My heart \n     goes out to all of you.\n\n  At Anthony's funeral, BG Albert Bryan described him as ``first and \nforemost a soldier.'' He went on to say:\n\n       Specialist Kinslow, in choosing to be a soldier, chose a \n     life of service over personal fulfillment . . . to provide \n     for the greater community rather than to seek out those \n     things that lead to personal gain.\n\n  At the same service, the Reverend James Walter called Anthony a \n``peacemaker.''\n  Anthony's mother remembers her son's bravery when he departed for \nIraq. She wrote Anthony a letter after his death, which was read by a \nfriend during his funeral. Her words describe Anthony as stoically \nturning to board the plane that would take him back to the \nbattlefields. She wrote, ``I marveled at your immense strength and \nbravery.''\n  Anthony will be remembered and deeply missed by all who knew him. He \nwas a kind, loving man who served his country selflessly. In the end, \nhowever, the best words to honor him belong to his mother. She said \nthis about her beloved son:\n\n       You were one of the brightest lights of my life, and I know \n     you will shine down on us from heaven. I will always love \n     you, tons, bushels, and spoonfuls.\n\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Army SPC Anthony D. Kinslow's \nfamily--his mother Kathleen, his father and step-mother A. Scott and \nJulia Kinslow, his sisters Emily, Mary, and Lucie Kinslow; his brothers \nPeter Kinslow and PFC Owen Kinslow, and his step-sister Kelli Vanover--\nin our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n          LANCE CORPORAL EDWARD AUGUST ``AUGIE'' SCHROEDER II\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fellow Ohioan--Marine LCpl \nEdward Schroeder II, who died on August 3, 2005, when a roadside bomb \nexploded by his vehicle in Iraq. He was 23 years old.\n  The son of Paul Schroeder and Rosemary Palmer and the brother of \nAmanda Schroeder, Lance Corporal Schroeder's middle name was August, \nand to family and friends he was known simply as ``Augie.'' Born in \nColumbus, he and his family lived in China during his pre-school years \nbefore moving to New Jersey, where he graduated from Columbia High \nSchool in 2000.\n  Augie's father remembers his son as a young man of great promise, \nwith an ``easy charm and readiness to help.'' Indeed, Augie was the \ntype of person whom we can all admire. At Columbia High, he was a \nmember of the swim team and lacrosse team. During his free time, he \nwould go door-to-door collecting food for needy families and was a \nmember of a church outreach program that painted run-down homes, built \nwheelchair ramps, and repaired roofs. He also passed the qualifications \ntest to become an emergency medical technician and served on two \nemergency squads. A friend from his church outreach program remembers \nthat Augie was simply the kind of person everyone should strive to be.\n  Augie's mother Rosemary recalls that ``he just liked to help \npeople.'' And sister says that Augie ``was a hero before he died--not \njust because he went to Iraq. I was proud of him before.''\n\n[[Page S11172]]\n\n  After graduating from high school, Augie followed family tradition \nand enrolled at The Ohio State University, while his family moved to \nCleveland. Augie studied criminal justice at OSU and was a member of \nthe Phi Kappa Theta fraternity. His fraternity brothers remember that \nhe loved to hang out in the fraternity house, sipping beers and talking \nabout Buckeyes football.\n  Augie began thinking of joining the Marines after the terrorist \nattacks of September 11. He enlisted in 2002. Augie wanted to serve his \ncountry and felt that the Marines was simply the best way for him to do \nthat.\n  Mr. President, Augie is remembered most of all for his wonderful \nsense of humor. His mother describes him as a boy of contrasts--he \ncould be somber, but he also had a good sense of fun. Friends and \nfamily still laugh over his many jokes and pranks.\n  For example, Augie's pre-school once held an event where the kids \nwere told to dress in a manner highlighting their heritage. Augie \nshowed up wearing a pair of lederhosen. He pulled them way up and told \neveryone that he was the German cousin of the famous television \ncharacter Steve Urkel and then did a perfect imitation.\n  Augie kept his sense of humor throughout school. Once, during a \nmiddle school talent show, he performed as an inept magician, who, \nalong with his dummy partner, fumbled all his tricks.\n  And, Augie never lacked ideas for humorous Halloween costumes. He \nshowed up at one Halloween party dressed as Tonya Harding, wearing a \nfigure-skating outfit and carrying a lead pipe. Another legendary \ncostume involved four fingers, a thumb, and a T-shirt lettered ``L.A. \nEvidence Room'' and ``one size fits all.'' He was the infamous bloody \nglove from the O.J. Simpson case.\n  Augie's mother said that she always thought that he would eventually \nbecome either a police officer or a stand-up comic--she just didn't \nknow which.\n  Rosemary also remembers that being part of a team was incredibly \nimportant to Augie. Whether growing up in China--where collaborative \nwork is stressed--or playing on his many sports teams in New Jersey, \nAugie was always someone who believed in working with others toward a \ngreater goal. He loved to participate on the football, soccer, \nbaseball, lacrosse, and swimming teams. He was simply a person who \nbelieved in placing teamwork before individual gain. ``Some people are \njust on that wavelength and that was Augie,'' his mother said.\n  Augie's belief in the importance of teamwork is reflected in the work \nhe did while growing up and as a young man. At different times, he \nworked as an emergency medical technician, a lifeguard, a Boy Scout, a \nchurch youth counselor at Camp Glen Gray, and a marine. Along the way, \nhe made a positive impact on every life he touched.\n  Augie was a young man of great maturity and compassion. Maralynn \nFahey, a church youth group leader, describes him as a ``selfless'' \nteenager. She particularly remembers his help during food collections. \nShe said, ``Dropping 500 bags in the neighborhood was a real effort, \nand that was something Augie was willing to do.''\n  An anonymous author once wrote, ``How lucky I am to have known \nsomeone who was so hard to say goodbye to.'' No better words reflect \nthe sentiments of those who knew and loved Augie Schroeder. His desire \nand willingness to help others--even those he didn't know--endeared him \nto all. He was simply a great friend and model citizen.\n  Augie's fraternity brother Brian Cox said the following at his \nfriend's funeral:\n\n       With Augie, there were no enemies--only friends. He was put \n     on Earth for a reason. Augie was, is, and always will be my \n     hero. \n     [ . . . ] There are very few people of whom you can truly say \n     [they] never let you down--whom you can call a best friend.\n\n  During his funeral, Reverend Charles Yoost also remembered the many \nlives Augie had touched. He said that ``it doesn't seem possible to \nbelieve that Augie is gone. His brief life made some of us more \nthoughtful people.''\n  His mother remembers that Augie was always asking what was out there. \nHe wanted to experience everything he could. His approach to life was \nsimple--``Let me try.''\n  Augie was a man who lived life to its fullest. He was a devoted \nfriend, son, brother, and soldier. His sense of humor brightened \nothers' days and his generosity and strength of spirit were an \ninspiration to all who knew him.\n  Augie's family and friends will never forget the young man who \nbrought so much joy to their lives. He was an individual who understood \nthe importance of honor and integrity, who believed in loving and \nrespecting his family, and who knew the importance of serving one's \ncommunity.\n  I am honored to speak about him today.\n  My wife Fran and I will continue to keep the family of Augie \nSchroeder in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                      SERGEANT BENJAMIN J. LAYMON\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to remember a fallen soldier, who gave \nhis life while serving our Nation in Iraq--Army Sgt Benjamin J. Laymon, \nfrom Mount Vernon, OH. On June 24, 2006, Sergeant Laymon died during \nfoot patrol when a roadside bomb exploded. He was 22 years old.\n  Ben, as family and friends called him, was a good-natured jokester, \nwho loved to pull pranks and make others laugh. Those who knew him best \ndescribed him as the light in the room, and his family called him \n``Gentle Ben'' because of his deeply caring nature. ``He was so sweet \nand considerate,'' remembers his mother Gale. And according to his \nstep-father David, Ben ``was the type of kid who would call if he was \ngoing to be late because he didn't want you to worry.''\n  As a boy, Ben would often visit a 72-acre farm belonging to his aunt \nand uncle Shirley and Richard Laymon. He was always a welcome visitor. \nShirley said that ``Ben was one of the sweetest, most thoughtful \npersons you'd ever want to know. He was so sweet, cared about \neverybody, and cared about his country.''\n  Ben attended Mount Vernon High School, where he proudly wore No. 73 \non the football field for the Yellow Jackets. His former football \ncoach, Scott Spitler, wasn't surprised at all when he learned that Ben \nhad decided to enlist in the Army. ``He was just a very hard worker and \nvery caring,'' Scott said. ``Ben was the type of kid who was willing to \ndo anything that he could to help his teammates, to better himself, and \nto better his team.''\n  Ben's former teammate, Chad Biddle, remembers the positive impression \nBen always made. ``He was the type of guy everyone got along with,'' \nChad said. ``He was always the center of attention, even when he wasn't \ntrying to be. He was just an all-around, down-to-earth good guy.''\n  Ben's close friend, Jessica Frazee, also recalls his great sense of \nhumor and his compassion for others:\n\n       Ben was the class clown. He liked to laugh. He was the kind \n     of friend who could make all of your troubles go away. He \n     always put people in front of himself, always listening to \n     what everyone else had to say. He is everybody's hero. He \n     just wanted you to be happy.\n\n  Ben's sense of humor truly was legendary at Mount Vernon High School. \nHe would often dress up in funny costumes to attend basketball games, \nand once even convinced his friend Joey Armstrong to go with him \ndressed as hunters in bright orange hats with ear flaps. ``He was \nalways making everyone laugh,'' Joey remembers. ``He was hysterical. . \n. . He was my best friend--the best friend anyone could ever have.''\n  Ben's childhood dream was to become a soldier. He simply knew what he \nwanted to do. As his brother Andy said during his funeral, ``Few people \nat Ben's age knew what they wanted to do with their lives. But Ben did. \nHe had goals and plans. He gave the Army 110 percent, and for that, I \nam so proud of you Ben.''\n  Ben enlisted in the Army in September 2002 and began serving his \nfirst tour of duty in Iraq in 2003. His second tour began in November \n2005. Family friend, Dick Shafer, remembers how excited Ben was about \nwhat he was doing--about how he believed in what he was doing and would \nwrite often of the good he saw happening in Iraq.\n  And, Ben's family remembers that he liked being in Iraq because of \nthe challenges and the freedom to do his job. After his tour finished, \nhe was hoping to become a SWAT officer in the Columbus police \ndepartment.\n  Ben was dedicated not only to serving his country, but also to the \nfamily he loved so very much. His sense of\n\n[[Page S11173]]\n\nhumor and love of laughter made him most popular with his six young \nnieces and nephews. His mother Gale particularly remembers the love Ben \nhad for kids. She said: I always thought he would be a great teacher \nfor younger children.\n  Even while in Iraq, Ben wanted to keep his family happy. When calling \nor emailing, he was always more concerned about them than himself. His \nmother remembers the very words he always said--``Don't worry, I'll be \nfine.''\n  Those who knew Ben remembered his rich life during his funeral at the \nFirst Christian Church. Reverend Jamie Gump said that Ben lived a full \nlife but died too soon for those who loved him. Reverend Gump also read \na letter from Ben's mother, in which she wrote: I miss you so much and \nlong to see your face.\n  At the service, MG David Huntoon presented Ben's parents with their \nson's Purple Heart and Bronze Star, and said:\n\n       Sergeant Laymon was part of the 10th Cavalry, a proud \n     outfit that has seen many heroes. His mission required \n     courage and compassion. It was clear to the United States \n     Army that he was an outstanding leader.\n\n  Ben's death has been a loss to his entire community. His friends and \nneighbors will never forget him. Kathy Blair knew both Ben and his \nfamily. ``I'm feeling great sadness, unbelievable sadness,'' she said. \nBeth Totman also knew Ben. ``He was a super-nice guy, so kind and fun \nto be around,'' she said. ``He always seemed to have a smile on his \nface.''\n  Ben brought joy and laughter to all who knew him. I would like to \nconclude with the words of one of Ben's fellow soldiers, a young man \nnamed Pete, who was with Ben when the roadside bomb exploded. This is \nwhat Pete said:\n\n       I'm going to miss him so much. He was a great friend. He \n     could make me laugh at the worst possible times in my life. \n     Even now, I look back on the stuff he did and laugh.\n       Ben will always be remembered. His compassion and positive \n     attitude were truly rare, and he simply brightened the lives \n     of all who knew him. My wife Fran and I will continue to keep \n     Ben's father and step-mother James and Kathy Laymon his \n     mother and step-father Gale and David Harstine, and his \n     brothers Trevor, Curt, and Andrew in our thoughts and in our \n     prayers.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     CORPORAL NICHOLAS A. ARVANITIS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to U.S. \nArmy CPL Nicholas A. Arvanitis of Salem, NH. On October 6, 2006, this \nbrave 22-year old paratrooper gave his life for his Nation while \nengaged in combat operations with enemy forces near Bayji, Iraq. \nCorporal Arvanitis had been stationed in Iraq since August 2006, \nserving as a squadron leader assigned to Company C, 1st Battalion, \n505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division, Ft. Bragg, \nNC.\n  Nicholas, or ``Nick'' to family and friends, grew up in Salem, NH, \nand was a 2003 graduate of Salem High School. He was a member of the \nwrestling team and played guitar in the jazz band and sousaphone in the \nmarching band. Friends remember him as a team player, who got along \nwith everyone and was always smiling.\n  Nick joined the U.S. Army in August 2003 because he wanted to protect \nhis country and his family. Friends and family said he loved his \ncountry, wanted to defend it, and sensed a call to duty. He completed \nInfantry One Station Unit Training at Fort Benning, GA, in December \n2003 and the Basic Airborne Course in January 2004. He reported to Fort \nBragg, NC, in March 2004 and was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division \nin April 2004. Corporal Arvanitis deployed to Afghanistan in the fall \nof 2004 in support of the Afghan elections and deployed to Iraq in July \n2006 as a member of 3rd Brigade Combat Team in support of Operation \nIraqi Freedom.\n  Corporal Arvanitis' awards and decorations include the Bronze Star \nMedal, Purple Heart, Army Commendation Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, \nNational Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on \nTerrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, \nArmy Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, Combat Infantryman Badge, \nParachutist's Badge, and Expert Weapons Qualification Badge.\n  Patriots from the State of New Hampshire have served our Nation with \nhonor and distinction from Bunker Hill to Bayji--and U.S. Army CPL \nNicholas Arvanitis served and fought in that same fine tradition.\n  My sympathy, condolences, and prayers go out to Nick's maternal \ngrandparents Leonard and Rita, his parents Maureen and Richard, his \nsister Kimberly, and to his other family members and many friends who \nhave suffered this most grievous loss. All will sorely miss Nicholas \nArvanitis, the forgiving young man with a heart of gold, the patriot \nwho always thought of his family and friends, the courageous and \noutstanding paratrooper who served our Nation with distinction and \nhonor. In the words of Daniel Webster, may his remembrance be as long \nlasting as the land he honored. God bless Nicholas A. Arvanitis.\n\n\n                     Lance Corporal Michael Scholl\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof U.S. Marine LCpl Michael Scholl of Nebraska. Lance Corporal Scholl \ndied from wounds suffered in combat operations in Iraq's Al Anbar \nProvince.\n  Lance Corporal Scholl was from Lincoln, NE. A 2002 graduate of \nLincoln High School, he was originally denied enlistment with the \nMarines. But with persistence, Lance Corporal Scholl received a medical \nwaiver and became a marine in 2003.\n  While stationed in Hawaii, Lance Corporal Scholl met his future wife \nMelissa. The couple were married a day before he was deployed to \nAfghanistan. He served in Afghanistan from summer 2005 to January 2006. \nWithin a month of his return, he and Melissa were expecting a baby. On \nOctober 11, 2006, only a few weeks after Lance Corporal Scholl was \ndeployed to Iraq, Melissa gave birth to Addison Rose Scholl. Although \nhe never met his daughter, Lance Corporal Scholl was a proud father. He \nreceived pictures of her while he was in Iraq and also recorded stories \nfor her to hear as she grew. Thousands of brave men and women like \nLance Corporal Scholl are serving in Iraq.\n  In addition to his wife and daughter, Lance Corporal Scholl is \nsurvived by his father Steven Scholl of Friend, NE, and his mother \nDebora Chandler of Lincoln, NE.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring LCpl \nMichael Scholl.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11173-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11173-S11174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING SENIOR MASTER SERGEANT MICHAEL L. LEMKE\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to recognize airman SMSgt \nMichael L. Lemke, stationed at Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in \nCheyenne, WY. Senior Master Sergeant Lemke was selected as one of the \nAir Force's 12 Outstanding Airmen for 2006. The award is based on his \nsuperior leadership, job performance, and personal achievements.\n  The Air Force honors the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year at the \nannual Air Force Association's Air and Space Conference and Technology \nExposition in September. Over 352,000 Active-Duty airmen were \nconsidered for this award. I am pleased they recognized Senior Master \nSergeant Lemke with this well deserved honor. I had the pleasure of \nmeeting with Senior Master Sergeant Lemke while he was in Washington to \nreceive his award.\n  Senior Master Sergeant Lemke has been in the Air Force for 19 years \nand is the superintendent of the 90th Contracting Squadron at F.E. \nWarren AFB. He was also selected as the top graduate at the Senior Non-\nCommissioned Officer Academy out of 2,515 Senior NCOs who graduated in \n2005. He recently returned from deployment in Iraq and I thank him for \nhis sacrifice and service. Senior Master Sergeant Lemke is preparing to \nretire from the Air Force.\n  I have always said that anyone wanting to live in Wyoming will do so \nif they can create a job. As chairman of the Senate Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions and also a member of the Small \nBusiness Committee, I am pleased that Senior Master Sergeant Lemke will \nbe entering the private sector as a small business owner in Cheyenne. \nHe and his wife Maria, who is an accountant, will be partners in Front \nRange Nuclear Medicine. One of the biggest problems in rural America is \naccess to health care facilities. Front Range Nuclear Medicine helps \nimprove access to health care for people in Wyoming by transporting \nmedical scanning technology\n\n[[Page S11174]]\n\nto the hospitals. Before I came to the Senate in 1997, I operated a \nsmall business with my wife, and I wish the Lemkes the best of luck in \nthis new endeavor.\n  Again, I congratulate SMSgt. Lemke for his selection as one of the \nAir Forces' 12 Outstanding Airmen for 2006.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11174-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ALPHA PHI ALPHA FRATERNITY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to salute Alpha Phi Alpha \nFraternity, which celebrated its 100th anniversary on December 4, 2006. \nFounded at Cornell University in 1906, Alpha Phi Alpha is the Nation's \noldest African-American fraternity. In addition to Martin Luther King, \nJr., the fraternity also proudly claims notable American leaders such \nas former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, former Senator \nEdward Brooke, Congressman Charlie Rangel, Detroit Mayor Kwame \nKilpatrick, and countless others.\n  From advocating for the rights of African Americans to encouraging \nyoung people to attend college, Alpha Phi Alpha has played an important \nrole in our country. Most recently, the fraternity successfully pushed \nto create a national memorial for Martin Luther King, Jr., on the \nNational Mall in Washington, DC. I send my best wishes upon this \nimportant milestone, and I am certain that the fraternity will continue \nits rich legacy of service and social justice in the next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11174-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On October 11, 2006, in New York, NY, Michael Sandy, a gay man, was \nattacked by four men. During the attack, Sandy was struck by a car \nwhile trying to flee. According to police, Sandy went to meet a man \nthat had contacted him through a singles website. They drove to a \nparking lot where three other men were waiting, the group subsequently \nattacked and beat Sandy. Police believe that these men have used the \nInternet to find victims numerous times in the past.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11174-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PORTLAND--UNWIRED\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my home State of \nOregon and the city of Portland. Thanks to the visionary leadership of \nPortland city officials and their plan to ``Unwire Portland,'' the \nforecast in Portland today is ``overcast, with free broadband access \nfor everyone.'' You see, there is a new cloud covering the city--a Wi-\nFi broadband cloud.\n  Residents, businesses, and city officials will be able to access the \nInternet anywhere under the 134 square mile Wi-Fi cloud, download \ncontent as quickly as 1 megabyte per second, and upload at speeds \nreaching 256 kilobits per second. And they will be able to do it all \nfor free.\n  The Wi-Fi network will not only offer city residents and businesses a \nnew affordable choice for broadband access, but will also improve the \nefficiency of city government operations. Public safety and other \nfield-based employees will now be able to wirelessly download and \nupload reports and data from the field.\n  The public / private partnership that was struck by the city to \nrealize this accomplishment perfectly illustrates how municipalities, \nfree of State restrictions, can improve access to broadband \nopportunities for its citizens while improving city services.\n  The Wi-Fi cloud over Portland also reminds us that the future \ncompetitiveness of our country depends upon ubiquitous broadband \ndeployment.\n  Congress must enact legislation that clearly articulates a national \nbroadband policy and provides affordable broadband access for all \nAmericans. I look forward to working with each of you, my colleagues, \ntoward this endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11174-4", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TIME FOR A CHANGE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, crime in our Nation is increasing. Too \noften guns are involved. In 2005, our country experienced a surge in \nmurder and robbery rates. Unfortunately, that surge has continued in \n2006. The Police Executive Research Forum, a think tank that serves \nmany of the Nations' police departments, examined the murder and \nrobbery statistics of 53 U.S. cities for the first 6 months of this \nyear. In their report, ``A Gathering Storm: Violent Crime in America,'' \nthey report that murder has increased in 26 of the 53 cities, and \nrobberies have increased in 43 of the 53 cities.\n  In Boston, after a 19.6-percent increase in murder in 2005, the first \n6 months of 2006 produced another 27.5-percent increase. In Memphis, \nmurder increased 27 percent in 2005 and 43 percent in 2006. Police \nofficials attribute these severe increases to increases in gang \nactivity, violent offenders returning from prison and kids who have \neasy access to guns.\n  In September, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported that in \n2005 violent crime increased 2.3 percent, murder and non-negligent \nmanslaughter increased 3.4 percent, robbery increased 3.9 percent, and \naggravated assault increased 1.8 percent from 2004.\n  What may be even more dramatic is the fact that these statistics are \nnot exclusive to larger cities. Smaller communities that typically had \nrelatively low amounts of crime have also been affected. In the first 6 \nmonths of 2006, robbery was up 47 percent in Rochester, NY, 37 percent \nin suburban Montgomery County, MD, 36.8 percent in Minneapolis, 36 \npercent in Milwaukee, and 27 percent in Norfolk, VA. This translates \ninto thousands more people being robbed, often at gunpoint.\n  According to a poll conducted by the Washington Post and ABC News, 61 \npercent of Americans favor stricter gun laws. This is up from 57 \npercent in 2002. The 109th Congress's record on gun safety is not one \nof which to be proud. It has been a ``do nothing'' Congress. I will \ncontinue in the 110th Congress to work to pass sensible gun safety \nlegislation to help make our communities safer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11174-5", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11174-S11175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THANKING UTAH VOLUNTEERS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

These dedicated volunteers are helping to protect and display \nan asset of great value not only to Utah but to the world.\n  The history of this discovery is fascinating. A few years ago, \nretired optometrist Dr. Sheldon Johnson was preparing his farm site for \ndevelopment, and as he turned over the earth, he discovered tracks of \nearly residents of Washington County--very early residents, in fact. \nDinosaur tracks dating back to the Jurassic period of history were \nuncovered. They are being preserved and are bringing economic and \nhistoric benefit to St. George, Washington County, UT, and the Nation. \nTo date, visitors from 68 nations and all 50 States have visited the \nsite.\n  I want to recognize and thank Dr. Sheldon and LaVerna Johnson who \ndiscovered the tracks and then donated the land to preserve this \nheritage. The Johnsons have made it all possible. Linda Sappington, \nWashington County volunteer coordinator, aided by volunteer supervisors \nKae Crabtree and Carole Chadwick, began in February 2000 to bring \ntogether individuals who cared about the tracks and who were willing to \ngive of themselves to help preserve the find.\n  I also want to recognize and thank Mayor Dan McArthur, the city of \nSt. George, Washington County, and the Utah State Legislature for their \nefforts. Past and present museum staff Theresa Walker, Andrew R.C. \nMilner, Janice Evans, Bob Kroff, and Anneli Segura have put forth \ncountless hours\n\n[[Page S11175]]\n\nof work and dedication to enhance, preserve, and share this prehistoric \ntreasure with the community and future generations.\n  In addition to the Johnsons, I recognize Suzanne Allen; Dr. Andrew \nBarnum; Herb Basso; Dr. David Borris; Alan Crooks; Lyle Drake; Kenneth \nHinton; Sharon Isom; unfortunately, now deceased; LaRee Jones; Dr. \nJames Kirkland; Dr. Martin Lockley; Dan Matheson; the late Layton Ott, \nKathy Smith; Darcy Stewart; Marshall Topham; Gary Watts; John Willie. \nThey are all members of the DinosaurAh!torium, a 501 (c) 3 foundation \nresponsible for funding the project.

Mr. President, I would like to go on the record regarding \nH.R. 1285, the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Reauthorization \nAct of 2005, a bill that I support as it moves through the Senate \ntoday.\n  This legislation extends for 3 years the Nursing Relief for \nDisadvantaged Areas Act of 1999 which provides nonimmigrant visas for \nnurses in areas where there is a shortage of health professionals.\n  Many hospitals across the Nation and, particularly in my home State \nof Texas, have been experiencing great difficulties over the last \nseveral years in attracting nurses. This shortage has been especially \nsevere in both inner-city neighborhoods and in rural isolated areas.\n  It was for this reason that in 1999 Congress passed the Nursing \nRelief for Disadvantaged Areas Act. This legislation created a new H-1C \ntemporary worker program with 500 visas available per year for \nregistered nurses. In order to be eligible to petition for an alien \nnurse, a hospital must be located in a health professional shortage \narea as designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the \nhospital must have at least 190 acute care beds, and it must have a \ncertain percentage of Medicare and Medicaid patients.\n  The legislation also included strong protections for American nurses \nby requiring that any H-1C nurses be paid the prevailing wage and \nmandating that hospitals take steps to recruit American nurses. \nFurthermore H-1C nurses may not comprise more than 33 percent of a \nhospital's registered nurses, and these hospitals may not contract out \nany H-1C nurses to other hospitals.\n  The legislation before us, H.R. 1285, will reauthorize the H-1C nurse \nprogram for 3 more years. The H-1C visa category is vital to Texas \nhospitals like McAllen Medical Center and Mercy Health System, located \nin Laredo, TX. The United States is facing a critical nursing shortage \nin the coming years, and this small but significant program is \nessential to our efforts to recruit more nurses to the United States. I \nbelieve this legislation strikes a balance between the critical need \nfor nurses in certain shortage areas while protecting the wages and \nworking conditions of U.S. citizen nurses.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11175-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11175-S11178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TESTIMONY OF MALLORY FACTOR\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \ntestimony given by Mr. Mallory Factor before the Senate Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on September 29, 2004, and before \nthe Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs on June 15, 2004, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Written Testimony of Mallory Factor Before the Committee on Banking, \n  Housing, and Urban Affairs, United States Senate, September 29, 2004\n\n       Chairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, and Distinguished \n     Members of this Committee, thank you for inviting me to \n     testify today about my views on the critical issue of curbing \n     terror financing.\n       Chairman Shelby, I would like to commend you in particular \n     for your unwavering commitment to addressing the financing of \n     terror. The work that this Committee is undertaking is \n     extremely important to the United\n\n[[Page S11176]]\n\n     States and the world. Thank you for your leadership.\n       My testimony will focus on terror financing emanating from \n     within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Clearly, there are \n     numerous other states that allow terror financing to continue \n     and that should be examined also. I have chosen to focus on \n     Saudi Arabia because of the enormous resources that are \n     funneled from within Saudi Arabia to terrorist groups around \n     the world.\n       My recommendations are contained in a report of an \n     Independent Task Force on Terrorist Financing, sponsored by \n     the Council on Foreign Relations, on which I served as Vice-\n     Chair. Since the report, along with its various appendices, \n     is almost 300 pages in length, I will only be able to \n     highlight core points and ask that the full report and its \n     appendices be placed into the record.\n       I would like to thank the Task Force Chairman, Maurice R. \n     Greenberg, who has been a leader in bringing this issue to \n     the nation's attention. I would also like to thank Council \n     President Richard Haass for his commitment to this topic and \n     to the Task Force's mission. I am testifying in my personal \n     capacity, as is customary, and not on behalf of the Task \n     Force or the Council on Foreign Relations.\n       Among the core findings of the first Terrorist Financing \n     Task Force report, released in October 2002, was that ``For \n     years, individuals and charities based in Saudi Arabia have \n     been the most important source of funds for al-Qaeda; and for \n     years, Saudi officials have turned a blind eye to this \n     problem.''\n       It should be noted that the Task Force found no evidence \n     that the Saudi government--as an institution--participated in \n     the financing of terror directly. However, the Saudi \n     government has clearly allowed individual and institutional \n     financiers of terror to operate and prosper within Saudi \n     borders.\n       The Bush administration has accomplished a great deal since \n     9/11. Some of the Administration's achievements in this area \n     have been integrating terrorist financing into the U.S. \n     government's overall counterterrorism effort, securing \n     unprecedented international support for UN sanctions against \n     al-Qaeda, strengthening international standards for financial \n     supervision through the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), \n     issuing significant and meaningful regulations under the \n     Patriot Act and implementing a wide-ranging strategy to \n     engage Saudi Arabia on the subject of financial and \n     ideological support of extremists. Still, there is much work \n     to be done.\n       I would like to set forth the following framework of \n     constructive, forward looking recommendations for improving \n     U.S. efforts against terrorism financing.\n       First, U.S. policymakers must build a new framework for \n     U.S.-Saudi relations. The terror financing issue is situated \n     in the complex and important bilateral relationship between \n     the United States and Saudi Arabia. For decades, U.S.-Saudi \n     Arabia relations have been built upon a consistent framework \n     understood by both sides: Saudi Arabia would be a \n     constructive actor with regard to the world's oil markets and \n     regional security issues, and the United States would help \n     provide for the defense of Saudi Arabia, work to address the \n     Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and not raise any significant \n     questions about Saudi Arabian domestic issues, either \n     publicly or privately.\n       More recently however, this framework has come under strain \n     because al-Qaeda, a terrorist organization rooted in issues \n     central to Saudi Arabian domestic affairs, has murdered \n     thousands of Americans. Al-Qaeda and similar organizations \n     continue to conspire to kill even more Americans and to \n     threaten our way of life.\n       Changed circumstances require a new policy framework for \n     U.S.-Saudi relations. When domestic Saudi issues threaten \n     Americans at home and abroad, the U.S. must pay attention to \n     those Saudi ``domestic'' issues that impact U.S. security \n     such as terrorist financing and the global export of Islamic \n     extremism. These issues can no longer be ``off the table''; \n     they must be front and center in our bilateral relationship.\n       This transition is already well underway, as evidenced by \n     turbulence in the bilateral relationship since 9/11. Some \n     Bush administration officials have privately characterized \n     the current state of affairs in Saudi Arabia as a ``civil \n     war'' and suggested that the appropriate objective for U.S. \n     policy in this context is to help the current regime prevail. \n     I agree, but believe the domestic Saudi problem will not be \n     solved by dispersing al-Qaeda cells and members in Saudi \n     Arabia alone. Rather, the ``civil war'' will be won only when \n     the regime confronts directly and unequivocally addresses the \n     ideological, religious, social, and cultural realities that \n     fuel al-Qaeda, its imitators, and its financiers all over the \n     world.\n       Second, Saudi Arabia must fully implement its new laws and \n     regulations and take additional steps to further improve its \n     efforts to combat terrorist financing. In addition to \n     implementing its recently enacted laws and regulations in \n     this area, Saudi Arabia should also deter the financing of \n     terrorism by publicly punishing those Saudi individuals and \n     organizations that have funded terrorist organizations. \n     Although a recent report by FATF noted several prosecutions \n     in Saudi Arabia under the terror financing laws, arrests and \n     punitive steps against financiers of terror have only taken \n     place in the ``shadows''. I am not aware of any publicly \n     announced arrests, trials or incarcerations in Saudi Arabia \n     relating to the financing of terrorism. Saudi Arabia must \n     also increase the financial transparency and programmatic \n     verification of its global charities and publicly release \n     audit reports of those charities. Saudi Arabia should ratify \n     and implement treaties that create binding international \n     legal obligations relating to combating money laundering and \n     terrorist financing.\n       Third, multilateral initiatives need to be better \n     coordinated, appropriately funded, and invested with clear \n     punitive authorities. The need for a new international \n     organization specializing in terrorist financing issues, as \n     recommended by the Task Force's initial report, has \n     diminished as a result of significant efforts being \n     undertaken by a variety of international actors. The need for \n     proper coordination and clearer mandates has increased for \n     the same reason. It is now time to minimize duplicative \n     efforts and reallocate resources to the most effective and \n     appropriate lead organization.\n       Fourth, the executive branch should formalize its efforts \n     to centralize the coordination of U.S. measures to combat \n     terrorist financing. My understanding is that, in practice, \n     responsibilities for the coordination of terrorist financing \n     issues have shifted from the Treasury Department to the White \n     House. I commend the Bush Administration for this action. \n     However, setting up a formal allocation of responsibilities \n     is crucial to maintain continuity and focus as the specific \n     individuals involved in these efforts turn over. Therefore, \n     allocation of responsibility to the White House needs to be \n     formalized through a National Security Presidential Directive \n     (NSPD) or otherwise.\n       Fifth, Congress should enact a Treasury-led certification \n     regime specifically on terrorist financing. Many governments \n     are working on shutting down terror financing from within \n     their borders, but many are not. Congress should adopt a \n     certification regime under which the Treasury Department \n     provides a written certification on an annual basis \n     (classified if necessary) detailing the steps that foreign \n     nations have taken to cooperate in U.S. and international \n     efforts to combat terror financing. In the absence of a \n     presidential national security waiver, jurisdictions that do \n     not receive this certification would be subject to sanctions \n     provided by section 311 of the Patriot Act--including denial \n     of U.S. foreign assistance monies and limitations on access \n     to the U.S. financial system.\n       The Administration has used the powers granted to it by \n     section 311 of the Patriot Act but only once in the terror \n     financing context. Section 311 allows Treasury to require \n     domestic financial institutions and agencies to take \n     ``special measures'' against certain parties, including both \n     institutions and jurisdictions, believed by the Treasury to \n     be engaged in money laundering/terror financing. These \n     special measures can include placing prohibitions or \n     conditions on ``correspondent'' or ``payable through'' \n     accounts involving the parties engaged in the money \n     laundering/terror financing.\n       Of course, foreign financial institutions and jurisdictions \n     that do not have significant financial relations with the \n     United States would not be meaningfully impacted by Section \n     311 sanctions imposed by the United States. However, a \n     similar sanction imposed in the money laundering context \n     resulted in the targeted jurisdiction promulgating desired \n     legislative and regulatory changes.\n       A certification regime for terror financing would ensure \n     that these special measures are used appropriately and \n     thoughtfully against ``rogue'' jurisdictions. A separate \n     certification regime for terror financing--distinct from any \n     other reporting requirements on the promulgation of terror \n     itself or money laundering--ensures that stringent \n     requirements are maintained specifically with respect to each \n     jurisdiction's practices on terror financing without \n     consideration of other issues.\n       I commend Congresswoman Sue Kelly and others who have \n     introduced legislation in the House, as H.R. 5124, that would \n     require a terror financing certification regime.\n       Sixth, the UN Security Council should broaden the scope of \n     the UN's al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee. The UN \n     Security Council should specifically impose international \n     sanctions on other groups and individuals that have been \n     designated as terrorists, as Hamas has been by the United \n     States and E.U. I understand that these UN committees \n     continue to discuss various actions but have not taken any \n     affirmative action as yet. Furthermore, the UN should \n     require, as a matter of international law, that member states \n     take enforcement action against groups, persons and entities \n     designated by the Sanctions Committee. The enabling \n     resolution for these expanded authorities should explicitly \n     reject the notion that acts of terror may be legitimized by \n     the charitable activities or political motivations of the \n     perpetrator. The UN should make it clear that no cause, \n     however legitimate, justifies the use of terror.\n       Seventh, the U.S. government should increase sharing of \n     information with the financial services sector as permitted \n     by Section 314(a) of the PATRIOT Act so that this sector can \n     cooperate more effectively with the U.S. government in \n     identifying financiers of terror. Helping private sector \n     financial institutions become effective partners in \n     identifying financiers of terror should be a top priority. \n     The procedures set forth in Section 314(a) of the PATRIOT \n     Act, which promote\n\n[[Page S11177]]\n\n     information sharing between the U.S. government and financial \n     institutions to increase detection of terror financing, are \n     not working as well as they should. The U.S. government is \n     still not providing financial institutions with adequate \n     information to enable the institutions to detect terror \n     financing and identify unknown perpetrators. The government \n     is still using financial institutions primarily to assist in \n     investigating known or suspected terror financiers, not in \n     identifying unknown ones. In addition, our government does \n     not currently have the appropriate resources to process and \n     make full use of information that is flowing to it from \n     financial institutions.\n       I recognize that the information that would enable \n     financial institutions to become effective partners with the \n     U.S. government in identifying terror financing may be highly \n     protected intelligence information. In other industries such \n     as defense and transportation, however, persons can be \n     designated by the U.S. government to receive access to \n     certain high value information as necessary. A similar \n     approach could be used to facilitate information sharing and \n     cooperation between the U.S. government and private financial \n     institutions.\n       Eighth, the National Security Council (NSC) and the White \n     House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should conduct a \n     cross-cutting analysis of the budgets of all U.S. government \n     agencies as they relate to terrorist financing. Monitoring \n     the financial and human resources that are actually devoted \n     to the various tasks involved in combating terrorist \n     financing will facilitate fully informed, strategic decisions \n     about whether resource allocations are optimal or functions \n     are duplicative. For this reason, the NSC and OMB should \n     conduct a cross-cutting analysis of all agencies' budgets in \n     this area, to gain clarity about who is doing what, how well, \n     and with what resources. With such a cross-cut in hand, the \n     Administration and Congress can begin to assess the \n     efficiency of existing efforts and the adequacy of \n     appropriations relative to the threat.\n       Ninth, the U.S. government and private foundations, \n     universities, and think tanks should increase efforts to \n     understand the strategic threat posed to the United States by \n     radical Islamic militancy, including specifically the methods \n     and modalities of its financing and global propagation. At \n     the dawn of the Cold War, the U.S. government and U.S. \n     nongovernmental organizations committed substantial public \n     and philanthropic resources to endow Soviet studies programs \n     across the United States. The purpose of these efforts was to \n     increase the level of understanding in this country of the \n     profound strategic threat posed to the United States by \n     Soviet Communism. A similar undertaking is now needed to \n     understand adequately the threat posed to the United States \n     by radical Islamic militancy, along with its causes, which we \n     believe constitutes the greatest strategic threat to the \n     United States at the dawn of this new century. To be \n     commensurate with the threat, much more will need to be done \n     by private U.S. foundations, universities, and think tanks in \n     a sustained, deliberate, and well-financed manner.\n       I look forward to your questions.\n                                  ____\n\n\nStatement of Mallory Factor, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, \n  ``An Assessment of Current Efforts To Combat Terrorism Financing,'' \n                             June 15, 2004\n\n       Madame Chairman, Senator Lieberman and Distinguished \n     Members of the Committee:\n       I am honored to testify here today to report to you on the \n     recommendations of the Independent Task Force of the Council \n     on Foreign Relations on Terrorist Financing, of which I have \n     served as Vice-Chair.\n       Madame Chairman and Senator Lieberman, I would like to \n     commend you for your unwavering commitment to these issues. \n     The work this Committee is undertaking is of critical \n     importance to the United States and the world. Thank you for \n     your important leadership.\n       Until relatively recently, too little was done to curb the \n     flow of funds to terrorists and extremists. That is why the \n     Council on Foreign Relations sponsored this Task Force in \n     2002 and renewed its mandate more recently. I would like to \n     thank Council President Richard Haass for all that he has \n     done to make this Task Force a success.\n       Our distinguished bi-partisan Task Force is chaired by \n     Maurice R. Greenberg and directed by William F. Wechsler and \n     Lee S. Wolosky. They led this Task Force in the interest of \n     serving our nation. I believe they have succeeded.\n       I would particularly like to commend Lee Wolosky, without \n     whose leadership, judgment, diplomacy, draftsmanship and \n     dedicated efforts this task force would not have been a \n     success. Lee worked tirelessly to reach consensus among task \n     force members on the report and its recommendations.\n       The Bush administration has accomplished a great deal since \n     9/11. Some of the administration's achievements in this area \n     have been integrating terrorist financing into the U.S. \n     government's overall counterterrorism effort, securing \n     unprecedented international support for UN sanctions against \n     al-Qaeda, strengthening international standards for financial \n     supervision through FATF, issuing significant and meaningful \n     regulations under the PATRIOT Act and implementing a wide-\n     ranging strategy to engage Saudi Arabia on the subject of \n     financial and ideological support of extremists. Still, there \n     is much work to be done and I believe that the Task Force \n     report sets forth a framework of constructive, forward \n     looking recommendations for improving U.S. efforts against \n     terrorism financing.\n       Our report focuses on terror financing from within the \n     Kingdom of Saudi Arabia because of the enormous resources \n     emanating from that state that fund terrorist activities. \n     Clearly, there are numerous other states that finance terror \n     and that should be examined also.\n       The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has accomplished a great deal \n     since May 2003. Most notably, Saudi Arabia has enacted \n     extensive laws and regulations which, if fully implemented, \n     would significantly reduce the flow of funds from within \n     Saudi Arabia to terrorists. However, we have not found Saudi \n     Arabia to be effectively enforcing these laws and regulations \n     as Lee Wolosky has discussed. Many issues still need to be \n     addressed before Saudi Arabia will have an acceptable regime \n     in place to combat terror financing.\n       Our task force report generally reaffirms the \n     recommendations made in the Task Force's first report and \n     makes nine new recommendations. I will discuss them in \n     varying levels of detail and would welcome the opportunity to \n     discuss any of them in greater length in response to your \n     questions.\n       First, we urge U.S. policymakers to build a new framework \n     for U.S.-Saudi relations. We recognize the broader context of \n     the complex and important bilateral relationship in which the \n     terrorist financing issue is situated. For decades, U.S.-\n     Saudi Arabia relations have been built upon a consistent \n     framework understood by both sides: Saudi Arabia would be a \n     constructive actor with regard to the world's oil markets and \n     regional security issues, and the United States would help \n     provide for the defense of Saudi Arabia, work to address the \n     Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and not raise any significant \n     questions about Saudi Arabian domestic issues, either \n     publicly or privately.\n       More recently however, this framework has come under strain \n     because al-Qaeda, a terrorist organization rooted in issues \n     central to Saudi Arabian domestic affairs, has murdered \n     thousands of Americans. Al-Qaeda and similar organizations \n     continue to conspire to kill even more Americans and to \n     threaten our way of life.\n       Changed circumstances require a new policy framework for \n     U.S.-Saudi relations. When domestic Saudi problems threaten \n     Americans at home and abroad, the U.S. must pay attention to \n     those Saudi ``domestic'' issues that impact U.S. security \n     such as terrorist financing and the global export of Islamic \n     extremism. These issues can no longer be ``off the table''; \n     they must be front and center in our bilateral relationship.\n       We acknowledge that this transition is already well \n     underway, as evidenced by the turbulence in the bilateral \n     relationship since 9/11. We note that some Bush \n     administration officials have privately characterized the \n     current state of affairs in Saudi Arabia as a ``civil war'' \n     and suggested that the appropriate objective for U.S. policy \n     in this context is to help the current regime prevail. We \n     agree, but we believe the domestic Saudi problem will not be \n     solved by dispersing al-Qaeda cells and members in Saudi \n     Arabia alone. Rather, the ``civil war'' will be won only when \n     the regime confronts directly and unequivocally addresses the \n     ideological, religious, social, and cultural realities that \n     fuel al-Qaeda, its imitators, and its financiers all over the \n     world.\n       Second, we recommend that Saudi Arabia fully implement its \n     new laws and regulations and take additional steps to further \n     improve its efforts to combat terrorist financing. In \n     addition to implementing its recently enacted laws and \n     regulations in this area, Saudi Arabia should also deter the \n     financing of terrorism by publicly punishing those Saudi \n     individuals and organizations that have funded terrorist \n     organizations. It should increase the financial transparency \n     and programmatic verification of its global charities and \n     publicly release audit reports of those charities. Saudi \n     Arabia should also ratify and implement treaties that create \n     binding international legal obligations relating to combating \n     money laundering and terrorist financing.\n       Third, we suggest that multilateral initiatives be better \n     coordinated, appropriately funded, and invested with clear \n     punitive authorities. The need for a new international \n     organization specializing in terrorist financing issues, as \n     recommended by our initial report, has diminished as a result \n     of significant efforts being undertaken by a variety of \n     international actors. The need for proper coordination and \n     clearer mandates has increased for the same reason. It is now \n     time to minimize duplicative efforts and reallocate resources \n     to the most effective and appropriate lead organization.\n       Fourth, we believe that the executive branch should \n     formalize its efforts to centralize the coordination of U.S. \n     measures to combat terrorist financing. Our understanding is \n     that, in practice, responsibilities for the coordination of \n     terrorist financing issues have shifted from the Treasury \n     Department to the White House, as we recommended in our \n     original Task Force report. I commend the Bush Administration \n     for this action. However, we believe that this allocation of \n     responsibility to the White House needs to be formalized \n     through a National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) or \n     otherwise.\n\n[[Page S11178]]\n\n       Fifth, we recommend that Congress enact a Treasury-led \n     certification regime specifically on terrorist financing. The \n     financial support for terrorism is the life-blood of global \n     terrorism and requires its own certification regime. A \n     separate certification process will ensure that stringent \n     requirements are maintained specifically with respect to a \n     nation's policies and practices on terrorist financing \n     without consideration of other issues.\n       I believe that the Saudi Arabia Accountability Act of 2003, \n     S. 1888, sponsored by Senator Arlen Specter and co-sponsored \n     by Chairman Collins and others would provide a good starting \n     point for a terrorist financing certification regime if it \n     were narrowed to focus solely on the financing of terrorism \n     and expanded to apply to other nations.\n       We understand that certification regimes are generally \n     disfavored by the executive branch (which must implement \n     them) and favored by the legislative branch (which they \n     empower). Although controversial, they also have the ability \n     to galvanize quickly action consistent with U.S. interests. \n     Moreover, they require official findings of fact that have \n     the effect of promoting transparency and compelling sustained \n     U.S. attention to important topics that, on occasion, U.S. \n     officials find it more expedient to avoid.\n       For these reasons, we believe that Congress should pass and \n     the President should sign legislation requiring the executive \n     branch to submit to Congress on an annual basis a written \n     certification (classified if necessary) detailing the steps \n     that foreign nations have taken to cooperate in U.S. and \n     international efforts to combat terrorist financing. We \n     suggest that in the absence of a presidential national \n     security waiver, states that do not receive this \n     certification would be subject to sanctions--including denial \n     of U.S. foreign assistance monies and limitations on access \n     to the U.S. financial system.\n       Sixth, we urge the U.N. Security Council to broaden the \n     scope of the U.N.'s al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee. \n     The UN Security Council should specifically impose \n     international sanctions on other groups and individuals that \n     have been designated as terrorists, as Hamas has been by the \n     United States and E.U. Furthermore, it should require, as a \n     matter of international law, that member states take \n     enforcement action against groups, persons and entities \n     designated by the Sanctions Committee. The enabling \n     resolution for these expanded authorities should explicitly \n     reject the notion that acts of terror may be legitimized by \n     the charitable activities or political motivations of the \n     perpetrator. No cause, however legitimate, justifies the use \n     of terror; indeed, the use of terror delegitimizes even the \n     most worthy causes.\n       Seventh, we suggest that the U.S. government increase \n     sharing of information with the financial services sector as \n     permitted by Section 314 of the USA PATRIOT ACT so that this \n     sector can cooperate more effectively with the U.S. \n     government in identifying incidences of terror financing. \n     International financial institutions subject to U.S. \n     jurisdiction are among our best sources of raw financial \n     intelligence to identify terror financing, but these \n     institutions need to be given appropriate information from \n     the U.S. government on what to look for. Currently, the \n     procedures required by Section 314 of the Patriot Act which \n     are designed to promote cooperation with financial \n     institutions in identifying terror financing are not working \n     as effectively as they might. We suggest greater information \n     sharing between the U.S. government and the financial \n     institutions within the framework of the Patriot Act in order \n     to allow these institutions to cooperate more effectively \n     with the U.S. government in identifying incidences of terror \n     financing.\n       Eighth, we recommend that the National Security Council \n     (NSC) and the White House Office of Management and Budget \n     (OMB) conduct a cross-cutting analysis of the budgets of all \n     U.S. government agencies as they relate to terrorist \n     financing. We understand this recommendation is difficult to \n     implement; however, we think that monitoring the financial \n     and human resources that are actually devoted to the various \n     tasks involved in combating terrorist financing will \n     facilitate fully informed, strategic decisions about whether \n     resource allocations are optimal or functions are \n     duplicative. For this reason, the NSC and OMB should conduct \n     a cross-cutting analysis of all agencies' budgets in this \n     area, to gain clarity about who is doing what, how well, and \n     with what resources. Only with such a cross-cut in hand can \n     we begin to make assessments regarding the efficiency of our \n     existing efforts and the adequacy of appropriations relative \n     to the threat. We commend Jody Myers, the former NSC staffer, \n     for suggesting a similar cross-cutting analysis in his Senate \n     testimony given last month.\n       Ninth, we urge the U.S. government and private foundations, \n     universities, and think tanks to increase efforts to \n     understand the strategic threat posed to the United States by \n     radical Islamic militancy, including specifically the methods \n     and modalities of its financing and global propagation. At \n     the dawn of the Cold War, the U.S. government and U.S. \n     nongovernmental organizations committed substantial public \n     and philanthropic resources to endow Soviet studies programs \n     across the United States. The purpose of these efforts was to \n     increase the level of understanding in this country of the \n     profound strategic threat posed to the United States by \n     Soviet Communism. A similar undertaking is now needed to \n     understand adequately the threat posed to the United States \n     by radical Islamic militancy, along with its causes, which we \n     believe constitutes the greatest strategic threat to the \n     United States at the dawn of this new century. To be \n     commensurate with the threat, much more will need to be done, \n     not only in Washington, but also by private U.S. foundations, \n     universities, and think tanks, in a more sustained, \n     deliberate, and well-financed manner than that afforded \n     through ad hoc initiatives such as our Task Force.\n       I look forward to your questions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11178-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO COLIN HAUCK\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor SSN 773, the USS \nCheyenne, for her 10 years of service in the U.S. Navy in defense of \nour freedom.\n  On July 6, 1992, the keel was laid for the USS Cheyenne in Newport \nNews, VA. She was launched on April 16, 1995. On September 13, 1996, \nMrs. Ann Simpson sponsored the USS Cheyenne. I am pleased to now occupy \nthe seat of Ann's husband, Senator Alan Simpson, in the U.S. Senate.\n  Since September 11, 2001, the USS Cheyenne has been engaged in \nimportant missions as part of the global war on terrorism. The USS \nCheyenne earned the distinction of the first to strike when she was the \nfirst ship to launch Tomahawk missiles in Operation Iraqi Freedom under \nthe command of CDR Charles Doty. She would go on to successfully launch \nher entire complement of Tomahawks, earning a clean sweep for combat \nactions in the final 3 months of her 9 month deployment. That level of \nexcellence continues today from her homeport in Pearl Harbor, HI.\n  The USS Cheyenne is the last Los Angeles class submarine built and \nthe third ship in our Nation's fleet named in honor of the city home to \nWyoming's State capital. The first USS Cheyenne, a tug boat, entered \nservice in\n\n[[Page S11179]]\n\n1898. The second USS Cheyenne, BM 10, was originally the monitor class \nUSS Wyoming. In 1909 it was renamed USS Cheyenne to make the name \navailable for the battleship BB 32, the new USS Wyoming. Fiction writer \nTom Clancy further cemented the legend of the USS Cheyenne when he made \nthe submarine a central player in a battle for the Spratly Islands in \nhis novel ``SSN.''\n  Cheyenne, Wyoming's motto is ``Live the Legend.'' The 145 submariners \nwho are aboard the USS Cheyenne have adopted the motto ``Ride the \nLegend.'' The city of Cheyenne has formed a special bond with the crew \nof her namesake. Each year the outstanding sailors of the USS Cheyenne \nare the guests of the city of Cheyenne for Cheyenne Frontier Days, the \nworld's largest outdoor rodeo, and the daddy of them all. Many of the \nsailors have never been out West or been to a rodeo. For a week, the \nsubmariners enjoy Wyoming hospitality and have a chance to live the \nlegend. It is a small chance for Wyoming and the people of Cheyenne to \nrepay a debt of gratitude to the crew of the USS Cheyenne.\n  CDR Richard Testyon, Jr., assumed command of the USS Cheyenne on June \n4, 2006. I wish him well in his new command and thank CDR Charles Doty \nfor his time at the helm. Commander Testyon brings extensive experience \nto the USS Cheyenne and will lead SSN 773 well.\n  The best skippers are complemented by outstanding crew; I would like \nto honor the crew of the USS Cheyenne.

Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and I have introduced this bill to address one of the most \nserious economic problems facing our Nation; namely, the trade deficit. \nThere is no greater advocate for sensible trade policies than Senator \nDorgan, and I am proud to join him in this effort.\n  The measure we have introduced is based on a proposal advocated by \none of the foremost free market advocates in the world, Warren Buffett. \nIt is a straightforward and market-based approach to our massive trade \ndeficit, and I commend Mr. Buffett for his willingness to step forward \nwith this idea.\n  In a seminal article in Fortune magazine, Mr. Buffett made the case \nfor taking action on this problem and laid out the basics of the \napproach that Senator Dorgan and I take in this bill. In that article, \nMr. Buffett argued that our trade deficit is, in effect, a transfer of \nour Nation's net worth. He describes our situation by using the \nimaginary example of two islands, Squanderville and Thriftville. Here \nis some of what he wrote:\n\n       A perpetuation of this transfer will lead to major trouble. \n     To understand why, take a wildly fanciful trip with me to two \n     isolated, side-by-side islands of equal size, Squanderville \n     and Thriftville. Land is the only capital asset on these \n     islands, and their communities are primitive, needing only \n     food and producing only food. Working eight hours a day, in \n     fact, each inhabitant can produce enough food to sustain \n     himself or herself. And for a long time that's how things go \n     along. On each island everybody works the prescribed eight \n     hours a day, which means that each society is self-\n     sufficient.\n       Eventually, though, the industrious citizens of Thriftville \n     decide to do some serious saving and investing, and they \n     start to work 16 hours a day. In this mode they continue to \n     live off the food they produce in eight hours of work but \n     begin exporting an equal amount to their one and only trading \n     outlet, Squanderville.\n       The citizens of Squanderville are ecstatic about this turn \n     of events, since they can now live their lives free from toil \n     but eat as well as ever. Oh, yes, there's a quid pro quo--but \n     to the Squanders, it seems harmless: All that the Thrifts \n     want in exchange for their food is Squanderbonds (which are \n     denominated, naturally, in Squanderbucks).\n       Over time Thriftville accumulates an enormous amount of \n     these bonds, which at their core represent claim checks on \n     the future output of Squanderville. A few pundits in \n     Squanderville smell trouble coming. They foresee that for the \n     Squanders both to eat and to pay off--or simply service--the \n     debt they're piling up will eventually require them to work \n     more than eight hours a day. But the residents of \n     Squanderville are in no mood to listen to such doomsaying.\n       Meanwhile, the citizens of Thriftville begin to get \n     nervous. Just how good, they ask, are the IOUs of a shiftless \n     island? So the Thrifts change strategy: Though they continue \n     to hold some bonds, they sell most of them to Squanderville \n     residents for Squanderbucks and use the proceeds to buy \n     Squanderville land. And eventually the Thrifts own all of \n     Squanderville.\n       At that point, the Squanders are forced to deal with an \n     ugly equation: They must now not only return to working eight \n     hours a day in order to eat--they have nothing left to \n     trade--but must also work additional hours to service their \n     debt and pay Thriftville rent on the land so imprudently \n     sold. In effect, Squanderville has been colonized by purchase \n     rather than conquest.\n\n  Mr. Buffett paints a grim picture for the future of our economy in \nhis article. At the time he wrote those words, our trade deficit was \nabout $500 billion. Last year, the trade deficit was about 60 percent \nhigher.\n  There are many factors contributing to our trade deficit, but there \ncan be no doubt that the deeply flawed trade policies of the past \ndecade and more have contributed greatly to the mess in which we find \nourselves.\n  The trade agreements into which we have entered, based on the model \nestablished by the North American Free\n\n[[Page S11180]]\n\nTrade Agreement, known as NAFTA, have helped ship much of our wealth \noverseas, often in the form of factories that provided entire \ncommunities with good-paying, family-supporting jobs.\n  I hold listening sessions in each of Wisconsin's 72 counties every \nyear. This is my 14th year holding those listening sessions, listening \nto tens of thousands of people from all over Wisconsin. I completed my \n1000th of those sessions just a few weeks ago, and I can tell you that \nthere is nearly universal frustration and anger with the trade policies \nwe have pursued since the late 1980s. Even among those who would have \ncalled themselves traditional free-traders, it is increasingly obvious \nthat the so-called NAFTA model of trade has been a tragic failure.\n  I voted against NAFTA, GATT, and permanent most favored nation status \nfor China, in great part because I felt they were bad deals for \nWisconsin businesses and Wisconsin workers. At the time I voted against \nthose agreements, I thought they would result in lost jobs for my \nState.\n  But, Mr. President, even as an opponent of those trade agreements, I \nhad no idea just how bad things would be.\n  And things could hardly be worse. You can see the results of those \npolicies in hundreds of communities around my State.\n  And I note that these trade policies are not the result of partisan \npolitics. I wish they were. I wish I could lay the blame at the feet of \nour colleagues in the other party. But Members of both parties have \naided and abetted these flawed policies. Presidents of both parties \nhave advanced them, and Members of Congress from both sides of the \naisle have approved them.\n  This legislation is not a substitute for a sound trade policy. It is \nnot intended to be. Even if we enact this measure, we will still need \nto straighten out the flawed trade policies of the past several \nadministrations. But there is a clear relationship between the flawed \ntrade agreements into which we have entered and the mushrooming trade \ndeficit.\n  In 1993, before NAFTA was implemented, our trade deficit with Canada \nand Mexico was $9 billion. In 2004, 10 years after NAFTA was \nimplemented, our trade deficit with those two countries has ballooned \n1,200 percent--1,200 percent--to $111 billion. By one estimate, the \nmassive growth of imports into this country from Canada and Mexico \nrelative to exports to those two countries has displaced almost 1 \nmillion jobs.\n  Giving China permanent most favored nation trading status and \nratifying the creation of the World Trade Organization have only made \nmatters worse.\n  Far from improving our trade balance, NAFTA and these other trade \nagreements have only made matters worse.\n  When questions were raised about the actual provisions of these \nflawed agreements, supporters were quick to play the free trade card \nand label those who questioned these policies as ``protectionist.'' It \nis somewhat encouraging that some who blindly accepted these agreements \nare now beginning to read the fine print.\n  One might think it obvious, but apparently it needs to be \nreiterated--these aren't your father's trade agreements, and the \nelegant theories of Adam Smith and others do not apply to the \nagreements we are asked to approve. As Thea Lee wrote in a column in \nthe Wall Street Journal:\n\n       We should all understand by now that modern (post-NAFTA) \n     free-trade agreements are not just about lowering tariffs. \n     They are about changing the conditions attached to trade \n     liberalization, in ways that benefit some players and hurt \n     others. These are not your textbook free-trade deals. These \n     are finely orchestrated special-interest deals that boost the \n     profits and power of multinational corporations, leaving \n     workers, family farmers, many small businesses, and the \n     environment more vulnerable than ever.\n\n  Millions of working families across Wisconsin know this. If instead \nof exporting manufacturing goods, China exported editorial writers, the \nopinion pages of our newspapers might reflect an understanding of this \nas well.\n  The argument we hear is that trade deals like NAFTA and CAFTA may \ncause some short-term pain, but they are ultimately good for all \ncountries concerned. Maybe we lose a few jobs to Mexico or China, the \nargument goes, but we would also gain jobs. Each country would engage \nin the economic activity for which it has a so-called comparative \nadvantage and everyone wins.\n  But as I noted during the CAFTA debate, this nice, neat academic \ntheory bears little relation to what is actually happening in the real \nworld. And one of the reasons for this disconnect is that in an arena \nthat has been fundamentally changed by technical advances, such as the \nInternet and the rapid flow of capital, we are not playing by the same \nrules as our trading partners.\n  The trade agreements into which our country has entered in recent \nyears too often lack even the most reasonable standards to ensure that \nour businesses and workers can compete on a level playing field. This \nwas certainly the case with CAFTA, which failed to include meaningful \nlabor standards. The weak standards it did include were effectively \nunenforceable. Similarly, the environmental provisions it included were \nlargely cosmetic. And the promised positive impact claimed for U.S. \nagriculture is far more likely to benefit middlemen and large \nagribusiness, while putting smaller family farms at a long-term \ncompetitive disadvantage as they continue to keep both the water and \nair clean while paying their employees a living wage.\n  As I said, we have to stop entering into trade agreements that are so \nfundamentally skewed and that result in a race to the bottom. I was \npleased to introduce a resolution laying out standards for the kind of \ntrade policies we should pursue. The principles set forth in my \nresolution are not complex. They are straightforward and achievable. \nThey require enforceable worker protections in our trade agreements, \nincluding the core International Labor Organization standards. They \ninsist that trade agreements preserve the ability of the United States \nto enact and enforce its own trade laws. They provide that trade \nagreements may protect foreign investors but state that foreign \ninvestors should not be provided with greater rights than those \nprovided under U.S. law.\n  The standards in my resolution also require that trade agreements \nprotect public interest laws from challenge by foreign investors in \nsecret tribunals. They require that the agreements into which we enter \nensure that food entering into our country meets domestic food safety \nstandards. They mandate that trade agreements preserve the ability of \nFederal, State, and local governments to maintain essential public \nservices and to regulate private sector services in the public \ninterest. They require that trade agreements contain environmental \nprovisions that are subject to the same enforcement as commercial \nprovisions.\n  My resolution requires trade agreements to preserve the right of \nFederal, State, and local governments to use procurement as a policy \ntool, including through Buy American laws, environmental laws such as \nrecycled content, and purchasing preferences for small, minority, or \nwomen-owned businesses. And it requires that trade negotiations and the \nimplementation of trade agreements be conducted openly.\n  These are sensible policies. They are entirely consistent with the \ngoal of increased international commerce, and in fact they advance that \ngoal.\n  We should pursue trade agreements that are built around these \nprinciples, but I fully understand that such a change in our trade \npolicies is unlikely to occur overnight.\n  The bill Senator Dorgan and I are introducing today focuses on \nreducing the trade deficit, and while it is not a substitute for \nsoundly crafted trade agreements, it can stem some of the damage done \nby the trade policies of the past several years.\n  This proposal is straightforward. It requires that the total value of \nwhat we import not exceed the total value of what we export, and rather \nthan trying to pick winners and losers, as some of our trade agreements \ndo, it lets the market decide which product areas will thrive in global \ncompetition and which will not.\n  This is done through the use of Balanced Trade Certificates, BTCs. \nBTCs would be issued to U.S. exporters in an amount equal to the dollar \nvalue of their exports. Those BTCs would be sold, directly or \nindirectly, to foreign exporters who wanted to bring goods into the \nUnited States. Foreign exporters would have to have BTCs in an\n\n[[Page S11181]]\n\namount equal to the dollar value of the goods they want to bring into \nthe United States. To import $1 million worth of products, a foreign \nexporter would have to have $1 million worth of BTCs, representing $1 \nmillion worth of U.S. exports.\n  By limiting the total value of all BTCs to the total value of all \nproducts we export, the bill would result in a balance of trade.\n  Unlike an industry-specific tariff or quota, the BTCs proposed in \nthis bill will not shield any particular industry or penalize any \nspecific country. While there would clearly be a net benefit to \nAmerican industries competing in the global market, that marketplace \nultimately would determine which industries and businesses succeed and \nwhich do not.\n  This new balanced trade system is phased in over 5 years to minimize \nany economic shocks, with a longer phase-in period of 10 years for oil \nand gas. While our addiction to oil is not the focus of this bill, that \naddiction continues to have an impact on our balance of trade. The \nadditional time provided in the bill for oil and gas imports will give \nCongress an opportunity to advance a serious energy policy, one that \nmoves us away from our addiction to oil, an addiction that only \naggravates our dangerous trade imbalance.\n  As Mr. Buffet warns in making this proposal, ``there is no free lunch \nhere.'' These balanced trade certificates will increase the price of \nimported goods. Some domestically produced goods might also increase in \nprice. But the alternative, continuing down the path we are now on, \nwill mean that we will increasingly transfer our net worth overseas, \nand with it our economic future.\n  Nor are we the only ones put at risk by our trade deficit. A recent \nstory in the New York Times headlined ``U.S. Trade Deficit Is Called a \nThreat to Global Growth'' reported the concerns of the Managing \nDirector of the International Monetary Fund, Rodrigo de Rato, and \nothers, over our trade deficit with China and other countries. The \nstory reports on the threat our trade deficit poses to global economic \ngrowth and notes that the warnings about our trade deficit by Mr. de \nRato and other financial experts will be addressed later this month \n``at the annual meeting of the directors of the I.M.F. and the World \nBank this month in Singapore.''\n  Some of the foremost experts in the world of international finance \nare concerned about our mushrooming trade deficit. It is time that we \ndid something about it.\n  In the article describing the proposal on which this legislation is \nbased, Mr. Buffett compares our country to a very rich family that owns \nan immense farm. He writes: ``In order to consume 4 percent more than \nwe produce, we have, day by day, been both selling pieces of the farm \nand increasing the mortgage on what we still own.''\n  Mr. President, if we don't do something to straighten out our trade \npolicies and turn our trade deficit around, before we know it, we won't \nhave any more of the farm to sell off. We will have sold off all of it.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Dorgan and me in sponsoring this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11181-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BROWNS CANYON WILDERNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I today reiterate my support for the \npermanent protection of one of our Nation's most spectacular sections \nof canyon country. Browns Canyon, CO, along the Arkansas River, is a \nbeloved stretch of wilderness that is deserving of permanent protection \nunder the 1964 Wilderness Act.\n  The 20,000 acres of wilderness in Browns Canyon are pristine, \ndramatic, and worthy of wilderness designation. My colleague from \nColorado, Representative Joel Hefley, has done heroic work over the \nlast several years to craft a wilderness bill that protects these lands \nand meets the needs of the local communities. Thanks to his diligent \nwork, they are eager to see Congress pass the Browns Canyon Wilderness \nAct as soon as possible.\n  Over the last several months, I have been working hard to pass this \nbill. I have worked with Representative Hefley to adjust the bill's \nwater rights language and, should we take the Senate version of this \nbill up, I will work to include language that will bring it in line \nwith an updated House version, which includes the agreed-to water \nrights language.\n  With only a few days left in this session, it is high time we act on \nthis bill. The Browns Canyon Wilderness Act is a great example of \nRepresentative Hefley's sensible, pragmatic work, and we should make \nthis wilderness designation a part of his legacy.\n  Mr. President, for the sake of our retiring colleague and for the \nbenefit of Colorado's wild places, I hope we can get this bill to the \nPresident's desk as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11181-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO WAYNE SAYER\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Wayne Sayer, who \ndied suddenly on November 3 of this year.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1983, Wayne was among the first people I \nmet who was interested in and concerned about the loss of our \nsemiconductor industry to Asia. He was one of the first to recognize \nthe value of a close partnership between government policy and the U.S. \nhigh-tech industry. His advice and counsel to members and staff through \nthese early debates until the day he died were invaluable. His \ncontributions to American competitiveness cannot be overstated.\n  An Air Force veteran, he first worked for Precision Scientific, an \ninstrumentation company. When Precision Scientific was acquired by GCA \nCorporation, he stayed with the new company and eventually opened GCA's \nWashington, DC office. At the time of his death, he was the senior \ngovernment affairs consultant to Applied Materials.\n  He was a smart, hard-working man with a great sense of humor and \nstyle. Those of us who valued his counsel and enjoyed his company over \nthe years will miss his voice of good sense, his skill with policy \nissues and mostly his friendship. This is a loss, Mr. President, not \nonly to the industry but to the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11181-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11181-S11182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN MEMORY OF JUDGE JAMES DeANDA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am saddened to inform you of the \npassing of Judge James DeAnda. I would like to take a few moments to \nrecognize Judge DeAnda's many important accomplishments and the \ntremendous impact he made in protecting civil liberties.\n  James DeAnda was born in Houston, TX, in 1925. The son of Mexican \nimmigrants, DeAnda fought bravely as a marine for his country during \nWorld War II. Shortly after returning from war, at a time when only a \nsmall number of Latino students were enrolled in higher education, he \nreturned to his studies and graduated from Texas A University and the \nUniversity of Texas Law School. As an attorney, DeAnda fought for the \nrights of all Latinos through his work on cases dealing with \nsegregation and threats to civil liberties. He also was a cofounder of \nthe Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, a nationwide nonprofit Latino \nlitigation, advocacy and educational outreach institution.\n  DeAnda became the second Mexican-American judge appointed to the \nFederal bench when he was confirmed in 1979. During his tenure, he \nserved for 13 years with the U.S. District and Bankruptcy Court's \nSouthern District of Texas including four as chief judge until his \nretirement in 1992. In more than a half century of service to the law, \nJudge DeAnda was involved with many cases. He is, however, best known \nfor his efforts as the youngest member of a 4-person legal team that \nargued the Hernandez v. Texas case which was ultimately decided by the \nSupreme Court. The 1954 decision overturned the murder conviction of \nPete Hernandez by an all-White jury and held that Latinos deserved the \nsame constitutional protections as other minorities including the right \nto serve as jurors.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join me and the many mourning \nmembers of the legal, Latino, and civil liberties communities in \nrecognizing and honoring Judge James DeAnda for his long\n\n[[Page S11182]]\n\nand distinguished service to our country.

His talent, passion, and humor dealing with \nstudents, coupled with his dedication to education, made him a natural \nteacher in the classroom.\n  In 1997, Jeffrey Mitchell chose to continue his public service and \njoined the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department. He brought with him \nthe same good-natured spirit that he exhibited in his previous \nprofessions to his new career in law enforcement. Jeffrey Mitchell \nserved as the recreational technician at Rio Cosumnes Correctional \nCenter in Elk Grove and was promoted to deputy in 2002.\n  Deputy Mitchell's family, friends, and colleagues all remember his \ninfectious smile and kind heart. He is survived by his wife Crystal, \nson Jake, and sister Kim Gervasoni. Deputy Mitchell was a devoted \nfamily man who chose to work the overnight shift so he could pick his \nson up from school and prepare dinner for his wife when she arrived \nhome from work.

Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I ask \nmy colleagues to join me today in honoring the memory of an \nextraordinary Californian, Elizabeth Terwilliger.\n  To the Marin County community, Elizabeth Terwilliger was a renowned \nnaturalist and educator, beloved by school children and adults, who \nleaves an amazing environmental legacy. She died on November 27, 2006, \nat the age of 97. She is survived by her daughter Lynn, her son John, \nand several grandchildren.\n  Elizabeth Cooper was born in Hawaii in 1909. She moved to the \nmainland to pursue a master's degree in nutrition from Columbia \nUniversity in New York and then attended Stanford nursing school. While \nat Stanford, she met her husband, Dr. Calvin Terwilliger. After World \nWar II, the couple settled in Mill Valley, CA, where they raised two \nchildren.\n  Elizabeth took her children on nature walks throughout Marin County. \nSoon, she was leading nature walks for local Girl Scout and Boy Scout \ntroops. Her unique hands-on style and storytelling ability became known \nthroughout the community, and soon she began leading field trips for \narea schools and environmental organizations. Leading such trips 5 days \na week became her life's work.\n  For the 50 years that followed, every child growing up in Marin \nCounty knew Mrs. Terwilliger. She was a famous and beloved educator who \ntraveled across the county in her familiar van filled with life-like \nanimal models to teach school children about nature. Upon sight of her \ncharacteristic floppy straw hat, children would come running and follow \nher through the woods with excitement and adoration. They would soak up \nher stories and bring them home to teach their parents.\n  Those who knew Mrs. Terwilliger well recount her mesmerizing \npersonality, her passion for nature and wildlife, and her openhearted \nway with children and adults alike.\n  In 1984, President Ronald Reagan honored Mrs. Terwilliger as an \noutstanding volunteer. While accepting the award at the White House, \nshe shared one of her famous stories about ``Mr. Vulture'' and had \nPresident Reagan holding his arms over his head in the ``V'' position, \nrepresenting a vulture in flight.\n  In addition to leading nature education programs, Mrs. Terwilliger \nwas an advocate for environmental conservation and open space. She \ncampaigned for a monarch butterfly preserve, bicycle paths, wetlands, \nand open space preservation. She received numerous awards and has two \npreserves named after her: Terwilliger Marsh in Mill Valley and \nTerwilliger Grove in Muir Woods.\n  She founded the Elizabeth Terwilliger Nature Education Center, which \nlater became known as WildCare. Using educational programs developed by \nMrs. Terwilliger, the center provides nature programs for over 40,000 \nBay Area school children each year. The center also treats thousands of \nwildlife each year, rehabilitating them and returning them to their \nnatural environment.\n  Mrs. Terwilliger often said, ``While you're learning, you're \nliving.'' Her life's passion was to teach people how to embrace and \nlove nature. She was a local treasure and a wonderful, inspiring woman.\n  I knew Mrs. Terwilliger and respected and admired her greatly. She \nwill be deeply missed.\n  For those of us who were fortunate to know her, we take comfort in \nknowing that school children will continue to learn from Mrs. \nTerwilliger's unique educational style at WildCare. Her vision, her \npassion, and her spirit will remain in the countless lives she \ntouched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11182-4", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11182-S11183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO THE RABBIT HASH GENERAL STORE\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the Rabbit \nHash General Store on its 175th anniversary. The Rabbit Hash General \nStore has continuously operated relatively unchanged in the town of \nRabbit Hash, KY, since 1831.\n  For 175 years, the Rabbit Hash General Store has been a meeting place \nfor the local community where citizens of Rabbit Hash have come \ntogether. The\n\n[[Page S11183]]\n\nRabbit Hash General Store has withstood ice jams and floods from the \nOhio River. The establishment shows the true fortitude of the people \nwho live in this great river town.\n  The Rabbit Hash General Store has been recognized as a landmark by \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky since the late 1970s. Nationally, the \nRabbit Hash General Store was recognized by the Department of the \nInterior on the National Register of Historic Places, and the town of \nRabbit Hash has been recently honored by First Lady Laura Bush as a \nPreserve America Community.\n  I ask my fellow colleagues to join me in congratulating the Rabbit \nHash General Store on its 175th anniversary. The Rabbit Hash General \nStore is a true American treasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11183-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BRAYTON WILLIS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in early 2007, the Army Corps of \nEngineers will see one of its finest employees retire after 28 years of \nexemplary service to individuals, communities, and agencies that the \nCorps serves.\n  Brayton Willis has lived in Idaho since 1999, serving as the project \nmanager in the Walla Walla District's Boise office. He served in the \nU.S. Marine Corps and later graduated from Northeastern University with \na degree in civil engineering. His career began in Massachusetts where \nhe worked on one of the first environmental impact statements required \nunder the Clean Air Act.\n  Brayton has worked for the Corps of Engineers in Arizona, Washington \nand South Carolina, in addition to his work in Idaho. Over the course \nof his career, he worked at two of the Nation's nuclear facilities \nproviding environmental restoration support to the Department of \nEnergy. He found time to use his expertise in a volunteer capacity as \nwell, helping local communities in California and Puerto Rico assess \ndamages after natural disasters. In Idaho, in particular, Brayton \nspecialized in flood control and issues related to environmental \nimprovement in urban and suburban flood-prone areas. He also worked \nwith local communities to address the critical issues of water and \nwastewater management and actively sought to involve community \nstakeholders in flood control and environmental improvement. Brayton \npreferred to approach flooding and its implications in a preventive \nmanner, before disaster happened. He worked under the firm belief that \nthis method was the most effective and efficient use of taxpayer \ndollars.\n  Brayton's work reflects the complementary ideals of caring for \ncommunities and the environment. Increased population growth in the \nWest means greater and more sensitive interface between the environment \nand people. If managed effectively and proactively, the result can be \npositive for the environment and hold far less risk of disaster for the \nresidential population. Brayton understands this and implemented it in \nhis almost three decades of employment in the Corps. I congratulate \nBrayton Willis on his retirement and wish him and his wife Debbie well \nin future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11183-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A FRIEND TO IDAHO FISH AND GAME\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, on January 1, Idaho sportsmen and \nwomen and wildlife will lose a great agency friend in the Idaho \nDepartment of Fish and Game. Steve Huffaker, 22-year veteran of Fish \nand Game, and director since 2002, will be retiring after a full and \nsuccessful career with this important agency.\n  Steve has been my great friend and supporter on many issues including \nwolves, elk, slick spot peppergrass, sage grouse, and cooperative \nconservation agreements with landowners. His enthusiasm for the \nCollaboration for the Recovery of the Endangered Species Act and the \nOwyhee Initiative has been instrumental as I seek the support of others \non these important land management policy initiatives. Steve also \nprovided expert advice and recommendations with regard to Federal \nimplementation of these initiatives. He served as an invaluable \nresource for considerations of wildlife habitat in designations in \nseveral State and Federal conservation programs. Steve has been a \nstaunch supporter of my Elk Collaborative; he has worked closely with \nmy staff on these and many other issues over the years. He led the \ncharge to delist grizzly bears, restored confidence and trust with \nagricultural interests, and remained determined to keep me informed of \nhis activities, ideas, and beliefs. Steve's strengths include a \npositive demeanor and clear and tough but fair and reasonable stance \nwhen he was called upon to defend his position and decisions.\n  During his years at Fish and Game, Steve served as both Fisheries \nBureau chief and Wildlife Bureau chief. He oversaw the agency during a \ntime of constant and frequent change. State management of wolves, fee \nincreases, access issues, conservation, and troubled agency \nrelationships with sportspeople, farmers, and ranchers were some of the \nchallenges that Steve met head-on, and today Idaho is better off with \nhis years of leadership. Now, he will have the time to privately enjoy \nthe fields, streams, and mountains of Idaho that he took such good care \nof over the years. The man who will be ``taking his grandkids fishing'' \nwill be sorely missed, and his boots, hard to fill. I wish Steve \nhealth, success, and successful hunting and fishing, in his well-\ndeserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11183-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MISSISSIPPI HEIGHTS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, SAUK RAPIDS, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I honor Mississippi Heights \nElementary School, in Sauk Rapids, MN, which will soon earn an Award \nfor Excellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative \nachievements in educating children.\n  Mississippi Heights Elementary School is truly a model of educational \nsuccess. The school begins each school day by welcoming all staff and \npupils in the gym with a unique ``Lift Off'' program, which is led by \nthe children and is designed to recognize birthdays, make \nannouncements, and strengthen the school's strong sense of community. \nAnother special characteristic of Lift Off is its buddy system, which \nmatches each child in the primary classes with a buddy from the \nintermediate classes to act as a mentor. The buddies sit together at \nLift Off and read to each other before the program begins.\n  Mississippi Heights is dedicated to a successful literacy initiative, \nwhose goals are: implementation of a balanced literacy program that \nwill include independent shared, guided reading, writing, and read-\nalouds throughout the day; students' demonstration of individual \nimprovement in reading levels; reading and writing throughout the day \nwhich aims toward raising RIGBY and Guided Reading levels for each \nstudent; and daily reading aloud by teachers, with 5,000 read-aloud \nbooks as a building goal.\n  Teachers at Mississippi Heights have made reading and writing a top \npriority, and it shows in their enthusiasm and passion in the \nclassroom. The students' reading and writing scores have improved: More \nthan 30 percent of the students scored in the top level of the \nMinnesota Comprehensive Assessment in 2006, and the school earned four \nstars from the Minnesota Department of Education in reading this year.\n  Much of the credit for Mississippi Heights Elementary School's \nsuccess belongs to its principal, Jean Clark, and the dedicated \nteachers. The children and staff at Mississippi Heights Elementary \nSchool understand that in order to be successful a school must go \nbeyond achieving academic success; it must also provide a nurturing \nenvironment where children can develop the knowledge, skills, and \nattitudes for success throughout life. All of the faculty, staff, and \npupils at Mississippi Heights Elementary School should be very proud of \ntheir accomplishments.\n  I congratulate Mississippi Heights Elementary School in Sauk Rapids \nfor winning the Award for Excellence in Education and for its \nexceptional contributions to education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11183-4", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11183-S11184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NEVIS PUBLIC SCHOOL, NEVIS, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I honor Nevis Public School, \nin Nevis, MN, which will soon receive an Award for Excellence in \nEducation for its exceptional and innovative achievements in educating \nchildren.\n  Nevis Public School is truly a model of educational success. It is a \nunique\n\n[[Page S11184]]\n\nschool that utilizes the strengths of the teachers, community, and \nrural setting, as well as educational opportunities in the Twin Cities \nand elsewhere to provide its students with an exemplary learning \nenvironment.\n  The school's rural setting and connection to the local community \noffer many exceptional learning benefits for the students. The school \nis adjacent to an 80-acre school forest, which is often the classroom \nfor the forest management class, while local rivers serve as the \nclassroom for the aquatic management class. Each Earth Day, students \nplant trees in the school forest and throughout the community. Fourth-\ngraders attend an annual Agriculture in the Classroom presentation, and \nsixth-graders learn about lakes and aquatic management at the \nFreshwater Festival.\n  The school is committed to a well-rounded education for its students \nand makes a strong effort to expose them to learning opportunities \noutside of the community, as well. Students have gone on ecological \ntrips to Russia and Peru; the band and choir have traveled to Chicago; \nand students are given a variety of opportunities to travel to the Twin \nCities for theatrical, sporting, and educational events. Students in \nthe art program have been selected to display their work at the State \ncapitol; and, for the past 3 years, Nevis School students have earned \nscholarships to attend the Minneapolis College of Art and Design.\n  In 2006, Nevis School was recognized as an ``outperformer'' by \nStandard & Poor's School Evaluation Services.

To achieve this \ngoal, the staff uses a variety of instructional strategies to \naccommodate individual learning styles. The result is a creative \nlearning environment that is flexible, innovative, and highly \nsuccessful.\n  Lancaster Public School has been recognized by Standard & Poor's \nSchool Evaluation Services as a district that outperformed \ndemographically similar school districts in reading and math \nproficiency for 4 the past 4 school years. Lancaster Public School is 1 \nof only 10 school districts in Minnesota that have attained this \nstatus. This achievement is particularly impressive because Lancaster \nis the smallest school in the group, with only 212 students in grades \nkindergarten through grade 12, and the most economically disadvantaged \nwith 59.9 percent of the students qualifying for free and reduced \nlunch.\n  Lancaster Public School District has been recognized by the Minnesota \nDepartment of Education for making adequate yearly progress for the \npast 3 years. The school's high achievement on the Minnesota \nComprehensive Assessment tests has earned both the elementary and \nsecondary schools a five-star rating from the State Department of \nEducation in reading.\n  Much of the credit for Lancaster Public School's success belongs to \nits principal, Bradley Homstad, and the dedicated teachers.

Their efforts resulted in the Literacy \nCollaborative, which is designed to improve reading for all children.\n  The school's framework for literacy lessons is based on providing \nmultiple\n\n[[Page S11185]]\n\nopportunities to participate in reading and writing projects. Recently, \nChallenger Elementary pupils partnered with the Arctic Cat Corporation \nto create educational books about snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles \nfor elementary-age children. These books now are being sold nationwide.\n  Challenger Elementary has benefited greatly from the strong support \nof the school board, which backed the Literacy Collaborative \nfinancially, as well as the community, which donated more than $40,000 \nfor the school's book room. To date, staff members and volunteers have \ngiven more than 1,160 hours of their time preparing the book room, \nwhich boasts more than 5,000 volumes. Clearly, the Literacy \nCollaborative is more than a school initiative; it is also a prized \ncommunity initiative that has been embraced by many volunteers and \ngenerous donors.\n  The program's success is evident in the students' strong test scores. \nMinnesota Comprehensive Assessment scores have improved since the \ninitiation of the Literacy Collaborative, and Northwest Evaluation \nAssociation scores are also on the rise. In 2006, Challenger Elementary \nreceived four stars in reading from the Minnesota Department of \nEducation.\n  Much of the credit for Challenger Elementary School's success belongs \nto its principal, Patrick Marolt, and the dedicated teachers.

The school \nhas developed an early intervention program to identify children, early \nin their school career, who could have difficulties in reading and to \nprovide intensive assistance in both kindergarten and first grade. This \nprogram has been extremely successful and has served as a model for \nother Lakeville schools and other school districts throughout the \nState.\n  Lakeview Elementary challenges all pupils to excel in reading through \nparticipation in an extensive, out-of-school reading program called \n``Accelerated Reader.'' The AR program encourages children to read more \nand to increase comprehension through computer-based assessments, which \nthe\n\n[[Page S11186]]\n\nchildren take after reading each book. For their efforts, pupils earn \npoints, which they can then spend at the AR store twice a year.\n  Parents' involvement is another reason for Lakeview Elementary's \nexceptional performance. This fall, 99.6 percent of all parents \nattended their child's conferences. Parents are also very active in \nboth the Lakeville Elementary Volunteer Organization and in the Parent \nAdvisory Council. Last year, LEVO raised over $17,900 to improve the \neducational program, providing a poetry residency for all pupils, \nfunding two assembly presentations, purchasing lap-top computers for \nthe children's use, providing funds for transportation for all field \ntrips, expanding the number of AR tests available, and funding the new \nart bulletin boards.\n  Lakeview Elementary stresses the importance of being a good citizen \nthrough service projects. Last year, the children adopted an elementary \nschool in Louisiana in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and held a \nfundraiser to buy school supplies and coats for the displaced children. \nThis service project created a strong bond between the two schools, and \nthe children communicated with their counterparts throughout the school \nyear.

The school, which is designed according to the principles of \n``service and compassion,'' uses learning through service as a \nsupplement to scholarly study to deepen intellectual growth, build \ncharacter, and contribute to the community in a meaningful way. The \nschool views combining service with study as a powerful motivator for \ngiving young people a purpose to learn. In the context of service work, \nstudents writing a letter, making a brochure, or creating a book are \nencouraged to perform at a higher level because the audience is a real \none and because students have an authentic reason to communicate.\n  An integral part of the Schoolcraft culture is the weekly conflict \nmanagement/resolution class, which teaches peacekeeping skills. A group \nof 29 students, part of a Students Teaching Attitudes of Respect--\nSTAR--team, visits other schools to promote conflict resolution skills.\n  Schoolcraft deepens educational opportunities through a half-year \nintegrated unit of study during which a student conducts an in-depth \ninvestigation of a theme or topic through authentic research, projects, \nfield work, service, and reflection.\n  The success of Schoolcraft Learning Community is reflected in the \nstudents' development into self-directed, lifelong learners who have \nthe skills and knowledge to navigate confidently and compassionately in \nthe world. The school's strong test scores have also been recognized by \nthe Minnesota Department of Education; in 2006, Schoolcraft Learning \nCommunity received four stars in reading from the department.\n  Much of the credit for Schoolcraft Learning Community's success \nbelongs to its director and superintendent, Scott Anderson, and the \ndedicated teachers.

(BOB) EDMONDS\n\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize an \noutstanding officer upon his retirement from the U.S. Air Force. \nBrigadier General David K. ``Bob'' Edmonds will retire on February 1, \n2007, after almost 28 years of service. His successes and \naccomplishments have been significant and many. He has been recognized \nby his superiors and subordinates alike for his ability to motivate and \nlead teams and mentor future leaders. Today, it is my pleasure to \nrecognize some of General Edmond's many accomplishments and commend his \nservice to the Air Force, the Congress, and our grateful Nation.\n  Brigadier General Edmonds was born and raised in Charlotte, NC. He \ngraduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1979 as a distinguished \ngraduate and the top cadet in the civil engineering major. He was \nselected for a Guggenheim Fellowship at Columbia University and \ngraduated in May 1980 with a master of science degree in civil \nengineering. He began his Active Duty career at Columbus Air Force \nBase, Mississippi, where he completed undergraduate pilot training as a \ndistinguished graduate and was selected to fly the F-15 Eagle. He has \nserved in numerous flying positions throughout his career, both as an \ninstructor pilot and a commander, and led 45 combat missions with the \n53rd Tactical Fighter Squadron during Operation Desert Storm. He is a \ncommand pilot with over 2500 flight hours and 300 combat hours.\n  General Edmonds' last assignment was deputy director for operations, \nNational Military Command Center, the Joint Staff, Pentagon, where he \nled a team that performed initial analysis of developing military and \npolitical situations worldwide for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, the Secretary of Defense, and President of the United States. He \nalso performed nuclear watch in conjunction with the North American \nAerospace Defense Command and U.S. Strategic Command and was ready to \nadvise the President on available courses of action and transmit the \nPresident's nuclear decisions.\n  We especially remember General Edmonds' his service to the Congress \nas the Deputy Director for Air Force Legislative Liaison from 2003 to \n2004 and as the Chief of Air Force Senate Liaison from 2001 to 2003. \nDuring these tours of duty, he was responsible for articulating Air \nForce priorities and programs to members and their staffs and \nresponding to congressional inquiries regarding a broad range of \nissues.\n  From 1999 to 2001, General Edmonds was the 16th commander of the \n131st Fighter Wing, St. Louis, MO, where he uniquely served as an \nActive Duty officer commanding an Air National Guard Wing. He had great \nsuccess leading the Wing to achieve and maintain air superiority with \nthe F-15 Eagle aircraft and, accordingly, was awarded the 2001 \nExecutive of the Year for the St. Louis metropolitan region. Prior to \nassuming this command, he was the chief, Joint Requirements Division in \nthe Directorate of Force Structure, Resources, and Assessments, J-8, \nJoint Staff, at the Pentagon. In June 1997, he graduated from the \nNational War College as a Distinguished Graduate. From 1995 to\n\n[[Page S11188]]\n\n1996, he was a White House Fellow assigned as a Special Assistant to \nPhilip Lader, a member of President Clinton's Cabinet, and the \nAdministrator of the Small Business Administration.\n  In 1994, he served as commander of the 95th Fighter Squadron, Tyndall \nAir Force Base, Florida, where he commanded over 300 personnel and \nsupervised the operation of 26 F-15 aircraft. Under his leadership, the \nsquadron was recognized as the 325th Fighter Wing Squadron of the Year. \nPreviously, he served in the Air Force Headquarters, with the Air Staff \nTraining Program, and was an air officer commander, civil engineering \ninstructor, motorglider instructor pilot, and women's rugby coach at \nthe U.S. Air Force Academy.\n  On the eve of General Edmonds' retirement, I offer my congratulations \nto him, his wife Ann, his son Gregory, who is a freshman at the Air \nForce Academy, and daughter Katelyn. General Edmonds will be missed, \nand I know that I speak for all my colleagues in expressing my \nheartfelt appreciation to him. He is a credit to both the Air Force and \nthe United States of America. We wish our friend the best of luck in \nhis future endeavors and congratulate him on completion of an \noutstanding and successful active-duty career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11188-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CAROL HAGEL\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the \nimportant leadership of Carol Hagel upon her retirement from the \nIndiana Farm Bureau, Inc. Over the years, she has traveled tirelessly \nrepresenting Indiana agriculture in her position as the second vice \npresident and head of the Women's Division.\n  In 1985, the Indiana Farm Bureau and I conceived the idea of \nsponsoring a youth essay contest focusing on the importance of Indiana \nagriculture in their daily lives. Throughout the years, essay topics \nhave focused on health and nutrition, global trade, and most recently, \nalternative energy consumption. The Indiana Farm Bureau Women's \nDivision has generously given of its time to judge over 15,000 essays \nat the county, district, and State levels.\n  For the past several years, I have looked forward to visiting with \nCarol when she traveled to Washington, DC, with the State essay winners \nand their families.\n  Carol has been a true friend to Indiana agriculture, and I cherish \nour years of friendship. I hope that you will join me as we honor and \ncelebrate her many contributions to the State of Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11188-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. JENNIFER RICHESON\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge an \nextraordinary constituent of mine, Dr. Jennifer Richeson. An associate \nprofessor at Northwestern University, Jennifer has recently been named \na MacArthur Fellow.\n  Each year, the MacArthur Fellows Program typically accepts our \nNation's most ingenuous and diligent minds. The Program is highly \nselective; typically only 20 to 30 applicants are accepted. Moreover, \nalthough the fellowship grants a $500,000 stipend, it is not meant to \nbe a reward. Rather, it is an investment in the creative potential of \nour Nation. To activate this potential, the stipend is free of \nstipulations; scholars spend their grant on whatever projects they \nchoose.\n  In 1994, Dr. Richeson received a bachelor's degree in psychology from \nBrown University. Then, in 2000, Jennifer received a doctorate in \nsocial psychology from Harvard University. Now, at Northwestern, she \nhas used innovative research techniques to study the effects of racial \nstereotyping and discrimination on cognition and behavior. With the \nstipend she receives from her fellowship, Dr. Richeson will surely make \nfurther contributions to our society's understanding of psychological \nand racial issues.\n  I congratulate Dr. Richeson on her accomplishments. She is a model of \nacademic excellence and commitment, and I am proud to be her Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11188-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING LIEUTENANT GENENERAL JOHN R. VINES\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I honor LTG John R. Vines, \nthe commanding general of the XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg.\n  General Vines, an outstanding American soldier from Alabama, will \nsoon retire after more than 35 years of selfless service to this great \nNation in the U.S. Army. General Vines' dedication to our soldiers, \ncommitment to excellence, and performance of duty has been \nextraordinary throughout his career. General Vines' lifetime of service \nculminated in an assignment as the commanding general of the XVIII \nAirborne Corps and Fort Bragg, which he has held since 2003.\n  During his time in uniform, General Vines served in a succession of \ncommand and staff positions worldwide. The embodiment of an Army \nRanger, General Vines has served all over the world, commanding \nparatroopers in combat during three separate conflicts. As a battalion \ncommander in the 82nd Airborne Division, General Vines led a combat \nparachute assault in Operation Just Cause in Panama in 1989 and then \nled the same soldiers in Operation Desert Shield as the first ground \ncombat unit in the gulf.\n  Soon after the United States went to war in 2001, General Vines, as \ncommanding general of the 82nd Airborne Division, led his forces into \nAfghanistan as head of Coalition Task Force 82 and then assumed control \nof Combined/Joint Task Force 180 in Bagram. From January 2005 until \nJanuary 2006, General Vines served as the joint forces commander of \nMulti-National Corps Iraq in Operation Iraqi Freedom, becoming the \nfirst general officer to command forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  LTG John Vines holds a B.S. degree in chemistry from the University \nof Alabama and an M.A. degree in National Security and Strategy from \nthe Naval War College. His numerous awards and accolades include the \nDefense Distinguished Service Medal; Distinguished Service Medal; \nDefense Superior Service Medal, with Oak Leaf Cluster; Bronze Star \nMedal, with Oak Leaf Cluster; Legion of Merit, with Oak Leaf Cluster; \nCombat Infantryman Badge; Master Parachutist Badge, with Combat Star \nand the Ranger Tab.\n  During his distinguished Army career, General Vines earned a \nreputation as one of the Department of Defense's most forward-thinking \nand insightful leaders. Remembered by those who served under his \ncommand as both an extraordinary man and leader, General Vines wrote \npersonal condolence letters to the families of each one of his soldiers \nkilled in combat. General John Vines represents the epitome of what \nArmy leaders, soldiers, and the country expect from our military \nofficers. He is a sterling roll model for young soldiers. Well known as \nthe ``Soldiers' General,'' his commitment to the troops he led was \nunparalleled, even being quoted as saying that success in combat is not \nabout military hardware or technology. ``It boils down to the \nindividual soldiers. It's about having people who have the commitment, \nthe courage, the will, and the warrior values to confront the forces \nthat threaten us. And only so long as we have those men and women who \nare able and willing to confront this will we be safe.''\n  His service to the Nation has been exceptional, and General Vines is \nmore than deserving of this recognition. His sacrifices are appreciated \nand important to the freedom we enjoy every day. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in thanking LTG John Vines for his commendable service to \nour Nation and the U.S. Army. I thank his wife Pamela and his sons, \nJoshua and Jacob, for their steadfast support while he fulfilled this \nessential duty to our country. I personally wish the Vines' family all \nthe best as they celebrate General Vines' richly deserved \nretirement. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11188-4", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11188-S11189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO SOUTHERN OREGON REHABILITATION CENTER AND CLINICS\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, it is my sincere pleasure to \ncongratulate the Southern Oregon Rehabilitation Center and Clinics on \nbeing awarded the 15th Annual Secretary Robert W. Carey Performance \nExcellence Award. On November 16, 2006, the SORCC was honored with the \nCarey Award, an award given by the Department of Veterans Affairs \nacknowledging those VA organizations which exhibit performance and \norganizational excellence.\n  Nearly 400,000 of our Nation's veterans reside in the State of \nOregon.\n\n[[Page S11189]]\n\nThe service of these men and women makes me proud to be an Oregonian. \nUnfortunately, oftentimes with great heroism comes great risk. Mental \nimpairments, along with a variety of contributing factors, have led to \na large concentration of homeless veterans in Oregon, totaling roughly \none-third of Oregon's homeless population.\n  The SORCC in White City, Oregon directly focuses on the needs of the \nhomeless, mentally ill, and substance abusers. Serving for over 56 \nyears, the SORCC is the VA's only freestanding rehabilitation center, \ncarefully tailored to treat debilitating problems unaddressed by \nstandard VA medical centers and clinics. White City pays special \nattention to Oregon's substantial Veterans homeless population, with 75 \npercent of all applicants stating that they are without a home.\n  While about one-fourth of the Veterans living within the general \nproximity of the facility receive some type of care from the SORCC, its \nexclusivity in Veteran specialty care has attracted patients from over \n35 States. Potential patients are likely persuaded not solely by the \nspecialized treatment and expertise of the staff, but because of the \ntime invested in each patient's recovery. White City offers a variety \nof community activities which expedite patient development and growth, \nwhile forming valuable relationships with staffers. Perhaps most \nimpressive of all, the SORCC retains consistently high outpatient \nscores between 80 and 90 percent.\n  Referred to by many as ``The Dom,'' in reference to its history and \npresent role as a domiciliary, the SORCC is an important facility for \nOregon veterans who need treatment outside of the home. Just over two \nyears ago, the VA considered closing the White City facility. I was \nstrongly against the potential closure and worked to ensure that its \ndoors remained opened to our Nation's veterans. After careful \ndeliberation, the Department of Veterans Affairs concluded that its \nsuccess in treating difficult addiction cases is unheralded, and \nimmediately implemented plans to repair and expand the existing \nfacility.\n  The SORCC continues to operate and serve Oregon's veterans with high \nlevels of professionalism and success. The population served by White \nCity continues to expand, including more than 120 returning veterans \nfrom the global war on terrorism. I am privileged today to offer my \ncongratulations to the SORCC. Their continued commitment to safety, \ncompassion, and growth will serve as a model for VA organizations \nnationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/05/senate-section/article/S11189-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROBERT COOK\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Robert Cook of \nCentral High School in Rapid City, SD. Robert was named the 2006 \nTeacher of the Year by the National Indian Education Association.\n  As the English and social studies teacher at Central High School, \nRobert has played an integral and unique role in furthering the \neducation of South Dakota's students.

This possibility forced Americans to rethink \nsecurity in many different sectors including the need to secure \ninfrastructure such as our Nation's dams.\n  As a result of the 9/11 attacks, the Bureau of Reclamation set up \nsite security programs, implemented more complex surveillance systems, \nerected protection barriers, and devoted substantial funding in the \nprocess.\n  Initially, the Bureau covered these added security costs, recognizing \nthat water and power infrastructure benefits the public generally. This \nwas a pattern established after the Pearl Harbor attacks when the \nFederal Government covered the added security costs at these public \nfacilities.\n  Indeed, all Americans benefit from stable power sources and improved \nflood control. Other universal benefits of public dams include \nrecreation, water supply, and fish and wildlife.\n  However, in recent years the Bureau has begun to shift these costs \nonto the energy rate payers probably due to pressure from Office of \nManagement and Budget. Thus, hard working American families, many of \nwhom are family farmers with limited incomes, are forced to shoulder \nthis large financial burden. Shifting the burden of national security \nto family farmers is patently unfair.\n  Our bill amends the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act to require to \nclarify that consumers of public power must contribute to site security \nat Federal dams. However, the bill would limit their contribution to 15 \npercent of total security costs. This provides a more equitable \ndivision of dam security costs between local and national \nbeneficiaries. The bill also would require the Secretary of the \nInterior to involve project beneficiaries in the planning and building \nof site security. Finally, the bill requires the Bureau to provide \nCongress a five-year plan on dam security and an annual report of its \nexpenditures.\n  There is no question we need to protect our critical infrastructure. \nIt seems logical that the costs of these national and multi-purpose \nfacilities should not be imposed on a concentrated group of energy \nconsumers. However, customers who depend on the Bureau of Reclamation \nfacilities are willing to pay their fair allotment of the security \nreflected in this legislation.\n  I believe this bill strikes a good balance between reasonable costs \nand a legitimate amount of transparency. Ultimately, its about working \ntogether as Americans to protect our critical infrastructure and \nprovide a fair cost distribution system. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4079\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restore habeas corpus for those detained by the \nUnited States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which is \ncaptioned ``Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2006'' which I introduced \non behalf of myself and Senator Leahy.\n  The legislation which was adopted earlier this year on war crimes \nstruck out habeas corpus jurisdiction of the Federal courts, sought to \nlimit jurisdiction of the Federal courts on habeas corpus for \nGuantanamo detainees and others detained on charges of being enemy \ncombatants or war criminals.\n  There was very extended debate on the issue at that time. The bill \nreported by the Armed Services Committee and backed by the \nadministration eliminated the jurisdiction of the Federal courts. I \noffered an amendment to reinstate habeas corpus. It was defeated 51 to \n48. This legislation would reinstate habeas corpus jurisdiction of the \nFederal courts. It is my view that the Federal courts will strike down \nthe provisions in the legislation eliminating Federal court \njurisdiction for a number of reasons. One is that the Constitution of \nthe United States is explicit that habeas corpus may be suspended only \nin time of rebellion or invasion. We are suffering neither of those \nalternatives at the present time. We have not been invaded, and there \nhas not been a rebellion. That much is conceded.\n  There has been an effort made to contend that those constitutional \nrights are maintained with the very limited review which goes to the \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n  In the limited time I have today I will not go into great detail \nduring the course of the argument as it appears in the Congressional \nRecord as to why that does not maintain the traditional constitutional \nright of habeas corpus, a right which has existed in Anglo Saxon \njurisprudence since King John in 1215 at Runnymede. The Supreme Court \nof the United States in the Hamdi case made it plain that these habeas \ncorpus rights apply to aliens as well as to citizens.\n  The administration has taken the position now that someone who is \nmaking a charge of having been tortured, which is a violation of U.S. \nlaw, may not be permitted to disclose the specifics of his \ninterrogation which he says constituted torture because al-Qaida will \nfind out what our interrogation techniques are and will move to train \ntheir operatives so they can withstand those interrogations.\n  It is unthinkable, in my opinion, to have a system of laws where \nsomeone who claims to have been tortured cannot describe what has \nhappened to him to get judicial relief because al-Qaida may be able to \neducate or train their operatives to avoid those techniques.\n  I supported the ultimate legislation on war crimes tribunals because \nit provided for recognition of the Geneva Conventions. It also provided \nfor confrontation. It also provided for limitations on interrogation \ntechniques.\n  It was my view as I expressed it at the time that with the \nseverability clause the Federal courts would eliminate the restriction \non their jurisdiction. But as a precautionary matter, to put the matter \nin issue, this legislation is being introduced at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the summary of the Habeas Corpus \nRestoration Act of 2006 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2006\n\n       The bill strikes the new limitations on habeas corpus \n     created in the Military Commissions Act of 2006, Public Law \n     109-366, 2006 Stat. 3930.\n       The MCA added two new habeas provisions--\n       (1) A new paragraph in the federal habeas statute, 28 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2241(e), that would bar any alien detained by the \n     United States as an enemy combatant from filing a writ of \n     habeas corpus. The new paragraph was to apply to all pending \n     cases ``without exception'' thereby barring all pending \n     habeas corpus applications pending on behalf of Guantanamo \n     Bay detainees.\n       (2) An entirely new habeas corpus limitation that barred \n     any habeas review of military commission procedures. Had this \n     bill been passed before the Hamdan v. Rumsfeld case was \n     decided, the Supreme Court would not have had jurisdiction to \n     review and reject the military commission procedures that \n     were at issue. This new habeas limitation was added to \n     federal law as 10 U.S.C. Sec. 950j(b).\n       The Habeas Corpus Restoration Act would strike these two \n     provisions from the law in their entirety, thereby restoring \n     the right of aliens detained within U.S. territorial \n     jurisdiction (including at Gitmo) to challenge their \n     detention via file writs of habeas corpus.\n       Because the Military Commissions Act already completely \n     repealed and superseded the habeas limitations created by the \n     Graham Amendment to the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, the \n     bill would restore the state of play before the DTA.\n       Actual effect--The MCA would deprive federal courts of \n     jurisdiction to hear the 196 habeas corpus applications \n     currently pending on behalf of the detainees at Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba. This bill would restore jurisdiction and allow \n     those cases to be decided on their merits. It would also \n     allow habeas corpus challenges to military commission \n     procedures.\n\n\n    Article 1, Section 9, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution\n\n       ``The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be \n     suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the \n     public Safety may require it.''\n\n\n           Select United States Supreme Court Decision Quotes\n\n     Hamdi\n       In the 2004 Supreme Court decision of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, \n     Justice O'Connor stated,\n\n[[Page S11198]]\n\n     ``All agree that, absent suspension, the writ of habeas \n     corpus remains available to every individual detained within \n     the United States.''\n       Justice O'Connor was unequivocally in stating, ``[w]e have \n     long since made clear that a state of war is not a blank \n     check for the President when it comes to the rights of the \n     Nation's citizens.''\n       The Hamdi court made clear that ``[i]t is during our most \n     challenging and uncertain moments that our Nation's \n     commitment to due process is most severely tested; and it is \n     in those times that we must preserve our commitment at home \n     to the principles for which we fight abroad.''\n       Regarding habeas corpus, Justice O'Connor wrote, ``we have \n     made clear that, unless Congress acts to suspend it, the \n     Great Writ of habeas corpus allows the Judicial Branch to \n     play a necessary role in maintaining this delicate balance of \n     governance, serving as an important judicial check on the \n     Executive's discretion in the realm of detentions.''\n     Korematsu\n       In 1949, Justice Murphy dissented in Korematsu v. United \n     States: ``[i]ndividuals must not be left impoverished of \n     their constitutional rights on a plea of military necessity \n     that has neither substance nor support'' . . . ``[t]he \n     judicial test of whether the Government, on a plea of \n     military necessity, can validly deprive an individual of any \n     of his constitutional rights is whether the deprivation is \n     reasonably related to a public danger that is so `immediate, \n     imminent, and impending' as not to admit of delay and not to \n     permit the intervention of ordinary constitutional processes \n     to alleviate the danger.''\n\n\n  CSRTs are not an Adequate and Effective Substitute for Habeas Corpus\n\n       Combatant Status Review Tribunals, commonly referred to as \n     ``CSRTs,'' are not an adequate and effective means to \n     challenge detention in accordance with the Supreme Court's \n     decision in Swain v. Pressley (``the substitution of a \n     collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective \n     to test the legality of a person's detention does not \n     constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.'').\n       CSRTs are not adversarial, but consist of a one-sided \n     interrogation of the detainee by the tribunal members. The \n     proceedings do not comport with basic fairness because the \n     individuals detained do not have the right to confront \n     accusers, call witnesses, or know what evidence there is \n     against them. As Justice O'Connor wrote in her plurality \n     opinion in the Hamdi case, ``[a]n interrogation by one's \n     captor, however effective an intelligence-gathering tool, \n     hardly constitutes a constitutionally adequate factfinding \n     before a neutral decisionmaker.''\n       According to the September 25, 2006 Judiciary Committee \n     testimony of the former U.S. Attorney for the Northern \n     District of Illinois, Thomas Sullivan, who has been to \n     Guantanamo on many occasions and has represented many \n     detainees. Mr. Sullivan cited hearings where individuals were \n     summoned before the tribunal, but did not speak the language, \n     did not have an attorney, did not have access to the \n     information which was presented against them, and continued \n     to be detained.\n       For example, in the case of Abdul Hadi al Siba'i, a Saudi \n     Arabian police officer who came to Afghanistan in August 2001 \n     to build schools and a mosque, Mr. Sullivan described how Mr. \n     Siba'i had no lawyer, spoke through a translator, and was \n     read the charges against him, but with no access to the \n     underlying evidence. According to Mr. Sullivan, his client \n     was returned to Saudi Arabia after a prolonged detention \n     without a trial, compensation, or apology. Mr. Sullivan \n     received no notice that his client was to be returned to \n     Saudi Arabia.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4081\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Habeas Corpus Restoration \n     Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RESTORATION OF HABEAS CORPUS FOR THOSE DETAINED BY \n                   THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 2241 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by striking subsection (e).\n       (b) Title 10.--Section 950j of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended by striking subsection (b) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Limited Review of Military Commission Procedures and \n     Actions.--Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or in \n     section 2241 of title 28 or any other habeas corpus \n     provision, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or \n     consider any claim or cause of action whatsoever, including \n     any action pending on or filed after the date of the \n     enactment of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, relating \n     to the prosecution, trial, or judgment of a military \n     commission under this chapter, including challenges to the \n     lawfulness of procedures of military commissions under this \n     chapter.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE AND APPLICABILITY.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall--\n       (1) take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act; \n     and\n       (2) apply to any case that is pending on or after the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee and cosponsor the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of \n2006. This bill would restore the great writ of habeas corpus, a \ncornerstone of American liberty for hundreds of years that Congress and \nthe President rolled back in an unprecedented and unnecessary way with \nSeptember's Military Commissions Act.\n  I am also pleased to join Senator Dodd as a cosponsor of the \nEffective Terrorists Prosecution Act of 2006. That bill would likewise \nrestore the liberties guaranteed by the writ of habeas corpus. It would \nalso correct many of the other very disturbing provisions of the \nMilitary Commissions Act by narrowing that act's extremely broad \ndefinition of ``unlawful enemy combatants,'' excluding evidence \nobtained by coercion, and allowing defendants to review evidence used \nagainst them.\n  Habeas corpus provides a remedy against arbitrary detentions and \nconstitutional violations. It guarantees an opportunity to go to court, \nwith the aid of a lawyer, to prove one's innocence. As Justice Scalia \nstated in the Hamdi case: ``The very core of liberty secured by our \nAnglo-Saxon system of separated powers has been freedom from indefinite \nimprisonment at the will of the Executive.'' The remedy that secures \nthat most basic of freedoms is habeas corpus.\n  The Military Commissions Act eliminated that right, permanently, for \nany non-citizen determined to be an enemy combatant, or even \n``awaiting'' such a determination. That includes the approximately 12 \nmillion lawful permanent residents in the United States today, people \nwho work for American firms, raise American kids, and pay American \ntaxes. This new law means that any of these people can be detained, \nforever, without any ability to challenge their detention in federal \ncourt--or anywhere else--simply on the Government's say-so that they \nare awaiting determination whether they are enemy combatants.\n  I regret that Chairman Specter and I were unsuccessful in our efforts \nto stop this injustice when the President and the Republican leadership \ninsisted on rushing the Military Commissions Act through Congress in \nthe lead-up to the elections. We supported an amendment which would \nhave removed the habeas-stripping provision from the Military \nCommissions Act. It failed by just three votes. I was saddened that the \nbill passed even with this poisonous habeas provision. Since then, the \nAmerican people have spoken against the administration's ``stay the \ncourse'' approach to national security and against a rubber stamp \nCongress that accommodated this administration's efforts to grab more \nand more power.\n  When we debated Chairman Specter's amendment to remove the habeas-\nstripping provision back in September, I spelled out a nightmare \nscenario about a hard-working legal permanent resident who makes an \ninnocent donation to, among other charities, a Muslim charity that the \nGovernment thinks might be funneling money to terrorists. I suggested \nthat, on the basis of this donation and perhaps a report of \n``suspicious behavior'' from an overzealous neighbor based on visits \nfrom Muslim guests, the permanent resident could be brought in for \nquestioning, denied a lawyer, confined, and even tortured. And this \nlawful permanent resident would have no recourse in the courts for \nyears, for decades, forever.\n  Many people viewed this kind of nightmare scenario as fanciful, just \nthe rhetoric of a politician. It was not. It is all spelled out clearly \nin the language of the law that this body passed. Last month, the \nscenario I spelled out was confirmed by the Department of Justice \nitself in a legal brief submitted in a Federal court in Virginia. The \nJustice Department, in a brief to dismiss a detainee's habeas case, \nsaid that the Military Commissions Act allows the Government to detain \nany noncitizen declared to be an enemy combatant without giving that \nperson any ability to challenge his detention in court. This is true, \nthe Justice Department said, even for someone arrested and imprisoned \nin the United States. The\n\n[[Page S11199]]\n\nWashington Post wrote that the brief ``raises the possibility that any \nof the millions of immigrants living in the United States could be \nsubject to indefinite detention if they are accused of ties to \nterrorist groups.''\n  In fact, the situation is more stark even than the Washington Post \nstory suggested. The Justice Department's brief says that the \nGovernment can detain any noncitizen declared to be an enemy combatant. \nBut the law this Congress passed says the Government need not even make \nthat declaration; they can hold people indefinitely who are just \nawaiting determination whether or not they are enemy combatants. It \ngets worse. Republican leaders in the Senate followed the White House's \nlead and greatly expanded the definition of ``enemy combatants'' in the \ndark of night in the final days before the bill's passage, so that \nenemy combatants need not be soldiers on battlefield. They can be \npeople who give money, or people that any group of decisionmakers \nselected by the President decides to call enemy combatants. The \npossibilities are chilling.\n  The administration has made it clear that they intend to use every \nexpansive definition and unchecked power given to them by the new law. \nLast month's Justice Department brief made clear that any of our legal \nimmigrants could be held indefinitely without recourse in court. \nEarlier in November, the Justice Department went to court to say that \ndetainees who had been held in secret CIA prisons could not even meet \nwith lawyers because they might tell their lawyers about the cruel \ninterrogation techniques used against them. In other words, if our \nGovernment tortures somebody, that person loses his right to a lawyer \nbecause he might tell the lawyer about having been tortured. A law \nprofessor was quoted as saying about the government's position in that \ncase: ``Kafka-esque doesn't do it justice. This is `Alice in \nWonderland.' '' We are not talking about nightmare scenarios here. We \nare talking about today's reality.\n  We have eliminated basic legal and human rights for the 12 million \nlawful permanent residents who live and work among us, to say nothing \nof the millions of other legal immigrants and visitors who we welcome \nto our shores each year. We have removed the check that our legal \nsystem provides against the Government arbitrarily detaining people for \nlife without charge, and we may well have made many of our remaining \nlimits against torture and cruel and inhuman treatment obsolete because \nthey are unenforceable. We have removed the mechanism the Constitution \nprovides to check Government overreaching and lawlessness.\n\n  This is wrong. It is unconstitutional. It is un-American. It is \ndesigned to ensure that the Bush-Cheney administration will never again \nbe embarrassed by a U.S. Supreme Court decision reviewing its unlawful \nabuses of power. The conservative Supreme Court, with seven of its nine \nmembers appointed by Republican Presidents, has been the only check on \nthe Bush-Cheney administration's lawlessness. Certainly the outgoing \nrubberstamp Republican Congress has not done it, or even investigated \nit. With passage of the Military Commissions Act, the Republican \nCongress completed the job of eviscerating its role as a check and \nbalance on the administration.\n  Abolishing habeas corpus for anyone who the Government thinks might \nhave assisted enemies of the United States is unnecessary and morally \nwrong. It is a betrayal of the most basic values of freedom for which \nAmerica stands. It makes a mockery of the Bush-Cheney administration's \nlofty rhetoric about exporting freedom across the globe.\n  Admiral John Hutson testified before the Judiciary Committee that \nstripping the courts of habeas jurisdiction was inconsistent with \nAmerican history and tradition. He concluded, ``We don't need to do \nthis. America is too strong.'' Even Kenneth Starr, the former \nindependent counsel and Solicitor General to the first President Bush, \nwrote that the Constitution's conditions for suspending habeas corpus \nhave not been met, and that doing so would be problematic.\n  Under the Constitution, a suspension of the writ may only be \njustified during an invasion or a rebellion, when the public safety \ndemands it. Six weeks after the deadliest attack on American soil in \nour history, the Congress that passed the PATRIOT Act rightly concluded \nthat a suspension of the writ would not be justified. Yet 6 weeks \nbefore a midterm election, the Bush-Cheney administration and the \nRepublican Congress deemed a complete abolition of the writ their \nhighest priority. Notwithstanding the harm the administration has done \nto national security with its mismanaged misadventure in Iraq, there \nwas no new national security crisis. There was only a Republican \npolitical crisis. The people have now spoken, and it is time to reverse \nthe dangerous choices this Congress made.\n  Rolling back the Military Commissions Act's disastrous habeas \nprovision will set the stage for us to approach that issue in a way \nconsistent with our needs and our values. We should take steps to \nensure that our enemies can be tried efficiently and quickly and to \nprevent our courts from being tied up with frivolous suits. But \nabolishing the writ of habeas corpus for millions of legal immigrants \nand others, denying their right to get into court to challenge \nindefinite detainment on the Government's say-so, is not the answer.\n  I hope that others will hear the call of the American people for a \nnew direction and work to correct these and other problems with the new \nlaw, including the gutting of the War Crimes Act, which I was proud to \nhelp spearhead with strong bipartisan support in 1997.\n  I will keep working on these issues until we restore the checks and \nbalances that make our country great. We can ensure our security \nwithout giving up our liberty.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO:\n  S. 4082.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 3678, the \nPandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act. This bipartisan bill, which \nwas drafted closely with Senator Kennedy, will improve our public \nhealth and medical preparedness and responses during emergencies and \ndisasters. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his partnership \non this important legislation. I also thank Chairman Enzi for his \nleadership, Majority Leader Frist, Senator Gregg and all 14 bipartisan \ncosponsors of this legislation for their hard work and support.\n  S. 3678 achieves two overarching goals. It reauthorizes the \nBioterrorism Act of 2002, which was signed into law\n\n[[Page S11236]]\n\nfollowing the terrorist attacks of September 11 and expired at the end \nof September, and it builds on the Project Bioshield Act of 2004, to \nspeed up the development of drug and vaccine countermeasures against \nbioterrorist and other public health threats.\n  In June 2002, President Bush signed the Bioterrorism Act into law and \nstated the legislation was proof that ``When people of both parties \nwork together, they can work on behalf of our country.'' Over the last \n2 years, S. 3678 has been developed through the same bipartisan \nprocess. We all understand that the threats of bioterrorism and other \npublic health emergencies, such as pandemic flu, are very real and we \nare committed to act now to protect the American people.\n  We know we must act now, before avian flu reaches our shores, before \nthe next hurricane devastates a great city, before a bioterrorist \nattack kills an innocent American.\n  The threat of bioterrorism remains. Around the world, radical \nreligious groups are being urged to establish new terror cells that \nspecialize in biological warfare. It is increasingly easy to access \nInternet guides to bioterrorism, including methods for contaminating \nfood and water supplies and spreading deadly microbes using do-it-\nyourself sprayers.\n  We often think of smallpox and anthrax as the gravest bioterrorism \nthreats; however, as science and technology advance, the number of \nworrisome agents is expanding. In fact, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity recently determined that an additional nine biological agents \npresent material threats against the United States sufficient to affect \nnational security.\n  It is clear we will not keep up with new and emerging threats if we \ncontinue to be constrained by practices and procedures which require, \nfor example, a decade to develop a new drug or vaccine countermeasure. \nInstead, we must take a faster, more creative approach to developing \nflexible, dynamic defenses against these threats.\n  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita proved once again that Mother Nature can \nbe extremely destructive. And now, the United States is preparing for a \npotential flu pandemic that may be carried by birds. The biodefense \nplan laid out in this bill will enable us to be more flexible and will \nallow us to rapidly respond to all-hazards emergencies--be they \nnatural, deliberate, or accidental.\n  We take five key actions in S. 3678, which will better prepare the \nNation for the all-hazards public health emergencies of the future.\n  First, the bill puts someone in charge. After Hurricane Katrina, it \nwas unclear who was in charge of our public health and medical response \nto this devastating storm. I believe unity of command and control is \nthe key to rapid emergency response. This legislation identifies the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services as the lead Federal official for \npublic health and medical response to emergencies, thereby eliminating \nconfusion and chaos and increasing accountability and predictability. \nS. 3678 also unifies HHS preparedness and response programs under a \nrenamed Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, ensuring \nsomeone in the Federal Government is constantly improving our \npreparedness.\n  Second, S. 3678 funds State and local preparedness. We know the best \nemergency response begins at the local level. My bill reauthorizes over \n$1 billion per year in grants from HHS for State and local public \nhealth and medical preparedness. Authorization for these \nimportant grant programs expired in September 2006. The legislation \nalso stresses accountability and fiscal responsibility in order to \nmeasure the progress made through these funds, and it requires States \nto match Federal investments in preparedness, beginning in 2009.\n\n  Third, the bill improves public health security. Public health \ndepartments across the country have varying abilities to identify a \ncase of bird flu and contain its spread. S. 3678 establishes a set of \nkey capabilities that all health departments must strive for. It also \nmodernizes how public health departments detect, respond to, and manage \npublic health threats, by collecting instant electronic information \nwhich will enable public health officials to make informed decisions \nbefore, during, and after a public health emergency.\n  Fourth, S. 3678 will speed up emergency medical response. During the \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina, it was too difficult for willing health \ncare providers to volunteer their time and provide much-needed medical \nexpertise to the gulf coast region. My bill makes it easier for health \ncare providers to volunteer in emergency situations, and it enables the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to provide liability protections \nfor approved volunteers. This legislation also promotes the use of \nmobile hospitals and alternative Federal facilities which can help \nhandle an increased number of patients during an emergency. \nAdditionally, the bill improves planning and logistics for health care \nproviders and volunteers to ensure emergency medical care can be \ndelivered faster during a disaster.\n  Finally, the bill ensures the development of more drug and vaccine \ncountermeasures to combat public health emergencies. The process for \ndeveloping a new medical countermeasure still takes up to a decade and \ncosts hundreds of millions of dollars. S. 3678 will improve our ability \nto quickly develop drugs and vaccines to protect against threats such \nas bird flu and bioterrorism. It reorganizes and enhances HHS medical \ncountermeasure research, development, and procurement activities, \nthrough the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or \nBARDA. Modeled after the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's \nsuccesses in defense research, BARDA will bring innovation to a process \nthat is simply too slow to combat terrorist activities or Mother \nNature.\n  Making the Government more dynamic, nimble, and accountable will \nbring more and better medical countermeasures to the public faster case \nof emergency.\n  In closing, I applaud my Senate colleagues for taking a decisive step \nforward today in improving the Nation's preparedness for all-hazards \npublic health emergencies--including acts of terrorism and those \nbrought to us by Mother Nature, by passing S. 3678, the Pandemic and \nAll-Hazards Preparedness Act.\n  I would like to thank the staff of my Subcommittee on Bioterrorism \nand Public Health Preparedness for their hard work, Jennifer Bryning, \nKendall Byrum, Jenny Ware, Heidi Swygard, former staff director, Dr. \nBob Kadlec, and former Senate fellow, David Marcozzi. Also, thank you \nto the majority leader's staff, especially Elizabeth Hall. Thank you to \nChairman Enzi's staff, Katherine McGuire, Ilyse Schuman, Steve \nNorthrup, and David Schmickel. Thank you to Senator Kennedy's staff for \ntheir hard work, David Bowen, and Caya Lewis. And thank you to Senator \nGregg's staff for their support, David Fisher, and Richard Weiblinger.\n  Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to travel to the Gulf Coast \nto learn from the disaster of Hurricane Katrina. It is our solemn \nresponsibility to do all we can to make sure our Federal response is \nbetter. I want to also thank the many State and local public health \nofficials from across the country, the hospitals, health care \nproviders, elected officials, patients, EMT personnel and citizens who \ngave us their ideas and shared their experiences in this process. \nTogether, we have laid out a plan to improve our Nation's public health \nand to better respond to disasters in the future.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this afternoon, the Senate will consider \nlegislation that will have far-reaching effects on the Nation's \nreadiness for bioterrorist attacks, epidemics, and other public health \nemergencies.\n  The passage of the bill today is the culmination of a long process \nthat our subcommittee, under the able leadership of Senator Burr, \nconducted to evaluate recommendations for renewing and strengthening \nthe public health legislation enacted in 2002 and the BioShield \nproposal enacted the following year.\n  That was no small challenge. Our lack of preparedness was painfully \nclear to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who suffered and are \nstill suffering in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Today we face the possibility of a pandemic or a bioterrorist attack, \nwhich could be as bad as a Hurricane\n\n[[Page S11237]]\n\nKatrina in every community in America. We know that we are not yet \nready for a catastrophe of that scale.\n  We need new medicines and new vaccines to protect against the disease \nthreats of the twenty-first century. Yet many biotechnology companies \nare unwilling to invest in this area because of its uncertain \ncommercial rewards.\n  Congress previously enacted the BioShield law to provide a guaranteed \nmarket for these products, but that program has been implemented poorly \nand has failed to live up to its promise.\n  Our legislation makes improvements in BioShield and supplements it by \ncreating a new agency based on the successful model of DARPA, which has \nenhanced the development of important new products for our national \ndefense. In recent years, the innovative research funded by DARPA has \nled to breakthroughs in supercomputers, robotics, materials science, \nnanotechnology, and in many other areas. Through the creation of a new \nagency, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency, we can \nemulate that success in the development of new vaccines and medicines.\n  But creating new products is only half the story. The newest vaccines \nand the most sophisticated technology are of little value if our \nhospitals and health agencies are overwhelmed and underequipped.\n  Time and again, Congress has called on the administration to take the \nsteps needed to protect America against these new threats. But time and \nagain, the response has been insufficient.\n  In 2000, Congress enacted the Frist-Kennedy legislation to provide a \nframework for bioterrorism preparedness. In the first year after the \nlegislation was enacted, these programs received just $1 million out of \nthe $360 million called for by the legislation.\n  Even in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the administration \ninitially proposed only $50 million to upgrade our hospitals and \nemergency rooms, and requested only $125 million to improve our health \nagencies. Thanks to the leadership of Senator Daschle, Senator Frist, \nand Senator Byrd, and of now-Senator Burr when he served in the House, \nCongress rejected these recommendations and provided over half a \nbillion dollars for hospital readiness and nearly a billion dollars for \nhealth agencies.\n  Yet the administration has cut these needed funds. The support for \nhospital readiness through HRSA has decreased from $518 million in 2003 \nto $483 this year. The story is the same in the CDC program to improve \nour health agencies. Funding has dropped from $939 million in 2003 to \n$834 million this year.\n  Is it any wonder that study after study shows that America is not \nready for a biological attack? Our former colleague, Senator Lowell \nWeicker, is chairman of the board of the Trust for America's Health, \nwhich convened a panel of experts in public health to assess each \nState's readiness for bioterrorism. The sad story is that no State was \nfully ready. Even the most prepared States scored only 8 out of 10 on \nmeasures of basic preparedness.\n  And these measures don't ask the impossible. One measure is whether a \nState has plans to ensure continuity of care in an emergency. Another \nis whether the State can provide additional ventilator beds for ten--\nyes, just ten--additional patients. Even on these basic measures of \nreadiness the majority of States scored a five or worse--and four \nStates scored only a woeful 2 out of 10.\n  We have seen the consequences of failure. Now we must prepare for \nsuccess.\n  With this bill, we take many important steps to increase our \npreparedness and response capabilities for public health emergencies. \nThis bill will increase our medical surge capacity, strengthen our \npublic health infrastructure, and clarify the responsibilities of \nFederal officials.\n  The first response to emergencies happens at the State and local \nlevel. But State and local governments were quickly overwhelmed by the \nmagnitude of the tragedy during Hurricane Katrina and would soon be \noverwhelmed in a pandemic. Federal assistance is essential. But for the \npast 4 years, we have been giving States money for public health \npreparedness without giving them adequate guidance on how to spend it. \nThis bill reauthorizes these grants to State and local public health \ndepartments, but now provides benchmarks, performance standards and \nincreased technical assistance from HHS that will allow State and local \ngovernments to improve their performance.\n  Accurate and up-to-the-minute information is essential to managing an \nemergency. Health information technology is the key to a more effective \nhealth care system in so many areas, and it can immeasurably improve \nour ability to monitor a health emergency. Our legislation includes an \nimportant program to harness the power of health IT to aid our health \nemergency response.\n  We must learn the lessons of the past and see that our hospitals and \nhealth professionals can treat the victims of disease, that our health \nagencies can detect disease threats rapidly and accurately and that all \nparts of our society have adequate plans to contain a disease outbreak. \nThis bill takes the right steps to better prepare our Nation for the \nnext public health emergency, no matter what its source. I urge my \ncolleagues to approve this proposal and to work with us to see that we \ncan send it to the President's desk before the end of the Congress.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nat the desk be agreed to, the committee-reported amendment, as amended, \nbe agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
