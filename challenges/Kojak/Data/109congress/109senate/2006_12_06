Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor and Pensions be discharged from further \nconsideration of H.R. 6143, and the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection it is so ordered. \nThe clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6143) to amend title XXVI of the Public Health \n     Service Act to revise and extend the program for providing \n     life-saving care for those with HIV/AIDS.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today marks an important milestone in our \nongoing national struggle with HIV and AIDS. Twenty-five years ago, the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention issued its first warning \nabout the disease we now know as AIDS. Today, we approve the third \nextension of the Ryan White CARE Act, the comprehensive legislation \nfirst enacted in 1990, for the prevention and treatment of HIV and \nAIDS.\n  In those early days, the Nation failed on all levels to recognize the \ndanger posed by this disease. Its victims suffered in silence and \nstigma. Shamefully, those who had the power to help did nothing.\n  Then, mid-eighties, a young boy's courage awakened the Nation to the \nvery real tragedy of AIDS. A disease that had seemed distant was \nsuddenly threatening us all, and we could no longer claim that it was \nsomeone else's problem. We realized it was a virus that knows no color, \nreligion, political affiliation, or income status. And I think Ryan \nWhite would be proud of the effort we are putting forth today with this \ncompromise we have worked hard on for the last few months.\n  In 1987, Senator Hatch and I introduced bipartisan legislation \ncalling for a comprehensive national strategy of education, prevention, \nand research to halt the spread of AIDS. We called on government, the \npublic health community, and the media to all do their part in order to \nprevent the AIDS epidemic from continuing its rampage across America.\n  We were optimistic that we were poised to handle this challenge more \neffectively than at any previous point in our history. We would not \nlose the battle, unless we failed to wage it with wisdom, reason, \ndignity, and common sense.\n  Yet the battle continues. We mourn the 500,000 Americans we have lost \nto the AIDS virus. Each victim is a human tragedy--so much potential \nlost before its time. But we take heart in the fact that AIDS is no \nlonger a death sentence. Through testing and treatment, people are \nliving long and full lives with HIV. We are identifying victims earlier \nin the progression of the disease and keeping them healthier longer.\n  But we still have a long way to go. Many who live with HIV and AIDS \ndo not have insurance to pay for costly treatments. As a result, heavy \ndemands are placed on community-based organizations and State and local \ngovernments. For these citizens, the Ryan White CARE Act continues to \nprovide the only means to obtain the care and treatment they need. It \ndoesn't matter where they live.\n  Americans agree. Seventeen percent of our people name HIV as the most \nurgent health problem facing the country, just behind cancer and heart \ndisease. Sixty-three percent say the Government is spending too little \nat home to fight HIV and AIDS. Six in ten believe more spending on \nprevention and testing will help slow the spread of this disease.\n  Four in ten say they know someone with HIV. Eighty-one percent say \ndiscrimination against people living with HIV or AIDS is a fact of life \nin America today.\n  We have far to go in educating people about the disease. Thirty-seven \npercent of Americans fear the spread of HIV through kissing, twenty-two \npercent by sharing a drinking glass, and sixteen percent by touching a \ntoilet seat, none of which are true.\n  We have not finished the job we started 25 years ago.\n  The Ryan White Care Act began as an emergency response to the crisis \nin urban areas, but today it represents a national plan to provide care \nand support for persons living with HIV and AIDS anywhere in America--\nurban or rural, coastal or inland.\n  This bill represents a working agreement among States, cities, \ncommunity-based organizations, hospitals and health providers, and \npersons living with HIV and AIDS their families and advocates.\n  It responds to an evolving epidemic that continues to grow in the \nvery cities and States that have long borne the greatest burden of \ndisease. It is expanding into regions of the country that have been \nhistorically less affected.\n  With this bill, we take a major step toward a more effective \nresponse. It preserves access to life-saving medications, quality \nhealth care, and support services for persons living with HIV and AIDS \nwho have come to depend on publicly-funded systems. It extends this \nsystem of quality care to persons with HIV and AIDS who have faced long \nwaiting lists for medications and severe limits on their access to \nspecialty health care. It protects governmental and community-based \ninstitutions charged with providing this care, all of whom face growing \ncase loads and the greater challenges of an evolving population of \npersons with HIV/AIDS. It balances the needs of high-prevalence cities \nand States with those facing rapidly growing epidemics. It ensures \nthose who have been relying on their local system of care that it will \ncontinue to be there for them. It reassures persons seeking tests for \nHIV that comprehensive care and support will also be ready to serve \nthem. And it authorizes the expenditure of $7 billion over the next 3 \nyears to carry out this mission.\n  This legislation is good for Massachusetts.\n  This bill recognizes the added burden facing States like \nMassachusetts that have increasing numbers of people with HIV and AIDS \nliving in cities like Boston. It ensures sufficient resources to \nmaintain a HIV/AIDS service system\n\n[[Page S11241]]\n\nstrained by a rising case load. It stabilizes funding to the State and \nstabilizes funding to the city of Boston because a larger portion of \ntheir award will be based on a predictable formula.\n  The bill continues to provide significant Federal support for the \nState medication assistance program, lessening the possibility of \nhaving to create cruel waiting lists for life-saving medications. It \neliminates the uncertainty of an untried severity of need index.\n  Both Massachusetts and Boston benefit from having the State's HIV \ncases counted for the first time, for next 3 to 4 years. This will \nallow my State of Massachusetts to continue to focus on providing \nquality care and support services to people living with HIV and AIDS.\n  At its best, America has the finest HIV/AIDS care system--one we as a \nNation should be proud to hold up as the gold standard of care \nthroughout the world. Our goal in this legislation is to make it also \nthe fairest system of care--with equal access for all, high standards \nfor quality, and guaranteed continuity of care. At last, access to all \nthe benefits of medical science will no longer be the result of \ngeography.\n  This bill is a product of effective advocacy, creative thinking, a \nsense of shared responsibility, and a common commitment to getting it \ndone. The Nation is fulfilling the promise of the original Care Act, \nfirst created in an era of limited treatment options and uncertain \nprognosis, to bring hope to persons living with the infection that they \nmay live healthy and productive lives.\n  It is also complex legislation, and all our committee staff, both \nDemocrat and Republican, deserve great credit for working long nights \nand weekends over the past several months. In particular, I thank \nKeysha Brooks-Coley, Lauren Brumsted, Ann Gavaghan, Lisa German, Ann \nGrady, Elizabeth Hoffman, Bruce Lesley, Tamar Magarik, and Michael \nWoody. And I give special thanks to Shana Christrup of Senator Enzi's \nstaff for her diligence and desire to make the world a better place for \npeople living with HIV and AIDS.\n  This was a clear bipartisan effort, by the House and Senate, and I am \ngrateful as well to staff from the House of Representatives, including \nMelissa Bartlett of Congressman Barton's staff and John Ford and \nWilliam Garner of Congressman Dingell's staff.\n  On my own staff, I especially commend several who worked so long and \nhard and well on this legislation--Alice Lam, Megan Gerson, Caya Lewis, \nCody Keenan, Ches Garrison, Daniel Dawes and Michael Myers, and above \nall to Connie Garner, whose passion, counsel, and commitment I value so \nhighly on this and many other issues. She never once let us forget what \nthis debate is truly about.\n  My hope is that as we continue to improve the Ryan White CARE Act to \nmeet the needs of this disease, the remedies we adopt will continue to \ncome from the bright lights of science, not the dark fears of bigotry. \nThis is an important day for people living with HIV and AIDS and for \nall Americans. We must do more to provide care and support for those \ncaught in the epidemic. This legislation will give us the time and \nsupport we need to accomplish that goal.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has been able \nto come to an agreement and adopt H.R. 6143, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS \nTreatment Modernization Act of 2006.\n  With this agreement, we finally reauthorize the only Federal program \nthat helps low-income individuals living with HIV/AIDS. We tried to \npass this critical legislation earlier this year, and even though this \neffort has enjoyed large bipartisan support in both Chambers, just a \nfew Members prevented its passage.\n  We worked to address their concerns in this compromise, and I am very \nglad to see the success of that endeavor. I would like to thank HELP \nCommittee Chairman Enzi and Ranking Minority Member Kennedy, and \nothers, for their tireless efforts throughout the reauthorization \nprocess. It has taken quite a long time to get here, and I commend \neveryone for their hard work. No one knows this more than Senator \nKennedy, with whom I authored the original Ryan White CARE Act back in \n1990, and I am very proud that our work has been able to help so many \npeople.\n  This bill may not be perfect, but it will continue a vital program \nthat needs to be continued. Importantly, it will help stabilize the \ndistribution of CARE Act funding in areas of the country where the AIDS \nepidemic is largest and also increase access to areas that have seen \nlarge numbers of new HIV infections.\n  Many of us in the Senate recently received a letter from 99 AIDS \norganizations that endorse this reauthorization. These are national and \nlocal organizations that provide services to people living with HIV/\nAIDS--they are the ones out there actually working with them, not \nsitting here in Washington, just talking about it. They have been \ninvolved throughout this entire reauthorization process--they have seen \nall the proposals and compromises--and they support this legislation.\n  I thank these individuals for their participation in and contribution \nto the lengthy reauthorization process because the end product would \nnot be effective without their input.\n  I am especially thankful for the insight of Jennifer Brown, the State \nAIDS director in my home State of Utah, who helped me throughout \nnegotiations to understand the possible effects of changes in the \nprogram.\n  I would like to read a portion of the letter sent by the AIDS \norganizations, which I think reiterates a very important message:\n\n       It is time to put aside regional differences and individual \n     jurisdictional concerns, and act on behalf of all Americans \n     who are living with this terrible disease. If Congress fails \n     to act before adjournment, many of our citizens will lose \n     life saving medical care, drug treatment and the support \n     services necessary for them to lead healthy, productive \n     lives.\n\n  This message has been quite clear for some time. We received this \nmessage from the HIV/AIDS community, from our constituents, and from \nthe President.\n  Everyone has urged us here in the Senate to work in the best \ninterests of the entire Nation and pass this reauthorization, and I am \npleased that we have been able to do so.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today the Senate affirmed its commitment to \nensuring access to quality care for all Americans living with HIV and \nAIDS no matter their race, gender, or where they live. Today we finally \nhave unanimous consent to pass H.R. 6143, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS \nTreatment Modernization Act.\n  Senator Kennedy and I and our counterparts in the House have worked \nfor nearly 2 years to address the concerns from every State and the \nhundreds of stakeholders who participated in our outreach efforts. We \nhave reached broad consensus that this is the right policy at the right \ntime.\n  In the past few weeks, we have received letters of support from more \nthan 100 leading AIDS service organizations calling for us to pass this \nlegislation now.\n  The Ryan White law must reflect the principle that every American \nliving with HIV/AIDS deserves access to quality care, and this \nreauthorization is a step toward our goal of just and equitable \ntreatment under this law. Our action today will ensure a more equitable \nprogram to provide not only AIDS patients but also HIV-positive \nAmericans with the treatment they desperately need.\n  The HIV/AIDS epidemic of today affects more women, more minorities, \nand more people in rural areas and the South than ever before. While we \nhave made significant progress in understanding and treating this \ndisease, there is still much more we must do to ensure equitable \ntreatment for all Americans living with this disease.\n  The epidemic is shifting, and our Federal programs must shift to meet \nthis need and fight the epidemic where it is today and will be \ntomorrow, not where it was 10 or 20 years ago. The legislation passed \nunanimously by the Senate today does just that.\n  An alarming 1.1 million Americans are living with HIV/AIDS today and \nthe face of the epidemic is rapidly changing. The Kaiser Family \nFoundation has reported that while the number of AIDS cases in the \nNation rose by 1 percent between 2000 and 2001, it rose by 9 percent in \nthe South and fell by 8 percent in the Northeast.\n  Newly infected people are increasingly likely to be poor, have \ninadequate access to health care, and be members of a minority \ncommunity.\n\n[[Page S11242]]\n\nFor example, African Americans make up 19 percent of the South's \npopulation but accounted for over 60 percent of new cases in 2003. In \naddition, the growing number of rural Americans infected with HIV face \nalready overburdened rural health care systems that have too few \ndoctors, underdeveloped support systems, and long travel distances to \ncare.\n  Rural States and States in the South have a newer epidemic, with more \nHIV than AIDS cases, while urban areas with a longer history of the \ndisease have a much higher percentage of AIDS cases. Because of old \nformulas that counted only AIDS cases, more than 100,000 Americans with \nHIV went uncounted, resulting in drastic funding disparities across the \nNation. This has crippled the ability of health systems in rural and \nfrontier States, like Wyoming, to confront this growing crisis.\n  Today, with the unanimous passage of the compromise bill, the Senate \nhas begun to correct these inequities and ensure that those \ntraditionally overlooked by this program will receive the care and \ntreatment they desperately need. The Ryan White program can now begin \nto address the epidemic of today, not yesterday, and treat the full \nspectrum of this disease.\n\n  This legislation strengthens and modernizes the Ryan White program to \nensure that all Americans with HIV and AIDS are counted, that \nappropriate funding is provided to those on the ground fighting this \nepidemic, and that State and city care systems are protected so they \ncan continue providing quality care to their residents with HIV and \nAIDS.\n  Senator Kennedy and I are committed to looking at the overall \nstructure of this program beginning next year. We both want to ensure \nthat when this reauthorization expires at the end of 2009, we have a \ncomprehensive solution to the health disparities created by the current \nflawed formula for allocating Ryan White funding. This legislation is \none step toward a more just and equitable program, and I look forward \nto continuing to strengthen and improve this program in the future.\n  In whatever policy we have on Ryan White, I will insist on key \nprinciples first, that the money follows the epidemic so that our \nfunding formulas can be responsive to the needs of Americans affected \nby the epidemic today and in the future. In addition, we need to ensure \nthat we capture the need of an area better by going beyond simply \nincluding HIV in the formulas and develop other mechanisms to better \naccount for the need on the ground.\n  Ryan White is a safety net program, and we need to better understand \nhow much of that safety net is being supported by local, State, and \nFederal dollars. Finally, I want to be clear to my colleagues that any \nnew funding formula must ensure that we are providing care across the \nspectrum of the disease--from HIV to AIDS. In doing so, we provide the \nright incentives for providing lifesaving care as soon as possible.\n  With that being said, I would like to close by thanking my colleagues \nand their staff both here in the Senate and in the House for their hard \nwork in passing this critical legislation. I want to thank all the \nmembers of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, especially my friend and ranking member Senator Kennedy.\n  I also thank our good colleagues on the House Committee on Energy and \nCommerce, Chairman Barton and Representative Dingell.\n  This bill is yet another example of the good work that can be done \nwhen we put politics aside and work together to improve the lives of \nAmericans. I am proud of the accomplishments I have achieved with \nSenator Kennedy in the 109th Congress, and I hope the 110th Congress is \njust as productive.\n  I would like to offer special thanks to my colleagues who assisted me \non the Senate floor in September when we previously tried to pass the \nbill. Senators Hatch, Burr, and Sessions were all instrumental in \ngetting us to this great victory today. I want to mention their staff: \nPattie DeLoatche and Karen LaMontagne with Senator Hatch, Liz Stillwell \nwith Senator Sessions, and Jenny Ware with Senator Burr.\n  I would like to offer a special thank you to Senator Coburn and \nRoland Foster, Stephanie Carlton, and Katy French of his staff. Senator \nCoburn helped educate our colleagues of the importance of getting this \nbill passed.\n  Vince Vintimiglia, Marty McGeein, Laura Ott, Maury Huguley, Deborah \nParham, and Adelle Simmons of the Department of Health and Human \nServices were crucial in guiding our efforts to help craft reforms to \nthe Ryan White programs. Megan Hauck at the White House was also \ninstrumental in helping us move this legislation forward.\n\n  I would also like to thank Marcia Crosse, Martha Kelly, and Suzanne \nWorth of the Government Accountability Office for their tireless \nefforts to analyze different proposals and their effect on distribution \nof funding across the Nation.\n  Through this entire process, Bill Baird of Senate Legislative Counsel \nand Pete Goodlowe of House Legislative Counsel have drafted countless \nlegislative proposals and compromises and were invaluable in crafting \nthe final language that reformed this program.\n  Kathie Hiers of the Southern AIDS Coalition and Bill McColl of AIDS \nAction have provided critical support from the beginning of this \nprocess, without which much of our progress would not have been \npossible. In addition, there were numerous other individuals and \norganizations who helped us throughout the process. So as not to leave \nanyone out, I just want to express my appreciation to all of you who \nhave continually labored with us to craft and pass this bill.\n\n  As you can imagine, a process involving Republicans and Democrats in \nthe House and the Senate over a year and a half involved many dedicated \nstaffers and many late nights. I would like to specifically acknowledge \nConnie Garner and Alice Lam of Senator Kennedy's staff; Melissa \nBartlett, Randy Pate, Ryan Long, and Katherine Martin of Chairman \nBarton's staff; and John Ford, William Garner, and Jessica McNiece of \nCongressman Dingell's staff for their diligence and determination as we \nworked together to craft this important and essential bill.\n  Both the Republican and Democratic leadership in the Senate were \nincredibly helpful in helping us reach the final compromise. I would \nlike to thank Majority Leader Frist and Elizabeth Hall of his staff and \nMinority Leader Reid and Kate Leone of his staff for their efforts.\n  Finally, there are a number of individuals I would like to thank on \nmy own staff for their dedication and determination to pass these \ncritical reforms to the Ryan White CARE Act. First and foremost, I \nwould like to commend Shana Christrup for her leadership, tireless \nefforts, determination, and unlimited patience. Without her knowledge \nof the policy and the process, this lifesaving legislation would not \nhave been possible. I would also like to thank Katherine McGuire, my \nstaff director on the HELP Committee. She keeps the trains running on \ntime and keeps my team motivated to search for solutions when solutions \nseem to be exhausted. I also want to thank Stephen Northrup, my health \npolicy director. He does a great job managing the health issues before \nthe committee.

Mr. President, for 12 years, I have served the people of \nTennessee as a U.S. Senator. Before I joined this body, I spent 20 \nyears practicing medicine--as a transplant surgeon.\n  But I spent even more time--nearly 30 years--getting the education \nnecessary for me to pursue a career at the cutting edge of transplant \nsurgery.\n  Without that education, I couldn't have pursued my dream of helping \npeople.\n  The fact is, education is an essential cornerstone in our society. \nNot just in the United State,s but around the world--across the global \nsociety.\n  Not only does a sound education increase the global competitiveness \nof America's workforce, but it also enables each and every worker to \npursue the American dream, in his or her own way.\n  Here in America, we have a rich history of working hard. We set \ngoals. We visualize dreams. And then we doggedly pursue them, with \nstubborn perseverance.\n  But as hard as we work, unless we possess the tools and the knowledge \nand the ``know how,'' we are not optimizing our resources. That means \nit is our best interest to pursue the best education possible. It is in \nour best interest to strengthen our education system so we can better \nequip future generations.\n  That is why I have supported a number of measures that enhance \nAmerica's education system.\n  Take the President's No Child Left Behind Act, which I proudly \ncosponsored. It set high standards for schools around the country. It \nis a comprehensive overhaul of the Federal Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act based on 4 pillars: accountability and testing, \nflexibility and local control, funding for what works, and expanded \nparental options.\n  We laid the groundwork for No Child Left Behind with ED-Flex, to give \nStates more flexibility in how they use Federal education dollars.\n  More recently, we passed the first-ever comprehensive reform and \nimprovement of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  We crafted this strongly bipartisan legislation with input from \nparents, educators, and disability groups--with the primary goal of \nensuring disabled students are achieving.\n  Streamlining regulations, simplifying and improving the integrity of \nthe conflict resolution process, reducing the paperwork burden for \nspecial education teachers, improving existing discipline provisions \nwhile still ensuring disabled children's rights are protected--with \nevery provision, we helped principals, teachers, and parents better \naddress the needs of disabled students.\n  Enhancing and strengthening our Nation's education system must occur \nat every level--primary, secondary, and beyond, in colleges and \nuniversities.\n  My SMART grant legislation took education reform to the university \nlevel, and without a doubt, among the education improvements I have \nsupported over the years, SMART grants hold pride of place in my heart.\n  SMART grants are a new student aid initiative that provide incentives \nfor promoting math and science education and consequently represent a \ndramatic step toward ensuring America's future global economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  Let me put it in perspective: China and India generate scientists and \nengineers at a furious pace while America lags dangerously behind.\n  We haven't reached the crisis point yet. We still have the best \nresearch universities in the world. We take home the lion's share of \nNobel prizes in the sciences. We lead the planet in most high-tech \nfields. And we produce more top scientists and engineers per capita \nthan any country with an economy even close to our size.\n  But for every one engineer we graduate in America, China graduates \neight and India graduates four.\n  SMART grants help America maintain our competitive edge by providing \naid to Pell grant-eligible students who maintain a 3.0 GPA and major in \nmath, science, engineering, technology, or foreign languages critical \nto national security during their third and fourth years of college.\n  These funds help incentivize more students to major in these time-\nintensive studies and they help America produce the quality workforce \nnecessary to compete in today's global economy.\n  But there is still more Congress can do to strengthen our education \nsystem and further enhance our America's competitiveness.\n  Right now, we stand at a crossroads. Unless we continue moving to \nimprove our education system at all leve1s, we could very well face \neconomic stagnation and a loss of global scientific leadership.\n  We can't afford to let that happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11243-5", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this is an opportunity to recognize the \nservice of several of our colleagues who are departing from the Senate. \nTo Senator Jeffords, Senator Frist, Senator DeWine, Senator Talent, \nSenator\n\n[[Page S11244]]\n\nSantorum, Senator Burns, and Senator Allen, let me express my \nappreciation for their service to their States and their service to the \nNation and wish them well. I particularly want to comment, though, on \nthree colleagues with whom I have had the privilege of working very \nclosely.\n\n\n                             Paul Sarbanes\n\n  The first is my friend and my chairman, ranking member, Senator Paul \nSarbanes of Maryland.\n  Paul has had an extraordinarily distinguished career in the Senate, \nand he has been the chairman of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \nCommittee and the Joint Economic Committee, and in both of those \ncapacities he has made profound and important impacts on the banking \nsystem and the economy of the United States. Housing and urban affairs \nhave also been improved dramatically by the efforts of Paul Sarbanes.\n  When it comes to understanding complex financial matters there is no \none more gifted and more knowledgeable than Paul Sarbanes. He has an \nextraordinary record of legislative achievements. The Sarbanes-Oxley \nAct of 2002 stands as a testimony both to his skill as a thoughtful \nobserver of the financial scene and as a legislator. It represented \nmajor reforms in corporate governance at a time when confidence in our \nmarkets was waning dramatically after the implosions of Enron and \nWorldCom. Through Paul's efforts, confidence was reestablished in a \nsystem of corporate governance which I think will stand the test of \ntime.\n  In addition, in 1999 he was instrumental in the Financial \nModernization Act, also known as Gramm-Leach-Bliley, and was \nparticularly concerned that the Community Reinvestment Act aspects of \nthe legislation be maintained because he was always committed to \nserving people and giving them opportunities. He understood that the \nfranchise to operate a financial institution with Federal Deposit \nInsurance required a concomitant commitment to serve the community, and \nPaul Sarbanes has done a remarkable job of maintaining that commitment \nto all the communities of America, particularly those that need an \nopportunity, need a chance to move forward.\n  As chairman of the Joint Economic Committee in the late 1980s, he was \na thoughtful and careful analyst, someone who I think led the way \nanalytically to the changes in the 1990s that returned us to a balanced \nbudget and a robust economy. Paul Sarbanes in many respects, through \nhis work on the Joint Economic Committee, was the architect of those \nefforts in the 1990s.\n  He has long had a concern about our role internationally in economic \naffairs. He was one of the first Members to raise concerns about \nChinese currency and its impact on our trade, our productivity, and our \nmanufacturing base. In the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of \n1988, he mandated that the Treasury Department report semiannually to \nCongress about international economic and exchange rate policies. I \nthink this is the lever that today is used to rally support, debate and \nattention to the issue of currency exchange rate policies.\n  He has also, in his capacity as a leader on the Banking and Urban \nAffairs Committee, been active in promoting transit throughout the \nUnited States. He made sure that our transit systems are supported, and \nare able to provide greater accessibility, environmental benefits, \nwhile reducing the demand on foreign oil. His insights into transit, \nand his leadership, have benefitted everyone in the country, \nparticularly the 14 million Americans who rely on mass transit every \nday.\n  He has also been a champion for affordable housing. He has been the \nauthor of the Home Investment Partnerships Program, known as HOME. \nDuring the past 16 years it provided funding to our States and \nlocalities to improve affordable housing. He was one of the key \nlegislators who offered the Market-to-Market Program, which preserved \nso much of our affordable housing, making sure low-income people have a \nchance to live in decent and affordable environments.\n  He has had the able assistance of Steve Harris, Marty Gruenberg, Pat \nMulloy, Johnathan Miller, Dean Shahinian, Sarah Kline, Aaron Klein, Lee \nPrice, Patience Singleton, Jen Fogel-Bublick, Steve Kroll, and Lynsey \nGraham.\n  I want to express my best wishes to Paul, to his wife Christine, and \ntheir family. His son, John, is now the new Representative for the \nUnited States House in the Third District of Maryland, so the Sarbanes \ntradition carries on.\n  Let me conclude by saying there is a word in Greek for integrity and \nintelligence, and that word is Sarbanes.\n  Paul, good luck.\n\n\n                             Lincoln Chafee\n\n  Let me also recognize my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Lincoln \nChafee. Senator Chafee is an individual both with character and sincere \ndevotion to our State and Nation, an honest, decent man who is always \nrespectful, thoughtful, and fair-minded. He is someone with whom we are \nall proud to have served. He is someone in this House respected for his \nintegrity and for his determination.\n  He came to the Senate upon the passing of his father, Senator John H. \nChafee, and picked up that tradition of service from his father. He was \na great model to emulate, and Senator Lincoln Chafee has done that. \nLike his father, he has concerned himself with issues of the \nenvironment through service on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. He sought to improve our Nation's water and air quality \nstandards. His pivotal work to provide for the cleanup and \nredevelopment of brownfields is a commitment and accomplishment that I \nthink will be recognized for many years to come.\n  He has also tried to preserve our State of Rhode Island's industrial, \nnatural, and cultural history, and he has done it persistently. Let me \napplaud him for his dedicated service and wish him and his family well \nin the days ahead.\n\n\n                              Mark Dayton\n\n  Finally, let me say a word about my colleague and friend, Senator \nMark Dayton. He is retiring after 6 years in the Senate. He began his \npublic life much earlier, in 1990, as a public school teacher in New \nYork City, and throughout his work he has dedicated himself to help the \npeople of Minnesota and the people of this great Nation. He has placed \nhimself on the front lines to provide better health care for seniors in \nMinnesota. He has worked closely on the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, LIHEAP. He has a good head and a great heart and he \nserved with distinction. I wish him well as he leaves the Senate.\n  To all my colleagues who served and conclude their service, let me \nonce again express deep appreciation for their friendship and for their \nservice to the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmy remarks, unless a Republican Senator appears wishing to speak, that \nSenator Stabenow of Michigan be allowed to follow.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11244-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11244-S11245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about two \nissues, legislative issues, that still require attention before this \nCongress adjourns. The first is related to Medicare cuts. Effective \nJanuary 1, Medicare reimbursement to health care providers is scheduled \nto be cut by 5 percent. I believe it is imperative that Congress step \nin and prevent that cut from occurring. Failure to do so will lessen \naccess to quality health care for many in this country.\n  The sustainable growth rate, the SGR, as it is referred to here in \nWashington more commonly, was implemented in 1998 as a means to \nannually adjust Medicare's physician fees in line with a set of \nspending targets. Until 2002, the total physician spending was below \nthe set targets, so physicians received an annual increase in their \nfees. However, starting in 2002, the trend was reversed. Spending on \nphysician services began to exceed the target. The result was a 4.8 \npercent reduction in physician fees in 2002 and the realization that \nthe SGR, or this sustainable growth rate formula, was flawed.\n  This was the beginning of what has become a yearly game of \nbrinksmanship, and we are in that game of brinksmanship again today\n\n[[Page S11245]]\n\nwith Medicare threatening to enact the cuts deemed appropriate by the \nSGR formula and Congress averting the fee cuts one year after another.\n  As of January 1 of next year, physician fees will be cut by 5 \npercent. In my view, this is causing understandable concern in the \nmedical community. I hear on a daily basis from physicians, both within \nand without my State of New Mexico, that these cuts will adversely \naffect patient care and access. I have no reason to doubt that \nstatement. The Albuquerque Journal in my home State of New Mexico \nreports that the proposed cuts will cost New Mexico doctors $12 million \nin 2007 alone. Presbyterian Health Plan president David Scrase believes \nthe cuts will result in closer to $32 million in cuts.\n  I believe this chart which was just put up here makes the point I am \ntrying to make very well. It is labeled ``Crisis in Medicare Physician \nPayments.'' The black line, which is going up, as everyone can see, is \nthe increase we have seen in the cost of medical practice in the last 5 \nyears. We can see very clearly that continues. It is a relentless \nincrease. The red line is physician payment updates under Medicare. We \ncan see those have been declining and are scheduled for a substantial \ndecline in 2007 again.\n  What I am trying to say is Congress needs to step in and at least \nkeep this line flat, at least hold physicians harmless in this 5 \npercent cut. I hope we are able to do even more than that. In my view, \nthese reductions will result in access problems for Medicare patients \nacross the Nation. Cuts such as these, along with the yearly \nuncertainty of whether the reduction will be implemented, make long-\nterm planning for small to medium physician practices almost \nimpossible.\n  In addition to the financial stresses of potential decreases in \nMedicare payments, physicians are being asked to adopt expensive health \ninformation technologies to improve the quality of medical care. This \nis a lot to expect from even large health systems, much less smaller \nphysician groups.\n  If the Medicare cuts go into effect--and all expert advice I have \nreceived leads me to believe they will--there will be access problems \nencountered by Medicare beneficiaries. But what may be even equally \nproblematic are the other measures physicians will be forced to take to \ncompensate for this cut. I am talking about the reduction of staff, \nforgoing health insurance for their employees, and delaying \nimplementation of new technologies. All of these are substantial new \nburdens we are putting on physicians operating their medical practices \nthroughout our country.\n  Where does this leave us? I believe we need to act both in the short \nterm and in the long term. Congress needs to take immediate action to \nhalt the scheduled 5 percent cut. I hope this can occur before this \nweek is over. Over the long term, we need to find solutions to continue \nto provide quality care to Medicare beneficiaries as well as fair \npayment to physicians for their work. That is not going to be easy.\n  Frankly, we are going to have to rethink this whole SGR system we \nadopted nearly a decade ago, and we are going to have to find ways to \nhave a fair formula that provides a fair level of compensation. In my \nopinion, this is a priority. It is something that has been the subject \nof intense negotiations between House and Senate Members in the last \nfew days. I understand that. I hope reason will prevail and that we can \ncome out with a solution that makes sense for seniors in this country \nand for those who depend upon the Medicare system for their health \ncare.\n  Finding long-term solutions to continue to provide quality care to \nMedicare beneficiaries as well as fair payment to physicians for their \nwork will require effort and collaboration between lawmakers and the \nmedical community. Earlier this year I introduced legislation that I \nbelieve is part of the solution. Because part of the payment that \nMedicare makes to physicians is based upon geographic location, \nphysicians in rural parts of the country are paid less than those in \nmore urban areas. This known as the geographic practice cost indices, \nor GPCIs. Congress determined that such extensive geographic \ndisparities were unfair and, as part of the Medicare Modernization Act \nof 2003, language from one of my bills was included that brought all \ngeographic areas up to the national average for the calculation of this \npiece of the Medicare physician payment formula. This year I introduced \nlegislation to extend this law. We should extend this law before \nCongress adjourns and, at the very least prevent the cuts that are set \nto occur at the end of the year.\n  To do less is to fail in our responsibility to the million of \nAmericans who depend on Medicare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11245-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EMERGENCY WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to speak about the problem \nof funding for wildfire suppression. This is an issue that particularly \naffects us in the West. We have a looming train wreck with regard to \nemergency wildfire suppression funding.\n  This year, wildfires burned a record of more than 9.5 million acres, \nmost of that in the West. The wildfires are still burning out of \ncontrol in southern California, where five more houses burned this \nweekend.\n  Federal wildfire-fighting expenditures also set a record at nearly $2 \nbillion in fiscal year 2006. That was more than twice what was \nappropriated for that fiscal year. When the cost of suppressing \nwildfires exceeds what has been appropriated, the agencies spend what \nthey have been appropriated for the fiscal year and the amount that has \nbeen provided to them in emergency supplemental appropriations. This \nyear, they also spent $500 million from what is called the emergency \nwildfire reserve account and an additional $110 million which they had \nto borrow from other accounts. Congress has not repaid any of that \nmoney as of yet. There is $610 million that has not been repaid to this \nwildfire reserve account and to the other accounts from which the \nForest Service has had to borrow.\n  Those agencies, particularly the Forest Service, have been left \nshort. They are financially unprepared for even an average wildfire \nyear in 2007. As we begin to look forward into next year, we are faced \nwith a very severe problem. In addition to the proposed 2007 \nappropriations, the agencies will need about $835 million if they are \nto maintain recent levels of financial preparedness. If the continuing \nresolution goes into effect, as we are advised it is likely to, the \nnumbers are likely to get even worse.\n  I filed an amendment to the Agriculture appropriations bill to begin \nto address the problem by providing $360 million in emergency wildfire \nsuppression funding for the Departments of Agriculture and Interior. \nThat amendment was sponsored by many of my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle. Senator Burns filed a similar amendment to the Military \nConstruction bill. But it is apparent that neither of those bills will \nget to the President for signature this year.\n  We have an enormous need for wildfire suppression funding and no \nclear way to address it. I urge my colleagues to find a way to address \nit before we leave at the end of this week. Providing some additional \nfunds to these agencies for this purpose is essential. I believe it \nwill be unfortunate if this Congress adjourns leaving those agencies in \nthe financial straits which they are in. I know there are many agencies \nacross the Federal Government which are going to encounter great \ndifficulty in carrying on these activities if we adopt a continuing \nresolution, as is being proposed, but this particular area of wildfire \nsuppression funding is one that deserves particular attention.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak, as my colleague from \nNew Mexico has spoken so eloquently, about a very serious issue we have \nto address before we leave for the year. Once again, I rise to speak \nabout the urgency of providing our Nation's physicians with the \nresources they need to provide high-quality Medicare services to our \nseniors and people with disabilities. As my colleague indicated, this \nis something of the utmost importance that needs to be addressed now. \nThere\n\n[[Page S11246]]\n\nis no reason we cannot address this before we leave.\n  On September 21, I asked unanimous consent for the Senate to approve \nS. 1574, legislation that would provide for a 2-percent update to \nphysicians as recommended by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, \nMedPAC. This particular bill was introduced by my colleague Senator \nCantwell, and I thank her for her leadership on this important issue. \nMy Republican colleagues objected to this request, and so nothing has \nhappened in the last 75 days. We are running up to the end of the year, \nand yet nothing has happened. Nothing has happened to ensure that \nphysicians will receive a modest update to their Medicare payments. \nNothing has happened to ensure seniors and people with disabilities \nwill have access to their doctors.\n  Senator Cantwell and I each introduced legislation over a year ago to \noverride the sustainable growth rate formula for Medicare physician \npayments--in other words, a formula that has been putting us on this \nroad to a 5.1-percent cut come January. We knew then that the formula \nwas wrong. It is not sustainable. It doesn't work. It needs to be \nfixed.\n  We have known this day was coming. We know physician payments will be \ncut by over 5 percent on January 1--just a few weeks from now--if \nCongress doesn't act. We know Congress has only a few short days to \ncomplete the business for the year. We know what we need to do to solve \nthe problem. While the clock is ticking down, we have time to address \nthis issue. It is critical that we not leave here without addressing \nthis for our seniors, for our families, for people with disabilities, \nand for the physicians of this country who are caring for those \nindividuals.\n\n  People say we are out of time. Some people buy Christmas presents on \nthe afternoon of December 24, but there are people who run right up to \nthe deadline. There are people who mail their tax returns right before \nmidnight on April 15. We are in one of those situations. We have to \ndecide to get this done because the deadline is here. We are running \nright up to the deadline. But we have to make this a priority before we \nleave. I know colleagues are working on both sides of the aisle as well \nas in the House to find a solution. It is critical that something be \ndone, that it be fair, that it moves us in the right direction, not the \nwrong direction. It is not going to take long to get this done if \npeople want to get it done.\n  In less than 1 month, payments to physicians will be cut by 5 \npercent. Under current law, while costs continue to increase, \nphysicians will actually be paid less than they are paid today. As I \nmentioned in September, we know from the recent survey conducted by the \nAMA that if the scheduled cuts go into effect, 45 percent of doctors \nwill decrease the number of Medicare patients they accept. Almost half \nof physicians will decrease the number of Medicare patients they can \naccept.\n  Fifty percent of doctors will defer purchase of health information \ntechnology, which is another critical issue that I am pleased to be \nworking on with colleagues on the other side of the aisle. We have a \nbipartisan consensus that we need to move forward on health information \ntechnology to save both money and lives. Yet we can't say to \nphysicians: We are cutting the income coming in, we are cutting your \npayments for serving people, and by the way, we want you to spend money \non new hardware and software and training people for a system that is \ncritically important for the Federal Government to save money. That \ndoesn't make any sense, and that is not going to happen.\n  We also know that 37 percent of doctors practicing in rural \ncommunities--and Michigan has many rural communities--will be forced to \ndiscontinue rural outreach services. This is unfortunate for the people \nof Michigan as well as around the country. And 43 percent of physicians \nwill decrease the number of TRICARE patients they serve.\n  We are talking about people in the military and their families. This \ndoesn't have to happen, if we can act and act quickly.\n  Further, MedPAC considers the Medicare SGR formula to be flawed. It \nis an inequitable mechanism for controlling the volume of services. \nThey recommended repeal of it in 2001 because it is not working. It is \nnot working mostly for patients, and it is not working for physicians. \nSince that time in 2001, they have consistently recommended repealing \nthe formula. MedPAC has stated that the cuts will be particularly \ndevastating for primary care doctors--the very doctors many Medicare \nbeneficiaries rely on for important health care management.\n  This doesn't have to happen. We have the power to make sure it \ndoesn't. While the problem is clear, fortunately so is the solution.\n  MedPAC is an independent Federal body established by Congress in 1997 \nto advise us on issues affecting the Medicare Program. In addition to \nadvising Congress on payments to providers, MedPAC is also tasked with \nanalyzing access to care and quality of care. In carrying out their \ncharge, MedPAC has recommended a 2-percent physician payment update to \nkeep them moving forward for next year. The change is one that I have \nadvocated, and in fact 79 of my colleagues have joined me in seeking \nand directly tracking MedPAC's recommendations. In fact, 80 Senators \nhave said that physicians must be provided with a positive Medicare \npayment update for 2007 before we adjourn.\n  Eighty Members have signed a letter to the two leaders of the Senate. \nSenator Reid has indicated his full support in moving forward with \nthis. Eighty Members have said yes, we know the problem, we know the \nsolution. The will should be there. Eighty out of 100 Senators have \nsaid this needs to get done. I joined these 79 other Senators in \nsending a letter in July to our leaders. Senator Reid has positively \nresponded. I thank him for that.\n  We have less than 3 days to get this done. My colleagues working on \nthis need to know we want to get this done, get this done in the right \nway, and that we will not leave until it is completed. We know if we do \nnot provide some kind of modest update to Medicare physicians payments, \nour seniors and people with disabilities will lose access to their \ndoctors. That is what this is all about. Shame on us if this happens.\n  I am very proud of the work that over 20,000 MDs and DOs in Michigan \neach day provide 1.4 million seniors and people with disabilities in \nMichigan high quality medical services under the Medicare Program. I \nwant them to be able to continue to do that. There is no way they can \nif, while their costs are going up, their time with patients goes up \nbecause of the complexities of dealing with many older citizens and \npeople with disabilities, yet at the same time their reimbursements for \nthose services are going down.\n  Beginning January 1, the average cut for a physician in Michigan \nwould be $34,000 per year. How can we ask them to increase their level \nof care to support and expand what they are doing as more and more \npeople enter the Medicare Program while we are making those cuts every \nyear? It is not sustainable. It does not make any sense that at a time \nwhen medical costs are going up, the payments and reimbursements are \ngoing down.\n  I have had many opportunities to hear from physicians in Michigan. \nLet me mention a couple of them. I will read a letter I received from \nDr. Gela Pala, geriatrician and resident of Oakland County, MI. She \nputs the problems in words that make the situation we face very clear.\n\n       As a resident of Oakland County, Michigan and practicing \n     geriatrician I believe cutting further Medicare physician \n     reimbursement will be a mistake.\n       Most of my patients are above 70 years old and they come to \n     the office with a list of 10 to 20 medications and 10 or more \n     diagnoses. I routinely spend 1 hour or more with a patient \n     and family to discuss options of care, realistic goals/\n     expectations and coordinate care.\n       As medicine is becoming more and more complex I anticipate \n     we, patients and doctors, will need to increase the time we \n     spend together.\n       I doubt an 80 year old cognitively impaired grandmother \n     will need less medical attention in the future. I doubt that \n     she will be able to navigate the complexities of the medical \n     system alone or with help from brochures, computers, etc.\n       I can see my patient getting lost in the shuffle of ``cost \n     effective'' medicine.\n       I can see the doctors ordering more tests because nobody \n     had the time to discuss the prognosis. I can see my patient \n     going from one office to another trying to understand what is \n     wrong, how to fix things and how to differentiate between \n     what is fixable and what is not.\n\n[[Page S11247]]\n\n       Cutting physician reimbursement will not make our nation \n     stronger, healthier or safer.\n       I believe that less physician time will mean less health \n     and more healthcare cost.\n       Please take action to prevent further deterioration of the \n     medical care for the elderly.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  I have heard from so many people regarding this issue. I will read \none more statement, from Dr. Thomas Watkins, a DO and family practice \nphysician in Muskegon, MI:\n\n       It will be a travesty for many seniors if doctors stop \n     accepting Medicare due to fund cutting. With our expenses \n     going up 5-10 percent annually and Medicare cutting 5 percent \n     next year it will be very difficult for many of my colleagues \n     and myself to continue to practice medicine for Medicare \n     recipients. Please at least vote to freeze the fee schedule \n     to allow access for all seniors to the physician of their \n     choice, just as you have that privilege.\n\n  I simply ask that we act now. We have no more time to wait. People \nare counting on us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are coming to the end of the session \nand 10 of our colleagues are retiring. I want to say a word about them, \nespecially one of them, my colleague, Senator Bill Frist, from \nTennessee.\n\n\n                               Bill Frist\n\n  I can still remember when Bill Frist came to my office in Nashville \nin 1994 and said he wanted to run for the Senate. I didn't know what to \nthink. Bill Frist lived in the neighborhood where I lived in Nashville, \nbut I didn't know him very well. Our ages are a little bit different \nand he had been away while I was Governor of Tennessee, practicing \nmedicine and honing his skills.\n  What I did know about him was that he was extraordinary. He was one \nof the pioneers in our country of heart and lung transplants. He \nperformed the first one in Tennessee, the first one in the Southeast. \nWhen he decided to run for the Senate, only a handful of physicians in \nthe world had made as many heart transplants as Dr. Bill Frist.\n  He had almost no chance of being elected to the Senate in 1994. \nHowever, he was elected. He had almost no chance, after having been \nelected, to help the Republicans gain the majority in 2002, but he did \nthat. No one expected him to be the majority leader of the Senate, but \nhe has been and he has done it very well.\n  As we look at the record of the accomplishments over the last 4 \nyears, Senator Frist can take credit for his leadership in creating an \nenvironment where we have had tax cuts that have benefited Americans, \nwhere we have confirmed judges who will interpret the law rather than \nmake it up as they go along. His hand was in the Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit which benefits millions of seniors. We would not have had \nthe $15 billion for HIV/AIDS in Africa had it not been for Bill Frist.\n  In Tennessee, we have had a sales tax deduction against our Federal \nincome tax and a new governing board for the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority, neither of which would have been accomplished were it not \nfor Bill Frist. When Lyndon Johnson was majority leader, he often said, \nhaving Lyndon Johnson as majority leader is good for the country and \nhasn't hurt Texas one bit. I would say, having Bill Frist as majority \nleader has been good for the country and it hasn't hurt Tennessee one \nbit.\n  He has been the perfect colleague. His ego has been completely under \ncontrol in a body where that is rare and difficult. And one thing is \ncertain: Anyone who knows Bill Frist won't underestimate him again. \nHistory has proven that is a dangerous thing to do. I don't know very \nmany people who have ever been in public life who have as many \ninteresting and important and viable options open to him as he does as \nhe looks forward to the next step in his contributions to public \nservice.\n  One of the joys of being a Senator is simply the privilege of serving \nwith other Senators. Each one of the Senators has something remarkable \nand special. For example, Senator Frist was president of the skydiving \nclub at Princeton when he was there. He spends vacations in Sudan, \ndoing surgery on poor people. He once got up at 4 in the morning and \nwent to the National Zoo to operate on the heart of a gorilla--which I \nguess is a pretty good way of preparing for coming to the Senate floor \nand dealing with what he has to deal with here. He is not the only one \nwho is a very special Senator.\n\n\n                              Conrad Burns\n\n  My friend, Conrad Burns, who is retiring, was a marine, an \nauctioneer, had his own radio program and TV program in Montana. He \nwould sometimes pick up hitchhikers on his way in to work in the \nSenate--a pretty good surprise for a Government employee to be picked \nup by a U.S. Senator.\n\n\n                              Mike DeWine\n\n  Or Mike DeWine, with his eight children and ninth grandchild, whose \nheart is nearly as big as he is. He lost a child, and he and Fran have \ngone to Haiti time after time after time to help people there who need \nhelp.\n\n\n                              George Allen\n\n  Or George Allen. I remember vividly the first time I met him, I \ncampaigned for him in Virginia. He was 40 points behind. I went back to \nTennessee and I said, I believe he will win, he is such a good \ncandidate. We haven't heard the last of him in public life.\n\n\n                             Rick Santorum\n\n  Or Rick Santorum, Karen, and their six children whom they home \nschool, and his Italian heritage--which explains a lot about his \nenthusiasm and vigor for the things he believes in most strongly.\n\n\n                             Paul Sarbanes\n\n  Or Paul Sarbanes, who was in the same Rhodes Scholar class with \nSenator Dick Lugar.\n\n\n                               Jim Talent\n\n  Or Jim Talent, who was the outstanding political science student at \nWashington University in St. Louis when he was there. No one would be \nsurprised to learn that.\n\n\n                             Lincoln Chafee\n\n  Or Senator Linc Chafee, also retiring, was a wrestler in college. He \nspent several years in the United States and Canada as a professional \nblacksmith before he got into politics.\n\n\n                              Mark Dayton\n\n  Or Mark Dayton, whose interest in the environment in Minnesota has \nbeen so exceptional.\n\n\n                              Jim Jeffords\n\n  Or Jim Jeffords, a former Navy captain, who has had so much to do \nwith offering legislation for clean air and children with disabilities.\n  When the most recent class of Senators was sworn into office nearly 2 \nyears ago, in the gallery were three women. One was the grandmother of \nBarack Obama. She was from Kenya. One was the mother of Senator \nSalazar, a 10th generation American. One was the mother of Mel \nMartinez, the new Republican National Committee chairman, who, with her \nhusband, put her son on an airplane when he was 14 years old and sent \nhim from Cuba to the United States, not knowing if she would ever see \nhim again.\n\n  In a way, each one of us who is here is an accident. None of us knew \nwe would be here. Each of us is privileged to serve, and one of the \ngreatest privileges is to serve with our colleagues. We will miss them \nand we are grateful for their service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the time for my departure from the \nSenate draws near, on behalf of the greatest blessing in my life, my \nwife Susan, and on behalf of myself, I thank all of my colleagues for \ntheir many courtesies and friendships that have been forged during the \npast 6 years and offer a few concluding reflections about our time here \ntogether, as well as talk about the future of our Republic.\n  Our foremost statesman in Virginia, Harry Byrd, Jr., observed that \nwith the exception of the Presidencies of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin \nRoosevelt, no time in the history of our country has witnessed more \nproblems and challenges of great magnitude than these past 6 years.\n  When I arrived here in January of 2001, America was at peace, or so \nit\n\n[[Page S11248]]\n\nseemed, and so we thought. And then on that bright blue sky morning of \nSeptember 11, the skies suddenly darkened with clouds of smoke from the \nPentagon and the horrific collapse of the World Trade Center towers in \nNew York City, and our world changed forever.\n  A cascade of other great challenges soon followed in rapid \nsuccession, issues foreign and domestic, challenges locally and \nnationally, threats manmade and disasters decreed by nature.\n  Through all of these unprecedented storms, it was our responsibility \nto make careful decisions for the safety, security, and prosperity of \nthe people of our country. I am particularly grateful to the people of \nthe Commonwealth of Virginia for the opportunity to serve here, to give \nvoice to their values, and fight for the future of this country, our \ncommonwealth, while serving in this, the world's most distinguished \nbody.\n  We all understand and respect the will of the people, whom I call the \nowners of the Government. They are the leaders of our representative \ndemocracy who bring us here and who may, at some point, take us away.\n  I have been honored by the people of Virginia, first as Governor and \nnow as a Senator, to be a part of important initiatives that have borne \nfruit for the people of our Commonwealth and our country.\n  As Governor, we worked across party lines to accomplish honest change \nthat Virginians desired and deserved. We abolished the lenient, \ndishonest parole system in Virginia, cracked down on violent criminals, \nand there are fewer victims of crime in Virginia. We reformed the \nwelfare laws by promoting the work ethic, and now there are tens of \nthousands of Virginians who are leading more independent, self-reliant \nlives. In education, we established high academic standards and \naccountability in our schools, and our students are learning better, \nand we invested in higher education throughout the Commonwealth of \nVirginia.\n  We sent a message to the world that Virginia was open for business, \nand cut taxes, and implemented prompter permitting in the Commonwealth, \nand were able to recruit in technology companies. In fact, the No. 1 \nmanufactured export from Virginia now is computer memory chips, \nsurpassing cigarettes. That is a great transformation from the Old \nDominion to the ``Silicon Dominion.''\n  When I came to the Senate, my goal was to use this perspective and \nthese experiences to continue and build on this work. I have been able \nto do that, and I am grateful to so many of my colleagues for working \nin partnership with me on so many issues that are vitally important for \nthe lives, safety, and prosperity of our citizens.\n  Whether it is making sure that avaricious State and local tax \ncommissars don't put an 18-percent tax on one's monthly Internet access \nbill, or whether it is the nanotechnology initiative, working with my \ncolleague across the aisle, Senator Wyden, or whether it was increasing \nthe paltry death gratuity that went to the next of kin of one of our \nfallen Armed Forces members, increasing it from $12,000 to $100,000, \nfrom a grateful nation, these are good successes, reflecting the values \nand virtues of our country.\n  I am particularly grateful to our State's senior Senator, John \nWarner, who at each step of the way has been by my side as a partner \nand even more as a gracious mentor, wise counsel, once in a while an \nencourager of various ideas, and once in a while, occasionally, a \ncorrector, but, most of all, an unwavering friend. He is the epitome of \nthe Virginia gentleman, and the model of an honest, hard-working \nSenator. I will leave here enriched immeasurably by this latest and \nbest chapter of our partnership of several decades.\n  Now, next month, I will no longer have the privilege of serving with \nSenator Warner and many of my colleagues here in the Senate, but I \npledge to keep working and advancing and advocating ideals and values \nand shared principles that I think are important missions for the \nfuture of Virginia and our country.\n  There are three key missions that I think are important for our \ncountry's future. First is to protect our freedom, and that starts with \nmaking sure our great men and women in our Armed Forces have the \nequipment, the training, and the armaments for their safety. We need to \nsupport their families as well. We need to work with other countries \nand allies in coordinated efforts to adapt and adjust our tactics, our \noperations, and our strategies to face the evolving threat of these \nvile, radical terrorist organizations and threats.\n  Our second mission is to preserve our values, and that starts with \nmaking sure that nominated and confirmed are judges who understand \ntheir role is to apply the law, not invent the law, not legislate from \nthe bench.\n  My very first speech as a Senator on the floor was asking my \ncolleagues to treat the nomination--first, asking the President to \nrenominate Roger Gregory, and then asking my colleagues here on the \nfloor, in my first speech, to treat Roger Gregory fairly, consider him \nfairly. I asked my colleagues to rise above partisanship and rise above \nthe worshiping of process, to treat this gentleman fairly.\n  The President renominated him, and my colleagues did treat Roger \nGregory fairly, and accorded him a vote, and now he is serving with \ngreat distinction on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals as the first \nAfrican American serving on that distinguished court.\n  Now through the years, we have seen obstruction of judges, which I \nthought was very unfair, for example, in the treatment of Miguel \nEstrada. We even have the nomination of John Bolton. Although a \nmajority of Members are for him, he will not be accorded the fairness \nof an up-or-down vote.\n  I urge my colleagues to treat nominees, judicial nominees and others, \nfairly, according them the fairness of an up-or-down vote. It is part \nof representative democracy. And let's have John Bolton be the last \ncasualty of the unfortunate partisan obstructionism. If you want to \nvote against a nominee, vote against him, but have the Senate vote, and \ntreat people with consideration; but vote. That is what the \nConstitution instructs us to do.\n  Now, our third mission for Virginia and, in fact, our whole country \nis to make sure America is a land of opportunity for all, a place where \nevery American is only limited by their imagination, hard work, and \ningenuity. Looking ahead, we need to recharge our competitiveness by \nmaking sure taxes are not increased on families and small business \nowners. We need to keep taxes off of access to the Internet. We need to \ncreate a climate where the entrepreneurial spirit can flourish. We need \nto also achieve energy independence from the Middle East and other \nhostile parts of the world, and foreign energy. This is not just an \neconomic necessity, this is also a national security imperative.\n  We need more of our energy explored here in America, produced and \ngrown in America, so hundreds of billions of energy dollars stay here \nin America for American jobs, American competitiveness, and American \nnational security, rather than having to worry about the whims of some \ndictator in a hostile part of the world.\n  Finally, we need to strive to make sure that the United States is the \nworld capital of innovation. To achieve this goal, we need more young \npeople, no matter their gender, no matter their race, no matter their \nethnicity, interested in science, technology, and engineering. If we \nare going to be the world capital of innovation, that needs to be done \nwith investment, encouragement, motivation, incentives, and even \nscholarships to make sure young people are encouraged to get into these \nkey fields of the future of our country, which must be the world \ncapital of innovation.\n\n  So, my friends, as I prepare to take leave, I am humbled and I am \ngrateful for the tremendous honor and privilege that has been accorded \nto me by the good people of the Commonwealth of Virginia. I leave here \nwith many new and enduring friendships, with valuable lessons learned, \nwith an unrestrained optimism about the potential of America, about our \nNation's future, and with pride in our accomplishments together.\n  My friends, do not let these challenging times along our national \njourney divert your focus from what truly matters. The tree of American \nliberty is as strong as ever. Our roots run deep into a wellspring of \nvalues that are as old as our Republic and, indeed, much older still.\n  Four hundred years after our Nation's beginning at Jamestown, we are\n\n[[Page S11249]]\n\nstill--we are still--in the springtime of life as a nation. We are \nstill planting seeds and bearing fruit. We are still growing and \ncreating, still inspiring and innovating, still providing life and hope \nfor people around the world seeking to escape the chains of tyranny, \nand to embrace the blessings of liberty.\n  Indeed, the sun is still rising on a bright American morning. And if \nwe will keep the faith, no matter the challenges or the choices we \nface, generations to come will remember and think well of us for this: \nWe never gave up. We never backed down. And we always stood strong for \nfreedom.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I see others who wish to speak, \nand I will make a couple of brief comments.\n  In the comments of the Senator from Virginia, his final couple of \ncomments recalled for me a statement made in the closing of the \nConstitutional Convention in Philadelphia, when on the back of the \nchair of the presiding officer was a sunburst. Someone opined in that \nConstitutional Convention: Dr. Franklin, is that a rising sun or is it \na setting sun? And Franklin ventured to say that with the birth of the \nnew Nation, with the creation of the new Constitution, that he thought \nit was a rising sun.\n  Indeed, it is that hope, that optimism of which the Senator from \nVirginia has just spoken--uplifting words--that are the feelings that \ngenerate this Senator from Florida to get up and go to work every day, \nand to look at this Nation's challenges, not as a Democratic problem or \na Republican problem, but as an American problem, that need to be \nsolved in an American way instead of a partisan way.\n  We have had far too much partisanship over the last several years \nacross this land, and, indeed, in this Chamber itself. And of the \nSenators who are leaving this Chamber, I think they represent the very \nbest of America, and on occasion have risen in a bipartisan way. It has \nbeen this Senator's great privilege to work with these Senators: Allen \nof Virginia, Burns of Montana, Chafee of Rhode Island, Dayton of \nMinnesota, DeWine of Ohio, Frist of Tennessee, Jeffords of Vermont, \nSantorum of Pennsylvania, Sarbanes of Maryland, Talent of Missouri.\n  As the Good Book in Ecclesiastes says: There is a time to be born and \na time to die. There is a time to get up, and a time to go to bed. \nThere is a time for a beginning, and there is a time of ending.\n  For these Senators who are leaving, it is clearly not an ending. It \nis an ending of this chapter in their lives, but this Senator from \nFlorida wanted to come and express his appreciation for their public \nservice, to admonish those where admonishment is needed when this \nChamber, indeed, this Government, has gotten too partisan, but to \nexpress this Senator's appreciation for the quiet moments of friendship \nand reflection and respect in working together, which is the glue that \nmakes this Government run.\n  Whether you call it bipartisanship, whether you call it friendship, \nwhether you call it mutual respect, whatever you call it, the way you \ngovern a nation as large and as complicated and as diverse as our \nNation is--as the Good Book says: Come, let us reason together--that is \nwhat this Senator tries to be about. And that is what this Senator will \ntry to continue to do in the new dawn of a new Congress. So I wanted to \ncome and express my appreciation for those Senators, who will not be \nhere, for the great public service they have rendered.\n  Mr. President, I am truly grateful for their personal friendship and \nfor their public service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the words of my friend from \nFlorida as I rise today and say my farewell to this body. I do it with \nsome sadness, but I also do it with some great pride. I also do it with \na great appreciation for the Senate and for the people who serve here.\n  It has always been one of my personal honors and privileges to serve \nthe State of Montana and the country for the last 18 years, and with \nsuch distinguished and honorable men and women.\n  We have seen a lot of changes. I want to answer my good friend from \nFlorida, before he leaves the floor: We have seen some changes come \nover the body, and I would suggest that we turn off that eye that \nsurrounds this body, turn it off and turn the Senate back into the \ndebating body it was once known for, with collegiality, because the \nbest I have ever seen the Senate operate is in executive session. When \nyou turn off the television and we get to the issues--and we have some \nmarvelous people, dedicated, on both sides of an issue, who can argue \nthe issue--some of us who may not be as disciplined in that particular \nissue as others could learn and vote more intelligently. I suggest \nthat, but I doubt that will ever happen, being that that is out in the \npublic today. I thank the Senator for his observation. We need to get \nback to the great debates that were held on the floor of the Senate \nmany years ago.\n\n  It was back on January 3, 1989, when I was sworn in the Senate. It \nwas a proud day in my life and, of course, for my wife and our family. \nI got to thinking during that day that only in America could something \nlike this happen. I was fortunate and, of course, we had both my wife's \nfamily, who are Nebraska folks, and my family, who are Missouri folks, \nin attendance that day. They are just folks, but they are emblematic of \nthose people who were born of the land and in the heart of America--\nranchers and farmers.\n  It was on the prairies of Missouri where I was born and raised on a \nlittle old bitty farm of 160 acres--what I call ``2 rocks and 1 \ndirt''--not a very good farm. But I have fond memories of that place. I \ngive thanks every day that I was born to that family and in that old \nhouse that still stands on that 160 acres. Of course, in my younger \nyears I gained most of my philosophy in life. I was born of folks who \nweren't very wealthy, as you would define wealthy. They were a product \nof the Great Depression and the terrible droughts of the 1930s. They \nsurvived by hard work and great pride. The values they passed on to \nmost of us in my generation were the love of this country first, \ncommunity pride and loyalty to that community, and honesty to the core. \nRussell and Mary Francis were married 59 years on that day when I was \nsworn in. And I will tell you, when they witnessed proudly their son \nsworn into the most prestigious body in the world, only in America can \nthat happen. It is truly the miracle of our country. It was also a \nproud day for all of our family.\n  I will say right now that we could not do well in this body without \nthe true support of a wife and family because it is from that source \nthat we draw our strength and, yes, our wisdom, as long as they are by \nour side. Phyllis, of course, and Keely and Garrett were all here. What \nblessings God has bestowed upon me personally. One was missing and that \nwas Kate. God called her home back in 1985, but she remains in our \nmemories and hearts forever. Again, one cannot do this job without the \nsupport and sacrifice of our family.\n  We have seen a lot of positive things happen in Montana. Montana has \njust begun to grow in new directions. Montana is a resource State, with \ntimber, mining, oil, and agriculture. But we have new opportunities \nnow, and they have opened. I am proud to say that it was me and my \noffice that led the way on most of those changes. It is said that it is \nnot bragging if you have done it. I was fortunate enough to attract a \nstaff that shared the same vision of change, and change we did. Montana \nis not short of visionaries. It was my privilege to know them, work \nwith them, and to move our State forward.\n  There is one thing about Montanans: They are not afraid to dream. As \nyou know, dreams never die; dreamers do. Our colleges and universities \nnow are national leaders in research and development, agriculture, \nengineering, and communications. We have telemedicine and distance \nlearning where none existed before. We have seen a real leap forward in \nour infrastructure and transportation and rural utilities. We have \nwatched an elevated vocational educational system grow. Tribal colleges \non our seven reservations are\n\n[[Page S11250]]\n\ngrowing and now offer opportunities that have never been available to \nour Native Americans in the history of our State. More Montanans are \nworking today and owning their own homes than at any other time in the \nhistory of our State.\n  I had the honor of serving with three Presidents, and one could say \nfour, as it was in the closing days of President Reagan's term. They \nare all honorable men and dedicated to this Nation. I know what it is \nlike to be in the minority, and I know what it is like to be in the \nmajority. One great statement was made: ``The majority is more \nfunner.''\n  I have enjoyed my work with some of the best men and women in the \nSenate who represented both sides of the aisle, from different regions \nof our country and diverse cultures of our country. I will miss them. \nBut we have welded some friendships that will last forever. The same \ncould be said of nations to which we have traveled and met national and \ninternational leaders on all continents.\n  During my tenure here, we have witnessed the crash of the Berlin \nWall, freedom in the market base come to the Eastern block in Europe, \nand the electricity that was in the House of Representatives when a \nnewly elected President of Poland made his historical speech in a joint \nsession. I will tell you what: It brought joy, tears, and pride to all \nof us in that Chamber.\n  Like every Member of Congress, I wept when two of our Capitol \npolicemen died on that summer day protecting this Capitol and us who \nlive and work here. Still, our hearts go out to their families. They \nwill never be forgotten.\n  I leave with many memories. I ask the Senate to return to the \ndeliberative and collegial body it was designed to be. I know it has \nthat ability because I have seen it firsthand. But the challenges ahead \nare tremendous for this Government. I can only list about six of them: \ntaxation, regulation, energy, health care, education, and litigation. \nWe must face those challenges if we are to live in this free \nentrepreneurial and economic country. I suggest that we don't just \ndwell on the national interests first and all others separate.\n  Members of this body are just average men and women, but they have \nthe capabilities of rising to any occasion of crisis. They are just \naverage, but they also have a higher degree of dedication to our \ncountry. I never underestimated any Member of the Senate, and I regard \nthem as quiet heroes in a time of peace and in a time of turmoil and \neven in the most stressful time in the process of developing \nlegislation that sets policy for our land.\n  I shall miss all of you. It has been my great privilege to serve with \nyou. As I leave, I say God bless you all.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11250-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11250-S11251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                 Lance Corporal Robert F. Eckfield, Jr.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor this morning to \npay tribute to Marine LCpl Robert F. Eckfield, Jr., from Cleveland, OH. \nOn October 27, 2005, Lance Corporal Eckfield died from injuries \nsustained in Iraq. He was 23 years of age at the time.\n  Lance Corporal Eckfield is survived by his father Robert, his mother \nand stepfather Virginia and Norman Taylor, and younger siblings Nathan, \nRachel, and Norman, Jr.\n  Even from a very young age, Robert knew he wanted to serve in the \nMarines. He was adventurous, loved being outdoors, and had a strong \nsense of duty and patriotism. In addition, Robert's family had a long \ntradition of military service. His grandfather had been a marine and \nfought in World War II and Korea. His Uncle Bill served in the Marines \nat Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. And Marine Cpl Derek Wright is Robert's cousin \nand the two enlisted together after the terrorist attacks on September \n11. According to Corporal Wright, Robert wanted to be in the Marines \never since he was 12 years of age.\n  Robert worked hard for the privilege of wearing the Marines uniform. \nWhile working odd, part-time jobs, he enrolled in Cleveland Christian \nAcademy and attended night classes so that he could earn his high \nschool diploma. Immediately after graduating in 2002, Robert joined the \nMarines. As his mother said:\n\n       Right from the start, he wanted to [fulfill] his duty. He \n     went right into boot camp after graduation.\n\n  Virginia was worried about Robert's decision, but she supported him \nbecause she knew how important the military was to her son. Their \nfamily drove down to Parris Island, SC, to celebrate his graduation \nfrom boot camp.\n  Robert was a truly brave marine. According to his family, he had his \nmother promise that he would be buried in Arlington if anything ever \nhappened to him in Iraq during his third tour of duty. Robert served \nwillingly and never questioned his duty.\n  In Iraq, Robert served with the 2nd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment, \n2nd Marine Division, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force based in North \nCarolina. Robert was an outstanding marine, someone who always gave it \neverything he had. He served with passion, honor, and dedication.\n  Two fellow marines who served with Robert in Iraq wrote the following \nto their friend on an Internet tribute Web site:\n\n       [Eckfield] was one of the most outstanding marines we had. \n     . . . [We] want everyone to know that Eckfield had something \n     no other junior marine had . . . and that was heart. Eckfield \n     never complained about anything, and he was one of the best \n     we had.\n\n  Robert fell in love before he left for Iraq. His girlfriend was Beth \nDunkle. She wrote the following words of tribute to Robert:\n\n       Bobby was a great man. We were only together for a short \n     time, but it felt like we knew each other our entire lives. \n     There was a connection the moment we met. Our journey started \n     there, and my love for him will never die. He is a true hero. \n     Words can't express how much I love him and miss him.\n\n  Robert and Beth were able to spend some time together before he left \non his third deployment. Beth visited him at Camp Lejeune where Robert \nfilled a room with rose petals, champagne, bouquets, and chocolate-\ncovered strawberries. Beth said they talked about everything--from \nRobert's ambition to be in law enforcement after leaving the service to \nthe future in general and them sharing it together for a lifetime.\n  In the words of Robert's mother:\n\n       He just fell in love with a wonderful woman named Beth. . . \n     .When he was home in September, they talked about how happy \n     they would be when he could return home for good in April, \n     and they could be together. He sent her roses on Sweetest \n     Day.\n\n  When Robert died, although Virginia would have liked to have had her \nson closer to her in Ohio, she honored his last request to be buried at \nArlington National Cemetery. On November 5, 2005, nearly 60 family \nmembers and friends traveled there for the service where Marine GySgt \nBarry L. Baker presented Robert's mother a flag in her son's honor.\n  Robert was a young man who had a bright future before him. He planned \nto attend college when he returned from Iraq and aspired to a career \nwith either the Central Intelligence Agency or the State Department.\n  Robert will be dearly missed by everyone who knew him. Teachers who \nknew him when he attended John Marshall High School in Cleveland were \nso proud of his accomplishments as a marine and devastated when they \nheard of his death.\n  According to family friend Steve Dever, all activity at Cleveland \nHopkins International Airport halted when Robert's body arrived. In \nSteve's words:\n\n       I'm glad to see he's getting a hero's funeral.\n\n  Before he was buried at Arlington, a memorial service was held in \nRobert's honor at St. Luke Lutheran Church in Cleveland. Robert's \ncousin, Richard Samkas, said he and Robert grew up like brothers, and \nthat he remembers him as a ``fun, outgoing kid [who] always had some \nthings funny to say.'' After the memorial service, these were Richard's \nwords:\n\n       If there is any way I'd want someone to remember him, it's \n     his honor--the way he honored the military every time he put \n     on that uniform.\n\n  The world is a better place because Robert lived among us. He was a \nyoung\n\n[[Page S11251]]\n\nman of courage and compassion, someone who served our Nation with honor \nand distinction. My wife Fran and I will continue to keep his family in \nour thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                      Lance Corporal Jeremy Shock\n\n  Mr. President, this morning I come to the Senate floor to honor \nMarine LCpl Jeremy Shock. This Green Springs, OH, native died on \nNovember 19, 2006, when the vehicle he was riding in hit an improvised \nexplosive device near Fallujah, Iraq. He was 22 years of age at the \ntime.\n  Jeremy had only been in Iraq since mid-September when the incident \noccurred. He served as a machine gunner while in Iraq and also repaired \nweapons in the armory.\n  Friends and family said Jeremy always put others before himself. One \nof his former roommates Seth Mahon said this of Jeremy's selflessness:\n\n       Jeremy was the greatest guy I ever met. . . . He was the \n     guy who, if he only had $5 and you needed it, he was going to \n     give it to you. He never asked for help. If you were having a \n     bad day, he would make it a good day.\n\n  A 2002 graduate of Clyde High School, Jeremy was a lineman on the \nfootball team and set an example for his fellow classmates and \nteammates. During Jeremy's funeral, his uncles carried his football \njersey and a football. The flag hung at half staff at the high school \nwhere his brother Zack is a sophomore and his sister Sara is a \nfreshman. Jeremy's High School principal, Joe Webb, said this of Jeremy \nshortly after his funeral:\n\n       Jeremy was a great kid. He was the type of kid that was a \n     leader through example. He would give you a great effort \n     every time. Whatever you asked him to do, you know he would \n     give his maximum effort and get it done. There's just no \n     better young man who's come through Clyde High School than \n     Jeremy Shock.\n  That is what his high school principal said.\n  After graduating from high school, Jeremy enrolled in Tiffin \nUniversity. His friend Lacey Cherry remembers the first time she met \nhim, a few days after they moved in at school. Jeremy, a large football \nplayer, would run around the dorms introducing himself to every person \nhe met. Lacey said, ``Ever since then, we had been really, really \nclose.''\n  Jeremy's roommates at Tiffin, Seth Mahon and Jake Tidaback, remember \nhow Jeremy was smart, how he worked hard, and how he always would make \nthem laugh. They recall how important joining the Marines was to him. \nAccording to Jake, there was no one who could serve our country better \nthan Jeremy. In his words:\n\n       Jeremy was simply the typical best friend, the kid who \n     would be there whenever you needed him. He was always happy. \n     If you would be having a bad day, he would make it a good \n     day.\n\n  Jeremy enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserves prior to his senior year \nat Tiffin. He decided to join while he was interning for the \nInternational Criminal Police Organization in the summer of 2005. He \nthen graduated with a degree in criminal justice in the spring of 2006.\n  Jeremy always had a positive outlook on life--an attitude he \nmaintained while serving in Iraq. He kept in touch with his former \nTiffin roommates Seth and Jake through e-mail. They remember that while \nJeremy would say that serving in Iraq had its ``ups and downs,'' he \nalways concluded that things ``didn't seem too bad.'' As Seth said, \n``Jeremy just wasn't a very negative person.''\n  Last April, Jeremy married Clara, his college sweetheart. The two met \nwhile they were both attending Tiffin. They were married while Jeremy \nwas home for a 3-day leave. Bonnie Tiell, former assistant athletic \ndirector and tennis coach at Tiffin University, remembers how caring \nJeremy was and how he loved Clara completely. Jeremy's family and \nfriends remember how much he was looking forward to returning home so \nhe could spend more time with her.\n  During Jeremy's funeral, Clara read the last letter she wrote to him, \nand I would like to read an excerpt from that letter:\n\n       You've made me the happiest woman on Earth. You always give \n     me support when I need it. Even when you're far away, you're \n     here for me. I really don't know yet what I'm going to do \n     without you in my life.\n\n  Jeremy will be missed by all who knew him and all who loved him. As \nhis former roommate Seth said:\n\n       He will definitely be missed. He's taking a lot of hearts \n     with him.\n\n  Jeremy was a humble man who never wanted to be in the spotlight. He \ntook pride in serving his country, and he was someone full of purpose \nwith a strong sense of duty. The military recognized Jeremy's \nleadership and his drive. He was honored with a National Defense \nService medal and a certificate of commendation.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks with the words from a prayer that \nwas posted on an Internet tribute Web site in Jeremy's honor, and this \nis what it said:\n\n       O Lord, into your hands, we humbly entrust our brother. In \n     this life, you embraced him with your tender love; deliver \n     him now from evil and bid him enter into eternal rest.\n\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Jeremy and his wife Clara, his \nfather and mother, Duane and Sherry, and his brother and sister, Zack \nand Sara, in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from Ohio. He \nhas taken on a special responsibility for fallen soldiers from his \nState to come to the floor and pay tribute to each of them. It involves \na great deal of work on his part to put together the record of their \nlives. It also involves a great deal of commitment on his part. He \nshows again to Members of the Senate that he is a man with great heart, \nand I know that he speaks not only for himself and his family but for \nall of us in extending our condolences to the 2,899 American soldiers \nwho have fallen in the war in Iraq. I thank him for doing this on \nbehalf of his State, and I join him in his salute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11251-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11251-S11252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IRAQ STUDY GROUP REPORT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a few moments ago, the Iraq Study Group \npresented their report. This is an historic document. It is 142 pages \nlong and easily read. Within the confines of this publication is a very \nimportant message. I want to salute, first, the members of this Iraq \nStudy Group. These men and one woman have risen to the call of public \nservice in a way that is exemplary for all of us who are involved in \npublic life. Former Secretary of State James Baker, former Congressman \nLee Hamilton, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, Vernon E. Jordan, Jr., Edwin \nMeese, III, former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Leon E. \nPanetta, William J. Perry, former Senator Charles S. Robb, and former \nSenator Alan K. Simpson have produced a bipartisan report on a war that \ntroubles every single American, and their conclusion in this report is \nclear. Their conclusion is it is time for the American troops to leave \nIraq and begin coming home. Their conclusion is that we are no longer \nwaiting, if we ever were, for the permission of Iraq for this to \nhappen. Instead, we are putting Iraq on notice that it is time for them \nto stand and make the important decisions for their future that will \nlead to stability in that nation.\n  They have shown, with this report, an impatience and frustration \nwhich has been shared with the American people. On November 7, Election \nDay, the American people were very clear. They said overwhelmingly by \ntheir votes across America they want a change in our policy in Iraq. It \nis no longer acceptable to lose so many of our best and bravest \nsoldiers, no longer acceptable to be bringing these brave soldiers home \nfor communities to grieve and to pray over them, as we should, but we \nmust bring this to an end. Twenty thousand or more American soldiers \nwere disabled in this war, some of whom will struggle for a lifetime to \nrebuild their lives and their futures. It is also time for us to bring \nan end to the expenditure of money on the war in Iraq; $2 billion to $3 \nbillion a week that we are spending.\n\n  At a time when we are cutting back on research at the National \nInstitutes of Health for medical research; at a time when we are unable \nto fund No Child Left Behind, when we know that our children, our \nfuture leaders, need a helping hand and we are unable to provide the \nresources; at a time when we cannot help working families pay for their \nhealth insurance, we are sending billions of dollars over for this war \nin Iraq, a war that has now lasted longer than World War II.\n  The report of the Iraq Study Group is a call to action. It is a call \nfor change, and, quite frankly, it is a call on the\n\n[[Page S11252]]\n\nPresident, our Commander in Chief, to move forward with new leadership \nand with a new candor in dealing with the people of Iraq.\n  They also make a bold suggestion, which I endorse, that we need to \nopen the diplomatic front. We need to bring to the table in the Middle \nEast many countries that we have shunned for a long period of time, \ncountries that, frankly, we disagree with on many basic things. We need \nto bring to that table Iran, a country which we have very few things in \ncommon with but a country we need to bring in and discuss the future \nstability in the Middle East. We need to bring Syria to the table as \nwell, in the hopes that they will become an agent for positive change \nin the Middle East and for stability. There are some who will disagree \nwith that, but I am not one of them. I recall, in the darkest days of \nthe Cold War, we would sit down with the Russians, we would sit down \nwith Soviet leaders, we would try to work out differences, try to find \nways to bring a peaceful resolution to many contentious problems. That \nwas the American way then, and it should be now in the Middle East.\n  I salute the Iraq Study Group. They have given us a guidepost. They \nhave given us a roadmap, in terms of our future policy in Iraq, and \nnow, with the American people calling for change, with the Iraq Study \nGroup on a bipartisan basis calling for change, now, the responsibility \nshifts to the President of the United States. I hope that he will \ndemonstrate his commitment to change by beginning to redeploy American \ntroops out of Iraq starting in January of next year. If we are to meet \nthe goal of this Iraq Study Group of the American combat forces \nredeployed out of Iraq by March of 2008, then we need to begin that \nprocess and begin it as soon as possible. For our soldiers, for their \nfamilies, for the American people, the President needs to begin this \nredeployment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11252-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11252-S11259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING SENATORIAL SERVICE\n\n\n                             James Jeffords\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, most of us remember the tectonic shift \nthat occurred in the Senate in 2001, in the month of May, when our \ncolleague, Jim Jeffords, changed parties. He moved from being a \nRepublican to becoming an Independent Senator and lined up with the \nDemocratic Caucus. Never before had control of the Senate changed on \nthe decision of one Senator.\n  It wasn't the first time Jim Jeffords had followed his conscience and \nmade history. I can recall his alliance with my predecessor, Senator \nPaul Simon. At a time many years ago, in 1994, when Rwanda was facing a \ngenocide, Paul Simon and Jim Jeffords were the two voices in the United \nStates who stood up and called for the Clinton administration to do \nsomething to stop this genocide. Unfortunately, it did not occur and \nhundreds of thousands of people lost their lives. But that call to \naction by Jim Jeffords was just one of the achievements of his public \ncareer he can point to with pride.\n  During that genocide, he was the ranking Republican of the Senate \nForeign Relations Subcommittee on Africa. The chairman of that \ncommittee, Paul Simon, joined with him in that effort. Five weeks after \nthe slaughter in Rwanda began, Senators Simon and Jeffords phoned GEN \nRomeo Dallaire, head of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Kigali, and \nasked what he needed. The desperate general said he needed 5,000 \nAmerican troops to stop the killing. Those two Senators, Jeffords and \nSimon, got on the phone, begging the White House to send the troops. \nThey wrote in their common message:\n\n       Obviously, there are risks involved, but we cannot sit by \n     idly while this tragedy continues to unfold.\n\n  Senators Jeffords and Simon received no reply, and the killings \ncontinued. Hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women, and children \nwere killed or maimed.\n  Later, Paul Simon would say:\n\n       If every Member of the House and Senate had received 100 \n     letters from people back home saying that we have to do \n     something about Rwanda, when the crisis was first developing, \n     then I think the response would have been different.\n\n  So many times I have stood on the floor of the Senate pleading for \nour Nation to intervene to stop the genocide in Darfur. Each time, I \nhave thought about Paul Simon and Jim Jeffords. Had the President \nlistened to them, hundreds of thousands of people in Rwanda could have \nsurvived that genocide. It doesn't take a great deal of moral courage \nto follow your conscience when the world is on your side, but it is \nwhen you stand alone, knowing you may lose, and you follow your \nconscience anyway, that you demonstrate real moral courage.\n  Time and again in his public career, Jim Jeffords, the retiring \nSenator from Vermont, has shown that courage. He has been an unwavering \nchampion of children and families with special needs, the environment, \naffordable health care for all Americans, and budget policies that are \nboth compassionate and responsible. He believes in moderation, \ntolerance, and that the Federal Government be committed to protecting \nbasic individual freedoms.\n  Three years ago this week, Paul Simon died unexpectedly following \nheart surgery. At the end of this week, Jim Jeffords will be casting \nhis last vote in the Senate. We wish him well in the next chapter of \nhis life. Those of us who have had the privilege of working with Jim \nJeffords, the new Senators who will join us soon, and those who will \nfollow in years to come would do well to remember the moral courage of \nSenator James Jeffords of Vermont.\n\n\n                             Paul Sarbanes\n\n  Another retiring colleague is one of my favorites. I have been asked \ntime and again: Who are your favorite Senators on the Democratic side? \nAnd I usually came up with two I always look to for wisdom and \nguidance: Paul Sarbanes and Carl Levin. I am glad that Carl Levin will \ncontinue his Senate career and has announced that he will run for \nreelection. But Paul Sarbanes is leaving the Senate after many years of \nfine service.\n  Paul Sarbanes is the quintessential American success story. His \nparents were immigrants from the same little town in Greece. They met \nin America, and what else would Greek immigrants do? They opened a \nrestaurant--in Salisbury, MD. They picked a classic American name for \ntheir restaurant. They called it The Mayflower, and Paul Sarbanes \nstarted as a young boy working in his family's restaurant and living \n``above the store,'' as they used to say.\n  He graduated from public high school, but a pretty good student and \nnot a bad basketball player, he won a scholarship to Princeton \nUniversity, studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, and earned a law \ndegree from Harvard in 1960. He was set to make a fortune as an \nattorney in private practice but, instead, he listened to President \nKennedy's call to public service and took a job as assistant to Walter \nHeller, who was President Kennedy's Chairman of the Council of Economic \nAdvisers.\n  Paul Sarbanes won his first election 40 years ago to the Maryland \nHouse of Delegates and was elected to the United States Senate 30 years \nago. He is the longest serving U.S. Senator in the history of the State \nof Maryland. It is said that the Senate is the most exclusive club in \nthe world. Paul Sarbanes is a member of one of the most exclusive clubs \nwithin it. Of the 1,885 Americans who have had the rare privilege and \nhonor to serve in the Senate, Paul Sarbanes is one of only 27 who have \nbeen here long enough to cast 10,000 votes in the Senate.\n  He is a modest, soft-spoken, hard-working man and one of the \nbrightest people I have ever served with in the House or the Senate.\n  A Congressional Quarterly profile says of Paul Sarbanes:\n\n       He possesses the intellectual skills to leave his opponents \n     sputtering.\n\n  He was a voice of reason in the House Judiciary Committee during the \nWatergate hearings of 1974 and later in the Senate's Iran-Contra and \nWhitewater investigations.\n  It was Senator Sarbanes's leadership in the wake of the scandals at \nEnron and WorldCom that led to the reforms in Sarbanes-Oxley, the most \nfar-reaching reform of accountability standards since the Great \nDepression.\n  An interesting thing happened a week ago. On November 30, a group \nwith an impressive and quasi-official-sounding name, the Committee on \nCapital Market Regulation, released a report arguing that excessive and \noverzealous regulation was hobbling U.S. capital markets. The report \nincluded 32\n\n[[Page S11253]]\n\nrecommendations, among them to redesign the SEC, the Securities and \nExchange Commission, to make it friendlier to business and increase \nprotections against private lawsuits against businesses--in other \nwords, pull some of the teeth out of the Sarbanes-Oxley reforms.\n  The very next day we learned that the report had been financed by a \nfoundation with ties to what the Washington Post described as ``a pair \nof well-heeled business donors and an executive battling civil \ncharges'' in a lawsuit filed in New York by the attorney general.\n  Some pension watchdogs and consumer advocates they turned out to be. \nThey were sounding an alarm bell with a real personal interest in mind. \nSo we should take care; before we make any wholesale change in the \nSarbanes-Oxley rules, we need to understand that we need to protect the \nintegrity and security of America's financial markets. Paul Sarbanes \nhad the courage to lead that battle. Change can take place, but let's \nmake sure it is reasonable; study the issue and ask the hard questions.\n  For over 30 years Paul Sarbanes has served Maryland and the Nation. \nHe has earned a reputation for excellence and integrity, winning the \nPaul Douglas Award for ethics just 2 years ago. He has given America \nsome of the most important legislation, but he has spoken out \nconsistently on the floor of the Senate so many times with the kind of \nleadership which we ask for in the Senate. I will be sorry to see him \nretire.\n  But the Sarbanes name lives on in Congress. On November 7 his son \nJohn Peter Styros Sarbanes was elected to represent Maryland's Third \nCongressional District, replacing Senator-elect Ben Cardin. In typical \nSarbanes fashion, his son won with 65 percent of the vote and will \ncontinue the Sarbanes family tradition of serving Maryland and America.\n\n\n                              Mark Dayton\n\n  Mr. President, Mark Dayton served representing the State of \nMinnesota. Business was his background, not politics. But Senator \nDayton developed a passion for politics at an early age. While his \nparents supported Richard Nixon in 1960 and 1968, Senator Dayton found \nanother hero in Bobby Kennedy. As a college student at Yale, he \nprotested the Vietnam war. He began using a share of his family's \nfortune to support progressives.\n  In return, he made it on an enemies list. He was investigated by the \nFBI, targeted by the IRS, and had that dubious distinction of being on \nRichard Nixon's enemies list, a distinction that he now wears as a \nbadge of honor.\n  He has devoted his entire adult life to public service, broadly \ndefined. Born into privilege, he fought for those less fortunate from \nthe start, especially for poor children. After college he taught \nscience in New York City and counseled runaway children in Boston. \nReturning to his Minnesota roots, he served as an aide to Walter \nMondale, then as Minnesota's State economic development commissioner, \nand later State auditor. Mark Dayton was elected to the Senate 6 years \nago on his second try. His first 2 years in the Senate he had that \ngreat colleague, Paul Wellstone. For the last 4 years, Mark Dayton, \nlike many of us, has tried to carry Paul Wellstone's standard, to fight \nfor the people that Paul Wellstone used to call ``the little fellers,'' \nwho don't have expensive lobbyists to watch out for them in the Senate.\n  Mark Dayton has been a consistent voice for fairness. He has used his \nown Senate salary to pay for seniors to travel to Canada to purchase \nless expensive prescription drugs. He has been a strong advocate for \nethanol, renewable energy, strengthening America's energy security, \nreducing global warming, and boosting the income of family farmers.\n\n  Senator Dayton was one of only 23 Senators who voted against the \nIraqi war resolution in 2002. He has used his seat on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee to ask hard questions of those who planned and are \noverseeing the war. He has demanded accountability from them while he \nhas continued to show consistent support for the men and women in \nuniform.\n  I look forward to seeing how Senator Mark Dayton will serve America \nnext, and I wish him the very best.\n\n\n                              Mike De Wine\n\n  I also express my best wishes to my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle leaving the Senate at the end of this session. I already made \nmention of Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio. So many times over the 10 years \nthat I served in the Senate I walked across the aisle searching for an \nally and found Mike DeWine. Whether it was a fight to put more efforts \ninto the global AIDS effort to reduce the deaths around the world or an \neffort to reach out and provide assistance to Haiti, a country which my \nfriend Mike DeWine has adopted, time and time again he rose to that \nchallenge. Debt reduction in Africa--so many other issues. His speech \ntoday on the floor was just another indication of the kind of \ncompassion that he brought to service in the Senate.\n  Elections come and go but the record that has been written by my \nfriend Senator Mike DeWine will endure.\n\n\n                             Rick Santorum\n\n  Senator Rick Santorum and I spent most of our time on the floor of \nthe Senate in hot debate, disagreeing on almost everything. But we \nfound some areas of agreement, and one of them was the global AIDS \neffort. I am glad that he joined as my partner in that effort. The \nmoney that we secured that will be spent around the world will save \nlives and provide hope.\n\n\n                             Lincoln Chafee\n\n  Senator Lincoln Chafee, a quiet voice of moderation from the State of \nRhode Island, followed in the footsteps of his great father, John \nChafee, with whom I was honored to serve. Senator Lincoln Chafee time \nand again would stand independently and express his views and his \nconscience. He was the only Republican of the 23 Senators who voted \nagainst the Iraqi war resolution.\n\n\n                              George Allen\n\n  Senator George Allen of Virginia and I have worked on a few measures \ntogether, including some help for veterans who returned from the war in \nIraq with traumatic brain injury.\n\n\n                              Conrad Burns\n\n  Senator Conrad Burns and I have served on the Appropriations \nCommittee and are friends from the Senate gym where we get together \nevery morning and find a few things to laugh about.\n\n\n                             William Frist\n\n  Senator Bill Frist is our leader in the U.S. Senate. We have had some \nbattles, of course, as you would. But we have also shown respect to one \nanother, and I respect the job that he has done and wish him the very \nbest. I might say of Senator Bill Frist that his commitment to public \nservice doesn't end with the Senate. He has taken his amazing skills as \na heart surgeon to some of the poorest places on Earth, spending spare \ntime which he could have had with his family or relaxing somewhere, \ninstead in some of the most outlying sections of the world helping the \nless fortunate. That speaks volumes about the heart of Bill Frist.\n  I wish all of my colleagues who are retiring well as they begin the \nnext chapters of their careers.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to several \nof my friends here in Washington. Too often we get caught up here in \nthe back-and-forth of politics and lose sight of the contributions of \nthose with whom we work every day. It is only at moments such as, at \nthe end of a cycle, that we have a moment to reflect on the \ncontributions of our colleagues. And while we may not always see eye-\nto-eye, this Senate is losing several admirable contributors who have \nmade many sacrifices to serve our democracy.\n  Mr. President, we are losing one of the great deans of the Senate in \nmy friend Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland. As many have already \nnoted, Senator Sarbanes helped bring the greatest disinfectant--\nsunshine--into the corporate boardrooms of America after the fall of \nEnron, to help investors cull out the few bad apples from the American \neconomy. In his three decades in the Senate, Senator Sarbanes has \nworked with five Presidents, seen the end of the Cold War, the boom of \nthe information age, and even a balanced budget a few years back. Any \nregular C-SPAN viewer would agree that he is one of the most incisive \nand skilled questioners in the Senate, and his work has elicited \nimportant testimony, bringing valuable information to the public \nsphere,\n\n[[Page S11254]]\n\nstrengthening our democracy. Through it all, his focus has always been \nthe people of Maryland, and his wisdom and experience will be missed.\n  I also want to say farewell to my friend from Vermont, Senator Jim \nJeffords--a true Yankee independent and a real treasure. When I joined \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee with Senator Jeffords, I learned early \non that he was an ally in standing up for America's veterans. I was \nalways impressed with his willingness to listen to all sides of an \nissue, and when he spoke, I was always listening. I have admired his \nstewardship of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and I know \nthat the Senate, the people of Vermont, and people across our country \nwill miss his leadership and his experience--more than three decades of \nservice.\n  Then there is my colleague on the Agriculture Committee, Senator Mark \nDayton of Minnesota. For much of his life, Senator Dayton has dedicated \nhimself to public service, both in Minnesota and in Washington--as a \nleader on economic development for his home State and later as State \nauditor before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2000. The Twin \nCities may be cold this time of year, but we all know that Minnesota \nDFLers will welcome him home warmly after his service in the Senate.\n  A number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will be \ndeparting in January, as well. There is our colleague from Virginia, \nSenator Allen, who wears, in my opinion, the second best pair of boots \nin the Senate. There is Senator Santorum of Pennsylvania, whose passion \nis admirable and whose energy is always enviable. Also leaving us is my \ncolleague in the centrist Gang of 14 that helped bring this Senate back \nfrom the abyss; Senator DeWine of Ohio, who will head back to the \nBuckeye State with my respect and admiration; and my friend Senator \nTalent from Missouri, with whom I spent many hours in the Agriculture \nCommittee working to level the playing field for America's farmers and \nranchers. We will miss Senator Chafee of Rhode Island's independence \nand his clear voice for fiscal discipline in Washington. And we will \nmiss Senator Burns of Montana, who shares my passion for rural America \nand who is headed home to Big Sky Country, back to the Rockies that I \nknow we both miss so much.\n  Finally, I wish to thank the majority leader, Senator Frist, for his \nservice to this body and this Nation. He is a man of remarkable skill \nand dedication, and he will now return to serving his constituents in \nthe way he knew first--as a healer. I am sure each of his future \npatients is already grateful for his skill and wisdom returning to \ntouch their lives directly.\n  America, when held to its finest ideals, is more than a place on the \nglobe or a work in progress. It is the inspiration to those around the \nworld and here at home to seek out excellence within themselves and \ntheir beliefs. It has been a pleasure to work alongside each of these \ngentlemen, who have helped me as I have found my way, sometimes \nliterally, through the halls of the Senate, in the pursuit of these \ngreater ideals that we all share: security, prosperity and an America \nthat we leave better than when we arrived. These ideals will resonate \nhere long after we all are gone and another generation stands in our \nplace making the decisions of its day.\n\n\n                              Mark Dayton\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to a decent \nand principled member of this body, Mark Dayton. Over the past 6 years, \nSenator Dayton has proven his dedication to the highest ideals of this \nbody through his devotion to economic justice, education, and health \ncare concerns.\n  In October 2002, Mark Dayton voted against the Iraq war resolution, \ndespite the fact that President Bush was presenting fairly convincing \nevidence that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and most \nof the Nation was supportive of the decision to go to war. Mark Dayton \nheld to his convictions, and history will judge him favorably because \nof it.\n  As a Senator, Mark has donated his entire Senate salary to help his \nconstituents pay for prescription drugs. His salary goes to the \nMinnesota Senior Federation for ``Rx Express'' bus trips to help senior \ncitizens buy cheaper prescription drugs in Canada. In the Senate, he \nhas fought to make such trips less necessary by proposing the Meeting \nOur Responsibility to Medicare Beneficiaries Act to permit the \nGovernment to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical \ncompanies. He has also introduced the Taste of Our Own Medicine Act to \nrequire Members of Congress to share the same prescription drug \nbenefits as Medicare recipients.\n  Mark Dayton's 6 years in the Senate are a continuation of his \nlifelong commitment to public service. He previously worked as a \nteacher on the Lower East Side of New York, as a counselor for \nrunaways, and as the chief financial officer for a social service \nagency in Boston. He worked for Senator Walter Mondale and campaigned \nwith him during his Vice Presidential bid with President Jimmy Carter. \nMark also served twice as commissioner of the Minnesota Department of \nEnergy and Economic Development.\n  Mark Dayton has used the economic experience he gained as \ncommissioner, and as Minnesota State auditor to help American workers \nduring his time in the Senate. He has supported extended unemployment \nassistance and an increase in the minimum wage while opposing \noutsourcing of American jobs.\n  Senator Dayton has been a strong supporter of increased funding for \neducation. He introduced the Nontraditional Student Success Act and the \nRestore the Dream Act to help students pay for higher education. He has \nrepeatedly insisted that Congress live up to its promise to America's \npublic schools and children by offering amendments to fully fund the \nfederal government's commitment to special education. Mark has also \nfought for additional career and technical training.\n  During his time in this body, Mark Dayton has nobly stood up for the \nAmerican people. In a speech on the Senate floor, he noted: ``A \ngovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people is a \ngovernment that tells the truth to its citizens. If it doesn't, it is \nnot a government of them, not by them, and certainly not for them. It \nis imperative.''\n  Although Mark Dayton's voice will no longer be heard on the Senate \nfloor, I know that he will continue to do great work for Minnesotans \nand for all Americans. I am proud to have served with him and wish him \nall the best.\n\n\n                             Lincoln Chafee\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in his Pulitzer Prize winning book, \n``Profiles in Courage,'' Senator John F. Kennedy extolled the virtues \nof political courage. ``Surely, in the United States of America, where \nbrother once fought brother,'' Senator Kennedy wrote, ``we do not judge \na man's bravery under fire by examining the banner under which he \nfought.''\n  For 7 years I have watched and admired the courage of Senator Lincoln \nChafee, who sits on the other side of the aisle, and who will be \nleaving us at the end of the 109th Congress.\n  I have watched and admired his firm stands against his own political \nparty, the Senate leadership, and the Presidential administration as he \nfollowed the dictates of his conscience. ``A man does what he must,'' \nwrote Senator Kennedy, ``in spite of personal consequences, in spite of \nobstacles and dangers and pressures--and that is the basis of all human \nmorality.'' This was the basis of Senator Chafee's tenure in the \nSenate.\n  Senator Chafee was appointed to the Senate in 1999 upon the death of \nhis father, the beloved and respected Senator John Chafee. He \nimmediately proved himself to be, to use an old cliche, a ``chip off \nthe old block.'' Senator Lincoln Chafee proved himself to be a Senator \nof immense integrity, great dignity, and high principle. And, like his \nfather, he proved himself a Senator of incredible courage.\n  He was the first Senate Republican to oppose the Bush tax cuts in \n2001.\n  He was a Senator who helped preserve the Senate as the institution \nthat was planned and handed down to us by the Framers of our \nConstitution, and all the great lawmakers who served in this Chamber \nbefore us. Senator Chafee was one of the seven Republicans who composed \nthe so-called gang of 14 that was ready to block the majority leader's \nuse of the ``nuclear option'' that would have destroyed the\n\n[[Page S11255]]\n\nU.S. Senate as a unique and sacred institution by curtailing the \nability of the minority to filibuster.\n  I, of course, will always remember, admire, and appreciate Senator \nChafee as the only Senate Republican to vote against the Iraqi war \nresolution. He was one of the immortal 23 Members of this Chamber who \nstood against popular opinion, stood up to the President of the United \nStates, and threw himself against the forces of war in voting against \nthe resolution to launch an unprecedented military assault on Iraq. If \nonly there had been more Senators like him, we would not find ourselves \nin a bloody quagmire in Iraq.\n  In voting against the war resolution, Senator Chafee was determined \nnot to hand over to President Bush, or any President, the power to \ndeclare war. That power, according to our Constitution, belongs to the \nCongress. With his firm belief in our constitutional doctrines of the \nseparation of powers and checks and balances, Senator Chafee opposed \nmany of the worst provisions of President Bush's efforts to create an \nall powerful Department of Homeland Security. He opposed, for example, \nthe administration's plan to reduce the civil service protections and \ndissolve the collective bargaining rights of federal employees in the \nnewly created agency.\n  Although he will soon be leaving Congress, there is a bright side. \nSenator Chafee will now have more time to spend with his wife Stephanie \nand their three children and to ride his horse Trapper. I wish all of \nthem happiness and success in their future endeavors, and many happy \nhours in the saddle.\n\n\n                              Mike DeWine\n\n  Mr. President, with the conclusion of the 109th Congress, Senator \nDeWine will be leaving us.\n  I do not want to say farewell to him, but to thank him for being a \ncongenial colleague and an outstanding Senator, a Senator who truly \nappreciated this chamber, its traditions, and the way it is supposed to \nwork.\n  For 12 years, he was an effective Senator, a Senator who built a \nlong, impressive list of legislative accomplishments on a wide range of \nissues, largely, I believe, because of his willingness to reach out, \nand to work with Members on this side of the aisle. In a true \nbipartisan spirit, he worked with my dear friend, Senator Kennedy, to \nincrease Federal regulation of tobacco.\n  He worked with Senator Dodd for a bill to provide health screening \nfor newborns.\n  He worked with Senator Paul Wellstone on legislation that revamped \njob training programs, and with Senator Lautenberg on bills to crack \ndown on drunk drivers.\n  With Senator Clinton, he promoted legislation to ensure that drug \ncompanies do a better job in studying the effects of their products on \nchildren.\n  For nearly a decade, whether in the majority or the minority, Senator \nDeWine cooperated with Senator Kohl in running the Antitrust \nSubcommittee on a bipartisan basis, and in the process, helped provide \nAmericans with cheaper phone service, more choices on television, and \ndirect flights home for the holidays.\n  He teamed up with my colleague from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, in promoting legislation that changed the government's \nemphasis in child custody cases from preserving family strucure to \nprotecting the best interests of the child.\n  Indeed, caring for and protecting America's children was a major \nfocus of his tenure in the Senate, and I applaud him for it. His \nconcern for children, among other concerns, led him to successfully \npush for legislation to improve school bus safety and tougher child \npornography laws.\n  I, of course, know Senator DeWine best from his service on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. He chaired the District of Columbia \nAppropriations Subcommittee, which I know from personal experience, is \nno easy chore. It is one of the most difficult and thankless tasks in \nthe Senate, and he did it very effectively. One of his objectives in \nthis position was to reform the District's child welfare system--and, \nagain, I know from personal experience, just how difficult and \nthankless reforming the District's welfare system can be. Senator \nDeWine worked at it, and had some outstanding successes.\n  Senator DeWine and I worked together to enact and defend the \nContinued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act, a trade law that returns to \ninjured companies and workers the duties that are collected by Customs \non unfairly traded imports. He also supported the enactment of the \nEmergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program--a program that has kept \nWheeling-Pittsburgh Steel in business and over 3,000 people employed \nfor decades. It is well recognized that, if the program had not \nprovided Wheeling-Pitt with its loan guarantee, the company would no \nlonger exist.\n  I will always remember Senator DeWine as a Senator who took the risk \nto help preserve the Senate as it was handed down to us by the Framers \nof our Constitution, and all the great lawmakers who served in this \nChamber before us. Senator DeWine was of the seven Republicans who \nhelped form the so-called gang of 14 to help block the majority \nleader's determination to use the ``nuclear option'' that would have \ndestroyed the U.S. Senate as a unique institution.\n  I know this effort cost him support from Members of his own party, \nand from folks back home. It reminds me of the words of Senator John F. \nKennedy, who wrote:\n\n       If the American people comprehended the terrible pressures \n     which discourage acts of political courage, which drive a \n     Senator to abandon or subdue his conscience, then they might \n     be less critical of those who take the easier road--and more \n     appreciative of those still able to follow the path of \n     courage.\n\n  For 12 years Senator DeWine took the path of political courage.\n  Mr. President, shortly after coming to this Chamber, Senator DeWine \nremarked, ``when you go to the Senate, you don't know how long you'll \nbe there. So you want to use your time wisely.'' In his two terms in \nthe Senate, Senator DeWine used his time wisely and effectively. As he \nleaves the Senate, he should take pride in the knowledge that his \npresence here may well have saved this sacred institution, and from the \nbottom of my heart, I thank him for it.\n  I wish him and his wife Fran health, happiness and never-ending \nsuccess as they begin the next phase of their lives and careers.\n\n\n                              conrad burns\n\n  Mr. President, the great State of Montana is Big Sky Country. It is \nthe land of open space, grizzly bears, gray wolves, and ponderosa \npines. It is a land of vast grasslands and the magnificent Glacier and \nYellowstone National Parks. It is the land of Senator Conrad Burns who \nwill be leaving us at the end of this session of Congress.\n  His service in this Chamber was the capstone of a fascinating, \nmultifaceted career. A Marine veteran, Senator Burns had worked for two \ndifferent major airlines, and had worked as a firefighter, a livestock \nfieldman, commissioner of Yellowstone County, and an auctioneer.\n  He had also served as a radio announcer, a farm broadcaster on the \nNorthern Agricultural Farm Network. A member of my staff grew up in \nGreat Falls, MT. She remembers, as a child, waking up very early on \ncold, Montana mornings, going out to feed the horses, and coming in to \nhear Senator Burns giving his ``ag'' report on television, telling the \npeople of Montana the price of pork bellies, hard red winter wheat, and \nother commodities.\n  With his boots, wide belt buckles, and folksy mannerisms, few people \nwould have expected that this Montana cowboy would become one of the \nSenate's leading experts in high-tech telecommunications.\n  During his service on the Committee on Commerce, Science, Senator \nBurns embraced and fostered new communications technologies. He chaired \nthe first interactive hearing on Capitol Hill and cofounded the \nCongressional Internet Caucus. As chairman of the Communications \nSubcommittee, he helped bring the Nation's communications laws into the \ndigital age as he helped broaden the use of the Internet. Indeed, he \nhas been praised as ``one of the fathers of the modern Internet.''\n  To the relief of, perhaps, millions of American Internet users, \nSenator Burns tangled with mass marketers to help secure enactment of \nantispam legislation.\n  With his interests in telecommunications, he enhanced 9-1-1 services \nthroughout the country, and worked with Senator Clinton in sponsoring \nlegislation to upgrade technology on cell phones.\n\n[[Page S11256]]\n\n  On the Senate Appropriations Committee, he chaired the Interior \nSubcommittee, and this is where I came to know and appreciate him. As a \nWesterner, Senator Burns brought an important perspective, as well as a \nwealth of experience and knowledge to the diverse and difficult issues \nthat came up in the Interior Appropriations bill that were important to \nhis state, and to his region of the country.\n  In 2001 and 2002, when I chaired the committee, it was a pleasure to \nhave Senator Burns serving as ranking member of the Interior \nSubcommittee and to work with him and his able staff. His dedication to \nduty, his willingness to work in bipartisan fashion, and his always \ngracious manner made my work infinitely easier. It was simply a \npleasure to work with and to serve with Senator Burns on this \nsubcommittee.\n  I must now say good-bye to my good friend and colleague. I wish \nSenator Burns and his dear wife Phyllis happiness and success as they \nnow prepare for the next phase of their lives.\n  In honor of and appreciation for the Senate's Montana cowboy, who was \nat one time in his career an auctioneer, I offer the following verse:\n\n\n                     the touch of the master's hand\n\n     `Twas battered and scarred, and the auctioneer\n     Thought it was scarcely worth his while\n     To waste much time on the old violin,\n     But held it up with a smile.\n     ``What am I bidden, good folks,'' he cried,\n     ``Who will start bidding for me?\n     A dollar, a dollar''--then, ``Two!'' ``Only two?\n     Two dollars, and who'll make it three?\n     Three dollars once; three dollars, twice;\n     Going for three--'' But no,\n     From the room, far back, a gray-haired man\n     Came forward and picked up the bow;\n     Then, wiping the dust from the old violin,\n     And tightening the loose strings,\n     He played a melody pure and sweet\n     As a caroling angel sings.\n\n     The music ceased, and the auctioneer\n     With a voice that was quiet and low,\n     Said, ``What am I bidden for the old violin?''\n     And he held it up with the bow.\n     ``A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two?\n     Two thousand! And who'll make it three?\n\n     Three thousand, once; three thousand, twice;\n     And going, and gone!'' said he.\n     The people cheered, but some of them cried\n     ``We do not quite understand\n     What changed its worth?'' Swift came the reply:\n     ``The touch of the master's hand.''\n\n     And many a man with life out of tune,\n     And battered and scarred with sin,\n     Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd,\n     Much like the old violin.\n     A ``mess of pottage,'' a glass of wine;\n     A game--and he travels on.\n     He's ``going'' once, and ``going'' twice,\n     He's ``going'' and almost ``gone.''\n     But the Master comes, and the foolish crowd\n     Never can quite understand\n     The worth of a soul, and the change that's wrought\n     By the touch of the Master's hand.\n       --Myra Brooks Welch\n\n\n                               Bill Frist\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to Senator \nBill Frist, who has served Tennessee in the U.S. Senate for the last 12 \nyears, the last few in the esteemed and challenging position of Senate \nmajority leader.\n  Senator Frist was my partner on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee's Subcommittee on African Affairs for several years in which \nwe both served as chairman or ranking member. I have appreciated his \nknowledge and passion for issues affecting Africa and the deep \ncommitment he brings to the global fight against HIV/AIDS. I also have \ngreat respect for his commitment to bringing his medical expertise to \nremote areas in Africa. There is no doubt that he has personally made a \nsignificant contribution to helping improve the lives of people around \nthe world living with HIV/AIDS.\n  I have also had the honor of sharing with Senator Frist the important \nwork of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, CSIS, Task \nForce on HIV/AIDS. Together, with many distinguished experts, we have \nbeen able to contribute to the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We \nset course on a bold agenda to help nearly 40 million people living \nwith HIV/AIDS in the world today. Senator Frist understands the impact \nof this disease that continues to ravage individuals, families, \ncommunities, and entire economies. While we have much work left ahead, \nSenator Frist has been pivotal in the efforts we have made thus far in \nthe fight against this devastating disease.\n  Here in the Senate, we will miss Senator Frist's dedication to Africa \nand his hard work to find a cure for HIV/AIDS. I thank him for his \nservice and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.\n\n\n                              Jim Jeffords\n\n  Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to Senator Jim Jeffords, a \nman who has honorably served Vermont and this country in the U.S. \nSenate since 1989. The people of Vermont have been fortunate to be \nrepresented by a man who is as principled and dedicated to serving our \nNation's best interests as Jim Jeffords.\n  Senator Jeffords will long be remembered for his courage and \nconviction and for his bold decision to leave the Republican Party and \nbecome an Independent. Never straying from his principles and his \ncommitment to representing the interests of his constituents, Senator \nJeffords made this decision despite the consequences for him \npersonally. He knew his decision would enable him to better serve the \npeople of Vermont and this Nation. His conviction was also clear when \nhe voted against authorizing the President to use force in Iraq. He has \nalso been an unyielding voice for upholding civil liberties and seeking \nto eliminate discrimination in the workplace, and I greatly respect him \nfor his outspoken leadership on these critically important issues.\n  I am proud to have worked with him on other widely ranging issues \nover the years. I want to particularly thank him for helping to pass \nthe Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and eliminate soft money. Senator \nJeffords also played a crucial role in the effort to pass much-needed \nArmy Corps of Engineers reforms. Debate over these reforms was \ncontentious at times, and his work behind the scenes and on the floor \nwas needed to win support for changing the way the Corps does business. \nIn the next Congress we will work to build on Senator Jeffords' hard \nwork and commitment to these important issues.\n  As chairman and ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, he has been committed to reforming our Nation's energy \nand environmental policies. He is a champion for our environment, and \nhis leadership and expertise will be greatly missed. It is the \nresponsibility of the next Congress to honor Senator Jeffords' legacy \nin this area by redoubling our efforts to protect the environment.\n  I was proud to work with Senator Jeffords on other critical issues as \nwell. As a knowledgeable leader on education issues, having served as \nchairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, he \npushed for reforms to the No Child Left Behind law. I was proud to work \nwith him on efforts to support our military families and to cast votes \nalongside him to force Congress to be more fiscally responsible.\n  Here in the Senate, we will miss Jim Jeffords' thoughtful leadership, \nhis independence, and his friendship. He was a valued ally on so many \nissues, and I wish him all the best in his retirement.\n\n\n                             Lincoln Chafee\n\n  Mr. President, today I wish to thank Lincoln Chafee for his 7 years \nof service in the Senate and to recognize the many contributions he has \nmade during his time in this body. Senator Chafee is a soft-spoken man, \nbut he has not been afraid to take courageous stands, even when that \nmeant standing alone in his own party. From the moment he arrived in \nthe Senate, it was clear that Senator Chafee would not only honor his \nfather's outstanding legacy but that he would become a respected leader \nin his own right.\n  Working with him on so many issues over the last several years, I \nhave come to know Senator Chafee well and to appreciate just how \ndedicated he is to serving the people of Rhode Island and the people of \nthis great Nation.\n  I don't know anyone in this body more committed to fiscal \nresponsibility than Lincoln Chafee. He is absolutely as tough as they \ncome on that issue, and he was tireless about holding Congress's feet \nto the fire. On pay-as-you-go legislation, on the congressional pay \nraise, and on so many issues, Senator Chafee demanded that Congress \ntake fiscal responsibility seriously when it counted and not simply pay \nlip service to the issue when it is convenient. It has been a pleasure \nto\n\n[[Page S11257]]\n\nwork with him on this issue, and I am grateful for his efforts.\n  Senator Chafee has been a strong supporter of campaign finance reform \nand of environmental protection and conservation, and I appreciate his \nwork on those critical issues. Before I close, I also want to recognize \nSenator Chafee's vote against the war in Iraq, which is one of the most \ncourageous votes I have seen cast during my time here in the Senate. \nThat was a hard vote for many Members of this body, but to be the only \nMember of his party to oppose the war must have been especially \ndifficult. But, as always, Senator Chafee did what he thought was \nright, and we have seen just how right he was to vote against this war, \nwhich has been so harmful to our national security.\n  With every vote he has cast and every position he has taken, Senator \nChafee has conducted himself with the utmost integrity and earned his \ncolleagues' utmost respect. While he and I certainly haven't agreed on \nevery issue, I always appreciate his thoughtful approach to our work \nhere and his strong commitment to the highest ideals in public service. \nI know that the work he has done here has made a lasting mark on our \nNation for many years to come. I will miss serving with him in the \nSenate, and I wish him all the best.\n\n\n                              Mike De Wine\n\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute to Senator Mike DeWine, \nwho has served Ohio, and the Senate, with honor and integrity during \nhis 12-year tenure in this body.\n  I am pleased to have worked with him on a wide range of issues over \nthe years, including reforming children's health care and Medicaid. We \nalso worked together quite frequently on other issues of importance to \nthis Nation, and he has been a valuable colleague on both the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate Select Intelligence Committee. \nAlthough we did not see eye-to-eye on every issue, we found common \nground on several initiatives including passing stricter antitrust \nlegislation.\n  Together with Senator Dick Durbin, we introduced the Clean Diamonds \nAct, a bill to ensure that the United States is not participating in \nthe conflict diamond trade. This bill would prohibit the importation of \ndiamonds from countries that fail to implement a clearly articulated \nsystem of controls on rough diamonds. Senator DeWine believed in the \ninternational community's responsibility to stop the trade in conflict \ndiamonds, and I have been proud to work with him in that effort.\n  I also want to take a moment to recognize Senator DeWine's dedication \nto honoring fallen service members from Ohio. By coming to the floor to \npay tribute to those who gave their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, he \nhas reminded all of us of the tremendous debt we owe these brave men \nand women in uniform.\n  I thank him for his leadership and his service to Ohio and our \ncountry, and I wish him all the best as he moves on to begin a new \nchapter in his distinguished career.\n\n\n                             PAUL SARBANES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for many of us on this side of the aisle, \nthere is a feeling of excitement and possibility for the next Congress. \nBut sadly, that Congress will no longer have the wise counsel, \nextraordinary talent, and perceptive insights of our friend and \ncolleague of many years, the outstanding senior Senator from Maryland, \nPaul Sarbanes.\n  Over the course of his 30 years in the Senate, Paul has been a \nconsistently eloquent voice of reason, compassion, and great \nintellectual depth. He has brought nothing but dignity to this historic \nChamber, and he eminently deserves his place of honor as the longest-\nserving Senator in the history of the State of Maryland.\n  As a member of the Banking Committee, he has been a respected leader \nin expanding and enhancing the economic vitality of America, especially \nurban America, through his strong support for housing, transportation, \nand financial policies that make sense for the Nation and its people. \nIn recent years, he guided into law one of the most significant reforms \nof corporate governance in more than half a century.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, he has been a highly \nrespected voice on many of the most serious challenges we face on \nforeign policy. He was an opponent of the war in Iraq from the \nbeginning, and he was a leader in the Iran-contra investigation in the \n1980s.\n  He believes deeply in the importance of public service. Drawing on \nhis wide learning, he often speaks about the great importance that the \nancient Greeks placed on public service. I understand he tells young \nstudents that in ancient Athens, people who involved themselves only in \nprivate life were called ``idiotes,'' which is the original source of \nthe word ``idiot'' in English.\n  Paul has always been a strong defender of the highest ideals of the \nUnited States at home and for a peaceful world that respects human \nrights.\n  Because of his leadership and the policies he has long championed, \nAmerica's cities are reclaiming their historical role as the heart of \nAmerican commerce and culture, and today's shareholders have new \nconfidence in the integrity of the stocks and bonds they invest in and \ndepend so heavily on.\n  It is a record of accomplishment that has improved the lives of \nmillions of our people and has helped to restore faith in American \nbusiness, at a time when public confidence in corporate America was \nbadly shaken and storm clouds were gathering over the American economy.\n  It is also the record of a patient, deliberative, and active Senate \nworkhorse, who has dedicated his career to the mastery of complicated, \nnuanced, and often seemingly insoluble problems at home and in the \nwider world. It's the record as well of a public servant who responded \nto the Nation's call to deal with some of the most difficult challenges \nof corruption and incompetence in our lifetime.\n  From the impeachment proceedings against President Nixon, to the \nIran-contra investigation and the Whitewater hearings, to the way he \nshone a bright light on the outrageous and predatory lending practices \nthat exploit lower-income Americans and keep so many hard-working \ncitizens mired in poverty, Paul Sarbanes was a Senator who could always \nbe relied on to take the assignment seriously, prepare brilliantly, and \nmake decisions on the facts, on the rule of law, and his firm belief in \nthe need for justice and fairness in public life.\n  Needless to say, he was a match for even the best of witnesses. I \ndoubt that any other Senator could go head-to-head with a witness in a \nhearing as skillfully as Paul Sarbanes could do with Alan Greenspan.\n  Paul has also been a profile in courage. He voted for what he thought \nwas right, without regard to the political consequences. And as his \nlong and strong support by the people of Maryland made clear, they \nrespected him all the more because of it.\n  Few Senators we have been blessed to serve with can match Paul \nSarbanes when it comes to decency, intelligence, or mastery of policy. \nIt is a privilege to listen to him and learn from him in Senate debate. \nHe can champion a proposal he favors with great skill and eloquence, \nand he can also utterly dissect a flawed proposal point by point. It \ncan be a very distressing experience to oppose him on an issue and have \nhim do the same thing to your side of the argument.\n  I am fortunate to have supported Paul many more times than I opposed \nhim. But regardless of which side you were on, his motivation in debate \nwas always clear--to achieve the best outcome for the public good, and \nto do so by opening his opponents' eyes and minds, not by harshly \nattacking their positions.\n  Author Elizabeth Drew well captured this quality of Paul in her \nassessment of life in Washington during Watergate. She wrote of the \nyoung Baltimore Congressman who, with just 3 years in Congress, found \nhimself in the thick of the House impeachment proceedings against \nPresident Nixon. He won the attention and respect of the Nation when \nhis colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee chose him to be the \nmanager of the first article of impeachment, for obstruction of \njustice. As Liz Drew wrote:\n\n       History and process lift people, and they have lifted this \n     group--and given the public a chance to see it. Paul Sarbanes \n     would not have looked at all bad at the Constitutional \n     Convention; he might have been one of the great ones.\n\n\n[[Page S11258]]\n\n\n  I certainly agree. As we say farewell to this outstanding Senator of \nour time, we will forever be grateful to this Greek immigrant son of \nMaryland for all he has done to make our country and our world a better \nplace, and for consistently elevating the quality of life in the Senate \nwe all love so deeply.\n  Fifty years ago, Paul was a young student at Oxford University in \nEngland on a Rhodes Scholarship, founded over a century ago by the \nwealthy British statesman whose goal was to encourage students in the \nEnglish-speaking world and other countries to be involved in public \nservice and ``join the world's fight.''\n  Paul Sarbanes has helped to lead that fight for half a century, and I \nam sure that Cecil Rhodes would be very proud of him.\n  We will miss you, Paul. We wish you and Christine great happiness in \nthe years to come. You are irreplaceable, but we take some comfort in \nthe knowledge that a new young Sarbanes, blessed with the same \nintellect and commitment to public service, will be joining us in \nJanuary as a Member of the House of Representatives.\n\n\n                             Paul Sarbanes\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation for all \nof the public service efforts of the senior Senator from Maryland, Paul \nSarbanes. My friend has served in the Senate since 1977, which makes \nhim the longest serving United States Senator from Maryland.\n  It has been a pleasure working with Senator Sarbanes over the years \non a number of issues. In 2001, I was fortunate to be added to the \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. At that time, the \nSenator from Maryland was serving as the chairman of the committee and \nit was a memorable session to be a part of the committee. In the wake \nof the accounting failures of Enron and other public companies, \nChairman Sarbanes conducted a very thorough series of hearings which \nled to the legislation which is now known as Sarbanes-Oxley. This is \nlandmark legislation that has increased corporate responsibility and \nresulted in more effective oversight of public companies. Without the \nvision, courage, and ability of my friend from Maryland, that \nlegislation would not have been possible. Despite numerous obstacles, \nhe brought about comprehensive accounting reform.\n  In addition, I have enjoyed working closely with the Senator from \nMaryland in trying to improve the financial literacy of our country. \nRising health care costs and insurance premiums and the lack of \naffordable housing have contributed to making the lives of working \nfamilies more difficult as they strain to meet their day-to-day needs. \nThe ability of families to meet their increasing financial obligations \nis hampered by their significant debt burdens, particularly credit card \ndebt, and by predatory lending practices such as refund anticipation \nloans. A lack of financial literacy makes it harder for families to \ndeal with the difficult decisions they are confronted with daily. \nSenator Sarbanes organized the first set of hearings on the issue of \nfinancial literacy and led the creation of the Financial Literacy and \nEducation Commission, the purpose of which is to promote financial \nliteracy and education among all American consumers.\n  Senator Sarbanes has been a champion for Federal employees. \nThroughout his Senate career, he has fought to ensure that Federal \nemployees and members of the military receive equal pay increases. He \nunderstands that the Federal civilian workforce plays a significant \nrole in the support of our Armed Services, and I am honored to join him \nannually in offering a resolution calling for pay parity between the \nmilitary and Federal workers.\n  He has been a leading advocate for consumer protection, increasing \naccess to affordable housing, and improving public transportation in \nour country. I will miss having my good friend from Maryland in the \nSenate. He has served Maryland and the country very well. Millie and I \nwish him and his family the very best.\n\n\n                             Paul Sarbanes\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to bid a fond farewell to my \ndear colleague and role model, Senator Paul Sarbanes, Maryland's \nlongest serving Senator.\n  Senator Sarbanes represents the greatest traditions of this body and \nof our country. He is the type of Senator we all imagined in high \nschool civics class--intelligent, diligent, effective, and thoroughly \ndecent. During the course of 30 years in the U.S. Senate and another 10 \nyears in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Maryland House of \nDelegates, Senator Sarbanes defined what it means to be a trusted \npublic servant in America.\n  Paul Sarbanes grew up on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, the son of \nGreek immigrants who instilled the values of opportunity and fairness \nin their child. Motivated and hard working, Paul attended Princeton \nUniversity, studied in Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, and earned a law \ndegree from Harvard.\n  Paul first came to the Nation's attention during the Watergate \nhearings, where as a freshman member of the House Judiciary Committee \nhe introduced the first article of impeachment, which related to \nobstruction of justice by President Nixon. Paul's own ethics and \nintegrity are beyond reproach, and he has brought dignity and \ncredibility to every task.\n  In the Senate, Paul's legacy reflects his ideals of opportunity and \nfairness. He has continually fought for legislation to aid veterans, \nseniors, workers, and indeed, all Americans. He is a tireless champion \nfor his constituents, his country, and the highest ethical standards. \nAs a Princeton alumnus, he has lived Woodrow Wilson's ideal of \n``Princeton in the Nation's Service.'' Each and every day, Paul \ndemonstrates that politics can be an honorable profession. It should be \nan honorable profession, and I can think of no better model for that \nideal than Paul Sarbanes.\n  In Senator Sarbanes' tenure as both chairman and ranking member of \nthe Committee on Banking, he led the fight on behalf of working-class \nAmericans to ensure affordable housing. He was instrumental in \ndeveloping and enacting the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, \nlegislation that helps States, local governments, and nonprofit \norganizations work together to build, buy, and rehabilitate housing \nthat hard-working people can afford. Paul has also worked to protect \nAmericans from unscrupulous lending practices and discrimination. His \nhearings and legislation on predatory lending brought this problem to \nthe attention of the Nation, and his work to reduce the cost of private \nmortgage insurance helped make home ownership a reality for millions of \nAmericans.\n  After Enron collapsed under the weight of widespread abuse and \naccounting fraud, thousands of workers woke up to see their jobs and \nlife savings gone, investors lost billions, and the public cried out \nagainst corporate malfeasance. The credibility of American business and \nour financial system was on the line. It was Senator Sarbanes who \nbrought his intelligence and concern to bear to restore investor \nconfidence and implement safeguards against Wall Street abuses. He held \ncomprehensive hearings, nurtured a bipartisan coalition, crafted \nthoughtful legislation and shepherded it through Congress with \nRepresentative Mike Oxley in the House.\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley law was the most comprehensive overhaul of \ncorporate oversight laws since the Great Depression. It created a \nstandard of transparency and accountability to assure investors and \nprotect workers. It is a towering achievement that will strengthen the \nAmerican economy for many years to come.\n  It has been an honor and a privilege to serve with Senator Sarbanes \non the Foreign Relations Committee. I have marveled at his keen \nintellect and commitment to his responsibilities. During committee \nhearings and committee markups, Senator Sarbanes is always well-\nprepared, asks direct, insightful, and important questions, and makes \nsure that no stone goes unturned.\n  He has played a key role in virtually all of the significant foreign \npolicy debates that have occurred during his 30 years of service on the \ncommittee. As a freshman, he was involved in the successful \nratification of the Panama Canal Treaties. He worked to enact tough \nantiapartheid laws in the 1980s. And he has developed a long and \nimpressive record on international economics, foreign assistance, and \nhuman rights issues.\n  The American people have been well served by Paul's leadership, and \nthis\n\n[[Page S11259]]\n\ninstitution would be well served if each of us was a little more like \nhim. On behalf of all of us, and for my constituents, I want to thank \nhim for his service and his example.\n  Let's wish Senator Sarbanes and his wife Christine well in this next \nphase of their lives. But let's also hope that we will continue to hear \nPaul's voice on important policy issues. He may be retiring from this \nbody, but I suspect his commitment to strengthening this country and \nimproving the lives of all Americans will continue. For that, as much \nas for all that Paul has accomplished through his distinguished career \nin the Senate, we should be grateful. I know that I am.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11259-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11259-S11267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NOMINATION OF ROBERT M. GATES, TO BE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 11:30 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to the executive session to \nconsider the nomination of Robert M. Gates, of Texas, to be Secretary \nof Defense.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Robert M. Gates, of \nTexas, to be Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am going to initiate our discussion this \nmorning on this important nomination. My distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Levin, will soon join me.\n  I urge all Senators to seek an opportunity, if they so desire, to \naddress this very important nomination not just to the executive branch \nbut, indeed, the Nation and, indeed, the world. All eyes are on this \nnominating process and this extraordinary candidate who stepped forward \nto offer his services and the wisdom of our President in finding, \nselecting, and convincing this outstanding American to, once again, \nserve the Nation--and, indeed, I think the whole world--in this \nimportant post.\n  I want to acknowledge the fact that yesterday, with the strong \nsupport of the distinguished ranking member, Senator Levin, the Armed \nServices Committee, in I believe a very commendable way and a very \nthorough way, held extensive hearings on Dr. Gates, with probably close \nto 60 hours in public and another close to 2 hours or less maybe in \nexecutive session. We thoroughly examined and cross-examined this \nnominee. He exhibited those extraordinary qualities that he has had \nthroughout his public life--candor, patience, clear and concise \nanswers, no equivocation, no effort to dodge any response which he felt \nwould contribute to the Record. I commend this distinguished nominee.\n  Then I have to say, with a great sense of pride, on behalf of the \ncommittee--not myself or Senator Levin but on behalf of the committee--\nthe vote was unanimous, even though, in the course of that deliberation \nthere were varying opinions of the members of our committee which I \nrespect--those varying opinions on what has happened and what is \nhappening today in Iraq and in Afghanistan and other troubled parts of \nthe world and what our course of action should be for the future.\n  The committee came together and, I am proud to say, unanimously \nadopted the recommendations of the chair to have this nomination go \nforward to the Senate.\n  It is interesting. One of the strongest proponents in the course of \nthat deliberation was our distinguished and revered colleague, Senator \nByrd. He has been a member of the committee for many years. I asked \nSenator Byrd if he would like to place before the committee the \nnomination of Robert Gates. He did so. I seconded it and then followed \nall members of the committee voting ``aye.''\n  Senator Levin and his staff and all members of the committee--and, \nindeed, my staff--were very helpful in the preparation of the very \nimportant steps that must be taken for this nomination. We didn't cut \nany corners. We didn't rush. We did what I say was a very competent \njob, consistent with the finest traditions of the advice-and-consent \nrole which is especially entrusted to the Senate.\n  In the brief period since the President announced his intent to \nnominate Dr. Gates on November 8, and recognizing the importance of \nthis nomination to our national security, we have worked together to \ncompile a thorough record on which the committee and the full Senate \ncan rely with confidence.\n  Doctor Gates has a long and distinguished record of accomplishments \nand service to his community and to the Nation. He completed his \nundergraduate studies at the College of William & Mary in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, receiving the prestigious Algernon Sydney \nSullivan Award, which is awarded to graduating seniors who have \ndistinguished themselves in service to others and to the community.\n  He then went on to receive a master's degree in history from Indiana \nUniversity in 1966, and later, a Ph.D. in Russian and Soviet history \nfrom Georgetown University in 1974. I would like to note that in recent \nyears Dr. Gates, among various distinguished academic posts, served as \na trustee of the endowment fund for the College of William and Mary, \nwhich in 1998 conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of \nHumane Letters.\n  Doctor Gates joined the CIA in 1966, but he served on active duty in \nthe Air Force from 1967 through 1969 assigned to the Strategic Air \nCommand. He rejoined the CIA upon his release from active duty and \nspent over 26 years as an intelligence professional, including a period \nof nearly 9 years assigned to the National Security Council.\n  Doctor Gates served as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence from \n1986 until 1989, and, subsequently, as Assistant to the President and \nDeputy National Security Adviser from January 20, 1989 until November \n6, 1991, for President George H. W. Bush. Dr. Gates was nominated by \nPresident George H. W. Bush, to be the 15th Director of the CIA in June \n1991. Dr. Gates is the only person who has ever risen from the ranks to \nbecome the Director of Central Intelligence.\n  Doctor Gates has been awarded the National Security Medal, the \nPresidential Citizens Medal, the National Intelligence Distinguished \nService Medal on two occasions, and three times received the CIA's \nhighest award, the Distinguished Intelligence Medal.\n  In September and October 1991, the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence under the leadership of Senator David Boren conducted \nhearings on Dr. Gates's nomination to be the Director of Central \nIntelligence. The Committee on Intelligence took the testimony of some \n21 witnesses, compiled a record of over 2,500 pages of testimony, and \nfavorably reported Dr. Gate's nomination to the full Senate.\n  During the Senate floor debate on Dr. Gates' nomination, on November \n4, 1991, I complimented Senator Boren on the thoroughness of his \ncommittee's work.\n  I stated, at that time, I had the privilege--and Dr. Gates was very \nthoughtful yesterday to indicate that--to introduce him to the \nIntelligence Committee for that hearing. In the context of that \nintroduction and then on the floor of the Senate, this paragraph \nsummarizes my own personal views of this extraordinary nominee.\n  I said:\n\n       Bob Gates is a very thoughtful man, an honest man, an \n     experienced official, a good analyst, a non-nonsense manager, \n     and a man with a vision of the future direction of the role \n     of U.S. intelligence.\n\n  I reiterate those comments in the context of this nomination again \ntoday.\n       On November 5, 1991, Dr. Gates was confirmed by the Senate \n     and served with distinction throughout the remainder of \n     former President Bush's term.\n       Yesterday, at our hearing on this nomination, Senator Boren \n     and our former leader, Senator Robert Dole, testified in \n     support of Dr. Gates's nomination and urged a new spirit of \n     bipartisanship as we wrestle with the problems of national \n     security we, as a Nation, face today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Boren's statement and such \nstatement as we hopefully will get from Senator Dole be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n\n[[Page S11260]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will quote Senator Boren's remarks of \nyesterday. Senator Boren stated:\n\n       During the 6 years that I chaired the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee, I watched Dr. Gates effectively work to build a \n     consensus on sensitive issues.\n\n  Democrats and Republicans had equal seats at the table. During these \n6 years, in no small part because of his bipartisanship spirit and his \nrespect for the oversight and policymaking role of Congress, our \ncommittee had only a tiny handful of rollcall votes and none of them \nwas close. We simply worked with each other and with the executive \nbranch, often represented by Dr. Gates, until a consensus was reached.\n  I believe I am the only current Member of the Senate who was a member \nof that committee at that time. All have retired from this institution. \nI remember those days quite well. It was a warming experience to see \nyesterday. I know full well he won the hearts and minds of all. He is \nnoted for his ability to cross the aisle and work out consensus \nopinions, reach decisions which are always, in his judgment and the \njudgment of others, in the best interests of our country. This \ndemonstrates Dr. Gates' qualification for the position of Secretary of \nDefense. It gives us a clear indication of how he will lead.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed a letter in support of the \nnomination received from a former chairman of the Committee on Armed \nServices, with whom I was ranking member for many years, the Honorable \nSam Nunn of Georgia.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Nuclear Threat Initiative,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 4, 2006.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman,\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear John and Carl: I wish that I could attend Tuesday's \n     hearing to help my friend David Boren introduce Robert Gates, \n     whom I believe is immensely qualified to serve as Secretary \n     of Defense.\n       Unfortunately, my travel schedu1e prevents me from being \n     with you in person, but I have asked David to submit the \n     attached statement into the Record on my behalf.\n           Best wishes,\n                                                         Sam Nunn.\n       Enclosure.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Statement of Former Senator Sam Nunn on the Nomination of Robert M. \n Gates, United States Senate Armed Services Committee, December 5, 2006\n\n       Chairman Warner, Senator Levin, and Members of the \n     Committee, although I am able to join you today, I appreciate \n     the opportunity to share with you my thoughts on the \n     nomination of Robert Gates to be our next Secretary of \n     Defense.\n       As you know, during my 24 years in the United States \n     Senate, I spent a great deal of time focusing on issues \n     pertaining to the national defense. I had the great pleasure \n     and honor of serving with many of you, including my good \n     friends John Warner and Carl Levin. as we focused on \n     remaining steadfast and prevailing during the Cold War and on \n     helping the Department of Defense meet the challenges \n     involved in transitioning from the Cold War to a new, and \n     vastly different, world. I had the opportunity to work \n     closely with a number of Defense Secretaries and Directors of \n     the CIA.\n       Even in the best of times, defending our nation while \n     managing a bureaucracy as big as the Pentagon, and at the \n     same time bearing primary responsibility for the lives and \n     welfare of our men and women in uniform, is a monumental \n     task. These are clearly not the best of times. There is no \n     question that our nation faces serious challenges on a number \n     of fronts. Among those challenges is the task of rebuilding \n     our forces, who have met and continue to meet extraordinary \n     demands in Iraq and Afghanistan. The situations in those \n     countries, as well as other global demands on our military, \n     including the new generation of global threats, compound, by \n     several orders of magnitude, the difficulties that will face \n     our next Secretary of Defense. In particular, the Secretary \n     of Defense has a critical role to play in addressing the \n     global threats from nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.\n       The next Secretary of Defense has been dealt a tough hand \n     of cards. We must have a Secretary who is open to change, who \n     values and gains a realistic and objective assessment of the \n     facts, and who has the experience, judgment, and wisdom to \n     lead the Pentagon during the perilous and challenging times \n     ahead.\n       I have known Bob Gates for at least 20 years, and I believe \n     that we are fortunate that he is willing to serve as our next \n     Secretary of Defense. Bob Gates is, in my view, an excellent \n     choice to lead the Department of Defense in these challenging \n     times. He has a well-deserved reputation on both sides of the \n     aisle for competency, integrity and objectivity. He is well \n     qualified, having been directly engaged on national security \n     issues for most of his long career.\n       His years in government have given him an appreciation of \n     the complexity of the issues that he will face as Secretary. \n     He also understands how government works best, and knows \n     that, to succeed as Secretary of Defense, he will need to \n     work cooperatively with others who impact the national \n     security agenda, including our military leaders, both \n     Democrats and Republicans in Congress, and particularly this \n     Armed Services Committee, the National Security Council, the \n     State Department, the Director of National Intelligence and \n     the intelligence community, and also the non-governmental \n     community.\n       I believe that Bob Gates understands that our national \n     security and military policy cannot remain frozen in time as \n     the world changes around us. He understands that, as the \n     facts change, our policies must be flexible enough to \n     acknowledge those facts and to adapt to those changes. I \n     believe that, if confirmed as Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates \n     will be willing to make the kinds of changes and new \n     approaches that many of us are convinced are needed in the \n     days ahead.\n       Finally, and perhaps most important at this time in our \n     history, Bob Gates understands that the secret to successful \n     leadership lies in the willingness to accept counsel and \n     advice from many people, both inside and outside of \n     government. When facts and circumstances change or when \n     mistakes are made, we must have a Secretary of Defense who \n     listens, who understands, who corrects errors rapidly, and \n     who adapts to reality. I am confident that Bob Gates will \n     listen, will understand, will adapt, and will make sound \n     recommendations and decisions for our nation's security.\n       For all these reasons, I am convinced that Bob Gates is an \n     excellent choice to serve as our next Secretary of Defense. \n     Thank you.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Since leaving the CIA in 1993, Dr. Gates served in a \nvariety of academic capacities and as the interim dean of the George \nBush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A University \nfrom 1999 to 2001. On August 1, 2002, he became the 22nd president of \nTexas A, the Nation's seventh largest university.\n  He referred to his work with that university with a great deal of \ncompassion and sentiment yesterday. He said in a very respectful way \nthat it is going to be difficult to leave that university, but he felt \nthe call of the Nation, the call of the President, had to take \npriority.\n  At the hearing yesterday, Dr. Gates was questioned about his past \nservice, about his reasons for returning to Government, and about his \nviews on Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and the tremendous challenges that \nface the United States today. He acquitted himself remarkably well.\n  Senator Levin and I have been here together for 28 years. My good \nfriend, who will soon follow me, would agree it was one of the more \nextraordinary nomination hearings we have had in the many years we have \nserved on the Committee on Armed Services, and he was given to \nunanimous support of each and every member attending that hearing \nyesterday. I think we had 100-percent attendance except a member \nattending a funeral.\n  I commend the President on his decision to nominate Dr. Gates. I am \nconfident he will, indeed, be absolutely fearless in providing expert \nadvice, professional advice, his own innermost personal feelings about \nthe complex issues that face our Nation and, indeed, the world.\n  For his fellow Cabinet members and to the Congress, he will be an \nextraordinary new addition, subject to the confirmation of this Senate, \nto our illustrious role of public servants.\n  I have served under three Secretaries of Defense when I was \nprivileged to be Secretary of the Navy. Together with Carl Levin, we \nhave worked with nine other Secretaries of Defense since that period of \ntime we have been in the Senate.\n  I conclude on another note which I think is very meaningful. Senator \nLevin and I met with the Iraq Survey Group this morning. I mention that \nbecause this volume represents their report. Five very able \nRepublicans, five very able Democrats, drawn from the private sector, \nnow all in the private sector, most all of whom have distinguished \npublic service careers of varying types--it is all a matter of public \nrecord--worked on this report as a contribution to the security of this \ncountry.\n  I had a small role with Frank Wolf and others in helping get the Iraq \nSurvey Group constituted and launched.\n\n[[Page S11261]]\n\nThey did a very fine job for America, indeed, the free world, in \nreaching a consensus, in reaching a unanimous opinion on a series of \nissues.\n  The debate on Iraq, the debate on Afghanistan, the debate on our \nsecurity matters should always reign in this Chamber with voices which \nhave different views. How well we know the difficulty, particularly in \nthis most controversial war, the difficulty of reaching a consensus.\n  I am proud to say our committee--which has among its members a strong \ndiversity of viewpoints about the conflicts for which our men and women \nof the Armed Forces are courageously carrying the torch for freedom--\nreached a consensus, unanimously supporting Bob Gates.\n  I mention those two important chapters--temporary chapters--in the \nhistory of this institution because I fervently believe we must try and \nwork in the Congress with the President to reach a consensus on the way \nahead in Iraq. All have to give up a little bit of some of our fixed \nviews which we have tenaciously held for these years of this conflict, \na conflict now that has gone on longer than World War II. In the spirit \nof trying to reach that consensus, we owe that obligation to the men \nand women in the Armed Forces who have given so much, who have lost \nlife and limb, who today are on the front lines--whether in Iraq or \nAfghanistan.\n  That is why, throughout this nomination process, I have stressed the \nneed to try to reach a consensus. The nominee himself likewise \nmentioned he hopes to work with a mandate from the Congress and the \nPresident which is derived in a bipartisan way, a consensus opinion.\n  As I look upon the current situation, we have now the Iraq Study \nGroup Report. The President, very wisely, some 2 months ago, directed \nevery person in his administration who has some responsibility in their \nportfolios with regard to national security, and most specifically the \nimplementation of our Armed Forces overseas and our foreign policy, to \nsit down and search their minds to come up with ideas and concepts as \nto how this Nation must move forward in the weeks and the months to \ncome in Iraq--move forward in such a way that we can achieve a stable \ngovernment, a government in Iraq that can provide the security for its \nNation, a quality of life for its people, and a nation that, hopefully, \nwill join other nations in the free world as a strong working ally in \nthe war against terrorism.\n  This is the first chapter. The next chapter will be the report, \npresumably within the executive branch.\n  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs--I spoke with him by phone this \nmorning--is working among his peer group and particularly those \ncombatant officers and men who have served in Iraq, served in \nAfghanistan, to draw together their views. His work will not \nnecessarily be completed in a finite report. To the contrary, his work \nmust go on every day, every week, to make assessments from the \nbattlefields, make assessments internally from the men and women in \nuniform, and perhaps some of the counterparts and the civilians who \nworked so closely with our men and women in the Department of Defense \nthroughout the world.\n  He will be making a contribution to the President as our President \nworks through deliberations that, no doubt, were comparable to \ndecisions Lincoln had to make in that critical period he served as \nPresident.\n  I remember being with our President in his office quietly one day. I \nbelieve it was Memorial Day a year ago. When he pointed to Lincoln, he \nsaid he often reflects on the pressures that were upon that great \nPresident and how he guided this Nation such that we are the United \nStates, all 50 States of America today are one solid, surviving, strong \nRepublic. Also, as Ben Franklin said when he emerged from the \nConstitutional Convention and was asked, what did they do at the \nConstitutional Convention of 1789? He wiped his brow and said, we have \ngiven you a republic, if you can keep it.\n  Part of keeping that Republic is keeping faith in the men and women \nof our Armed Forces as we ask them to take on these burdens. Therefore, \nit is my hope that after our distinguished President studies carefully \nthe contributions of the Iraq group, of his own internal assessment, \nindeed, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that he will come to \nhis own conclusions. But before he makes them public, I hope he \nconsults in a bipartisan way with the leadership of this institution in \na private forum and then thereafter at the time of his own selection in \nan announcement to the public.\n  In that way I hope we can have a consensus, we can show our \nbipartisanship in strength. We keep our commitment to the men and women \nof the Armed Forces that this Government, this executive branch, can \nwork as a team on their behalf as we ask them to take the enormous \nrisks of carrying the torch of freedom wherever they are in the world.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Statement of David L. Boren, President, the University of Oklahoma, \n Former U.S. Senator (Oklahoma), Before the U.S. Senate Armed Services \n                      Committee, December 5, 2006\n\n       Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, thank you for \n     allowing me the privilege of joining with my colleague \n     Senator Bob Dole to formally present Dr. Robert M. Gates, the \n     President's nominee for Secretary of Defense. I sincerely \n     believe that at this critical moment, Dr. Gates is the best \n     possible choice for this position.\n       In my entire adult lifetime, our country has never been \n     faced with more dangerous challenges. With only 6% of the \n     world's population, we face economic growth in other nations \n     and regions which are likely to bring them into economic \n     parity with the United States in a relatively short time and \n     military parity as well if they decide to use their resources \n     for that purpose. We are militarily spread thin in areas of \n     the world where serious threats exist, and there are no easy \n     options for extracting ourselves from our military \n     involvement in Iraq.\n       At the end of WorId War II and the beginning of the Cold \n     War, we also faced threats that could have overwhelmed us. \n     How we responded then provides us with an excellent guide for \n     the present.\n       First, we brought together people of exceptional talent, \n     like Bob Gates, to serve us without regard to political party \n     affiliation.\n       Second, leaders like President Truman, a Democrat, and \n     Senator Vandenburg, a Republican, adopted a truly bipartisan \n     blueprint that provided us with a consistent policy for over \n     40 years without regard to which party controlled the White \n     House or the Congress.\n       Third, we did not bear all the burdens of leadership by \n     ourselves. We formed strong alliances and partnerships based \n     upon mutual respect. We struck the right balance between \n     diplomacy, dialogue, and military strength. We made sure that \n     we were always strong enough to act alone if we had to do so, \n     but we were wise enough to avoid that situation.\n       We must do exactly the same thing now. Partisan \n     polarization, if allowed to continue, will destroy our \n     economic, military, social and moral influence in the world \n     and ultimately the fabric of our country.\n       During his 26 years of service at the Central Intelligence \n     Agency and at the National Security Council, Bob Gates \n     demonstrated his sincere commitment to bipartisanship. He \n     served as Deputy Director and Director of the C.I.A. under \n     Republican presidents with Democratic majorities in both \n     houses of Congress.\n       During the six years that I chaired the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee, I watched him effectively work to build a \n     consensus on sensitive issues. Democrats and Republicans had \n     equal seats at the table. During these six years, in no small \n     part because of his bipartisan spirit and his respect for the \n     oversight and policy making role of Congress, our committee \n     had only a tiny handful of roll call votes and none of them \n     was close. We simply worked with each other and with the \n     Executive Branch often represented by Dr. Gates until a \n     consensus was reached.\n       I came to respect Bob Gates as a realist who faced up to \n     the facts and adjusted to changing situations. He rejected \n     inflexible ideological positions and worked hard to fashion \n     practical solutions. We badly need those qualities right now.\n       More recently, as a fellow university president, I have \n     watched with admiration his leadership n bringing faculty \n     members, students and alumni together to increase the \n     strength and diversity of Texas A where he serves as \n     president.\n       Bob Gates knows how to lead large and complex \n     organizations. He will hit the ground running as Secretary of \n     Defense at a moment when we have no time to waste.\n       I am here today not only because I believe that Bob Gates \n     has exceptional ability, but also because I have confidence \n     in his personal integrity and his sincere desire to serve our \n     country.\n       It was my responsibility to chair the hearings which \n     resulted in his confirmation to serve as Director of the \n     Central Intelligence Agency. His nomination came to our \n     committee on June 24, 1991. Our scrutiny of this nominee was \n     not completed until October 18th of that year. All questions \n     which were raised, even those of doubtful credibility were \n     vigorously pursued.\n       Part of the final committee report read as follows: ``By \n     any standard, the consideration of this nomination was the \n     most thorough and comprehensive of any nomination ever\n\n[[Page S11262]]\n\n     received by the committee. Thousands of documents were \n     reviewed. Hundreds of witnesses were interviewed. The nominee \n     testified for four long days in open and closed sessions \n     responding to almost 900 questions and written responses were \n     submitted to almost 100 additional questions.''\n       In short, these thorough proceedings confirmed the \n     commitment of Bob Gates to faithful and honorable public \n     service.\n       Today we have an opportunity to embark upon a new \n     bipartisan path to protect our national security. The Senate \n     can do its part by quickly and overwhelmingly confirming this \n     talented nominee as Secretary of Defense. But confirmation \n     alone is not sufficient. The President must also do his part \n     by making sure that he gives great weight to the bipartisan \n     spirit and realistic advice which I believe that he will \n     receive from Dr. Robert Gates.\n       There are those who say it is an impractical and romantic \n     idea that we can replace polarization with civility, \n     cooperation and partnership. To the doubters, I answer that \n     we achieved it in the Senate Intelligence Committee with the \n     help of Bob Gates only 15 years ago. It is not only an option \n     we can achieve with hard work and determination--it is \n     imperative if the United States is to remain a world leader.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Statement of Hon. Robert Dole, Former U.S. Senator From Kansas\n\n       Senator Robert Dole. It is on?\n       Chairman Warner. Yes.\n       Senator Robert Dole: Well, Mr. Chairman, I'm almost--I'm \n     probably here by accident, because the phone rang at home, \n     and I picked it up, and the person on the other end said, \n     ``Senator Dole, would you mind introducing me at the hearing? \n     and I said, ``Yes.'', Then I learned, later, they were \n     calling for Elizabeth. So----\n       So --\n       [Laughter. ]\n       Senator Robert Dole:--I appreciate the fact that she's on \n     the committee, but I appreciate this opportunity, and it'll \n     be very brief.\n       President John Adams once said, ``If we do not layout \n     ourselves in the service of mankind, whom should we serve?'' \n     Bob Gates truly understands this. Granted, I may be a little \n     biased, owing to his Kansas roots. It was Kansas where he \n     first learned the meaning of service, while growing up in \n     Wichita. His appreciation for the interests of others grew as \n     a student at William and Mary and throughout his years as a \n     career intelligence official and through his subsequent \n     leadership of our intelligence services, and, most recently, \n     in his stewardship at Texas A, one of our Nation's \n     outstanding universities. Through it all, Bob Gates has given \n     of himself in this great tradition to our Nation and our \n     people.\n       Mr. Chairman, as we convene, our Nation's defense policy is \n     dominated by a single issue: the war in Iraq. Even those \n     critics of the war who want us to withdraw soon or cut our \n     forces substantially acknowledge that the stakes are high. I \n     believe we can agree with our President, who has said, ``This \n     is a massive and difficult undertaking. It is worth our \n     effort, it is worth our sacrifice, because we know the \n     stakes. The failure of Iraq democracy would embolden \n     terrorists around the world, increase dangers to the American \n     people, and extinguish the hopes of millions in the region.''\n       At this critical hour, Mr. Chairman, you and your committee \n     have gathered for an exceedingly rare act, the confirmation \n     of a new Secretary of Defense in wartime. The last time this \n     happened was in 1968, when President Johnson nominated Clark \n     Clifford to replace Bob McNamara. Make no mistake about it, \n     history is being made here today.\n       Today, Bob Gates is poised to take the helm at the Defense \n     Department at a time of intense debate over the war. Some \n     contend that, with sufficient time and dedication, victory is \n     assured. Yet, there is no denying that, having overthrown \n     Saddam Hussein, we have not secured the peace, that Iraq's \n     borders remain porous, that the interests and destabilizing \n     involvement and Iran and Syria have not been adequately \n     addressed, and that the current power vacuum creates risk of \n     an even larger scale sectarian conflict. At the same time, \n     those who have been calling for withdrawal or massive date-\n     certain drawdowns should acknowledge that these are tactical \n     shifts, not a radical overhaul of our policies, that the \n     removal of Saddam from power opened the door to democracy, \n     and that to realize these are goals worthy of sacrifice and \n     that defeat is not an option, but the quality of life in many \n     parts of the country is better than it was 4 years ago.\n       In the American experience, wars that enjoy equivocal \n     support from our people usually end with equivocal outcomes. \n     This is why our country must unite behind a strategy for a \n     successful military mission, a viable exit plan, and a \n     recognizable vision for Iraq's future. I agree with the \n     President that Bob Gates is the man to make this happen. He \n     is a person of uncommon resolve, intellect, and strength of \n     character. He has the force of will to exercise civilian \n     control over the military, but be sensitive to respect the \n     wisdom and counsel of our generals and admirals, and the men \n     under them...\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Robert Gates to \nbe Secretary of Defense, as did every member of the Committee on Armed \nServices, under the leadership of Senator Warner.\n  Over the last few weeks, I have met personally with Dr. Gates, \nreviewed his record, his response to written policy questions from the \nCommittee on Armed Services. I listened carefully to his testimony \nbefore the committee yesterday. At every stage of the process I have \nbeen favorably impressed by Dr. Gates' candor, his forthrightness, and \nby the direct answers he has provided to our questions.\n  The American people in November demonstrated their strong desire for \ntwo important changes in our Government. One is a change in policy on \nIraq. The second is a change in the atmosphere in Washington. On each \nof these issues, Dr. Gates' performance has been exemplary.\n  He has also provided a dose of reality and straightforward honesty \nrelative to Iraq. Dr. Gates' willingness to identify past mistakes was \nnotable. He included in a list of those mistakes, when he was asked, \ninadequate troop levels at the outset of the operation, disbanding of \nthe Iraqi Army, de-Baathification measures that went too far. He \nacknowledged we are not winning overall in Iraq, with the important \ncaveat that our troops continue to perform superbly and have yet to \nlose a single battle.\n  He agreed we need to communicate a sense of urgency to the Iraqis and \nto pressure them to reach a political settlement that only they can \nreach, and that without it there will be no end to the violence, \nregardless of improvements in the Iraqi military.\n  Dr. Gates stated that a major change in policy is needed and that all \nobligations need to be on the table.\n  He made it clear that he intends to consult with the commanders in \nthe field, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and others before recommending a \nstrategy. He stated he would consult with Members of Congress on a \nbipartisan basis. He agreed that we need to more clearly identify our \nobjectives and match our forces to those objectives. He spoke favorably \nabout the need for specific benchmarks for those efforts and the \nefforts of the Iraqis.\n  On the second issue, Dr. Gates placed a strong emphasis on the need \nfor bipartisan solutions to our problems in Iraq and other national \nsecurity issues. He spoke in favor of congressional oversight. He \nexpressed his desire to work with Members of Congress in both political \nparties.\n  Moreover, Dr. Gates stated that our senior military leaders must be \nfree to speak truth to power, to express their views directly to the \nPresident, the Secretary of Defense, and the Congress.\n  He also stated that intelligence should not be politicized and that \nintelligence analysts must be free to provide their unvarnished views \nto leaders of both the Congress and the executive branch. He stated to \nthe extent the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy \nprior to the Iraq war provided a separate avenue for the analysis of \nintelligence information outside of the intelligence community that he \nhas ``a problem with that.''\n  We will make significant progress in Iraq only if a new approach is \nforthcoming. We are not going to make significant progress if we insist \non circling the wagons, denying any mistakes have been made, and \nstaying the course. We are not going to make significant progress until \nthe administration comes to grips with what is happening on the ground \nin Iraq and listens to the views of the Congress, the American people, \nand others who have had differences with the administration.\n  Dr. Gates' confirmation as Secretary of Defense will not by itself \nsolve our problems in Iraq. Indeed, as he acknowledged, the key \ndecisions on Iraq will continue to be made by the President of the \nUnited States, not by the Secretary of Defense.\n  On the key issues of Iraq, and the atmosphere in Washington, however, \nhis testimony was very encouraging indeed. Dr. Gates' testimony on \nother issues was positive as well. For example, he stated his belief \nthat we should engage with North Korea, Iran, and Syria, and that he is \nopen to the possibility of doing so on a bilateral basis, even though, \nunderstandably, he does not have any great expectations that\n\n[[Page S11263]]\n\nsuch discussions would lead to significant improvements. This kind of \nwillingness to engage in at least discussions with those who disagree \nwith us has too often been hard to find in the administration.\n  I support Dr. Gates' nomination. I wish him luck as he undertakes \nthese immense challenges facing the Department of Defense.\n  I want to comment on two other issues, one that Senator Warner made \nreference to, and that is the Baker-Hamilton report. That report \nproposes a welcome change in direction for our policy. It urges the \nadministration and all of us to come together politically on a \nbipartisan basis. It also suggests that the only way we can maximize \nthe chances of success in Iraq is if the Iraqis come together \npolitically and take over the responsibility for their own country.\n  The ideas they propose in this report are totally consistent with \nwhat a number of us have been urging for a long time: that we have to \npressure the Iraqis to take over, that they have to resolve their \npolitical differences, and that unless those political differences are \nresolved by the Iraqis that there is not going to be an end to the \nviolence in Iraq.\n  The discussion in this report about reduction in forces is a tool of \nputting pressure on the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own \nfuture. We cannot be a security blanket in an unlimited way for the \nIraqis. They, and they alone, are going to decide whether they have a \nnation or whether they have a civil war, and we cannot get in the way \nof the Iraqis if they are determined to have a civil war.\n  Finally, I want to say a word about Senator Warner.\n  The fact that this nomination is coming to this floor with a \nunanimous vote is, in part at least, the result of the efforts of \nSenator Warner. Obviously, we all have decided that Dr. Gates deserves \nour confirmation. But, as is always the case with Senator Warner, the \nprocess which was used here was thorough, fair, and consistent with \nsenatorial traditions: that we look at nominees, ask hard questions, be \nthorough.\n  His respect for this institution is not exceeded by anybody, as far \nas I am concerned, in this institution. It is essential to the Senate \nthat we have this kind of respect, not just for each other, as \nimportant as that is--and clearly his civility in that regard is also \nexemplary--but that we also have great respect for the procedures, \nprocesses of this institution.\n  We gave Senator Warner a little tribute yesterday as we were voting \nin executive session, a little plaque that had three gavels on it. \nThose three gavels represented the three times actually that Senator \nWarner has been the chairman of the Armed Services Committee; one of \nwhich was kind of unique just because for 17 days in 2001, when the \nVice President of the United States was Al Gore because the President \nhad not been sworn in until January 20, and the Congress was 50-50 on \nJanuary 3, I actually was chairman for 17 days and Senator Warner was \nranking member for that short period of time before he took over again \nas chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Because of the rules of \nhis caucus, which are totally the business of the Republican caucus, \nSenator Warner will now take on other responsibilities in this \ninstitution. But his civility, his sense of this institution, his \nbipartisanship--which is again reflected in the remarks which he made \ntoday, and reflected in what he has urged the President to do and what \nhe urged Dr. Gates to do in terms of discussions with Members of the \nCongress--that effort on his part is so totally typical of him as a \nhuman being and him as a leader, who senses that when it comes to \nnational security policy and defense policy this country requires \nbipartisanship.\n\n  Maybe in other areas the danger is less of excessive partisanship. \nMaybe in other areas besides national security and defense we can get \naway with being partisan, even though we should not. But in this area \nwe cannot, in good conscience, be partisans. We have to be patriots. We \nare going to have different views. Those different views are not \nnecessarily going to be divided by this aisle, but those different \nviews are respected, they are welcome.\n  Senator Warner again expressed the importance of different voices \nbeing added to a chorus. But at the end that chorus, hopefully, will be \nsinging the same song about the security of this country, with \ndifferent voices from different places but talking about the same goal, \nwhich is the national security of the Nation.\n  Another goal which he has championed is the support for the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces. They never had a greater champion. They have \nhad great champions in this body, on the Armed Services Committee, off \nthe Armed Services Committee. They have had great champions. They \ndeserve great champions. They have had a great champion in John Warner.\n  The men and women of the military who put their lives on the line for \nthis Nation deserve the kind of support they get from John Warner. He \nis an example that all of us follow, I hope, or at least try to follow \nwhen we look at what the needs are of the men and women of the Armed \nForces in uniform, and out of uniform, who take the risks for us and \nwhose families take the tragic losses and have to face those losses \nevery moment of every day in that their loved ones are in harm's way.\n  So I just want to--as we bring, I guess, this last nomination to the \nfloor, which is brought to the floor by Senator Warner as chairman of \nthe committee--pay him tribute on behalf of the whole committee. We \nall, in our own way, speak to him about it, sometimes privately and \npersonally, other times very publicly, like this is. But I just want to \nlet him know that he has not only been one great friend, his wife \nJeannie and Barbara and I have been great friends, and we will continue \nto be.\n  As he frequently points out, we came here together, which is a \nspecial bond between us--which it is for all Members of the Senate. \nMembers of their class are usually the ones they are closest to, just \nlike in high school. That has nothing to do with party labels or \naffiliations. That has everything to do with relationships, going \nthrough the same process together and going through the same hoops and \njumping the same hurdles together.\n  We have done it together. I relied on him more than he will ever \nknow, and I will continue to rely on him as a member of the committee. \nBut as I undertake my new responsibilities, I, again, not only will \ncontinue to cherish his advice and friendship, but I will be relying on \nit almost as much as ever.\n  I thank him, I know, on behalf of all the members of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I am deeply touched by my colleague's \ncomments. We have stood toe to toe on this floor. How many times have \nwe walked right out here and looked each other in the eye, and \nsometimes with a great deal of ferocity disagreed on matters? But I \nsuppose if you ever asked Members of the Senate what their greatest \nreward for service in the Senate would be, certainly high among those \nrewards is the personal association with Members.\n  I have calculated, I say to the Senator, in the time we have been \nhere these 28 years there have been 241 different Senators we have come \nto know and shared the work of this great institution. We have shared \nit with them. But you have been very special, a good friend. We do not \nalways agree, but that is all right. That is one of the foundations of \nthis country. But I do hope perhaps together we can work on forging \nthis consensus which I feel so strongly about, and you feel so strongly \nabout, because this is one of the most unusual chapters of the history \nof America.\n  I say to the Senator, you mentioned my association with the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces. I was privileged to serve as a 17- or 18-\nyear-old sailor in the last year of World War II and later in the \nMarines during the Korean conflict. I mention that only because my \nmilitary active duty is of no great consequence. I just did what \nmillions of others have done--no great valorous contribution, but I did \nmy duty. But I got to know those people and what it is that inspires a \nyoung person to volunteer.\n  Then my work as Secretary of the Navy in the final years of that \nturbulent period in Vietnam, we emerged with the All-Volunteer Force, \nwhich is\n\n[[Page S11264]]\n\nthe most extraordinary military force in the world today. Nothing \ncomparable.\n  If you look back in military history, there used to be not only \nconscripts, but they used to go out and lock them up. It is noted in \nthe Navy, they would go back and hijack innocent civilians and put them \nonboard ships, and the Navy would keep them there for 2 years. They \nnever got off the ships. But today we have this All-Volunteer Force. \nAnd decisions in the military are made around the dinner table--we say, \nthe families--and therefore they are a vital part of it.\n  So I am so proud to work with you and the members of the committee. \nAnd I say to the Senator, you are going to do a fine job as chairman. \nYou had that briefly for a while, and now you have it again. We are \nthere to support you in your capacity as chairman and do everything we \ncan.\n  I hope one of the earliest challenges out of the box, as we say, in \nJanuary 2007--just weeks away, surprisingly--will be that we can work \non a consensus in the supporting of our President and supporting the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces as we chart the future direction for \nIraq and other conflicts.\n  I mentioned the report of the Baker commission, I say to Senator \nLevin. I am just looking through it. We were both in there this \nmorning. But they said the following on the first page:\n\n       Our country deserves a debate that prizes substance over \n     rhetoric, and a policy that is adequately funded and \n     sustainable. The President and Congress must work together. \n     Our leaders must be candid and forthright with the American \n     people in order to win their support.\n\n  The reason I urged the President to come and visit privately with the \nleadership of the Congress before his final decisions was a reflection \nof the mandate of the people in this most recent election. I believe \nthey spoke very loudly. This war was heavily influencing the judgment \nthey made when they went to those polling places.\n  This report stresses the need for that public support. The young men \nand women who go out and take these burdens on want to feel that every \nAmerican citizen is behind them as they perform their duties.\n  Further, this report says, on the next page:\n\n       What we recommend in this report demands a tremendous \n     amount of political will and cooperation by the executive and \n     legislative branches of the U.S. Government.\n       It demands skillful implementation. It demands unity of \n     effort by government agencies, and its success depends on the \n     unity of the American people in a time of political \n     polarization. Americans can and must enjoy the right of \n     robust debate within a democracy. Yet, U.S. foreign policy is \n     doomed to fail--as is any course of action in Iraq--if it is \n     not supported by a broad, sustained consensus. The aim of our \n     report is to move our country toward such a consensus.\n\n  We have had two chapters. We have had this and the vote of the \ncommittee yesterday. I do not wish to predict the vote that will take \nplace, but in my heart of hearts, I think there will be a strong \nconsensus when, hopefully, the vote on Mr. Gates is taken in the \nSenate.\n  I thank my colleague for his strong effort to make all of this \npossible.\n  I believe our colleague from Texas wishes to address the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I have a motion which is in order, \nbut I need to hold off because another person involved is not here. I \nhave given him my word that I would wait. So if Senator Levin has \nsomething to proceed with, I suggest that Senator Levin proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, Senator Kennedy is here. I ask unanimous \nconsent that after Senator Kennedy has completed, Senator Hutchison be \nrecognized again in the event she is prepared to go at that time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I just ask how long does Senator \nKennedy expect to speak?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Probably 6, 7 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, before making these comments on the \nBaker-Hamilton report and on the nominee for Secretary of Defense, I \njoin with my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee in paying \ntribute to an extraordinary friend and incredible Senator and a \nmagnificent leader, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I \nthink all of us who have been on that committee know of its importance \nin terms of its responsibilities for the security of our country. It \nhas been a place of extraordinary leadership historically for this \nNation at very challenging times.\n  Having had the greatest public honor of representing the people of \nMassachusetts and being on that committee now for some 25 years, I join \nmy friends in the unanimous acclamation to a very extraordinary \nindividual, our chairman, John Warner. I thank him so much for his \nservice to our country over a long and very distinguished career. I \ngrew up in a family that believed that individuals can make a \ndifference, and John Warner has made an extraordinary difference to \nthis Committee, to the Senate, and to the country. I consider myself \nfortunate to have served on the committee and to call him my friend.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, from the depth of my heart, I express my \nappreciation to the Senator and others who have reflected those \nsentiments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this morning the Iraq Study Group \nissued a stunning indictment of the administration's policy toward \nIraq.\n  The study group has concluded that the ``situation in Iraq is grave \nand deteriorating'' and that ``sectarian conflict is the principal \nchallenge to stability.''\n  The group's report explicitly rejects the strategy of staying the \ncourse. As it states, ``Current U.S. policy is not working, as the \nlevel of violence in Iraq is rising and the government is not advancing \nnational reconciliation. Making no changes in policy would simply delay \nthe day of reckoning at a high cost. Nearly 100 Americans are dying \nevery month.'' Truer words were never spoken.\n  The study group calls for ``new and enhanced diplomatic and political \nefforts in Iraq and the region, and a change in the primary mission of \nU.S. forces in Iraq that will enable the United States to begin to move \nits combat forces out of Iraq responsibly.''\n  Significantly, this group of distinguished leaders has called \nunanimously for change in our military mission of engaging in combat \ndirectly to a new mission of supporting the Iraqi army and beginning to \nwithdraw our combat troops. The report sets a clear goal for achieving \nthis shift in mission and beginning the redeployment of our forces by \nthe first quarter of 2008. The report states clearly that ``the United \nStates must not make an open-ended commitment to keep large numbers of \nAmerican troops deployed in Iraq.''\n  Instead, the report calls for clear commitments from the Iraqi \ngovernment on reconciliation, along with clear consequences for our \nmilitary, political, and economic assistance if the commitments are not \nmet.\n  The report also calls for talks that include all of Iraq's neighbors \nin the region, especially Iran and Syria, and for a new diplomatic \ninitiative to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n  The American people are demanding change in Iraq, Robert Gates, the \nnominee for Secretary of Defense, has agreed we need change, and now \nthe bipartisan Iraq Study Group recommended a clear change in the way \nforward in Iraq.\n  The verdict is in. There can no longer be any doubt that the violence \nand chaos in Iraq are getting worse, that our current strategy is \nfailing, and that we need to work together on a new strategy that will \nmake it possible for us to bring our troops home. The only question is \nwhether the White House will heed this clarion call and agree to change \nthe perilous course we have been on in Iraq since Saddam Hussein fell \nand the chaos began.\n  More of the same failed policy that depends on an open-ended \ncommitment of our military will not bring America closer to success. It \nwill not stop the violence. It will only continue to undermine our own \nnational security interests.\n  Iraq is the defining issue of our time, and the person who will have \na major\n\n[[Page S11265]]\n\nvoice in meeting the enormous responsibility of recommending the new \ncourse will be the new leader we are confirming today as the Secretary \nof Defense.\n  The American people are demanding far more than a change of faces at \nthe Pentagon. They are demanding--and they deserve--a comprehensive \nchange in our policy so that we finally have a policy on Iraq that is \nworthy of the enormous sacrifice, commitment, and valor of our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  Although I voted against the nomination of Robert Gates to head the \nCIA in 1991, I support his nomination to be Secretary of Defense, \nbecause he assured the committee that he would be an independent \nthinker and give candid and frank advice to the President about a way \nforward in Iraq.\n  During the confirmation hearing yesterday, Dr. Gates spoke with \ncandor--a candor that has been sorely missing from the Department of \nDefense under this administration. He recognized the high price that \nour troops are paying for the current policy.\n  He clearly stated that we are not winning in Iraq and that all \noptions for a way forward are on the table.\n  He assured me personally that he would speak candidly, frankly, and \nboldly to people at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue about what he \nbelieves and what he thinks needs to be done. He told me that he is not \ncoming ``back to Washington to be a bump on a log.'' He assured me that \nhe will be ``independent'' and that he ``will consider all of the \noptions.''\n  He said that he is open to dialogue with Iran and Syria.\n  We all hope the administration will quickly set a new course that \nwill enable our troops to begin to come home. We need more than a new \nface--we need a new policy.\n  Our men and women in uniform who are making the ultimate sacrifice in \nIraq deserve no less, and I look forward to working with Dr. Gates on \nthese important issues in the months and years ahead as he assumes the \nresponsibility of Secretary of Defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank our colleague for his \ndistinguished participation on our committee for these many years. He \nwas with us all day yesterday in regard to the hearing. The Senator's \nquestions were very pointed. I am delighted to hear of his support.\n  At this time, I think the Senator from Texas is ready.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, we are still in negotiation on the \npoint. If no one else is here, may I make my statement on behalf of Bob \nGates?\n  Mr. WARNER. Absolutely. Now would be the time to do it.\n  I wish to inquire of the Presiding Officer, is there not an order to \nstand in recess at 12:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I hope at that time we can make a unanimous consent to \ntake such time as the Senator needs.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we be \nable to move that adjournment time until after the motion I wish to \nmake is done and Senator DeMint has a chance to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to speak on behalf of Dr. Robert Gates to become the next \nSecretary of Defense. I am very pleased to stand in support of this \ngreat man. I have gotten to know him, working with him as president of \nTexas A University and, before that, as the head of the Bush Library \nthere. I have found him to be a thoughtful, visionary leader who is a \nperfect fit for what we need in the Department of Defense at this \ncrucial time.\n  I was very pleased to see the Senate Armed Services Committee \noverwhelmingly and unanimously approve his nomination and bring it to \nthe floor. I thank Chairman Warner and Ranking Member Levin for acting \nexpeditiously on the nomination because, of course, when there is a \ntransition in place, you need to have the leader confirmed.\n  American military personnel are bound by the core values of duty, \nhonor, and country. GEN Douglas MacArthur articulated this during his \nfamous address to cadets at West Point in 1962.\n  Dr. Bob Gates certainly understands the meaning of these values. Dr. \nGates had not anticipated returning to Government service. He said he \nhas never enjoyed any position more than being president of Texas A \nUniversity. That makes me proud in itself. But in wartime, he said he \ncould not refuse the President's request.\n  Over the last 40 years, Dr. Gates has gained experience that makes \nhim uniquely qualified to serve as our 22nd Secretary of Defense. He \nstands ready to provide leadership that America needs to achieve \nvictory in the war on terror. He has been a commissioned officer in the \nAir Force, serving in the Strategic Air Command. He holds a Ph.D. in \nSoviet history from Georgetown University. He has held numerous \npositions within the intelligence community, including Director of the \nCIA and Deputy National Security Adviser. In 2002, he became president \nof Texas A, our Nation's sixth largest university.\n  Most recently, he was also a member of the Iraq Study Group that has \njust made its report today. He was a member until his nomination as \nSecretary of Defense. I believe that also has provided him with a good \nbackground on what is needed on the issue he faces so starkly right \nnow; that is, what we do in Iraq, what do we do that allows the Iraqi \npeople to have a government that is stable, a government that cannot be \noverrun by outside forces, and a government that will be stabilized \nitself for the good of its own people?\n  Dr. Gates' background is going to be perfect also at this particular \ntime because he has worked across the aisle. He has worked in \nintelligence, which is not a partisan issue. So I believe his \nexperience and his ability--acknowledged by all--to work with others is \nthe right formula for leading our Department of Defense and working as \none of the President's closest advisers.\n  I am very pleased that he has accepted this huge challenge. Texas A \nis a great university. It is a university that has a unique spirit, and \nit is a military spirit. So many of our heroes from past wars have \ngraduated from Texas A University. He has kept this military \nconnection, his intelligence connection, and his ability to work with \nothers, all making him the very best choice for the President.\n  I, for one, know this man and am very confident that he is the right \nchoice. I look forward to working with him to make sure we are doing \nthe right thing in the war on terror, which is bigger than just Iraq. \nIt is Afghanistan. It is all over the world where terrorists are \nharming people and are taking away part of the freedom for which we \nstand. And we don't want that to happen. We have to beat the \nterrorists, and I want to beat them where they are, not have them come \nto America ever again and hurt American citizens and people who live \nand work in America.\n  I think Bob Gates is the right person to advise the President, to \nwork with the President, to implement the President's policies and \nbring this war to a conclusion with only one thing to be said, and that \nis, a conclusion that is a victory.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 5385\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to speak on behalf of \nthe brave men and women who are defending our country around the world \nand for those valiant veterans who have served and are now home.\n  On November 14, this Senate passed the Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs appropriations bill. I was on the Senate floor for 5 \nhours, and every Senator had ample time to debate any part of this \nbill. Several Senators spoke. In the end, this bill was agreed to by \nthe entire Senate by a unanimous vote. It is a good bill. It is a \nbipartisan bill. It is one that we have worked on together for months.\n\n[[Page S11266]]\n\n  We are at war. We have to care for the men and women fighting this \nwar, and we have to take care of them when they return. This bill funds \nthe vital infrastructure our brave soldiers, sailors, and airmen and \nwomen need to defend our country. They must have the funding to operate \nbases with sufficient facilities and protection so they can fulfill the \nmission we ask of them.\n  The bill also provides critical dollars to care for those veterans \nwho were injured in battle. This bill provides funds for medical \nservices and mental health treatment for veterans suffering from the \nwounds they received in battle. They are not only suffering from \nobvious wounds, thousands are suffering from traumatic shock and mental \nanguish. Thousands are suffering from diseases for which we don't even \nhave a treatment. This bill funds the research for that treatment.\n  As a nation, we ask our men and women to defend and protect us. We \nowe it to them. We have an obligation to care for them. It is a moral \nobligation and one that I feel is my responsibility to fulfill.\n  If we adjourn without completing our work on this bill, we will let \nthose men and women down. We will let down every American they swore an \noath to protect and serve.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of H.R. 5385, the Military Construction \nappropriations bill; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, reserving the right to object, let me \nsay that I strongly support this legislation that will maintain and \nimprove the quality of life for our military personnel. I believe that \nthe Senator from Texas, the chairwoman of the subcommittee, has done an \nexcellent job with the bill.\n  I am also pleased that the Senator from Texas obviously feels there \nis still time to conference this bill, since the House committee has \nbeen saying in the newspapers that there is not enough time. I agree \nwith Senator Hutchison that if we appointed conferees today, with some \nhard work, this bill could get finished.\n  I, also, add that the Senator from Texas is committed to keeping this \nbill clean in conference, which we greatly appreciate. I agree with her \nthat we are at war, but those of us who sent our troops to war should \nnot be back home selling out the country for which they are fighting. \nIt is my understanding that the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee has refused to make the assurances that we need to keep this \nbill clean in conference and, therefore, if I consent to letting this \nbill go to conference, there is a risk that it will return to the \nSenate as a foot-tall Omnibus appropriations bill, with thousands of \nearmarks in an unamendable form. Therefore, Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, over the last several weeks, I have made \nit clear that I believe this bill, which is a good bill, needs to stay \nclean of additional appropriations and earmarks if it is to go to \nconference. I was asked by the members of the Senate steering committee \nto protect their interests in keeping these appropriations bills clean.\n  I informed the leader that the steering committee did not believe it \nwas wise to send a bill to conference without an understanding of what \nthe conference agreement would look like. I have made it clear that all \nwe want is a commitment from the leadership and the Appropriations \nCommittee that this is what will happen. I am not looking for anything \nextraordinary, a unanimous consent agreement or anything like that. We \nwould be satisfied with a commitment from the chairman of the committee \nor the leadership that this is what will happen.\n  At one point, it appeared that we had such an agreement. Leader Frist \nasked me to put on paper what our specific concerns were to avoid any \nconfusion. I did so.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter from myself, \nSenator Coburn, and Senator Inhofe be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 4, 2006.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader U. S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader, We share your commitment to addressing the \n     needs of our veterans, service members, and their families, \n     while protecting the interests of hard working American \n     taxpayers. As we have said from the beginning, we will \n     support a clean Military Construction, Military Quality of \n     Life, and Veterans Affairs conference report, as long as it \n     is not used as a vehicle for a pork-laden omnibus.\n       Therefore, we hereby reiterate our support for a conference \n     if, and only if, it is limited to producing a military \n     construction and veterans spending conference report and \n     potentially a clean continuing resolution for the remaining \n     unfunded appropriation bills to ensure the uninterrupted \n     operations of the Federal government.\n       Additionally, with respect to the military construction and \n     veterans spending legislation--\n       1. Each spending provision or directive language in either \n     the text of the final legislation or the statement of the \n     managers must meet one of the following criteria--\n       a. it is authorized in current law, and the amount in the \n     conference report does not exceed the authorized level;\n       b. it was requested in the President's Budget, and the \n     amount in the conference report does not exceed the amount in \n     the President's Budget;\n       c. it is listed on the Future Years Defense Plan and the \n     amount in the conference report does not exceed the amount in \n     the Future Years Defense Plan.\n       2. Each spending item contained in the conference report \n     must be contained in either the House or Senate bills and \n     must not exceed the higher of the two amounts for that \n     specific provision.\n       3. The total spending level in the Military Construction \n     and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriation Bill \n     shall not exceed the current 302(b) allocations.\n       Thank you for your leadership and willingness to do the \n     right thing for American taxpayers.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jim DeMint,\n     Tom Coburn,\n     Jim Inhofe.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, the leader then told me he wanted to \ntalk with Senator Hutchison and the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee before he responded to the letter. Senator Hutchison agreed \nto the parameters of the letter. The chairman of the committee, \nhowever, felt that he could not agree to the request we made in the \nletter. Unfortunately, that means the Military Construction bill will \nhave to wait until next year.\n  I take my colleague from Texas at her word when she says she will \nkeep the bill clean. I know she will keep the bill clean. However, when \nthe chairman of the committee says he will not make such a commitment, \nI must take him at his word as well. I believe the veterans and \nmilitary projects need to be funded and should not be used as a vehicle \nfor unrelated, wasteful earmarks.\n  Let me explain how we got to this point. In the November 7 elections, \none of the top issues for the voters was wasteful spending. While we \nhave done some things to control taxes and spending, we have not done \nnearly enough, and the voters are right. Earmarks have gone up in \nnumbers every year and are now at an all-time high. If this does not \nend, we will never regain the trust of the American people.\n  When the military construction and veterans spending bill passed the \nSenate, I strongly supported it. However, it was clear that the intent \nwas to use the bill as a shell to carry the Omnibus appropriations bill \nand other add-ons. Because the scope of the conference rules has become \nso relaxed, the conferees, under our rules, would have the ability to \nput into the bill any projects they please, with no opportunity for us \nto amend them or even vote, except on final passage of the bill, which \nwould be overwhelmingly approved.\n  The conference process has rendered the Senate floor consideration of \nbills almost irrelevant. Nothing we do in this Chamber matters until a \nbill goes to conference. When a bill goes to conference, conferees may \nremove provisions that are in both the House and the Senate bills, even \nif they were approved by both Houses overwhelmingly. Conferees may add \nprovisions that are unrelated to either bill.\n  Through this process, a clean Military Construction bill could grow \ninto a foot-tall Omnibus appropriations bill, with thousands of \nearmarks and wasteful spending. The process is flawed, and\n\n[[Page S11267]]\n\nit cannot continue this way. When a bill comes back that funds the \nentire Government and we are forced to vote for the bill or shut down \nthe Government, that bill is going to pass. This means that if I \nconsent to letting this bill go to conference, I am essentially \nconsenting to enact whatever the conferees want to insert in the bill \nunamended.\n  We put a lot of trust in our conferees, and all I was asking was for \nan understanding from the committee that we know, at least in general, \nwhere the conference will be headed. I have not been able to get this \ncommitment. I was given no information and no assurances.\n  Therefore, I am compelled to do what I think is right to protect the \ntaxpayers and to provide integrity and accountability in the spending \nprocess.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, let me say right upfront, I hope \nthis objection will go away sometime today. I think we are talking \nabout whether something is done in writing or whether it is semantics. \nI didn't have to agree to what was in the letter that was written to \nthe leader because our Military Construction bill meets all of the \ncriteria they set forth. I didn't have to agree to their letter because \neverything in our bill is authorized or it is in the President's bill \nor it is in the future years' designations of priority by the \nDepartment of Defense. That is called a FYDP. It meets those criteria. \nWe don't put provisions in our military construction conference \ncommittee reports that are not in the House or Senate bill.\n  All I can do is give my word that this is not going to turn into an \nomnibus. I am giving my word it is not going to be an omnibus. It is \ngoing to be the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill that \nwas passed unanimously by the Senate.\n  I hope that all of the relevant parties will be able to sit down \nbecause I can't call this up for a vote. It would be spread out for so \nlong as to lose the ability to go to conference. The House is planning \nto go out of session at the end of this week. I would stay here for 2 \nweeks to finish this bill because there is so much in it that is \nimportant. It is all new starts. This bill is filled with the \npriorities that the Department of Defense has in facilities on military \nbases all over this country, including quality-of-life housing for our \nmilitary men and women. It has veterans affairs priorities and \nincreases in funding for mental health and for research into post-\ntraumatic stress syndrome. There are many items in this bill that will \nnot be covered in a continuing resolution.\n  I hope we will all be able to sit down together. I hope the House \nwill cooperate if we send this conference committee request to them. I \nam prepared to work all night and all day tomorrow to try to fit all of \nthe timeframes.\n\n  Let me end by saying that we are very close between the House and the \nSenate. I think we can work out the differences between the House and \nthe Senate. I am saying right now this will not turn into an omnibus \nappropriations bill. It will be a bill that funds military housing and \nquality of life for our men and women in the military and their \nfamilies, and it will have the new starts that cannot be covered by a \ncontinuing resolution. We certainly meet the criteria or the Senate \nwouldn't have passed the bill unanimously.\n  So I am not saying the Senator from South Carolina is wrong in his \nstatements about what happens in conference committee reports in many \nother areas and in the history of the Senate. He is right. Sometimes a \nconference report will turn into an omnibus, and sometimes you find \nthings that are not in either the House or Senate bill. But I am saying \ntoday that would not be the case in our bill, nor has it been the case \nthat I can remember in past bills. Maybe I am forgetting something. But \nby and large, our bill is straightforward. And by and large, our bill \nis supported by the entire Senate. It is not very far from the bill \nthat the House passed, and I think if we all put our minds to this and \nput away--I don't think our leadership would be required to sign a \nletter and I don't think the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nshould be required to sign a letter. I think we should be good for our \nword around here. If we are not, then we have lost the spirit of this \ninstitution.\n  So I am saying today that I am going to go back to the drawing board. \nI am going to work with the Senator from South Carolina and the \nSenators from Oklahoma. I am going to work with my counterparts on the \nHouse side, and I am going to try to get a bill through here, and I am \nnot going to stop trying for the rest of the time that one of our \nHouses is in session. I think we owe it to our men and women in the \nmilitary, we owe it to the veterans who have already served. We owe it \nto those people who are coming back here without limbs that we are \nfunding at additional levels, not only the prosthetics but also the \ntraining on how to be proficient in using those artificial limbs. Madam \nPresident, I think we can do it. I am committed to trying, and I hope \neverybody who is involved in this process will also try.\n  Let me also add that my counterpart, Senator Feinstein, who is the \nranking member of this subcommittee, is in full support of this bill. I \nhave talked to her about the issue I am trying to address, and she is \nready to go to conference. I do believe that if we will sit down and \ntalk with everyone who is interested, everybody would be satisfied that \nwe will keep our word and we will do what we intended to do, anyway, \nwhich is conference a bill that is going to take the differences in the \nHouse and Senate bills and resolve those differences. That is what we \nare supposed to do, and that is what I am committed to do.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I know we have the call for party \nluncheons. I have some comments which are heartfelt about a colleague \nof ours, Paul Sarbanes, and I wonder if the Chair would indulge us for \na few minutes to be able to make these comments now. We are debating \nthe Secretary of Defense, but we have set that aside until after the \nconferences of our parties. Would it be permissible with the Chair if I \nmade some brief comments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair for her courteousness and \nunderstanding.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11267-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                       The Appropriations Process\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I come to the floor here today to share \nwith my colleagues and my constituents my frustration with the inaction \nof Congress on its most basic responsibility, to enact bills to make \nappropriations for the Government for the coming year.\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular \n     Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all \n     public Money shall be published from time to time.\n\n  That is the Constitution of the United States. There is no \nresponsibility more fundamental than the one I\n\n[[Page S11268]]\n\nhave just read. The American people pay taxes and they expect the \nCongress to do something with those taxes every year. Part of it they \nexpect to be spent on the operations of Government--for the payments of \nthe Defense Department, for the payments of the Treasury Department, \nfor all things that go on in the Energy Department. All of those \nfunctions of Government are put together and handled in appropriations \nbills that have a committee chairman and a ranking member, and each \nyear, under our system, where it is annual, they are supposed to \nproduce an appropriations bill that goes from House to House and \nbecomes a final product when it has been passed in both Houses and gone \nto conference between the two Houses and comes out as a final bill, \nwhich goes to the President of the United States. That is the format.\n  There are 13 of those that cause the Government of the United States \nto function. Can you believe that many publications have scorned \nCongress? Some have blamed the House of Representatives, some have \nblamed the Senate, some have blamed the administration for sending an \nunrealistic budget last February. The blame game doesn't interest this \nSenator. We all share in this quiet conspiracy to duck fulfilling the \nmost fundamental responsibility that we have and that is to vote on \nappropriations bills, to confer between the House so they are the same \nbill, the same package of requirements, requests, expenditures that we \nultimately call a bill.\n  Some media analysts contend that the Senate was afraid to cast votes \non appropriations bills, thinking these votes might be used against \nincumbent Senators in recently held elections. All sorts of reasons \nemerged that justified laying aside this appropriations bill or that \none. Some feared that amendments to the bills might take too long, too \nmuch time. Amendments might be painful choices for Senators. Some of \nthe votes might slow down the process and some might show up later in \ncampaign commercials or propaganda.\n  This Senator has cast more than 12,000 votes, more than almost any \nother Senator in the Senate history. There are maybe five or six who \nhave cast more. My votes may be characterized by my opponents in a \ncampaign, using commercials and whatever else they would like. They can \nfind almost any vote I have taken over the years I have been here.\n  I took this job knowing full well I would have to vote to decide, to \nchoose, and that these decisions would absolutely be second-guessed by \na whole host of people. So I reject the notion that the Senate saved \nitself by avoiding so-called hard votes. We had not and we did not take \nthe votes, did we? And look at the results in November. If it were our \nRepublican approach to save ourselves, we lost ourselves.\n  Now we have the end of a Congress and here sit the appropriations \nbills unattended, sitting over there on the various clerks' desks. All \nthe work has been done except the final work where they have to come to \neach House and get approved.\n  What we will do, for and to the people of the United States, from \nthis day forward is terrible. Since we do not have the bills passed on \nboth sides, we will have a continuing resolution, named for another \ndocument where we will pass the Government spending for a period of \ntime and say we will spend, and then we relate it to something. We \nnormally do it for 20 days out of the year. This time we will have a \ncontinuing resolution with the bills that have not been passed. That \nshould be used very seldom, this continuing resolution, and it is \ngetting to be like apple pie around here. We use it all the time. \nRather than do our work, we do a continuing resolution. We continue it \nby resolution, equating it most frequently to the work that has been \ncompleted by the House, for they have done their work first. Therefore, \nthe Senate has little or no input into what the continuing resolution \nultimately says we are going to spend money on.\n  It used to be that a continuing resolution was not watched very well \nand it was a way of putting all kinds of things on. That doesn't happen \nmuch anymore. So what we are getting out of this as Senators is \nnothing. We are getting little or no input into the appropriations \nprocess. The bills we handle, if we are chairmen or ranking members, \nare not going to get adopted at any time or even referred to at any \ntime unless we decide, in the next 6 or 7 weeks, to do something \ntogether that will change that by reference or by adopting some new \nbill.\n  There is much to be done and clearly we are not on the right course \nat this point. We are not going to pass many of these bills except \nperhaps a military construction bill, which is no longer a construction \nbill, but it is a bill for the health and welfare of our soldiers, and \nfor many other things, and it is for building many new things that have \nto be built here at home for them and, therefore, that Military \nConstruction bill will probably be a must and it will be around, and \npeople will be talking about it and the fact that it has to be done.\n  From my standpoint, this week, if this 109th Congress slinks into \nhistory, as seems to be scheduled, it will have completed work on only \ntwo appropriations bills, Defense and Homeland Security, and maybe the \none I have just referred to as Military Construction. In place of the \ncompleted bills, we will have a continuing resolution through February \n15, next year, about the time the President will send us a 2008 final \nfiscal year budget. We will be getting a new one before we have done \nanything about the old one. We will be getting a brandnew budget--\nimagine--and we will not have done anything about all of those that are \nsitting on the desks of clerks, waiting to do their part in \nappropriately spending our money.\n  Next year, we will look at the remaining 2007 bills, the much \nanticipated $100 billion Defense supplemental request that we all \nexpect the President to suggest, and all 13 of the 2008 bills.\n  Does someone think this kind of procedure serves the public interest \nor some political interest? I believe it serves neither of the two.\n  For those Senators who are glad to see a continuing resolution \nbecause they think it saves money, think again. Not only will this \ncontinuing resolution not save money, but it will give reordering of \npriorities to the 110th Congress. I predict that we will spend more, \nnot less, as a result of the strategy adopted by the Congress this \nyear. The upshot will be that we have both failed to fulfill our \nconstitutional responsibility and have spent more money.\n  What an outcome.\n  Who is to blame, then? Not the Senate Appropriations Committee, which \nreported every single appropriations bill by the end of July, the \nearliest such bills had been reported in 18 years. Not the subcommittee \nchairman, of which I am one, who worked to meet the deadlines set by \nthe chairman and ranking member.\n  Those highly motivated members who wanted a full and open debate on \nthe appropriations bills certainly cannot be blamed, although the \noutcome of their efforts will probably disappoint them by the middle of \nnext year. Each Senator has the obligation to pursue what he or she \nbelieves is the correct policy, using any parliamentary means \nappropriate. I cannot condemn my colleagues who, for one reason or the \nother, find the appropriations process objectionable.\n  Here is what I suggest for the future. Let's vote. Let's report the \nindividual bills, as Chairman Cochran did this year, on time. Then, \nlet's bring the bills up on the floor. If members want to filibuster, \nthat is their privilege. We vote on that. If cloture prevails, we have \npost cloture debate, and then vote again. Yes, it is time consuming, \nbut it's our job. Let's vote.\n  Let me close by discussing briefly my own Energy and Water \nappropriations bill, which has awaited Senate action for almost 5 \nmonths now.\n  It is almost ludicrous that at this time in history, the 109th \nCongress failed to act on this bill. We read daily about the growing \nnuclear threat in North Korea; millions of words are written and spoken \non the threat of an Iran with a nuclear capability. Six Arab, Sunni \nnations have now petitioned for a nuclear program through the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, including Saudi Arabia, contending \nthat they need such programs for domestic energy purposes. Many \nanalysts believe that the Arab nations observe the growing threat of a \nShia Iran, with the potential for a nuclear weapon, and want nuclear \nprograms for weapons purposes. We listen to witnesses tell us\n\n[[Page S11269]]\n\nof their fears of nuclear terrorism and the failures of the present \nnonproliferation programs.\n  For more than two decades now, these subjects have been the focus of \nmuch of my work as a Senator. And much of the good work that this \nNation has done to address nonproliferation and nuclear terrorism is \nfunded by the Energy and Water appropriations bill.\n  Yet at this dangerous time, the 109th Congress couldn't find time to \ntake up the Energy and Water appropriations bill. In addition to \nhundreds of millions, almost billions of dollars for disposing of \nweapons grade nuclear material, and funding to try to stop nuclear \nmaterial from shipment to this Nation, the bill funded alternative \nenergy sources. It funds weatherization grants for Americans. It funds \na brand new approach to handling nuclear waste here and abroad.\n  Let me close by discussing several important items in the bill, which \nlanguishes.\n  First, in the area of nuclear nonproliferation, the administration \nhas given careful thought to how to handle the growing Iran and North \nKorea nuclear threat. Yet under the strategy adopted by this Congress \non my bill, the Nonproliferation and International Security Account \nwill be $53 million less than the House passed bill and the Senate \ncommittee-reported bill recommend. Think about that, short-changing \nthat nonproliferation account because we were afraid to vote.\n  Second, and even more serious, one of the largest non-proliferation \nprojects ever will be delayed. The Fissile Materials Disposition \nprogram, located in South Carolina, I add for the benefit of those two \nSenators, is known by the short hand of MOX. That program now has \nstopped construction, because the House passed bill eliminated all \nfunding. And, since we have no Senate-passed bill, we cannot even \nnegotiate levels on the continuing resolution. Think about this: the \nUnited States and Russia have spent the last 10 years negotiating a \ndeal to eliminate 34 tons of plutonium from the nations' stockpiles and \nnow the future of this effort is in limbo because Congress couldn't \nfind the time to do its job.\n  As chairman of the Energy and Water subcommittee I was excited about \nthe new initiatives proposed by the President including energy \nindependence and to increase funding for science research in the Fiscal \nYear '07 request.\n  The Fiscal Year '07 budget took bold steps and made significant \ninvestment in nuclear power and alternative energy. Unfortunately, \nenactment of a CR will delay our investment in to alternative energy \nand maintain our increasing level of dependence on foreign energy \nsources.\n  Building on Energy Policy Act passed in 2005, the President supported \nincreased funding for the research on cellulosic biomass, solar, \nhydrogen and advanced battery research. The Senate also restored \nfunding geothermal development a renewable resources in the west with \ngreat potential.\n  The Senate Energy and Water bill supported the implementation of a \nloan guarantee program that was included in the Energy Policy Act of \n2005. This is an innovative financial solution, which would not cost \nthe Federal Government a dime in appropriated funding.\n  The backing by the Federal Government supports the commercial \ndeployment of first-of-a-kind energy production technology. Without the \nlanguage in the Senate bill, this program will not go forward and our \nNation will not get closer to energy independence.\n  The Senate Energy and Water bill also fully funds the President's \nrequest for the Department of Energy's Office of Science. Our future \neconomic growth and security will require our schools to train the next \ngeneration of scientists and engineers. We haven't done enough and are \nlosing ground in scientific research. This budget will reverse that \ntrend with investments in basic scientific.\n  The Senate fully funds the President's request for the Office of \nScience.\n  The Senate bill also provides important funding to support the \nlicensing of a new nuclear power reactor that will met our growing \nenergy demand without increasing greenhouse gases.\n  The bill closes the funding shortfall for the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission in order to hire and train additional technical staff that \nwill be needed to review the new license applications being developed \nby utilities. These priorities will not be recognized with continued \ndelays with a CR.\n  This year the President outlined his plans for the Global Nuclear \nEnergy Partnership. This program invests makes a large investment in \naddressing spent fuel stored at reactors all across the country by \nrecycling. As Yucca Mountain continues to face delays, the Senate bill \nsupports the administration's efforts to reduce, reuse and recycle \ncommercial spent fuel.\n  I understand the challenges the leadership of Congress faces. Any of \nus who have served a chairman of the Budget Committee certainly \nunderstand the cross-currents in this Chamber. But, putting aside hard \nchoices almost never leads to good results. We should remain in session \nthis month until we fund the 2007 bills. After all, that's our job.\n  Since it appears there are no Senators wishing to speak, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Appointment of Conferees--H.R. 5385\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 5385, the Military Construction appropriations \nbill, that the Senate insist upon its amendments, request a conference \nwith the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. If the \nSenator from Texas would allow me to discuss with her our conversation \nwith Leader Frist. As we talked about earlier today, both the Senator \nfrom Texas, myself, and I believe the entire Senate and Congress want \nthis bill to pass.\n  Senator Hutchison and myself have had the opportunity to meet with \nLeader Frist to talk about the importance of passing this bill, as well \nas the importance of not adding additional appropriations and \nadditional earmarks which were not part of the Senate or the House \nversion of this bill or were not part of the President's budget.\n  If I could ask the Senator, is it her understanding that it is our \ngeneral agreement and also leadership's that this bill will be kept to \nthe basic bills which have been passed by the House and Senate and that \nit will return to the Senate floor as a bill that we have discussed \nwith Leader Frist?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, there was never any other intention. I \nhave discussed this with Senator Cochran, chairman of the committee. I \ndiscussed it with Senator Frist, our leader. I have discussed it with \nthe ranking member, Senator Feinstein. And most certainly we will bring \nback a conference report that has either material in the President's \nbudget request, something that has passed the House or the Senate in \nthis bill, and all of the projects will be duly authorized on the \nmilitary construction side.\n  On the Veterans' Administration side, we worked very closely with the \nauthorization committee, Senator Craig, Senator Akaka, and others to \nassure that we have the approval of the committee leaders for all of \nthe veterans' expenditures.\n  I have to say to the Senator from South Carolina that there are some \nvery important initiatives in the Veterans bill that would not be \ncovered in a continuing resolution. And there are very important \ncommitments for new starts in the Military Construction bill that are \nnecessary for us to keep pace with the BRAC project and with other \nmilitary housing and quality-of-life projects that are included in the \nbill. It is going to be a Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \nbill with the priorities of the Senate. This bill passed unanimously in \nthe Senate. We would go forward with the clear understanding that this \nis going to be a military construction and veterans affairs and \nmilitary quality-of-life conference report.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator for her \nopenness and\n\n[[Page S11270]]\n\ntenacity in helping to get the agreements we need to keep this bill \nclean and focused on the needs of our military. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Presiding Officer (Mr. DeMint) appointed Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \nBurns, Mr. Craig, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Allard, Mr. McConnell, \nMr. Cochran, Mr. Stevens, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Johnson, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Byrd, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Harkin conferees on \nthe part of the Senate.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is a major step forward. I have \nbeen working with Senator Feinstein to try to get conferees appointed \nfor our bill. There is time in this session for the House and the \nSenate to come together and put a bill forward in the conference report \nthat will do what is right by our military who are serving our country \nand protecting our freedom, who are in harm's way as we speak. There is \ntime for us to take care of those good people. There is most certainly \ntime for us to take care of our veterans and to make sure that the \npriorities which we have set this year, for heaven's sake, are passed \nin this session of Congress.\n  If anyone says to me we don't have time to have a conference, they \nare wrong. It is 12:40 in the afternoon. It is Wednesday. I will work \nall night, if necessary, and so will our great staff working with the \nHouse, if the House will sit down with us. Our military personnel and \nour veterans deserve what is in this bill. It is a bill which passed \nunanimously. The House passed a bill overwhelmingly as well. It will \nmove our military quality of life up. That is certainly our intent.\n  This could not have been done without everyone's cooperation. I think \nthat is what the people of America expect from the Congress. They \ndeserve it. That is what we are going to give them.\n  I want to particularly say that Senator Frist and Senator Cochran \nhave been instrumental in allowing us to go forward. There has been a \nlot of emotional talk and rhetoric around what we do in these last few \ndays of this session of Congress. I think everyone, including the \nSenator from South Carolina and the Senators from Oklahoma, have all \nrisen above certain emotional feelings and have said: Yes, we are going \nto work together. I am very pleased that we are.\n  I am going to yield the floor in one minute and roll up my sleeves \nand try to get the Military Affairs, Quality of Life, Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs bill in shape for us to pass this \nsession of Congress and send a good conference report to the President \nof the United States, who I know will sign the bill.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask consent that the vote on the \npending nomination occur at 5 p.m. today, with the time until the vote \nequally divided between the chairman and the ranking member or their \ndesignees; further, that 20 minutes of the chairman's time be allocated \nto Senator Specter; provided further that immediately following the \nvote, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and \nthe Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been my honor twice to sit down in \nmy office with the nominee to be our next Secretary of Defense, Robert \nGates. Both meetings have been very positive. The last was this \nmorning.\n  When Dr. Gates came in early this morning, I congratulated him on his \nappearance before the Committee on Armed Services yesterday. He said: \nIt is amazing what a little candor will do. That is what endeared him \nto the committee and resulted in this unanimous, bipartisan vote \nbringing his nomination to the floor. Dr. Gates was honest with members \nof the Committee on Armed Services. He will be honest with the American \npeople. He understands that our efforts in Iraq are not going well and \nwe need to change. He is a person who is dedicated to the kind of \nchange which will be consistent with our values in foreign policy.\n  He told me honestly he didn't know what we should do in Iraq, but we \nneed to examine the two primary missions we now face: establishing \nconditions of security on the one hand, training and supporting the \nIraqis on the other. He said we may need to shift the balance between \nthe two missions. That is not unlike the recommendations of the Iraq \nStudy Group which were released today.\n  That commission delivered to the President a series of \nrecommendations.\n  In just a short time, in about 2 hours, the Senate is expected to \nconfirm Dr. Gates as the new Secretary of Defense with an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote.\n  Those two developments today provide an opportunity to change the \ncourse in Iraq. Of course, the ultimate responsibility is on our \nCommander in Chief, the President of the United States. On November 7, \nthe American people spoke out clearly of the need for change.\n  Dr. Gates was an original member of the Baker-Hamilton group and \nagrees that change is necessary. Today, that group confirmed the need \nto change our policy and lay out a framework to redeploy American \nforces. Redeployment means basically removing them from the dangers of \nIraq, placing them nearby to be called on if necessary but, more \nimportantly, starting to bring them home. Only the Commander in Chief \ncan make that happen.\n  The President has said he is not looking for a graceful exit from \nIraq. I would have to say that America should be looking for the right \nexit from Iraq. The President was asked a few months ago: When will \nAmerican troops come home? He said he would have to leave that decision \nto future Presidents. I don't believe America wants to see troops in \nIraq facing the dangers of war for the next 2 years and for many years \nbeyond. We believe we have done a great deed for the Iraqi people in \nremoving their dictator and giving them a chance to have their own \nconstitution and their own government. Now it is time for the Iraqis to \nstand and defend their own nation.\n  According to the Iraq Study Group, the most professional and \nproficient military in history has been stretched to the breaking point \nbecause of repeated deployments to Iraq. As of today, I have been given \nan updated figure: 2,907 American service men and women have been \nkilled and 21,000 have been wounded. We have about 140,000 troops in \nIraq today. We certainly owe it to these soldiers, these brave men and \nwomen and their families to initiate this redeployment process as \nquickly as possible.\n\n  The war in Iraq impacts our defense posture worldwide. Because of \nIraq, we have fewer options to respond to emerging threats in this \ndangerous world.\n  In thinking about the war in Iraq recently, like many others I was \nstruck by how many comparisons there are to the situation of Vietnam \nfour decades ago. There are many differences, but there are many \nparallels.\n  In October of 1964, running for President, Lyndon Johnson said:\n\n       We are not about to send American boys nine or ten thousand \n     miles away from home to do what Asian boys ought to be doing \n     for themselves.\n\n  In 1969, 5 years after that statement, there were over half a million \nAmerican troops in Vietnam.\n  That same year, Johnson's successor, President Nixon, who had run on \na campaign that he had a secret plan to end the war, said:\n\n\n[[Page S11271]]\n\n\n       I'm not going to be the first American president to lose a \n     war.\n\n  Well, both Presidents made a series of decisions that prolonged and \nexpanded that war at enormous cost to our Nation. We have only to walk \njust a few blocks from this Capitol to the Vietnam Memorial to see the \nreal cost of that war.\n  Perhaps like Presidents Johnson and Nixon, the Bush administration \nhas gone through several phases on this war. First was the time of \ndeception, when we were told there were weapons of mass destruction \nthat did not exist, a link with al-Qaida that did not exist, and other \nclaims about nuclear capabilities that did not exist.\n  Next came the phase of denial, where the President and some of his \nkey advisers refused to recognize or adapt to the realities on the \nground, dismissing the first signs of insurgency. You recall, I am \nsure, as I do, Vice President Cheney saying the insurgency is in its \nlast throes, and denying its growing strength as we have seen the \ncasualties in Iraq mount by the day. Then they downplayed and denied \nthe outbreak of sectarian violence that now seems, for all intents and \npurposes, a real civil war.\n  The third phase has been delusion. The President apparently continues \nto delude himself about Iraq. I hope this Iraq Study Group will be a \nturning point in his thinking.\n  For example, in a phrase that cannot help but remind us of Katrina \nand FEMA Administrator Brown, President Bush recently said of Prime \nMinister al-Maliki: He is the ``right guy for Iraq.'' What a contrast \nfrom the memo by the President's National Security Adviser, Stephen \nHadley, which said:\n\n       The reality on the streets of Baghdad suggests al-Maliki is \n     either ignorant of what is going on, misrepresenting his \n     intentions or that his capabilities are not yet sufficient to \n     turn his good intentions into actions.\n\n  When asked in October if we were winning in Iraq, President Bush \nsaid:\n\n       Absolutely, we're winning.\n\n  When Robert Gates was asked that question yesterday in his \nconfirmation hearing, he said very clearly: No.\n  That gives me hope that with this Gates nomination and with this Iraq \nStudy Group report we may have turned the corner. The Nation cannot \nafford deception, denial, or delusion when it comes to the situation in \nIraq. Certainly, our soldiers and their families deserve better. They \ndeserve change.\n  We will now have a much needed change in the Pentagon. I know Members \non both sides of the aisle are eager to work with the new Secretary to \nmake more changes. But, ultimately, it is the President's \nresponsibility. The buck truly stops in the Oval Office. If the \nPresident recognizes the urgent need for a new direction in Iraq, we \nwill see it happen, and soon.\n  The Baker-Hamilton commission has given the President a call to \naction, a roadmap to engage in broader diplomacy, to transfer \nresponsibility to the Iraqis, and to redeploy American combat forces.\n  I hope President Bush, with the assistance of his new Secretary of \nDefense, Mr. Gates, will begin that redeployment process this January.\n  Consider our challenge. The Baker study group said we should have, \nbasically, the combat forces of America gone by April 1 of 2008. With \nabout 140,000 or 150,000 15 months before that date, we need to start \nseeing redeployment happen, and happen soon. Nothing could send a \nclearer signal to the Iraqis, the American people, and the world that \nwe are truly moving down a new road in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to speak on \nthe nomination of Robert Gates to be Secretary of Defense. It is my \nhonor to serve under Chairman John Warner on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. We are particularly proud of the fact that 1 out of every 10 \npersons in uniform in this country, or serving around the world, calls \nTexas home. So we are very proud of the military. We are pro-military. \nWe believe in doing everything we can to support our men and women in \nuniform and particularly their families.\n  So it is with great joy that I say the President has chosen someone \nwho currently serves as President of Texas A University to be the \nnext Secretary of Defense. Even though Bob Gates is from Kansas \noriginally, he has most recently become a Texan--at least we claim him \nbecause he has been living in College Station as President of Texas A \nthese last few years.\n  I particularly commend the President for his selection and Mr. Gates \nfor answering the call, once again, to public service. He is not a new \nface in this town. Having served as Director of the CIA, having served \non the National Security Council, he has a distinguished record of \npublic service. He has written extensively on military intelligence and \nmatters of diplomacy.\n  My meetings with Dr. Gates, preliminary to the hearings we had this \nweek on the Armed Services Committee, gave me great confidence that he \nis of the temperament and ability to lead the Department of Defense in \nwhat has to be the second most difficult job in Washington, DC; that \nis, to deal with an agency with the budget of about a half-trillion \ndollars a year and to perform what is the most important priority of \nthe Federal Government: provide safety and security to the American \npeople. That is a responsibility not only here at home, obviously, but \nliterally all around the world.\n  On the matter of Iraq, which was the subject matter of most of the \nquestions and comments of the committee during Dr. Gates' confirmation \nhearing, I think he understands the challenges that face us in Iraq and \nwhy it is that we must succeed. As he told me, and as he testified at \nthe hearing, a failure in Iraq would lead to increased activity by al-\nQaida, as well as regional instability in the Middle East. It could \neven lead to a regional--I think he used the term ``conflagration,'' \nwhere additional States that are not currently involved in the conflict \nin Iraq could find their interests at stake and could resort to \nmilitary force. First, dealing with al-Qaida, and the result of a \nfailed state in Afghanistan after the Soviet Union left there in 1989, \nultimately led to the rise of the Taliban and gave Osama bin Laden a \nplace to plot, plan, train, and then export terrorist attacks around \nthe world, including in Washington, DC, and New York City on September \n11. Beyond the terrorist threat, it is also clear that Iran has \naspirations that will very much put the future of Iraq in jeopardy and \nour own safety in America as well.\n\n  As is widely known, Iran is primarily a Shia majority population. \nIraq is composed of roughly three ethnic divisions--Kurds, Shia, and \nSunni--and, clearly, Iran is taking advantage of the instability in \nIraq to consolidate its position with the Shia in the south, which \nhappens to be an oil-rich region of that nation. But, in effect, if our \nprecipitous withdrawal from Iraq would leave a failed state and leave \nopportunities for Iranian hegemony, it would create further de facto \npartitions of Iraq which could perhaps cause the Saudis, as some \nleaders have suggested, to have to go into Iraq to defend the Sunni \nminority against ethnic cleansing by the Shia majority, perhaps in \ncombination with Iran, and it would create an opportunity, perhaps, for \nthe Kurds to create, in effect, a separate state in northern Iraq which \nwould cause Turkey a lot of concerns, as has been frequently expressed.\n  I am pleased that Dr. Gates understands the seriousness of this \nchallenge that confronts our Nation. This is one that is certainly \nbigger than any election or any political party because, as I said at \nthe outset, it represents the single most solemn responsibility those \nof us who serve in the Federal Government have, and that is to provide \nfor the safety and security of our own people at home.\n  Today, as everyone knows, the Iraq Study Group issued its report, and \nI am hopeful we can work together in this body with a new course in \nIraq, working with the White House. Clearly, this is a job for the \nCommander in Chief. He has expressed a willingness to work with this \nbipartisan Iraq Study Group and work with Democrats and Republicans in \nthe Congress to achieve victory in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S11272]]\n\n  I hope Robert Gates' confirmation, his manner and temperament, one \nthat earned him the support of a unanimous vote on the Armed Services \nCommittee, will serve him well as he works on behalf of the President \nand the executive branch to deal with what is certainly the most \nsignificant challenge of our time.\n  I do want to, however, point out a couple of items in the bipartisan \nIraq Study Group report because, obviously, there is a lot of public \ninterest in it. This volume is 142 pages, and not many people have read \nevery single page in it. So we have a number of people highlighting \ndifferent portions of this 142-page document, perhaps a point they want \nto emphasize. I have a couple of points I want to emphasize because I \nthink they are entirely consistent with what Dr. Gates has said during \nhis confirmation hearing, and these points should be made clear.\n  On page 66 of the Iraq Study Group report--sometimes called the \nBaker-Hamilton commission report--the study group says this:\n\n       The presence of U.S. forces in Iraq is a key topic of \n     interest in a national reconciliation dialog.\n\n  And this is the point I want to emphasize. They go on to say:\n\n       The point is not for the United States to set timetables or \n     deadlines for withdrawal, an approach that we oppose . . .\n\n  I think it is important to make the point that the Baker-Hamilton \nstudy group, the Iraq Study Group, opposes timetables or deadlines for \nwithdrawal.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The point is for the United States and Iraq to make clear \n     their shared interest in the orderly departure of U.S. \n     forces. As Iraqi forces take on the security mission, a \n     successful national reconciliation dialog will advance that \n     departure date.\n\n  I think what the Baker-Hamilton commission is saying is that \nwithdrawals ought not to be based upon an arbitrary timetable, in \neffect, based on domestic political considerations but, rather, ought \nto be based upon security considerations--how can we best provide for \nthe Iraqi people to be able to stand on their own to defend themselves \nand to allow the political process in Iraq to go forward where people \ncan trade ballots and votes for bombs and bullets.\n  One other point I wish to raise. I am glad to see the Senator from \nSouth Carolina on the floor because there is a point that I know he \nagrees with and certainly one I think Senator McCain and others have \nadvocated which I happen to believe is an option the President ought to \nconsider at the top of his list in terms of the course forward in Iraq.\n  We have heard the study by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nGeneral Pace, at the Pentagon summarized into three options. I believe \nthis was done by a newspaper or perhaps within the Pentagon itself. \nThey summarized for the course forward to go big, go long, or go home.\n  Clearly, one can tell from my comments that I believe we all want our \ntroops to come home. We are unified and of a single mind on that point. \nThe question is, based on what criteria? Is it based on politics in the \nCongress or is it based on security, our long-term security, not just \nthe Iraqis' but our security at home, lest Iraq become a failed state \nand a launching pad for future terrorist attacks.\n  The alternative ``go long,'' I believe, was explained as reducing the \nsize of our forces in Iraq but basically making a multiyear commitment, \na long-term commitment to have our troops there; frankly, an \nalternative that I don't think holds out much hope for success.\n  The American people are clearly anxious to see the situation in Iraq \nbe stabilized, to see some improvement, and I think that brings us to \nthe last choice that has been mentioned as a result of these Pentagon \ndiscussions: Go big. Let me explain what I mean.\n  I mean we need to surge American troops into the capital city of \nBaghdad for a temporary period of time--not a long-term or open-ended \nengagement--to provide the ability to back up the Iraqis to do what we \nneed to do to clear, to hold, and then to build on that effort in \nBaghdad, to demonstrate not only that we can provide the security \nbacking up the Iraqi forces, but also to create the basic security \nconditions that are necessary for the Iraqis to have that national \nreconciliation process to work out their differences the best they can, \nand then to provide for their own defense so we can bring our troops \nhome.\n  But I want to make sure--because this is an important point--some, I \nbelieve, have represented this Iraq Study Group Report as an \nendorsement of a withdrawal of troops not based on security conditions, \nand I say this report does not endorse that approach, as I indicated.\n  With regard to the surging of troops in Baghdad on a temporary basis, \nas advocated by the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from \nArizona, and one that I find is the only really viable alternative we \nhave in Iraq, the Iraq Study Group says this on page 73:\n\n       We could, however, support a short-term redeployment or \n     surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad or to \n     speed up the training and equipping mission if the U.S. \n     commander in Iraq determines that such steps would be \n     effective.\n\n  My hope is the President of the United States, the Commander in \nChief, having this worthwhile report which makes clear that every \noption has been looked at without regard to ideology or partisan \npolitics, that the report of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nconsulting with the leadership at the Pentagon, together with even \nSecretary Rumsfeld's memo that was recently printed, a classified memo \nof all the alternatives that was recently printed in the newspaper, \nthat the President has all of these various options available to him to \ngo forward in Iraq.\n  I think Secretary-to-be Gates was correct yesterday when he said \nthere are not any secret options. Basically, we know what the choices \nare with this report and the other reports that have come out. Simply \nstated, there is going to be a time for choosing. That choice and the \nconsequences of that choice are very important because, clearly, what \nwe are doing now is not working in Iraq and, clearly, there are dangers \nin terms of terrorist activity, in terms of Iranian ambitions, a \ncountry that is attempting to build, in defiance of the civilized \nworld, a nuclear weapon.\n  There are tremendous risks and consequences of not getting this done \nright, and the American people deserve to know not only what the risk \nis, what the threat is, and the consequences of failing to live up to \nthis challenge, but that we are doing everything we can in a bipartisan \nfashion as a nation, looking to the best minds and the best experience \nthis Nation has to offer, to come up with a plan or an assortment of \nchoices and then to give the President the opportunity to make the very \nbest decision he can as Commander in Chief, a position conferred upon \nhim by the Constitution, to lead this course change in Iraq so we do \nnot have a failed state which would further endanger not only that \nregion, but would endanger us at home.\n  In conclusion, those who think America can simply pull the covers \nover its head and the problem will go away or they simply think we can \nwithdraw our troops--even in a precipitous fashion--and there will be \nno consequence to it, I cite the comments of GEN John Abizaid, the head \nof Central Command, who acknowledged that, yes, we could bring our \ntroops home before security is established in Iraq, but the enemy would \nfollow us here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak on an unrelated subject for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And that the distinguished Senator from South Carolina \nbe the Senator who follows.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Energy Security\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, just last week the price of natural gas \nwas at $7.79 per million Btu's. That is nearly double the price it was \n2 months ago. In October, natural gas was selling for $4.01 on the spot \nmarket. This kind of price instability it brings harms consumers, harms \nbusinesses, is devastating to manufacturers, and is a threat to our \neconomy.\n  On August 1, 71 Senators in this Chamber cast what I consider one of \nthe most important bipartisan votes of the year. We voted for the Gulf \nof Mexico Energy Security Act, a bill that will open 8.3 million acres \nin the Gulf\n\n[[Page S11273]]\n\nof Mexico for oil and gas exploration. The exploration could bring an \nestimated 1.26 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas to market over the next several years.\n  That oil and that gas will be American. It will be extracted from \nAmerican territorial waters, will be extracted by American companies \nand American workers, and will be on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico \nand will also share the royalties with the adjoining States, which has \nnot been done before, sharing in a different way where they get much \nmore of the proceeds.\n  That is a precedent which we have never accomplished before and which \nwill do us good as we look around our other States to see if we can't \ndo more like this effort.\n  The support for this bill came from my colleagues from the Northwest, \nthe Southeast, and the Southwest, from the Northeast and the Midwest, \nfrom both coasts, from areas in between, and from both parties. We all \nacted to stem the rising tide of energy prices--something good for our \ncountry.\n  Those who voted for it and helped us with it know that the prices \ncontinue to rise for natural gas in our homes and our businesses, and \nwe are awaiting the passage of this bill to stabilize prices for the \nnext few years as this fountain full of natural gas descends upon the \nUnited States as a result of this new proposal and proposition in the \nGulf of Mexico between our sovereign States and the U.S. Government to \nproceed with drilling. We cast that vote for families worried about \nhigh costs of energy. We cast that vote for American businesses, large \nand small, which have been hit hard by rising energy costs. We cast \nthat vote for manufacturers who have been forced to shut down hundreds \nof U.S. plants in the last several years and for millions of American \nworkers who lost their jobs when their plants closed. We heard the \nstories of all of these in our Energy Committee as we proceeded on this \nbill.\n  Occupying the chair is the distinguished new Senator from Florida. He \nremembers this testimony and these facts, and he anxiously waits, as I \ndo as chairman and he as an active Member, for the House to take up \nthis bill and pass it. They have a few alternatives. They can lose the \nbill and drop it and let it become dead; yes, indeed. But that seems to \nme to be the worst option of all. They also can pass it just like we \nsent it to them, and they will have a completed bill, and nothing \nfurther. They can affix it to any bill they choose to pass over there--\nthe tax extenders--and send it to us, and, of course, if that is the \ncase, we will have to do further work on it as it gets here. But that \nwill be the rule as it applies to a bill which is not exactly the same \nas the one we sent them.\n  So we cast our votes, as I said, in the manner I have described.\n  Natural gas prices climbed 400 percent from 2002 to 2005. In that \ntime, the chemical manufacturing industry alone closed 70 plants in \nthese United States and plans to close 40 more, largely because of \nskyrocketing prices of natural gas. We joined together, Republicans and \nDemocrats, to tackle that problem, and we passed, by strong bipartisan \nvote, a bill that is as important a step toward tackling our energy \nchallenges as we have around us anywhere in either body, a small but \nmeaningful step toward reducing our reliance upon foreign oil.\n  This week I hope, and I am confident, that the House will take up our \nbill. I anticipate equally strong bipartisan support from the House. \nThis legislation is critically important for our consumers and our \neconomy, for housewives and homes, and as we go down the line, we know \nnatural gas is the life of America, and we will add a very significant \ninventory to America's large inventory, and it will be American, it \nwill not be imported.\n  The legislation is critically important. The oil resources in this \nregion are impressive, but vast reserves of natural gas are the real \nbonanza. We believe there is natural gas in lease sale 181 and lease \nsale 181 south to heat 6 million homes for 15 years--6 million homes \nfor 15 years. Largely because of these gas services, the Wall Street \nJournal has called this bill an ``easy victory'' for the U.S. economy. \nOn the other side of the political spectrum, the New York Times wrote: \n``This bill meets an immediate need and is a reason to drill in the \ngulf.'' How can you get more than those two ends of the spectrum \nagreeing and 71 Senators from both sides of the aisle voting for it?\n  Now I cry out today to the House: Don't go out of session without \npassing the bill I have just described to you which awaits action from \nyou. It is simple action: just an ``aye'' vote for a simple majority, \nand that is it. It will be done. This rather gigantic resource will \nthen become available. It is in America, sitting there waiting for \nsomebody to use it. It will be usable with that vote.\n  As I just told my colleagues, for purposes of an explanation and \nelaboration, 6 million homes--6 million homes--will have their gas for \ntheir full season for 15 years just from what we are going to do there. \nWhat an astounding achievement if we will just complete the work by \nhaving a vote in the House.\n  I was saddened to read that we continue to lose businesses because \nnatural gas prices are too high. The National Association of \nManufacturers estimates that 3.1 million high-wage manufacturing jobs \nhave been lost since 2000, largely due to inadequate supplies of \nnatural gas. This week, the House can join us in doing something about \nthat, and I urge they do whichever they see as the best way to pass it. \nIf they think it is best to do it freestanding and send it to us as we \nsent it to them, I wish them the best. If they choose to put it on the \ntax bill, I hope it will not just make it more difficult and cause the \nbill to be lost in the transit to the Senate, which appears simple but \nbecomes cumbersome, at least once it hits the House and hits the \nSenate. It is nice and easy just coming over as it is walked over, but \nit is very cumbersome once it gets here. That is what would happen. It \nwould then be discussed and perhaps debated, and it would have to have \na vote. That is the second approach and far less desirable.\n  But the House can see the writing on the wall--do it now or perhaps \nnever do it. What a shame. Do it now and you get the benefits I have \nindicated or, believe it or not, it could be that you won't get it \never. That is just not a good way to leave for this Christmas, as I see \nit, and I hope it isn't.\n  I thank the Senate for permitting me to speak today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to echo what the Senator from New \nMexico said. He has a very good idea, and I hope the House will act on \nhis recommendations.\n  Very briefly, I rise in support of the nomination of Dr. Bob Gates \nfor Secretary of Defense. I believe he is the right guy at the right \ntime. He has the background to be successful. I know this body will \noverwhelmingly confirm him. I wish him well in his very difficult but \nimportant task that lies ahead for the country and particularly for Dr. \nGates.\n  Very briefly, here is what I expect from Dr. Gates and really \neveryone involved in the war on terror: a winning strategy. He said at \nthe hearing in one of the answers to one of the questions I posed to \nhim that he believed the war in Iraq was one of the central \nbattlefronts of the war on terror. If you believe that, as he does and \nI do and the President stated, then you have to throw everything you \nhave at winning because the outcome in Iraq really will affect the \noutcome of the war on terror. If you believe that, you fight it to win. \nHe also said something I thought was equally true and very candid: We \nare not winning. Our military has won every battle, but the extremists \nare trumping the moderates, and extremism is winning out over \nmoderation in Iraq because we don't have enough security in place to \nallow moderation to flourish.\n  My question to the country is, If we all agree we are not winning, \ncan we all agree that we must not lose? I hope the country will rally \naround the concept that losing in Iraq will be devastating to our \nefforts in the war on terror. It will be devastating to forces of \nmoderation in the region. It will empower extremists, religious \nextremists, al-Qaida, and others who have as their goal to topple all \nforms of moderation in the Middle East, to drive us out of the region--\nnot just Iraq--and one day\n\n[[Page S11274]]\n\ndestroy the State of Israel. If you believe it is the central backbone \nof the war on terror, I hope we can come together as a people in this \ncountry to make sure we have the resources on the ground to win.\n  Dr. Gates said that we did not have enough troops after the fall of \nBaghdad to bring about security. I think everybody believes that now. \nIf General Shinseki was right and we needed 200,000 to pacify the \ncountry and secure the country after the fall of Baghdad, what has \nhappened in the intervening months and years to require less troops? \nNothing. It is far worse today in Baghdad than it was a year ago when I \nlast visited. I was there on election day in December. People were \nwalking around voting, very happy, very upbeat. Now people are afraid \nto go outside, and their children are under attack when they go out for \nthe most simple things.\n  So I do hope that not only will he take over this job and start over \nwith the Congress and the American people, that he will commit himself \nto winning this war, and the way to win, in my opinion, is to provide \nsecurity so the political process can be successful. No Prime Minister, \nno historical figure or great politicians of the past could bring about \na democracy in Iraq with this level of violence. It is chicken-and-egg \nstuff to me. You cannot have a political solution until you control the \nviolence. When you have a high-crime neighborhood, you don't send in \nless police, you send in more. Our mistakes in the past have come back \nto haunt us. We have never had enough troops. The situation on the \nground has gotten out of control. I do believe we can control it with a \nsurge of American troops.\n  The goal is to come home, but the goal is victory. History will judge \nus not by when we left but what we left behind. The consequences of \nwinning or losing in Iraq are central in the war on terror, and we have \nno other option, in my opinion, other than to win. The way to win over \nextremists is you stand boldly with moderates, and the way you win \nagainst people who could care less about humanity is to embrace the \nbetter parts of humanity and show the people who are trying to drive us \nout of Iraq that their agenda will lose to a better agenda, that their \nidea is second to ours.\n  People in the Mideast are dying for their freedom. People in Iraq are \ndying for their freedom. If you become a judge in Iraq, they try to \nkill your family. If you are a politician in Iraq, they don't say bad \nthings about you, they try to kill your family. Let's stand with the \nmoderate forces in Iraq. Let's make sure we win this war which is \ncentral to the war on terror, and the only way I know to win a war is \nto fight it with overwhelming force.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to correct my vote on rollcall \n271, the motion to waive the Congressional Budget Act point of order on \nSenate amendment No. 5205.\n  I am recorded as ``yea'' to waive the Budget Act point of order. It \nwas my intent to uphold the point of order. Therefore, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the record be changed so I will be recorded as voting \nagainst the motion to waive the budget point of order. The record \nshould reflect my vote as ``nay'' on amendment No. 5205. It would not \nchange the outcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon first of all for \nthe purpose of agreeing with my colleague from South Carolina and \npreviously my colleague from Texas, both distinguish Senators who spoke \nin favor of the nomination of Dr. Gates to be our next Secretary of \nDefense.\n  I intend to support his nomination. I believe he has served our \ncountry well in the past, and we are fortunate that he is willing to \nstep into a difficult position at a very difficult time in our history. \nI intend to support him. I commend the Armed Services Committee for \ntheir show of unity and bipartisanship in unanimously supporting his \nnomination. I hope there will be a strong vote in support of Dr. Gates \nas he heads into this very difficult assignment.\n  I think it is important we note today two other things--one, the need \nfor us to look at this problem in Iraq with a sense of bipartisanship, \nwith a sense of unity as Americans, putting aside the stripes we \nusually wear as Democrats and Republicans and looking at this problem \nas Americans concerned about a difficult problem, one that has taxed us \nbut one in which we must succeed.\n  Today the President received the report of the Iraq study commission, \na group of distinguished Americans who came together to give us \nrecommendations. I commend the President for not only accepting their \nreport but also highlighting how clear he was and the seriousness that \nwill be given to the recommendations it makes.\n  Lastly, I wish to also take a moment to commend and thank Secretary \nRumsfeld for his service to our Nation. I had the pleasure of meeting \nSecretary Rumsfeld when I was very inexperienced in the ways of \nWashington, a person from Florida, and I came here to serve in the \nPresident's Cabinet. During the time of the transition into this \nadministration, I met Secretary Rumsfeld as we jointly prepared for our \nconfirmation hearings before the Senate and proceeded to our jobs in \nthe Cabinet. I came to know and appreciate this great American patriot, \na man of incredible intellect and talent but also incredibly dedicated \nto our Nation. I came to truly appreciate his leadership and his skill \nas he led the Department of Defense initially through the treacherous \nattacks of September 11 where he, with his bare hands, was helping to \ndig the injured from the rubble of the Pentagon as that building was \nattacked on that unforgettable morning of September 11, 2001. I saw him \nnext in our immediately following Cabinet meeting when the President \nasked all of us to try to pull ourselves together to help lead our \nNation at this very difficult moment. He, in a certain and clear way, \nshowed us a way forward and how our military would respond to the \nthreats to our Nation--first of all, to secure the Capitol and New York \nCity but then in a very clear and direct way on how to respond to those \nwho had plotted these attacks in Afghanistan.\n\n  He led our country into a very successful and very clear and decisive \nvictory in Afghanistan and then prepared our country and led us into \nthe war in Iraq with a very difficult and still uncertain outcome.\n  In all of the debate and discussions that have ensued over the last \nseveral months about this difficult struggle in which we find ourselves \ntoday, I think too often we have been guided by the usual bickering and \npartisan politics, but not often enough do we stop to recognize a \ndedicated American who has served our Nation well. I am proud to call \nSecretary Rumsfeld my friend. But I am equally proud to say today that \nhe has served our Nation with great distinction, that our Nation owes \nhim a great debt of thanks and to his family as well, to his wife Joyce \nand to his children for the sacrifice that all of them have made so \nSecretary Rumsfeld could serve our Nation once again. At a certain age \nwhen many of us might be looking forward to retirement, he came to \nWashington once again to serve in a very difficult job and has done it \nwith great distinction.\n  I thank Secretary Rumsfeld on behalf of Floridians, and I think a \ngrateful nation as well, and the men and women in uniform he has led \nwho I know thought so much of his leadership. I know he has given so \nmuch of himself to the transformation of our military to prepare us for \nthe future. I, for one, rise today with a voice of thanks to a great \nAmerican for his service.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S11275]]\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \nconfirmation of Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense. When I looked at \nthe testimony that was offered by Robert Gates yesterday in front of \nthe Armed Services Committee, I was impressed by the qualities that he \nwas proposing to bring to the job. I want to speak to some of those \nqualities this afternoon before we get to a confirmation vote on his \nnomination to be the next Secretary of Defense.\n  First, I was impressed with his candor. I think his sense of what is \nhappening in Iraq and his grasp of the facts, being straightforward \nwith the committee and straightforward with the Senate in terms of how \nhe views the picture of Iraq, is refreshing. I think what it tells all \nof us is that Dr. Gates will bring in the fresh eyes we need to have on \nthe problem in Iraq so we can hopefully develop a new direction that is \none that will work for our country. So I appreciate the candor with \nwhich he spoke yesterday in the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Second, I was also impressed with Dr. Gates and his openness with \nregard to considering all options in respect to questions that were \nasked of him by members of the committee. What he said, in effect, was \nthat all options are on the table. He did not simply say that he had a \nspecific course of action or that we were going to stay the course, but \nhe said that everything needed to be examined. I think that is a \nrefreshing attitude about this major problem in the Middle East that we \nhave and we share as Americans today.\n  Third, I was impressed also by the quality of collaboration he talked \nabout. I think in his statement to the committee, as he talked about \nworking with all agencies and working with the Members of Congress, he \nwas saying that this is an issue in Iraq that really is a problem that \nbelongs to all of America. How we move forward with the issue of Iraq \nis something that is going to require all of us working together to be \nsuccessful in Iraq. In so doing, I think he was making a statement that \nthis is not just a Republican issue; it is not a Democratic issue; it \nis an American issue and we need to find a strategy and a direction for \nus to be successful.\n  I believe when you look at what has happened in the last 4, 5, or 6 \nweeks in America, what we see is a growing momentum for a new direction \nin Iraq. I think that new direction is set forth with a lot of things \nthat are happening, developing a method that will hopefully bring this \ncountry together as we look for solutions. But let me say the Iraq \nStudy Group in its own study, which I know is being heralded around the \ncountry today, starts out with a very candid assessment of what is \nhappening in Iraq today and is set forth in the first paragraph of the \nIraq Study Group Report. It says:\n\n       The situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating. There is \n     no path that can guarantee success but the prospects can be \n     improved.\n\n  When this study group says that the situation in Iraq is grave and \ndeteriorating, there is a sense of candor with respect to what is \nhappening on the ground in Iraq.\n  I had the honor and privilege of visiting Iraq with my friend from \nVirginia, Senator Warner, for whom I have tremendous respect, and \nSenator Levin from Michigan for whom I also have tremendous respect, \nand that was in March of this last year.\n  I remember my conversations with my good friend from Virginia when he \ntalked about how things changed in Iraq from the first time he had \nvisited Baghdad to the time we were there in March. The fact is things \nhave gotten worse with respect to the violence we saw on the ground. \nHow we move forward is a very important challenge that we face in \nAmerica.\n  I strongly believe we need to move forward in a bipartisan manner in \ndeveloping new directions for our country with respect to Iraq. I \nbelieve we need to succeed in Iraq. I believe that getting the regional \ninterests involved in helping us formulate a solution is very important \nand we need to continue to send a message to the Iraqi people and the \nIraqi Government that they first and foremost have the responsibility \nto bring about the security that will allow their Government to \nfunction and the people of Iraq to have peace and stability, which is \nsomething that is very essential.\n  I believe we have the people and the leadership here in this body of \nthe Senate to be able to chart that future bipartisan direction for the \nUnited States of America, not only in Iraq but in the Middle East. As \nwas appropriately pointed out by the Iraq study commission, this is an \nissue that goes beyond Iraq. It is an issue that involves the entire \nMiddle East and how we deal with this issue.\n  I will quote again another wonderful friend of mine, former President \nBill Clinton, when he says, ``The eggs have been broken and now we have \nto make an omelet out of it.'' Or Secretary Colin Powell, who made the \ncomment at one point in time that, ``We broke it, we bought it.''\n  We have a problem in Iraq and in the Middle East. In order for us to \nmeet the challenges that face us, it is going to take tremendous \nbipartisanship leadership from all of us here in this body. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues as we move forward on this \nagenda.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to our distinguished colleague from \nColorado that I had the privilege of being with the distinguished \nranking member, Senator Levin, Senator Biden, Senator Lugar, Senator \nLieberman--a group of us at the White House--Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Roberts, counseling with the President on these various issues. \nIt was an extraordinary meeting. I have had the privilege throughout my \n28 years in the Senate to be in that Cabinet Room many times, but this \nwas a very historic moment. The President listened very carefully to \nthe perspectives and views of Members of the Senate, and we had an \nequal number from the House of Representatives. I am encouraged for the \nfuture. I am looking forward to our President assessing all of the \noptions related to Iraq. I commended the Baker-Hamilton report during \nthe course of our meeting. We talked about his interim study. We talked \nabout the Pentagon input and the input of the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs. I am optimistic that our President is going to carefully \nconsider all options. But we must wait and see as he, under the \nConstitution, has to make that final decision with regard to such \nchanges that we may have in our policy.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nPennsylvania is allotted 20 minutes. We will have to either revise that \nprevious agreement or take time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have to say that I think, colleagues, we \nmust maintain the 5 o'clock voting time. A lot of Senators rearranged \ntheir schedule. I was unaware because I happened to be away from the \nfloor.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the courtesy of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to express my \nsupport for the nomination of Robert Gates to be Secretary of Defense \nand to use this occasion to comment about the proposed changes in \npolicy of the United States in the conduct of the war in Iraq.\n  When Robert Gates was nominated to be Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency in 1987 and I was serving on the Intelligence \nCommittee at that time, concerns were expressed, including mine, that \nMr. Gates had not been forthright in the preparation of the testimony \nof then-CIA Director Casey in disclosures about what happened in the \nIran-Contra affair. Mr. Gates withdrew as a nominee for CIA Director at \nthat time. However, he was again nominated in 1991 by President George \nH.W. Bush, and at that time I supported his nomination, thinking that \nwhatever mistakes Mr. Gates had made in the past, he had learned from \nthose mistakes.\n  President George W. Bush has now nominated Robert Gates to be \nSecretary of Defense. I believe he is well qualified to undertake this \nposition. He has testified before the Armed Services Committee that he \ndoes not intend to be a bump on a log, has asserted his\n\n[[Page S11276]]\n\nindependence, told me in a meeting which we had last week on November \n30th that he would bring a fresh pair of eyes to the situation and \nwould be open to change. There is no doubt that change is in the wind, \nconsidering the memorandum which has surfaced, written by Secretary of \nDefense Donald Rumsfeld the day before the election, and from comments \nmade by National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley, and comments made by \nthe President himself. It is my view that had we known Saddam Hussein \ndid not have weapons of mass destruction, we would not have gone into \nIraq. Once we had made the decision to go into Iraq, I think it not \nadvisable to withdraw and leave Iraq in a condition of instability. But \nthe situation there cannot go on forever, interminably, without some \nlimitation and without change of policy because, as Robert Gates put \nit, we are not winning there and the situation is not improving there. \nSo there has to be some change. Precisely what that change should be is \na matter yet to be resolved, and yet to be considered. But a long list \nof alternatives has been proposed in a number of quarters.\n\n  Today, the commission, led jointly by James Baker and Lee Hamilton, \nhas issued a report calling for some very fundamental changes. The \nRumsfeld memorandum outlines a number of alternatives.\n  One of the important recommendations which was made by the Baker-\nHamilton commission is that there has to be involvement by other \nnations in the region, especially Saudi Arabia, with all of its wealth, \nmaintaining a hands-off position, and they ought to be helping to \nresolve the problems there. The Baker-Hamilton commission has further \nrecommended that the United States engage in negotiations with both \nIran and Syria perhaps on a multilateral basis.\n  My own view, which I expressed in an extended floor statement last \nJune, is that the United States ought to negotiate directly with Iran. \nI also believe we ought to negotiate directly with Syria. In my June \nstatement I also broadened to consideration of direct negotiations with \nNorth Korea. As I said at that time and reiterate, as has been pointed \nout, we need to keep our friends close and our enemies closer; that if \nwe would undertake a dialog showing respect, showing courtesy to our \nopponents--we do not have to agree with them--I think that diplomacy \nand dialog have an excellent opportunity to lead to a solution; and, \ncertainly as a matter of first impression, it ought to be what is \nundertaken.\n  It is my hope the President will move in the direction cited by the \nBaker-Hamilton commission and will go even further and engage in direct \nnegotiations with Iran, Syria, and North Korea.\n  In October, I publicly urged that changes should be made promptly and \nnot wait until after the election because we were sustaining so many \ncasualties on an ongoing basis.\n  On October 22, during an interview with CNN, I was asked how much \ntime does the Iraqi Prime Minister have to get tough to deal with the \ndeath squads and the militias before the United States has to reassess \nits strategy. I replied that I would say the time is already past.\n  I was encouraged by a lead story in the New York Times that day that \nthe administration was considering some timetables. President Bush said \nin his Saturday address the day before that he was prepared to be \nflexible to make adjustments, if necessary, to be victorious. I said \nthen that I don't believe a shift in tactics ought to wait until after \nthe election; that there are too many casualties; and that if we had a \nbetter course, we should adopt it sooner rather than later.\n  When Senator Warner came back from a trip to Iraq several weeks \nbefore the election and was quoted to the effect that things were going \nsideways, I called him and suggested to Senator Warner and to other of \nmy colleagues that it might be useful and appropriate to have a joint \nstatement to the President as to the views that we got from our travels \nto our States and from our travels generally. It was apparent to me \nweeks before the election--really months before the election--that \nthere was an ongoing descending pattern in which the American people \nwere not in support of United States policy in conducting the war in \nIraq. And the public opinion polls cited in my formal statement, which \nI will introduce into the Record, have shown that. The attitude of the \ntroops in the field--again the specifics of my formal statement had \nshown that. It was my view that the will of the American people would \nbe expressed at the election, and in no uncertain terms repudiating \nwhat the United States was doing in Iraq. And, of course, that did \nprove to be the case.\n  I had been concerned back in 2002 before the vote was taken on the \nresolution for the use of force as to what the United States was \nprepared to do once Saddam Hussein was toppled. What were the specifics \non the evidence of weapons of mass destruction; what will be the costs \nin terms of casualties; and what will happen? I was speaking in 2002 \nabout the conflicts among the Sunnis, the Shiites, and the Kurds.\n  Now we have a situation where it is up to the President to make the \ndecision as to what will be done specifically; and that is his role as \nCommander in Chief. But the Congress also has a very definite, a very \nprecise, and a very important role as we undertake the appropriations \nprocess.\n  From time to time there are comments by Members on a wide variety of \nsubjects that funding should be cut off from executive operations in \norder to carry out Congress' will. That is done in the appropriations \nbill. When a Secretary of a given department is about to undertake \nsomething which the Members of Congress do not like, we provide that no \nfunds appropriated in the bill shall be used to carry out a specific \nfunction. There has been a suggestion that funding ought to be cut off \nfor the activities in Iraq. Certainly we would not cut off funding to \nleave our troops in harm's way, without adequate resources to carry out \ntheir mission. However, there may develop a congressional consensus \nwhich would reflect the will of the American people that there needs to \nbe something done in Iraq, perhaps even staged withdrawals. Cutting \ndown funding in stages to effectuate such staged withdrawals could \naccomplish congressional objectives and not leave our troops exposed, \nwith sufficient planning in advance.\n\n  In light of the public opposition to the way we are conducting the \nwar in Iraq, and very significant agreement among Members with that \ndemonstrated public response, there remains the possibility that \nCongress could act with respect to the appropriations function to \neffectuate changes. That is certainly a course which I would not like \nto see happen.\n  It would be vastly preferable if, as a result of what has happened, \nincluding the Baker-Hamilton commission report and what Secretary \nRumsfeld has said and the new approach of Secretary-to-be Gates--I \nthink he will be confirmed later this afternoon--that the President \nwill make a sufficient change in policy which will lead us in a better \npath.\n  Certainly the continued presence of U.S. troops in Iraq has two major \nproblems--at least two major problems. First, it incites the insurgents \nto attack U.S. troops; second, it allows the Iraqis to continue to rely \nupon the United States to provide a defense and to provide military \nprotection. They do not have the motivation to increase their police \nforce and their military to handle the jobs themselves. The public \nopinion polls cited in my prepared statement are shocking in that the \npeople in Iraq approve of the attacks against U.S. soldiers. We are in \na very uncomfortable position.\n  In essence we may be on a watershed mark today with the confirmation \nof Robert Gates to be Secretary of Defense on a day when the Baker-\nHamilton report has been filed which makes recommendations for changes. \nUltimately, the President will have to make the decision.\n  We debated earlier this year proposals to have a withdrawal by stages \nin 2007 without a specification as to what there would be. We had a \nvote on withdrawal by July of 2007 which was decisively defeated, \ngetting only 13 votes. The temper of the country is such that there is \nwidespread public opposition to what is being done by the United States \nby way of military action in Iraq today. We learned the bitter \nexperience of the Vietnam war, that we cannot conduct a war which is \nunpopular with the American people, which the American people reject.\n\n[[Page S11277]]\n\n  In voting to confirm Mr. Gates, we will see the possibilities of a \nnew chapter. But it is up to the President, it is up to the Commander \nin Chief to structure a change in policy which will ultimately take our \ntroops out of harm's way, which will be done in a way consistent with \nmaintaining stability in Iraq to the maximum extent possible to set the \nstage for Iraq to continue to develop its incipient democracy and, as \nper the Baker commission report, perhaps embed troops with the Iraqi \nmilitary and the Iraqi police so they can undertake their own defense. \nBut that will require the change in policy with all of the options \nhaving been presented by the variety of sources which I have cited.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my prepared statement \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nPrepared Statement of Senator Arlen Specter on the Nomination of Robert \n        Gates to be Secretary of Defense and U.S. Policy in Iraq\n\n       Mr. President. I seek recognition to speak about the \n     nomination of Robert Gates to be the 22nd Secretary of \n     Defense and our policy as it pertains to Iraq.\n       Robert Gates was first nominated to lead the Central \n     Intelligence Agency in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan. At \n     that time, I, along with many of my colleagues, held \n     reservations about his nomination. Specifically, I was \n     concerned about his role as Deputy Director of the CIA in \n     helping to prepare former CIA Director William J. Casey for \n     testimony before the Congress in which he failed to disclose \n     the full details of the Iran-Contra Affair. I was also \n     concerned about Gates' failure to recognize the possible \n     impropriety of diverting funds from Iranian arms sales to the \n     Contras. Reservations expressed by other members of the \n     Senate and myself reportedly led to the withdrawal of his \n     nomination.\n       In 1991, when Gates was nominated by President George H.W. \n     Bush to lead the CIA, I supported his confirmation. In \n     explaining my support for Gates on the Senate floor, I \n     stated, ``To the extent that Mr. Gates has made mistakes, it \n     is my conclusion that he has learned from them. I believe \n     that as a matter of his personal qualifications he is an \n     astute, experienced intelligence officer'' and that ``Mr. \n     Gates is ready, willing and able to work with the Congress, \n     allowing the Congress its appropriate oversight capacity.'' \n     The majority of Senators at that time came to similar \n     conclusions, resulting in his confirmation by the Senate. He \n     served admirably as Director of the CIA for fourteen months \n     and is the only career officer in the agency's history to \n     rise from entry-level employee to Director. As was reported \n     in a December 4, 2006 article in the Washington Post, ``even \n     his critics describe it as a reasonably successful, \n     modernizing tenure.''\n       At a time when our country is engaged in a world wide war \n     against terror and is searching for answers on how to deal \n     with the simmering civil war in Iraq, President George W. \n     Bush has nominated Gates to replace Donald Rumsfeld as \n     Secretary of Defense. During his confirmation hearing, Gates \n     offered refreshing testimony, stressing he would ``listen \n     closely'' to various sources of advice, form his ``own \n     conclusions'', ``speak candidly'' about what needs to be done \n     in Iraq and that he is not returning to service to ``be a \n     bump on the log.''\n       After meeting recently with Robert Gates, I believe he \n     will, as he told me in our meeting on November 30, 2006, \n     bring a fresh set of eyes to the Department of Defense and to \n     U.S. policy towards Iraq. My meeting, in conjunction with my \n     review of his testimony before the Armed Services Committee, \n     has led me to conclude Robert Gates can provide competent \n     leadership at the Pentagon at this critical juncture in our \n     nation's history.\n       The nomination of Robert Gates to head the Department of \n     Defense is an opportunity to chart a new course. His personal \n     relationships with Secretary Rice, a former subordinate, and \n     his three decade relationship with National Security Advisor \n     Stephen Hadley, will hopefully aid the transition and provide \n     a new dynamic in the Administration's national security team. \n     It is my hope that Gates will not only bring a fresh pair of \n     eyes to our policy in Iraq, but also to our dealings with \n     regional actors such as Syria and Iran.\n       In 2004, Gates co-chaired a task force of the Council on \n     Foreign Relations that concluded that ``it is in the \n     interests of the United States to engage selectively with \n     Iran to promote regional stability, dissuade Iran from \n     pursuing nuclear weapons, preserve reliable energy supplies, \n     reduce the threat of terror, and address the `democracy \n     deficit' that pervades the Middle East as a whole.'' In \n     response to a question submitted by the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee on Iran, Gates expressed his belief that ``no \n     option that could potentially benefit U.S. policy should be \n     off the table'' and noted that ``in the worst days of the \n     cold war the U.S. maintained a dialogue with the Soviet Union \n     and China.'' Most recently, during his testimony before the \n     Senate, he confirmed the position that ``our first option \n     should be diplomacy'' to deal with the problems Iran poses.\n       I have consistently urged the Administration to work with \n     Iraq's neighbors, including Iran and Syria, to develop \n     cooperative stabilization efforts. To that end, I have \n     personally met with Iran's Ambassador to the United Nations \n     and Syria's Ambassador to the United States in an attempt to \n     help facilitate such an effort. I have amplified my strong \n     belief that dialogue with nations such as Iran and Syria, \n     most recently in an essay ``Dialogue With Adversaries'' \n     published in the winter edition of The Washington Quarterly. \n     I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the record at \n     the conclusion of my remarks.\n       I have supported the Iraq Study Group, an independent, \n     bipartisan commission led by former Secretary of State James \n     Baker and former Congressman Lee Hamilton which was created \n     by Congress in order to deliver an assessment of the \n     situation in Iraq and recommend strategic options for the \n     future. I expressed my support and interest in the work of \n     group to CNN on October 22, 2006: ``Let's consider the \n     alternatives and what Jim Baker and Lee Hamilton and his \n     group are thinking about, sooner rather than later.''\n       The Iraq Study Group report, unveiled today, recommends \n     that, ``Given the ability of Iran and Syria to influence \n     events within Iraq and their interest in avoiding chaos in \n     Iraq, the United States should try to engage them \n     constructively.'' The report also notes that, ``The United \n     States cannot achieve its goals in the Middle East unless it \n     deals directly with the Arab-Israeli conflict and regional \n     instability. There must be a renewed and sustained commitment \n     by the United States to a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace on \n     all fronts: Lebanon, Syria, and President Bush's June 2002 \n     commitment to a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. \n     This commitment must include direct talks with, by, and \n     between Israel, Lebanon, Palestinians (those who accept \n     Israel's right to exist), and Syria.'' I am pleased that the \n     Iraq Study Group considered engaging in dialogue with \n     regional actors and I appreciate its recommendations on how \n     to move forward in Iraq.\n       Today, the Baker Commission concluded that ``stability in \n     Iraq remains elusive and the situation is deteriorating.'' \n     Yesterday, in testimony before the Armed Services Committee, \n     Gates candidly responded ``No, sir'' when asked if we were \n     winning in Iraq. One month ago to date, Secretary Rumsfeld \n     drafted a memorandum declaring ``it is time for a major \n     adjustment.'' All of these call for a change in U.S. policy.\n       A shift in policy in Iraq is overdue and I have long-\n     expressed openness to considering any and all suggestions for \n     a change in course. When Senator Warner returned from Iraq on \n     October 5, 2006, he made a public statement to the effect \n     that things were ``drifting sideways'' in Iraq. I called him \n     to express my view that I had found in my travels in \n     Pennsylvania and elsewhere that the people were totally \n     opposed to the way the United States was conducting the war \n     in Iraq.\n       I expressed my concern to Senator Warner that we were \n     heading for an election debacle in the face of public \n     opposition to the way we were handling the war in Iraq if \n     modifications were not promptly made. I consulted with a \n     number of my colleagues in the Senate about jointly advising \n     the President of such concerns. There was a consensus that we \n     not do so on a joint basis. I then had an extended telephone \n     conversation with Presidential adviser Karl Rove to express \n     my misgivings.\n       Later that month, I publicly urged that changes should be \n     made promptly and not wait until after the election because \n     we were sustaining so many casualties on an ongoing basis. On \n     October 22, 2006, during an interview with CNN, I was asked: \n     ``How much time does the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-\n     Maliki, have to get tough to deal with the death squads, the \n     militias, before the United States has to reassess its \n     strategy?'' I replied: ``I would say . . . that the time has \n     already passed. I was encouraged by a lead story in the New \n     York Times today that the Administration is considering some \n     timetables. President Bush said yesterday in his Saturday \n     address that he's going to be flexible and would make \n     adjustments if necessary to be victorious . . . We have James \n     Baker saying that there are alternatives besides staying the \n     course and cutting and running. I don't believe that a shift \n     in tactics ought to wait until after the election. There are \n     too many casualties there. If we have a better course, we \n     ought to adopt it sooner rather than later.''\n       I believe that had we known Saddam Hussein did not possess \n     weapons of mass destruction, the Congress would not have \n     authorized the invasion of Iraq. I told CNN on September 24, \n     2006, that, ``By hindsight, we operated on faulty \n     intelligence. And I think, had we known that Saddam Hussein \n     did not have weapons of mass destruction before the war was \n     started, I think the odds are very strong that it wouldn't \n     have been started.'' However, we entered that country and we \n     must to do everything in our power to not leave it in a \n     condition that will continue to precipitate violence.\n       Prior to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, I publicly stated my \n     concerns about the potential fallout from such action. On \n     February 13, 2002, I took to the Senate Floor to express my \n     belief that there should be a comprehensive analysis of the \n     threat posed by Saddam Hussein and what an invasion would \n     amount to in terms of U.S. casualties: ``We need to know, \n     with some greater precision, the threat posed by Saddam \n     Hussein with respect to weapons of mass destruction . . .\n\n[[Page S11278]]\n\n     There also has to be an analysis of what the costs would be, \n     some appraisal in terms of casualties . . . Then there is the \n     issue as to what happens after Saddam Hussein is toppled.''\n       Eight months later, on October 7, 2002, I returned to the \n     floor to again express my concerns: ``What happens after \n     Saddam Hussein is toppled has yet to be answered in real \n     detail.''\n       ``What was the extent of Saddam Hussein's control over \n     weapons of mass destruction? What would it cost by way of \n     casualties to topple Saddam Hussein? What would be the \n     consequence in Iraq? Who would govern after Saddam was \n     toppled? What would happen in the region, the impact on the \n     Arab world, and the impact on Israel?''\n       ``In previous briefings, I have sought the administration \n     plan as to what will be done after Saddam Hussein is toppled, \n     and I think that is an area where a great deal more thought \n     needs to be given. The situation in Iraq would obviously be \n     contentious, with disputes between the Sunnis and the \n     Shi'ites, with the interests of the Kurds in an independent \n     state, and it means a very long-term commitment by the United \n     States.''\n       Nonetheless, now that we are there, I feel we should give \n     the Iraqis an opportunity to solidify a democratic government \n     and do our best to establish the capabilities of Iraq's army \n     and police forces to provide adequate security. However, \n     continuing violence and instability have made it apparent \n     that Iraq is in a state of civil war and that the current \n     policies of the U.S. and Iraqi governments need to be \n     reassessed. I believe the recent resignation of Secretary of \n     Defense Donald Rumsfeld and decision by Iraqi Prime Minister \n     Nuri al- Maliki to speed transition of security \n     responsibilities to Iraqi forces signal that the \n     Administration and Iraqi government are ready to make \n     changes.\n       The United States cannot prosecute a war which does not \n     enjoy the support of the American public. The election \n     results and other evidence demonstrate that the American \n     people do not support the war in Iraq. Support has dwindled \n     with those serving on the front lines. According to a \n     February 28, 2006 Zogby poll, 62 percent of Americans believe \n     that things are going badly in Iraq. Furthermore, 72 percent \n     of troops serving in Iraq favor a pull out within the year. \n     How much longer can we continue to prosecute this war that \n     has become increasingly unpopular both with the American \n     public and our troops? As I warned my colleagues on the \n     Senate Floor on February 13, 2002: ``We have seen the bitter \n     lesson from Vietnam that we cannot prosecute a war without \n     the public support.''\n       There is a broad consensus that our policy in Iraq is not \n     producing the desired results. A change in course is mandated \n     not only because of the events on the ground but by the \n     collective voice of the American people who spoke out during \n     the November elections. The situation has reached a critical \n     mass as we have recently seen the National Security Advisor, \n     the Secretary of Defense and the President all recognizing a \n     change is needed and, furthermore, indicating change will be \n     forthcoming.\n       I commend President Bush's decision to ``look at new \n     ideas'' and ``broaden the aperture of the debate'' as \n     National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley stated on Meet the \n     Press on December 3, 2006. The following day, the President \n     stated that he is ``not satisfied with the pace of progress \n     in Iraq.''\n       Further evidence that change is needed came from the \n     Administration's point person and architect of U.S. action in \n     Iraq, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, in a November 6, \n     2006 memorandum: ``In my view it is time for a major \n     adjustment. Clearly, what U.S. forces are currently doing in \n     Iraq is not working well enough or fast enough.''\n       National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley confirmed that \n     U.S. policy needs retooling when he restated the President's \n     position, ``that what is going on in Iraq is not going well \n     enough or fast enough'' and that ``some of those changes are \n     going to be significant.''\n       Most importantly, the incoming Secretary of Defense, in \n     response to a question posed by Senator Levin, the incoming \n     Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``Are we \n     winning in Iraq?'' Robert Gates responded, ``No, sir.''\n       The Iraq Study Group Report states that the ``primary \n     mission of U.S. forces in Iraq should evolve to one of \n     supporting the Iraqi army, which would take over primary \n     responsibility for combat operations. By the first quarter of \n     2008, subject to unexpected developments in the security \n     situation on the ground, all combat brigades not necessary \n     for force protection could be out of Iraq.'' I support this \n     recommendation and I am pleased that President Bush, \n     according to his National Security Advisor, is ``looking \n     forward to the report'' and that he ``wants to listen to \n     Republicans and Democrats in Congress.'' I would respectfully \n     suggest that the President heed the work of the Iraq Study \n     Group and the opinions of Congress.\n       From time to time, there are comments by Members that we \n     should cut off funding for executive operations to carry out \n     Congress's will. Certainly, we would not cut off funding to \n     leave our troops in harm's way without adequate resources to \n     carry out their mission. However, there may develop a \n     Congressional consensus on staged withdrawals if the \n     President does not initiate such a plan himself. Cutting down \n     funding in stages to effectuate such staged withdrawals could \n     accomplish Congressional objectives and not leave our troops \n     exposed with sufficient planning in advance. In light of \n     public opposition to the way we are conducting the war in \n     Iraq and widespread agreement among Members with the public \n     response, there is a significant possibility that Congress \n     would act to curtail expenditures to effectuate staged \n     withdrawals.\n       During a April 27, 2005 Defense Appropriations Subcommittee \n     hearing, I expressed my concern over federal spending \n     priorities directly to Secretary Rumsfeld: ``There is a lot \n     of disquiet out there among the people as to what is \n     happening in Iraq and disquiet as to what is happening to our \n     discretionary budget. I chair a subcommittee which is \n     responsible for education and health care and worker safety, \n     and it's been cut by almost a full percent and with the \n     inflation factor, I'm about $7 billion short. And that makes \n     it very, very tough to sell when you have NIH and health-care \n     program and Pell grants and education.'' I reiterated my \n     concern in a May 19, 2005 letter to Sec. Rumsfeld: ``There is \n     considerable angst in my state, and I suspect generally in \n     the country, concerning the cost of our military operations \n     in Iraq, especially when compared to the cuts in domestic \n     discretionary spending.''\n       Giving the Iraq government a virtual blank check on our \n     staying there is counter-productive in at least two important \n     respects: First, it encourages the insurgents to violence \n     against our troops there and against other Iraqis. Second, it \n     encourages the Iraqis to continue reliance on our presence \n     there to defend their stability.\n       Our presence in Iraq incites violence which results in \n     increased U.S. and Iraqi deaths. On September 24, 2006, I \n     told CNN, ``that the war in Iraq has intensified Islamic \n     fundamentalism and radicalism . . . That's the focal point \n     for inspiring more radical Islamic fundamentalism.'' \n     According to the Department of Defense's Manpower Data \n     Center, 99 U.S. soldiers were killed in support of operations \n     in Iraq in October 2006. This represents the most U.S. \n     casualties in a month since November 2004.\n       Not only are U.S. troops being attacked on a regular basis, \n     but such action appears to be acceptable to the very populace \n     we are attempting to aid. According to a September 27, 2006 \n     USA Today article, ``About six in 10 Iraqis say they approve \n     of attacks on U.S.-led forces, and slightly more than that \n     want their government to ask U.S. troops to leave within a \n     year, a poll finds.'' Further, The Washington Post reported \n     that a survey conducted by the State Department revealed two-\n     thirds of Iraqis in Baghdad favor an immediate withdrawal of \n     U.S. forces.\n       According to the USA Today article, ``About 61 percent \n     approved of the attacks--up from 47 percent in January. A \n     solid majority of Shiite and Sunni Arabs approved of the \n     attacks, according to the poll.'' Furthermore, ``Three-\n     fourths say they think the U.S. plans to keep military bases \n     in Iraq permanently.'' A consolidation of bases, as suggested \n     by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, in conjunction with \n     an indication to begin removing U.S. forces from Iraq, would \n     aid in alleviating this concern and potentially reduce \n     attacks.\n       Our presence, with no indication of departure, has allowed \n     the Iraqis to rely too heavily on the U.S. for security and \n     has not spurned them to stand up an organic security \n     capability. The Administration has deemed the rapid creation \n     of an effective Iraqi fighting force as key to stabilizing \n     Iraq and expediting the eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces. \n     The rationale for this effort is that a well-trained, well-\n     equipped Iraqi army can be effective in quelling the \n     insurgency and can help smooth the process of restoring full \n     and real sovereignty to the Iraqi government.\n       According to the Congressional Research Service, forty \n     percent of total U.S. appropriations for reconstruction--\n     nearly $14 billion--are aimed at building Iraqi security \n     forces. Most of these funds--$10.5 billion--have been added \n     since September 2004, as the security situation remained \n     unstable and efforts to train forces appeared inadequate. \n     According to the State Department, in mid-October 2006, there \n     were 128,000 trained and equipped conventional Iraqi police \n     and 129,700 army forces. Officials have stated that 325,000 \n     security forces are needed to defeat the insurgency. In all, \n     about 312,400 security forces are currently defined as ready \n     for action.\n       However, various reports indicate that many fewer could be \n     said to be capable of the most demanding jobs. During the \n     past three years, poorly trained and equipped security \n     forces, no-shows and desertions, dismissals of police for \n     criminal behavior, bribe-taking for obtaining higher rank or \n     for release of insurgent suspects, and infiltration of police \n     and other units by sectarian militia groups have threatened \n     U.S. plans to increase security using Iraqi personnel.\n       I am optimistic that the Iraq Study Group's report will \n     usher in a new tone in the Iraq debate--one that will move \n     away from the extremes of ``cut and run'' versus ``stay the \n     course.'' I am hopeful that the convergence of this report \n     and a set of fresh eyes leading the Department of Defense \n     will produce an atmosphere allowing candid discussions on our \n     policy resulting in a pragmatic shift in our course.\n       Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld provided the impetus \n     for change. In his November 6, 2006 memorandum ``Iraq--\n     Illustrative New Courses of Action'' he suggests one option \n     for the President to consider is to ``Begin modest \n     withdrawals of U.S. and Coalition forces (start ``taking our \n     hand off the\n\n[[Page S11279]]\n\n     bicycle seat''), so Iraqis know they have to pull up their \n     socks, step up and take responsibility for their country.''\n       On October 22, 2006, I told CNN: ``The Unites Sates is \n     going to insist on a timetable from Iraq that we're not going \n     to be the guarantors forever . . . I like the report in the \n     [New York] Times . . . that the administration is considering \n     timetables to tell the Iraqis that they're going to have to \n     take a larger role in their own security, that they're going \n     to have to show some progress no sectarian violence, and \n     maybe even further consideration of the option of dividing \n     Iraq into three segments, Shiite, Sunni and Kurd, so these \n     warring factions will be less likely to kill each other''\n       The report issued by the Iraq Study Group states ``the \n     United States should significantly increase the number of \n     U.S. military personnel, including combat troops, imbedded in \n     and supporting Iraqi Army units. As these actions proceed, we \n     could begin to move combat forces out of Iraq. `` I concur \n     that a phased withdrawal of combat forces is the best course \n     of action at this juncture.\n       I am cognizant of what a premature departure may lead to in \n     Iraq. The Iraq Study Group concluded that, ``Because of the \n     importance of Iraq, the potential for catastrophe, and the \n     role and commitments of the United States in initiating \n     events that have led to the current situation, we believe it \n     would be wrong for the United States to abandon the country \n     through a precipitate withdrawal of troops and support.\n       In an interview with CNN on November 12, 2006, I concurred \n     by stating, ``We don't want to withdraw if we're going to \n     leave chaos. Troop withdrawals are definitely in the offing, \n     but it's a military decision to determine when there's \n     sufficient military force in the Iraqi army and in their \n     police to maintain stability.''\n       U.S. forces should not remain in Iraq any longer than \n     necessary. Iraqi government forces will ultimately be \n     responsible for securing their country. As ever increasing \n     numbers of Iraqi security forces are trained and able to \n     conduct operations on their own, U.S. forces should gradually \n     redeploy. According to NSA Stephen Hadley, Prime Minister \n     Maliki has said ``that his goal is to be able to take \n     responsibility of the security of his country middle of next \n     year.'' I would suggest that we hold Prime Minister Maliki to \n     his pledge and work to ensure that Iraqis are able to stand \n     up and provide security.\n       It is my hope that the President will respond to the strong \n     public reaction evidenced in the election results and \n     widespread opposition by Members of Congress to our current \n     military activities, the Baker Commission Report, the Gates \n     testimony and the Rumsfeld memorandum to change the direction \n     of our military efforts in Iraq. As Commander-in-chief under \n     the Constitution, the President has the options and \n     additional information to modify our military action in Iraq \n     to meet these concerns.\n       It is imperative that the United States change the course \n     in Iraq and I am optimistic that the confirmation of Robert \n     Gates will be the starting point for that action.\n       I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I further ask unanimous consent that an essay which \nChristopher Bradish and I published in the current issue of the \nWashington Quarterly which goes into some greater detail about my own \nviews as to the advisability of bilateral talks with Syria and Iran, as \nwell as North Korea, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Washington Quarterly, Winter 2006-07]\n\n                       Dialogue With adversaries\n\n              (By Arlen Specter with Christopher Bradish)\n\n       Facing serious dangers from nuclear weapons from Iran and \n     North Korea, the United States should be willing to negotiate \n     bilaterally with those two nations. Success in diffusing \n     these threats will require multilateral assistance from other \n     world powers, but our willingness to treat Iran and North \n     Korea with dignity and respect could go a long way in \n     disarming those nations militarily and diplomatically.\n       My Senate assignments on the Intelligence Committee and \n     Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations have \n     provided me the opportunity to meet with Syrian President \n     Hafiz al-Asad, Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat, Iraqi \n     President Saddam Hussein, Cuban President Fidel Castro, \n     Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, and others.\n       Those meetings have shown me that people are people, even \n     at the highest levels of government. They are interested in a \n     candid dialogue. They accept differences and disagreements as \n     long as the tone is courteous. Regrettably, the worldwide \n     ``ugly Americans'' reputation is encouraged, in my opinion, \n     by our unwillingness to at least meet and talk one on one \n     without preconditions.\n       Sun-tzu's advice to ``keep your friends close and your \n     enemies closer'' is a good admonition to keep in mind as we \n     approach our relationships in the world. Admittedly, it is \n     difficult to accord respect and dignity to countries such as \n     Iran and North Korea, whom we have branded as part of the \n     axis of evil. President Ronald Reagan invited Soviet leader \n     Leonid Brezhnev to a dialogue weeks after labeling the Soviet \n     Union the ``Evil Empire.'' It may not work, but it is \n     certainly worth a try when the stakes are so high and our \n     other strenuous efforts are not bearing fruit.\n       Perhaps irrelevant, my first assignment as assistant \n     district attorney in Philadelphia was interviewing inmates \n     for commutation of sentences to life imprisonment from death \n     in the electric chair for first-degree murder. That \n     experience taught me that you can have a meaningful dialogue \n     with anyone.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n       There is no doubt that Iran has been trying to flex its \n     muscles since 1979 when the Shah was deposed. Iran is a proud \n     nation with a rich history. In asserting its right not to be \n     restrained in developing nuclear technology, Iran seeks to be \n     a world power, and its leaders think that status and respect \n     can be achieved by becoming a nuclear power. A good starting \n     point for U.S.-Iranian relations would be to treat them as \n     equals for the purpose of negotiations. It does not give them \n     the same status as being a nuclear power, but it could be a \n     good step forward if mighty America would treat them with \n     respect while negotiating.\n       I have tried to visit Iran since the Iran-Iraq War ended in \n     1988. I have not yet succeeded. For many years, however, I \n     have reached out to Iranians such as the former ambassador to \n     the United Nations in New York, Seyed Muhammad Hadi Nejad \n     Hosseinian, and his successor, Muhammad Javad Zarif, in an \n     effort to foster an exchange of visits by Members of Congress \n     to Iran and Iranian parliamentarians to the United States to \n     try to open dialogue between our two countries. I thought my \n     efforts finally came to fruition in January 2004 when plans \n     were made for U.S. members of Congress to meet with Iranian \n     parliamentarians in Geneva. Unfortunately, Tehran later \n     rescinded the invitation, declaring it was ``not on their \n     agenda.''\n       Terrorism, military nuclear capabilities, energy, Iraq, and \n     the Israeli-Palestinian dilemma are all major issues \n     confronting the United States and the world. All of these \n     challenges are intrinsically linked with Iran, and none can \n     be addressed or resolved without an appreciation for Iran's \n     role in each. Undertaking this venture will not be easy, but \n     in the words of Ambassador L. Bruce Laingen, the senior U.S. \n     official held hostage in Tehran for 444 days, ``Diplomats \n     should talk, even with our foes. That's what we do. It \n     doesn't make sense for us not to talk to the Iranians. I'm \n     not saying that I would confidently predict a breakthrough, \n     but there must be some sort of dialogue.''\n\n\n              The Problem with Outsourcing Foreign Policy\n\n       The United States has responded to Iran's challenge by \n     correctly recounting Iran's dubious nuclear behavior and \n     disregard for the international community but has avoided \n     direct dialogue with Tehran. I commend the \n     administration's change in course, deciding to deal with \n     Iran through multilateral talks, and view it as \n     confirmation that a change in our tactics is overdue. \n     Prior U.S. policy committed to dealing with Iran via the \n     UN Security Council and the Europeans. Prospects are dim, \n     however, for garnering support from China and Russia for a \n     UN resolution with teeth. Russia's and China's significant \n     energy, military, and political interests restrict their \n     ability to support tough action against Iran and represent \n     a significant barrier to a successful resolution vis-a-vis \n     the UN.\n       Although the Europeans are supportive of tough action \n     against Iran, some are hesitant to continue down a path on \n     which they feel the United States is not fully committed and \n     not an active partner. Germany, France, the United Kingdom, \n     the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and UN \n     Secretary General Kofi Annan have all indicated that the \n     United States needs to be directly engaged in the Iranian \n     effort. My colleague, Senator Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.), in his \n     May 8, 2006, Financial Times op-ed, highlighted the \n     importance of U.S. involvement: ``U.S. allies will support \n     tough action against Iran only if they are confident the U.S. \n     is serious about achieving a negotiated, diplomatic solution. \n     Continued unwillingness of the United States to engage Iran \n     will make other states hesitate to support, and possibly \n     oppose, these tougher measures.''\n       Periodically, I read that military options are some of \n     these tougher actions that may be considered to confront \n     Iran. Although the option should not be removed from the \n     table, military engagement will do nothing to solve the \n     litany of problems between our nations. We should only \n     consider going to war when we have exhausted all options. \n     Today, we are not there. In that light, I commend President \n     George W Bush for his May 24, 2006, statement that ``our \n     primary objective is to solve this problem diplomatically.'' \n     I believe diplomatic options remain, and it is precisely \n     these options that can prevent conflict.\n       Why has it taken so long to consider talking to the Iranian \n     regime? Richard Armitage, former deputy secretary of state, \n     told Time in a May 22, 2006, article that ``it appears that \n     the Administration thinks that dialogue equates with \n     weakness, that we've called these regimes ``evil'' and \n     therefore we won't talk to them. Some people say talking \n     would legitimize the regimes. But we're not trying to change \n     the regimes, and they're already legitimized in the eyes of \n     the international community. So we ought to have enough \n     confidence in our ability as diplomats to go eye to eye with \n     people--even though we disagree in the strongest possible\n\n[[Page S11280]]\n\n     way--and come away without losing anything.''\n       To be certain, we find ourselves in this position in no \n     small part due to Tehran's deceit and arrogance toward the \n     international community. Nevertheless, U.S. policy toward \n     Iran has played into the hands of President Mahmoud \n     Ahmadinejad and the hard-line radicals in Tehran. Although \n     the extent of Ahmadinejad's power remains unclear, the U.S. \n     administration's discussions of regime change and refusal to \n     rule out using nuclear weapons against the Iranian regime \n     have bolstered its position. Such U.S. rhetoric, coupled with \n     other policies, enhances Tehran's ability to tap \n     nationalistic sentiments to solidify support for a nuclear \n     weapons program, effectively taking the focus away from its \n     constituents' discontent with failed domestic policies, most \n     notably Ahmadinejad's poor stewardship of the economy. To \n     some degree, we are the distraction buttressing his position. \n     In this perfect storm, Ahmadinejad's rise on the wave of oil \n     revenues and growing global discontent with U.S. policies has \n     afforded him the forum, confidence, and leverage to challenge \n     the United States and the international community.\n\n\n                 Deciphering and Reaching beyond Tehran\n\n       It is still unknown what level of power and influence \n     Ahmadinejad holds within Iran. Some accounts indicate that \n     Iran's elite, and even some hardline officials, are critical \n     of Ahmadinejad's aggressive handling of the nuclear issue, \n     whereas others report that he has amassed significant power. \n     Nevertheless, it is important to remember that much of the \n     power in Tehran does not rest with the president, but with \n     Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the mullahs.\n       Khamenei installed Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, an \n     advocate of rapprochement with the United States, as chairman \n     of the Expediency Council, a senior position as arbiter \n     between the legislature and constitutional court. Rafsanjani, \n     Ahmadinejad's adversary in the 2005 election, is thought to \n     have been given the position to act as a counterweight to \n     Ahmadinejad. Some accounts suggest that Rafsanjani has taken \n     an increased profile in Iranian diplomacy, a move not likely \n     done without the coordination and approval of Khamenei.\n       Despite the many factions within Iran's leadership, \n     Ahmadinejad, former president Muhummad Khatami, Khamenei, and \n     Rafsanjani all advocate a nuclear Iran. In addition, although \n     Rafsanjani is considered to be a relative moderate, he has \n     still labeled Israel as ``the most hideous occurrence in \n     history,'' which the Muslim world ``will vomit out from its \n     midst.'' Regrettably, these are the views held by those with \n     whom we must engage.\n       Notwithstanding Iran's leadership, we must constantly \n     remind ourselves of those over whom they rule. The United \n     States should effectively communicate our desire for a \n     prosperous Middle East, free of tyranny and oppression, that \n     respects human rights and rule of law and where \n     governments represent and ref1ect the desires of those \n     they govern. Further, we should be frank when conveying \n     our concerns and those of the world to the Iranian people \n     over specific problems threatening peace and security. \n     Nearly three-quarters of Iran's 70 million people are \n     under the age of 30. Placing our disagreements with Iran's \n     leadership aside, not letting these people know what we \n     stand for and what we value would be irresponsible. The \n     United States should focus on this emerging population and \n     those who yearn for increased freedom and reform.\n       According to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, \n     a 2002 poll conducted by the Majlis, Iran's legislature, \n     revealed that three-quarters of Iranians favored \n     rapprochement with the United States and that nearly one-half \n     believed U.S. policy was ``to some extent correct.'' In \n     typical Iranian fashion, the two pollsters were later \n     sentenced to nine years for ``publishing nonscientific \n     research.'' It is precisely examples such as this that fuel \n     disdain amongst Iranians for their leadership. Bush \n     poignantly illustrated the plight and underscored the hopes \n     of the Iranian people in a July 12, 2002, statement: ``The \n     people of Iran want the same freedoms, human rights, and \n     opportunities as people around the world. Their government \n     should listen to their hopes. * * * As Iran's people move \n     towards a future defined by greater freedom, greater \n     tolerance, they will have no better friend than the United \n     Stares of America.''\n       When Ahmadinejad or any Iranian leader calls into question \n     the virtue and value of liberal democracy, we should respond \n     by touting its successes. We should talk about our commitment \n     to rule of law, individual liberties, and freedom of press \n     and speech. Are not freedom of speech, press, and association \n     liberties that the Iranian people would enjoy? Would those \n     incarcerated in Iran for criticizing the government not wish \n     to be freed? Most importantly, liberal democracy has better \n     arguments than theocracy, and we should not shy away from \n     this debate. Perhaps a crash course in the history of \n     authoritarian failures would be the best place to start.\n\n\n                      An Opportunity for Dialogue\n\n       The concept of dialogue with Iran is not unfamiliar to this \n     debate. Both sides have previously taken one step toward the \n     table and one step back. Reports indicate that, in 2003, \n     Iran, with the blessing of Khamenei, secretly proposed talks \n     with the United States on Iraq and Iranian nuclear ambitions. \n     That same year, the United States offered to send a high-\n     level delegation to Tehran following the earthquake in Bam, \n     only to be rebuffed by Iran. Unfortunately, this tentative \n     shuffle never amounted to anyone sitting down at the table at \n     the same time.\n       There are some indications, vague as they may be, that \n     Tehran may again be interested in establishing dialogue with \n     Washington. For example, on May 8, 2006, Ahmadinejad sent an \n     18-page letter to Bush. Following that letter, USA Today \n     reported that Ali Larijani, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, \n     said in a television interview that I ``[p]erhaps, it could \n     lead to a new diplomatic opening. It needs to be given some \n     time.'' Further, according to Time, a senior Iranian official \n     described the letter as being designed to offer ``new ways \n     for getting out of the current, fragile international \n     situation.''\n       Muhammad Nahavandian, a close adviser to Iran's top nuclear \n     negotiator, was reportedly in the United States for a few \n     weeks during that same month. According to Newsweek, he told \n     Robert Malley, a former Clinton administration official, that \n     Khamenei was eager to broaden Tehran's tentative cooperation \n     with Washington on Iraq and other subjects and that he was \n     ``putting out feelers.'' In addition to these developments, I \n     agreed with Bush's decision to authorize the U.S. ambassador \n     to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, to engage in discussions with \n     Tehran, even if they were initially restricted to Iraq. In \n     time, it is my hope that such discussions will lead to a \n     broader dialogue.\n       What is most significant in our recent dealings with Iran \n     is the offer for dialogue and how the offer in itself \n     outweighs any terms set by either side. Although Tehran \n     responded to our interest in joining talks by dismissing our \n     conditions that enrichment be suspended, the offer clearly \n     had an impact. On June 2, 2006, Saeed Laylaz, an Iran analyst \n     living in Tehran, confirmed these sentiments to the \n     Washington Post: ``The fact that [Secretary of State \n     Condoleezza] Rice has announced the United States' \n     willingness to hold talks with Iran is more important than \n     the conditions she set.'' The administration's decision to \n     consider dialogue has had a great impact in moving our \n     countries closer to resolving our issues. As reported in that \n     Washington Post article, ``Javad Vaeidi, the Iranian Supreme \n     Council's deputy head for international affairs, agreed that \n     the United States' overture was, in itself, a positive \n     step.''\n       The consequences of an Iran with nuclear weapons would be \n     grave. Tehran does not seem willing to cease uranium \n     enrichment voluntarily or submit to the IAEA. The Europeans \n     are running into walls in the form of China and Russia in the \n     UN Security Council, and it is apparent that the UN has not \n     been able to alter Iran's behavior. It is precisely Iran's \n     ambitions that may drive regional powers such as Egypt, \n     Turkey, and Saudi Arabia to pursue nuclear ambitions. The \n     Middle East is already a volatile neighborhood. The phrase \n     ``adding fuel to the fire'' does not approach describing \n     what the introduction of nuclear weapons would mean, not \n     only for the fate of the region but for the world.\n       The United States is not to blame for Iran's devious and \n     deceptive behavior, nor their arrogance and defiance of the \n     international community. I have called on the international \n     community to act aggressively in dealing with Iran's \n     involvement in the crisis in southern Lebanon. As I stated on \n     the floor of the U.S. Senate on July 20, 2006, ``The United \n     Nations ought to call Iran and Syria on the carpet to explain \n     their conduct in backing Hezbollah, in providing personnel to \n     do more than train Hezbollah, more than advisers being \n     integral parts of the military offensive of Hezbollah.''\n       Twenty-seven years of silence broken only by a few \n     whispers, however, has not worked and has left us in the \n     dangerous predicament in which we find ourselves today. All \n     the while, the United States has been watching from the \n     sidelines. Something has to give. Current U.S. policy does \n     not include direct talks with Iran with no preconditions. \n     Perhaps it is time to stop passing notes to Tehran via the \n     Swiss and to sit down and start talking.\n\n\n                              North Korea\n\n       Just as the United States has been criticized by its \n     European allies for not dealing directly with Iran, we have \n     encountered similar criticism from Russia, China, and South \n     Korea for not directly engaging North Korea. It is clear, as \n     pointed out by John McLaughlin, former deputy director of the \n     Central Intelligence Agency, that ``the North seems sure to \n     engage us. It could be across a table. It could be with the \n     consequences of its negative behavior or its own ability.'' \n     The United States should focus on the table in hopes of \n     preventing the consequences.\n       Today, North Korea exists in the dark, both literally and \n     figuratively. The regime of Kim Jong-il actively pursues an \n     unsupervised and unregulated nuclear program. This program \n     and its long-range missiles pose a grave threat to regional \n     security and represent a hostile posture toward the United \n     States. Meanwhile, the 23 million residents of North Korea \n     remain among the poorest and most repressed in the world.\n       A satellite photo taken of the earth at night reveals \n     lights across much of the populated world. Yet North Korea, \n     with the exception of a tiny dot denoting Pyongyang, is \n     totally black. Ironically, this blank spot is symbolic for \n     just about everything about\n\n[[Page S11281]]\n\n     this country. It is a massive blind spot with very little \n     known in the United States or elsewhere about exactly what is \n     going on inside its borders. Even Kim's nuclear progress was \n     unverified until recently.\n       What we do know, as Esther Pan of the Council on Foreign \n     Relations observes, is that North Korea has ``developed a \n     nuclear arsenal of an estimated six to eight nuclear weapons \n     and continued to enrich nuclear fuel; removed its nuclear \n     program from all international treaties, obligations, and \n     safeguards; decided when to negotiate and when to drop out, \n     and then set the terms for returning to negotiations; [and] \n     steadily increased the amount of unconditional aid it \n     receives from international sources,'' including more than $1 \n     billion from the United States over the last 10 years. On \n     October 9, 2006, North Korea claimed to have conducted an \n     underground nuclear test. Given this disconcerting state of \n     affairs, it may be appropriate for the United States to deal \n     directly with North Korea.\n       I commend the administration for enlisting North Korea's \n     neighbors to engage Pyongyang. Regrettably, that regime has \n     refused to return to the six-party talks with China, Japan, \n     Russia, South Korea, and the United States. On May 17, 2006, \n     I was pleased to read in the New York Times that ``Bush's top \n     advisers have recommended a broad new approach to dealing \n     with North Korea that would include beginning negotiations on \n     a peace treaty, even while efforts to dismantle the country's \n     nuclear program are still under way.'' As reported, such a \n     deal would be contingent on North Korea returning to the six-\n     party talks, something I hope the North will do. Regardless, \n     it is possible to address North Korea both in multilateral \n     and bilateral fora.\n       On June 1, 2006, Pyongyang extended an invitation to the \n     United States for talks, which Washington declined. This may \n     have been an opportunity worth taking. As Kevin O'Neill and \n     David Albright conclude in their book, Solving the North \n     Korea Nuclear Puzzle, ``Serious misunderstandings, missed \n     opportunities, and false expectations have often plagued the \n     U.S.-North Korean relationship.'' In my opinion, dialogue is \n     one way to avoid these pitfalls in the future.\n       The problems in our bilateral relationship do not end with \n     North Korea's nuclear ambitions. North Korea's human rights \n     record is deplorable. The Department of State reported on \n     March 8, 2006, that ``the government's human rights record \n     remained extremely poor, and the regime continued to commit \n     numerous serious abuses. The regime [has] subjected citizens \n     to rigid controls over many aspects of their lives.'' The \n     report cited extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, \n     life-threatening prison conditions, torture, and forced \n     abortions and infanticide, as well as denial of freedom of \n     speech, press, religion, assembly, and association. The North \n     is one of the world's preeminent counterfeiters and has long \n     been suspected of trafficking drugs. While we work to quell \n     the North's desire to be a nuclear state, we must not simply \n     trade resolving the nuclear issue for another nefarious vice. \n     A repressed, corrupt, and hungry North Korea is not a \n     healthy, stable, and secure North Korea.\n       The complexities in our bilateral relationship with Iran \n     and North Korea are different. On both accounts, however, we \n     have failed to grasp the correlation between U.S. policy and \n     nationalism and how it leads to support those in power. U.S. \n     saber rattling and threats of regime change have permitted \n     unsavory leaders in each nation to incite nationalist \n     sentiments, leading them to strengthen their grip on power. \n     As Henry Kissinger wrote in his May 16, 2006, Washington Post \n     op-ed, ``Focusing on regime change as the road to \n     denuclearization confuses the issue.'' I would go one step \n     further and submit that it hinders our ability to \n     denuclearize either North Korea or Iran. Hostile rhetoric and \n     disengagement will not move us closer to the negotiating \n     table nor a solution.\n\n\n             Dialogue, Even with Foes, Can Be Constructive\n\n       Involvement in foreign policy matters is a time-honored \n     role for members of the Senate and one in which I have \n     enjoyed participating during my quarter century in this body. \n     Active involvement in these issues by members of the Senate \n     is not meant to supplant the roles of the president, \n     secretary of state, or their designees. Our foreign policy \n     priorities are set by the executive branch.\n       Yet, my own experiences in this area, even with leaders \n     such as Arafat or Saddam and on issues such as human rights \n     with China, have convinced me that maintaining a dialogue and \n     allowing cooperation in areas of common interest, even with \n     our most pronounced foes, should be one of our nation's \n     priorities because of its potential to yield positive \n     results. I offer my own experiences, having traveled to 95 \n     different countries, including Syria, Cuba, and Venezuela, as \n     examples of why I believe maintaining an active dialogue and \n     open lines of communication preserve the potential to find \n     peaceful solutions to resolve differences with our \n     adversaries.\n       My first opportunity to promote dialogue in the face of an \n     international crisis came in the spring of 1982 when serving \n     my first term. Following a Saturday radio address by Reagan, \n     which noted that the Soviet Union and the United States had \n     enough nuclear weapons to destroy the other, I proposed a \n     Senate resolution calling for a summit between the leaders of \n     each nation. Relying on the doctrine of mutually assured \n     destruction was not a sufficient way to provide security for \n     either nation. The obvious solution to this standoff was to \n     have a negotiated arms control agreement.\n       Upon calling for a vote on my resolution during \n     consideration of the annual Department of Defense \n     authorization bill, I was sharply challenged by Senator John \n     Tower (Tex.), a fellow Republican and chairman of the Armed \n     Services Committee. Citing my short tenure, Tower questioned \n     my authority and knowledge on the issue. Senator Paul Laxalt \n     (R-Nev.), one of the first members to vote, supported my \n     resolution. Tower told Laxalt, ``Specter's trying to tell the \n     president what to do.'' He replied, ``Well, what's wrong with \n     that? . . . Everyone else is too, but Specter's right.'' \n     Following a lively debate, after which Tower was confident \n     his position would prevail, my resolution was adopted by a \n     vote of 90-8. It did not produce immediate talks between the \n     United States and the Soviet Union, but it showed the support \n     of the Senate for dialogue and may have given a little \n     impetus for the summits during the 1980s.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n       I first traveled to the Middle East in 1964. In the \n     intervening 42 years, I have made 24 trips to the region \n     before and after election to the Senate. Since 1984, I have \n     visited Syria 15 times, had nine lengthy meetings with Asad, \n     attended his funeral on the only congressional delegation to \n     Syria in 2000, and met with his son and successor, Bashar al-\n     Asad, on three occasions. I have spent much of my time in the \n     region shuffling between Damascus and Jerusalem, which led me \n     to coin the term ``shuffle diplomacy,'' similar perhaps to \n     Henry Kissinger's ``shuttle diplomacy,'' to describe my \n     efforts to bring resolution to issues confronting these \n     neighbors.\n       In 1988 I urged Asad to permit Syrian Jewish women to \n     emigrate because the limited number of Jewish men in Syria \n     presented them with limited opportunities for marriage. Asad \n     resisted, citing that Syria was ``at war'' with Israel and \n     that emigration had the potential to strengthen Syria's \n     enemy. I continued to press this issue in subsequent meetings \n     with him. As I reported in an article I wrote for the New \n     York Post in 1994, after I continued to press the issue, \n     ``Asad responded with a romantic offer that he would allow \n     any Jewish woman to leave when a suitor came to Syria and \n     took her to the United States to marry. That offer was \n     relayed to the active Syrian Jewish community in Brooklyn and \n     elsewhere.'' Ultimately, Syrian policy was altered to permit \n     Jews to emigrate.\n       As a result of my many lengthy conversations with Asad, we \n     developed a congenial relationship. In August 1995, I told \n     Asad that when Yitzak Rabin, Shimon Perez, and Arafat \n     received the Nobel peace prize for the Oslo accords, if Asad \n     made peace with Israel, he too would be honored. Asad replied \n     by laughing, saying that he might be well received in \n     Stockholm but probably would not be permitted to return to \n     Damascus. Nevertheless, I continued to urge Syria to \n     participate in discussions with Israel in hopes of \n     alleviating tensions between the two neighbors.\n       Asad had initially rebuffed offers to open talks with \n     Israel, stating that Syria would only participate in talks \n     sponsored by all five permanent members of the UN Security \n     Council. Israel was opposed to this format, believing that \n     only the United States would support Israel in such \n     negotiations. When I pressed Asad on this issue again in \n     1990, he indicated that he had changed his position on the \n     proposal and that Syria would be willing to participate in \n     meetings organized by the United States and the Soviet \n     Union. As I reported in a floor statement, this change was \n     significant because it appeared to be part of a broader \n     Syrian initiative. ``In our January 1989 meeting, I asked \n     on three separate occasions, separated by respectable \n     periods of time, what it would take for Syria and Israel \n     to become friends. President Asad answered, after a third \n     query, that it was not a question of friendship, but that \n     `normalizing' a relationship between Syria and Israel \n     might be possible under certain circumstances.''\n       I relayed this offer to Israeli Prime Minister Yirzhak \n     Shamir, who was ``surprised'' and ``pleased'' with Asad's \n     overture. One year later, in October 1991, Syria participated \n     in the Madrid peace conference cosponsored by Washington and \n     Moscow. Although the three days of talks did not yield a \n     peace agreement, the summit marked the first bilateral talks \n     between Israel and Syria. It is preferable to have the \n     Syrians, Lebanese, Jordanians, Israelis, and Palestinians \n     airing their grievances over coffee at a negotiating table in \n     Spain than through violence in the streets of the Middle \n     East.\n       Five years later, during my 1996 visit to the region, I \n     served as a line of communication between Jerusalem and \n     Damascus. Prior to my visit, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin \n     Netanyahu indicated that his government would hold Syria \n     accountable for the actions of Hizballah along the Lebanese \n     border. This caused Syria to realign its troops in a posture \n     hostile to Israel, resulting in a dramatic rise in tensions \n     between the two countries. On one side, Syria's four-million-\n     man army amassed, and on the other side lay Israel's \n     sophisticated and combat-tested military of 1.5 million.\n       On August 27, 1996, I met with Netanyahu in Israel. During \n     my report to the Senate, I informed my colleagues that ``Mr.\n\n[[Page S11282]]\n\n     Netanyahu said he wanted to begin peace negotiations with his \n     Arab neighbors,'' that he ``was eager to get to the \n     negotiation table with Syrian President Asad,'' and that he \n     ``asked me to carry a message to President Asad, whom I was \n     scheduled to meet with the next day.'' The following day, I \n     traveled to Damascus and met with Asad for three and a half \n     hours. As I reported in a floor statement, ``I conveyed \n     Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's message that Israel had \n     only peaceful intentions toward Syria, that both sides should \n     move immediately to reduce military tensions, and that Mr. \n     Netanyahu wanted to reopen direct negotiations between Israel \n     and Syria.''\n       Asad did not seem interested in the offer and told me that \n     ``Syria would not go back to the table until Prime Minister \n     Netanyahu reaffirms the land-for-peace basis of negotiations, \n     and agrees to pick up where Israel's Labor Government left \n     off.'' Asad further asked me to convey that Syria's troop \n     movements along the border were routine and not intended to \n     threaten Israel. I returned later that evening to meet with \n     Netanyahu and relayed Asad's comments that the military \n     action on the border was not to be interpreted by Jerusalem \n     as aggressive.\n       Upon my return to the United States, I met Walid al-\n     Moualem, Syrian ambassador to the United States, to get an \n     update on the situation between Syria and Israel from his \n     perspective. As reported in a floor statement at the time, \n     ``Ambassador Al-Moualem told me that his government viewed my \n     August round of talks between Prime Minister Netanyahu and \n     President Asad as having been helpful in deescalating the \n     dangerous tensions . . . and the Ambassador encouraged me to \n     return to the region for another round of meetings aimed at \n     helping the parties find a basis to reopen their peace \n     negotiations.'' Moualem later told me that I had ``gained the \n     trust and confidence and personal relationship with President \n     Asad'' because I was ``objective'' even though ``nobody could \n     question [my] support of Israel.'' I later received a similar \n     suggestion from Netanyahu during a phone conversation.\n       As a result of this encouragement, I returned to the region \n     three months later, in November 1996. During my November 20 \n     meeting with Netanyahu, he informed me ``that tensions with \n     Syria [have] been reduced since the August/September time \n     period and that he wants to continue to de-escalate the saber \n     rattling. He asked me to convey this and specifically that \n     Israel has no aggressive intent against Syria.'' Netanyahu \n     also told me to tell Asad ``that he wishes to [reopen peace \n     talks] as soon as possible and that he is ready, willing, and \n     able to be personally involved in such talks.''\n       I flew to Damascus after my meeting with Netanyahu to \n     transmit the message to Asad. As reported in a floor \n     statement, ``President Asad did generally seem to share Prime \n     Minister Netanyahu's desire to continue to ease and avoid \n     military tensions which could lead to unintended hostilities. \n     . . . Asad received this portion of Prime Minister \n     Netanyahu's message positively and reiterated his own return \n     message to the same effect.''\n       Seven years later, on my 2003 trip to the Middle East, \n     Prime Minister Ariel Sharon denounced Syria's harboring of \n     terrorist organizations and its support for Hizballah in \n     Lebanon. I asked him if he would be willing to enter into \n     peace negotiations with Damascus, brokered by the United \n     States, similar to those in which Prime Minister Rabin had \n     participated in the 1990s. He acquiesced with the \n     assurances that there would be no preconditions. I \n     conveyed his response directly to President Bashar al-Asad \n     three days later. Asad responded favorably, saying he was \n     willing to participate in peace talks with Israel. He said \n     he did not think it appropriate to conclude a treaty \n     before Israel and the Palestinian Authority had reached a \n     final settlement but that Syrian-Israeli talks could \n     proceed on a separate track. Although other events in the \n     region have eclipsed this opportunity, I believe we should \n     continue aggressively to advocate peace between these \n     nations so its failure does not become the lead story \n     tomorrow.\n\n\n                                  Cuba\n\n       My experience with Syria provided an opportunity to reduce \n     hostility between a U.S. adversary and one of our allies. My \n     travels have also included three trips to Cuba and meetings \n     with Castro since June 1999, most recently in August 2005. \n     These sessions have given me the opportunity to understand \n     how our nations' confrontational history has been viewed from \n     the perspective of Cuba's leader. They have also proven to me \n     that it is possible to find some areas of common ground, even \n     with our most ardent foes. In time, it is my belief that \n     small cooperative efforts can help to break down the barriers \n     that divide us, leading to expanded cooperation and better \n     relations.\n       Since the early 1960s, Cuba has been viewed as a Communist \n     stronghold 90 miles off the coast of Florida. The Cuban \n     missile crisis, suspicions of Cuban complicity in the \n     assassination of President John F Kennedy, and rumored \n     assassination attempts on Castro by the CIA have complicated \n     our relationship. As a result, U.S. policy has consisted \n     largely of isolating the island nation through comprehensive \n     economic sanctions. During my first meeting with Castro in \n     1999, we talked about a number of the issues that have \n     divided our countries for so long. I was particularly \n     interested to hear him speak on the assassination of Kennedy \n     because of my work as an assistant counsel on the Warren \n     Commission. As I reported in a floor statement, Castro \n     ``maintained that the Cuban government played no role in the \n     assassination, and that it would have been insane for it to \n     have become involved, given that the United States, by his \n     reckoning, was looking for provocation or pretence to invade \n     Cuba. . . . President Castro was relieved that the Warren \n     Commission concluded Cuba was not involved with Oswald.''\n       On the Cuban missile crisis, Castro related how Premier \n     Nikita Khrushchev had mistakenly revealed to him a promise by \n     Kennedy to withdraw U.S. missiles from Turkey and Italy. As a \n     result, Castro was told, Moscow would breach its agreement \n     with Havana by removing its own missiles from Cuba, leaving \n     the island vulnerable to a U.S. invasion in Castro's view. \n     Castro saw a bright side to the Soviet withdrawal. As I \n     reported in a floor statement, Castro stated, ``We preferred \n     the risk of invasion to the presence of Soviet troops, \n     because it would have established [the] image [of Cuba] as a \n     Soviet base.''\n       Prior to that first meeting with Castro, I had examined the \n     records of the Church Committee and found that there was \n     evidence of eight or nine attempts by the United States to \n     assassinate him. When presented with this number, Castro \n     scoffed and said the actual number was more than 300. When \n     asked how it felt to be the subject of so many attempts on \n     his life, he responded by asking if I had a sport. When I \n     told him I was a squash player, Castro retorted that \n     ``avoiding assassination is a sport for me.''\n       In all of my three meetings with Castro, I pressed him on \n     Cuba's deprivation of human rights and the failure to have \n     contested elections. I also met with a delegation of human \n     rights activists, many of whom had been jailed for expressing \n     anti-Castro sentiments. As I reported in a floor statement, \n     ``Having just come from a meeting with dissidents, I pressed \n     Castro to release the political prisoners in his jails. \n     Castro tried to shift the topic of conversation from his \n     prisoners by bringing up the case of five Cubans convicted of \n     spying in the U.S. whose convictions were recently \n     overturned.'' In reply, I suggested to Castro that ``far from \n     being an example of American wrongdoing, this kind of fair \n     process is exactly the type of justice he should be offering \n     to his own people. I also pressed Castro to open his country \n     to democracy and dissent. He listened, but my exhortations \n     obviously had no effect.'' I conveyed to Castro that if the \n     Cuban government initiated some reforms on democratization or \n     freedom of speech, U.S. policymakers would be more favorable \n     to modifying trade policy toward Cuba.\n       These meetings have left me with the conviction that, \n     before giving consideration to any modification of the U.S. \n     embargo, relations between our two countries can be \n     immediately strengthened in areas such as drug interdiction \n     in the Caribbean and medical research. I proposed to Castro \n     the possibility of U.S.-Cuban cooperation in drug \n     interdiction efforts. Cuba occupies a strategic location for \n     combating the flow of drugs from Latin America to the United \n     States and could be very helpful to U.S. law enforcement \n     efforts. In 1999, Castro said, ``[W]e are willing to \n     cooperate''; and as I reported in a floor statement, he \n     ``suggested a formal relationship with the United States in \n     order to make progress on drug interdiction in efforts in the \n     area.'' In my view, this remains an offer the United States \n     should not only accept but robustly support.\n       To that end, I have introduced amendments to provide \n     funding for such collaboration in the foreign operations \n     appropriations bills each year since fiscal year 2001. I have \n     been successful in convincing my Senate colleagues to support \n     the provision. Regrettably, the House of Representatives was \n     insistent on dropping the language because of anti-Cuban \n     sentiment among a number of House members, which was \n     supported by the Speaker of the House. Yet, when there were \n     more material issues involved, such as farm trade, Congress \n     was supportive.\n       Nonetheless, at my insistence, the FY 2002 Foreign \n     Operations Appropriations Conference Report, H.R. 2506, \n     included a provision directing the secretary of state to \n     report on how U.S. counternarcotics assistance to Cuba would \n     decrease the flow of drugs in the region. In July 2002, the \n     State Department reported that, ``should Cuba make increased \n     seizures and arrests, it could help impede the drug traffic \n     through the Jamaica-Cuba-Bahamas corridor.''\n       Another area in which closer relations may be mutually \n     beneficial is medical research. Scientists in Cuba have shown \n     promise in developing a meningitis B vaccine. During my visit \n     to Cuba in January 2002, I met with a team of researchers at \n     the Finlay Institute in Havana, which entered into a \n     cooperative agreement with GlaxoSmithKline in 1999 to develop \n     this vaccine. Based in part on what I learned from these \n     conversations, I remain convinced that a better relationship \n     with Cuba and the erosion of existing barriers would benefit \n     both countries.\n\n\n                               Venezuela\n\n       After traveling to Havana last year, I had the opportunity \n     to meet with Chavez on August 17, 2005. It is clear that the \n     United States and Venezuela are at odds over many different \n     issues, but there are areas of interest, such as drug \n     interdiction, where our two countries can work together. \n     These common interests can perhaps serve as a catalyst to \n     construct a dialogue on our differences.\n       On August 7, 2005, 10 days before I arrived, Chavez \n     suspended cooperation with U.S.\n\n[[Page S11283]]\n\n     counternarcotics officials after accusing U.S. Drug \n     Enforcement Administration agents of conducting intelligence \n     operations. Prior to my meeting with Chavez, all efforts by \n     the U.S. ambassador to Venezuela to secure meetings with \n     high-level Venezuelan officials to resolve the dispute had \n     been unsuccessful. After being briefed on the situation by \n     our diplomats in Caracas, I met with Chavez and requested \n     that he direct his ministers to meet with the U.S. \n     ambassador. As I reported in a t100r statement, ``At the \n     conclusion of our meeting, President Chavez agreed that it \n     would be useful for his Foreign Minister and Minister of \n     Interior to meet with our Ambassador the following week to \n     try to resolve [U.S.-Venezuelan] differences on drug \n     enforcement.''\n       After our discussion on narcotics policy, Chavez further \n     suggested that consideration ought to be given to forging a \n     new drug interdiction agreement. Although the State \n     Department's ``2006 International Narcotics Control Strategy \n     Report'' determined that Venezuela can no longer be certified \n     as an ally in the war on drugs, the report noted that \n     continued U.S. work with Venezuelan law enforcement: led to \n     record cocaine seizures in 2005. The report also states that \n     the United States is committed to renewing cooperation with \n     its Venezuelan counterparts at all levels in the war on drugs \n     in 2006.\n       During our meeting, Chavez expressed his concern about \n     statements from the United States portraying Venezuela as a \n     destabilizing force in Latin America. Specifically, Chavez \n     mentioned comments made in Peru by Secretary of Defense \n     Donald Rumsfeld in which the secretary referred to Chavez as \n     ``a guy who seemed like a comic figure a year ago [that] is \n     turning into a real strategic menace.'' I responded by \n     calling on both sides to cease the harsh rhetoric that I \n     believe is counterproductive to enhancing our bilateral \n     relationship. On August 19, 2005, I wrote to Rumsfeld, \n     stating that ``I believe there is a window of opportunity at \n     this time to resolve the disagreement on drug interdiction \n     policies'' and that ``it may well be helpful to, at least, \n     have a moratorium on adverse comments on Venezuela.''\n\n\n                              Talking Pays\n\n       These examples highlight but one senator's efforts to forge \n     a dialogue with foreign leaders. The full weight of the White \n     House and our diplomatic corps can accomplish much more. I \n     encourage the administration to authorize more dialogue with \n     those we consider combative or enemies. The United States \n     will be in a better position when it is engaged in long, hard \n     diplomatic slogs than military conflicts.\n       It is clear that isolation has not been successful on many \n     fronts. It did not prevent Saddam from repressing his people, \n     it has not crushed the government of Castro, and it certainly \n     does not appear to be working in dealing with Chavez, \n     Ahmadinejad, or Kim. It has been my experience that dialogue, \n     even with pronounced foes, can lead to constructive results. \n     This is particularly true if the conversation starts on areas \n     of common interest and works up to the main areas of \n     disagreement. Such an investment takes time and hard work to \n     see results on our most critical national security interests.\n       The United States should treat each country and its \n     leaders, no matter how horrific their views, with some form \n     of dignity and respect for their sovereignty. The United \n     States, perhaps more than any other nation in history, has a \n     great capacity to serve as a conduit of peace. It is my hope \n     that we take every opportunity to ensure this capacity is not \n     wasted.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for Dr. Robert \nGates to be the next Secretary of Defense. Dr. Gates is poised to take \nan extraordinarily difficult job at one of the most dangerous times in \nU.S. history. He will face a number of pressing problems. Clearly, the \nmost pressing problem facing Dr. Gates is determining the next step of \nU.S. operations in Iraq.\n  Today the Iraq Study Group released its report. It begins:\n\n       The situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating [and] \n     there is no path that can guarantee success.\n\n  The study group makes a series of recommendations that are strikingly \nsimilar to the Levin-Reed amendment that was offered last June. These \nrecommendations include engaging Iraq's neighbors, including Iran and \nSyria, encouraging the Iraqi Government to increase their efforts to \nbring security to their people, reconciliation and governance reforms \nto their nation, and the transition of the mission of our troops from \ncombat operations to training; also, the recommendation that there be a \ncomplete redeployment of most of these combat forces by the beginning \nof 2008.\n  These recommendations are realistic but they are also very difficult \nand, I presume, not well liked--at least initially--by this \nadministration. Evaluating and implementing these recommendations will \nbe the daunting but necessary task of Dr. Gates.\n  Dr. Gates also needs to focus his attention on Afghanistan, the \ninitial and proper focus on the war on terror. Reports make it \nincreasingly clear that we are losing ground. The Taliban has regrouped \nand rearmed. This spring, they mounted the toughest resistance since \n2001. Suicide attacks, which were once unknown in Afghanistan, have \nmore than doubled this year. Lieutenant General Eikenberry, formerly \nthe commanding general of Combined Forces Command Afghanistan, believes \nthe fiercest fighting yet will be next spring.\n  NATO'S International Security Assistance Force has assumed control of \nforces in Afghanistan, but this force is only at 85 percent strength. \nAlmost 5 years after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, only half of the \nmoney pledged by the international community to rebuild Afghanistan has \nbeen delivered and spent. Sixty percent of the country is still without \nelectricity, 80 percent without potable water, and the unemployment \nrate is 40 percent. Without viable alternatives, residents of \nAfghanistan return to what ensures they will survive and, \nunfortunately, in many cases, that is growing poppies.\n  Last week, the U.N. and World Bank released a report stating that \npoppy cultivation increased 59 percent and opium production by 49 \npercent over the last year. It concludes that international efforts to \ncombat opium production, which includes $400 million in U.S. \ncounternarcotics funding, have failed. Dr. Gates will have to pay \nimmediate attention to these issues in Afghanistan, a linchpin in our \nwar against terror.\n  One of the unintended consequences of U.S. operations in Iraq is the \nenhanced strategic position of Iran. With the election of Iranian \nPresident Ahmadinezhad, the nation has become increasingly belligerent \nto the United States and Israel, a key ally of the United States. The \nIranians continue to press for what they describe as a nonmilitary \nnuclear program. Despite the threat of international sanctions, they \nare developing their ability to enrich uranium, a necessary step for \nboth a civilian nuclear program and a military weapon. The fear, which \nI believe is justified, is that with access to enriched uranium in the \ncontext of a nuclear power program, the Iranians would be unable or \nunwilling to avoid the temptation to use this material to construct a \nnuclear device.\n  Then there is North Korea, the actions of which have also become \nincreasingly belligerent over the last 2 years. They have walked away \nfrom the agreed upon framework, ejected international inspectors, and \nnow likely have enough plutonium to build 10 nuclear weapons. On the \n4th of July they provocatively tested a long-range missile. The test \nwas a failure, but it underscored their determination to challenge the \ninternational community. Finally, on October 9, they tested a nuclear \ndevice.\n  I argue that Iranian and North Korean nuclear aspirations raise the \nmost serious strategic issues we face today. If these countries are not \nchecked, then there is a significant probability of a regional arms \nrace.\n  All of these international engagements, all of these international \nchallenges, are creating enormous strains on our military, particularly \nour ground forces. Recent studies have shown that two-thirds of our \nActive-Duty Army and more than two-thirds of the National Guard are \nrated as ``nondeployable'' ``noncombat ready'' principally because of \nequipment shortages. This is a shocking and scandalous record.\n  This administration has allowed two-thirds of our Army forces to \nessentially be denied the equipment--in some cases, the personnel--to \nbe fully represented for combat. Virtually every active brigade not \ncurrently deployed is not prepared to meet its mission if called upon.\n  One of the reasons these brigades are not ready is because of \nequipment shortages. Over a year ago, the Army estimated that in order \nto reset equipment being used in theaters of operation, it will require \napproximately $12 billion in funding every year of ongoing operations \nuntil 2 years after operations cease in Iraq and Afghanistan. The \nMarines have been slowly coming back from a $16 billion reset, but they \nstill need $3 billion to draw even and will still incur annual \noperating costs.\n\n[[Page S11284]]\n\n  Besides equipment, the Army and Marines must worry about their \npersonnel. The present Active-Duty Army end strength is approximately \n504,000. About 400,000 soldiers have done one tour of combat duty, and \na third have deployed twice. In order to meet recruiting goals, the \nArmy has increased the maximum age for enlistment and lowered the \nphysical, academic, and ethical standards. To meet retention goals, the \nArmy has implemented stop loss measures and offered increasingly large \nreenlistment bonuses. There are presently 184,952 Active and Reserve \nMarines on duty. Over the past 4 years, 169,558 have been deployed, a \nsignificant number of Active and Reserve Marines. This operational \ntempo simply cannot be sustained. Again, Dr. Gates will have to address \nthis issue or risk the future health of the Army and Marine Corps.\n  Dr. Gates also faces extraordinary budget challenges. The fiscal year \n2007 Defense Appropriations Act was $366 billion, the largest Defense \nbill in history. Still, it is not enough. The Army's share of the \nfiscal year 2007 budget was $98.2 billion. Secretary Rumsfeld set the \nArmy's fiscal year 2008 budget at $114 billion, an increase but \ninsufficient. In response, Army Chief of Staff GEN Peter Schoomaker \ntook the unprecedented step of refusing to submit the 2008 budget plan \nby the August 15 deadline. General Schoomaker has determined in fiscal \nyear 2008 the Army needs $138.8 billion just to continue to operate. \nAgain, it is an unprecedented step in which a Chief of Staff, a \nuniformed officer, would not submit his budget to the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  The Navy, which is not significantly involved in the Iraqi and \nAfghanistan theaters, is still key to our foreign presence around the \nworld. Today's Navy fleet numbers 278 ships. The Chief of Naval \nOperations' 5-year shipbuilding plan calls for new ship construction \nwith necessary funding of $14.1 billion beginning in fiscal year 2008 \nand rising to $19.1 billion in fiscal year 2012. This is a huge number, \nbut without this critical funding our fleet will be in jeopardy. And, \nagain, the Secretary of Defense has to respond to this request by the \nChief of Naval Operations.\n  All of this is in the context of the regular budget. But as we all \nknow, we have been funding operations in Afghanistan and in Iraq \nthrough supplementals. To date, $495 billion has been appropriated \nthrough these supplementals for our efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. \nPress reports indicate that the Pentagon is preparing a new \nsupplemental. The request is in the range of $127 to $150 billion just \nfor an additional year of operations in these theaters of war.\n  There are several problems with these supplementals. They contribute \ndirectly to our Nation's deficit, which is $248 trillion. They do not \nallow the military to effectively and efficiently plan for the \nmaintenance of troops, equipment, and operations because none of this \nspending can be counted upon in terms of the exact number and the \ntiming of the passage of the supplemental. The supplementals, as large \nas they are, still are insufficient. The Army, even with supplementals, \nis citing billions of dollars in shortfalls, particularly with respect \nto equipment resets. They will not last forever, since I can \nanticipate, we all can anticipate, the reaction of the American public \nto another request for $100 billion or more.\n  Finally, when the supplementals do cease, either totally or in \nsignificant numbers of dollars, the Army and Marine Corps will still \nhave troops and equipment in the field, with no funding. They will face \na precipice, if you will: They still have a responsibility, they still \nhave the personnel, they still have the equipment, but where is the \nfunding? These are extraordinary problems that Dr. Gates is facing, \nmost of them a direct result of poor decisions made by the \nadministration and the Department of Defense.\n  Most of these issues were raised with Dr. Gates in yesterday's \nconfirmation hearing. Although there were some issues that Dr. Gates \ndid not yet have in-depth knowledge of, he was frank in his responses \nand open to the ideas and open to the advice of all who asked him \nquestions.\n  For months, I and many of my colleagues have called for a change in \nour course in Iraq and in the rest of our foreign policy. I believe \nthat Dr. Gates is a signal of that change. I do not believe that he is \ninvested in the decisions, many of them bad, that have been made in the \nDepartment of Defense over the last 5 years. I also believe he will \nhave a completely different management style from Secretary Rumsfeld, \nallowing civilians and military personnel to speak more freely. I \nbelieve these differences will allow honest, albeit difficult, \ndiscussions to take place and changes to be made.\n  I have had the opportunity to get to know Dr. Gates over the past 5 \nyears. I have found that he is a thoughtful, experienced, and realistic \nvoice on foreign policy. He is a good listener, and I think he will \ndraw on a cross-section of views when making decisions. I commend him \nfor leaving private life and a job he clearly loved to take on a very \npublic job that will be thanklessly demanding.\n  Perhaps the most difficult task that Dr. Gates faces is bringing \nunvarnished reports of bad news to a President and inner circle who do \nnot like to hear such things. However, I believe that Dr. Gates has the \nstature and the wherewithal and the will to do what needs to be done.\n  The months ahead are going to be difficult, not only for Bob Gates \nbut also for our military. However, I have confidence that Dr. Gates \nwill be an able leader and, therefore, I will support his nomination \nand wish him well in a very daunting task.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, while my colleague from Rhode \nIsland is here, I want to ask him a couple questions. He is my friend, \nand he is one of the truly knowledgeable Members of the Senate on \nmatters having to do with the defense of our country.\n  With all the things that the Senator has outlined, which are \ncertainly true--the lack of equipment; the wearing out of equipment; \nthe fact that some of our troops went into Iraq and did not have the \nproper equipment, even body armor; the fact that, as the Senator has \nstated, the recruitment goals are not being met; the fact that more and \nmore of the load is being put on the Reserves and the National Guard, \nwhich is taking particularly the National Guard away from its initial \nresponsibility with regard to the States--my question to the Senator \nwould be, since these two Senators were quite impressed with the candor \nof Dr. Gates, is he going to be able to make a difference in his advice \nto the President? Will the President listen?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Florida has put his \nfinger on a critical issue, perhaps the most critical. I believe Dr. \nGates will give good, sound advice. He will listen. But the real \nquestion is, Will that advice be accepted by the President? And will \nthe President be able to redefine policy in such a way that is \nrealistic and achievable? And also, will he be able to articulate this \npolicy and rally the support of the American public as we go forward--\nand not only the American public but the international community? But \nmy sense, my hope is that Dr. Gates will take that first important step \nof speaking truth to power, even though it is unpopular truth.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. That is well said. Let me ask my colleague one \nfurther question of his opinion, Mr. President.\n  My question would be that one of the things this Senator was struck \nwith yesterday in hearings, basically all day, was that he came to the \ntable refreshingly open in a nonpartisan way, much more in a bipartisan \nway. We certainly have not seen a lot of the conduct of this war in the \npast several years being done in a bipartisan way.\n  I ask the Senator: How do you think Dr. Gates, as the new Secretary \nof Defense, is going to be able to involve that process, where those of \nus on both sides of the aisle will be able to participate and assist \nhim in his role as Secretary of Defense?\n  Mr. REED. I have always been impressed by the fact that Bob Gates \nevaluates the quality of the idea, not just the source of the idea. I \ngot to know Bob Gates in that same context of bipartisan foreign policy \ndeliberation at the Aspen Strategy Group with a group of individuals. \nSome of our colleagues were there, including Senator Feinstein and \nothers. But it is chaired\n\n[[Page S11285]]\n\nby Brent Scowcroft, who was the National Security Adviser for President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush, and cochaired by Joe Nye, who was in the \nClinton administration.\n  Bob Gates is someone who brings to the foreign policy arena this \nsense of reaching out to both sides. In fact, as he pointed out \nyesterday--and I think the Senator heard--one of the tasks he sees that \nhe must perform is to create a bipartisan consensus to sustain the long \nwar against terror beyond Iraq, beyond the current dilemmas we are \nfacing. He will do that by reaching out, by listening, again, \nultimately, by evaluating the ideas, not simply the source of those \nideas.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I say to the Senator, thank you. I thank the \nSenator for his responses. And his responses mirror the feelings of \nthis Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor and announce that I had \nvoted for Dr. Gates in the committee because I was impressed by a \nnumber of these attributes that the Senator from Rhode Island and I \nhave discussed. And among them, clearly, are that this Senator grew up \nin an era in which it was understood that partisanship stopped at the \nwater's edge. In other words, when it became matters of the defense of \nthis country, that partisanship was over, that we came together in a \nbipartisan way.\n  Sadly, I can say that I do not think that is the way this war has \nbeen conducted with regard to reaching out across the aisle and \ninvolving both sides, who all have the constitutional responsibility of \nreflecting and representing the will of the American people. It is very \nhard to sustain a war unless you have the support of the American \npeople. If that is not done in a bipartisan way, then sooner or later \nthat good will is going to run out.\n  That is one of the things I was impressed with and pressed Dr. Gates \nabout yesterday in the hearings: not only what appeared to be \nrefreshing candor from him but also his approach, in a nonpartisan way, \nto these issues of war and peace. When we talked to him--as in the \ndiscussion recently in this Chamber, in the colloquy with the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island about the Guard and Reserves--he recognizes that is a \nproblem. And he recognizes that what he is going to have to do is have \na more responsible and direct way of utilizing existing forces because, \nin the short run, he is not going to be able to increase the forces \nconsiderably.\n  And he ruled out, in my question to him, any return to the draft. So \nthat means he has to make the military, particularly the Army and the \nMarines, attractive in order to get the reenlistments and the \nenlistments. Certainly, he has his hands full there, while being able \nto keep the Guard's ability to respond to their respective States in \nthose times of emergency.\n  Clearly, he had a refreshing candor about the question of what was \nthe size force that was going to be needed, not only in Iraq but around \nthe world. He recognizes that we have a problem right now in Al Anbar \nProvince, that General Abizaid recently had told us he was going to \nincrease the presence there by 2,200 marines in a Marine expeditionary \nunit, that that is a part of the country that is clearly not under \ncontrol.\n  So I found our deliberations with him to be refreshing, direct, with \nthe candor that ought to be forthcoming from a member of the \nPresident's Cabinet in his interaction with the Members of Congress. \nAfter all, this is a constitutional government, one in which there are \nshared powers--some powers with the executive branch but some powers \nwith the legislative branch. The way to have this machine humming is to \nhave those branches cooperating with each other. My first impression of \nDr. Gates is he is going to be that kind of Secretary of Defense to \nhelp us continue to work together.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the nomination \nof Dr. Robert Gates to become the next Secretary of Defense.\n  I have had the opportunity to work with Dr. Gates on numerous \noccasions and must note that he was an excellent member of President \nGeorge H.W. Bush's national security team during the first gulf war. \nThis was highlighted by the fact he was nominated and confirmed to \nbecome Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shortly thereafter. \nDr. Gates adds intelligence and diplomatic experience to a war that \nincreasingly requires its leaders to go beyond tactical military \nexpertise. Further, he is a pragmatist, who will work with allies and \nmake necessary changes to our tactics and initiatives.\n  I was impressed by Dr. Gates' candid assessment of the war in \nyesterday's confirmation hearing. He asserted, correctly in my view, \nthat the United States is not winning the war, but we are not losing, \neither. The status quo is not acceptable, and that is why the President \nhas tapped him to do whatever it takes to bring a successful end to our \nefforts in Iraq. He spoke openly about our failures and our successes \nso far, and he underscored what is at stake: If we are not successful, \nit could ignite ``a regional conflagration'' in the region.\n  Dr. Gates understands that we need to refine not the objectives of \nour strategy but how we achieve our goals. The President and Dr. Gates \nremain committed to a course of action that achieves the goals best \narticulated by Dr. Zalmay Khalilzad, United States Ambassador to Iraq. \nHe stated: ``Our goal is to enable Iraqis to develop a multi-ethnic, \nmulti-sectarian representative democracy . . .'' that can fully meet is \nsecurity obligations.\n  I appreciate his comments that he is ``open to a wide range of ideas \nand proposals.'' I know that he is a leader who will review the options \nand advise the President on what he believes is the best way to \nproceed.\n  Some of those innovative ideas will be found in the New Army Field \nManual for Counterinsurgency Warfare. This is a vital document that \nwill directly address what I have heard from many returning soldiers, \nthat the Army's culture is one that emphasizes the use of firepower and \nconventional warfare rather stability and counterinsurgency operations. \nThis new doctrine will immediately begin to transform our tactics and \ntraining, thereby being enormously helpful to our troops in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Dr. Gates has my full support. These are trying times for our Nation. \nOur resolve is being tested. I know that Dr. Gates is the right man to \nadvise the President on the means to achieve our goals and help the \nIraqi people usher in a new era in that country.\n  I yield the floor. PERSONAL COMPUTER\\J\\059060-A06DE6-043-*****-*****-\nPayroll No.: 83315 -Name: ys update -Folios: 464s-465s -Date: 12/06/\n2006 -Subformat:\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Robert Gates to succeed Donald Rumsfeld as the next \nSecretary of Defense.\n  I applaud the Senate Armed Services Committee and Senators Warner and \nLevin for moving this nomination to the floor in a prompt but \nthoughtful manner.\n  I was heartened to see the forthrightness and candidness employed by \nDr. Gates at his confirmation hearing yesterday.\n  He fully admitted the need for a ``change of approach'' in Iraq, \nstating his view that we are not currently winning the war and that the \n``status quo'' is unacceptable.\n  Additionally, he expressed a willingness to use ``fresh eyes'' in \nlooking for solutions and promised to keep all options on the table.\n  He committed to cooperating with the Congress in pursuing its \noversight responsibilities and said he would always speak boldly and \ncandidly about what he believed.\n  Finally, Dr. Gates talked about the complexities of the situation in \nIraq, acknowledging that a number of major mistakes had been made, \nincluding: the lack of appreciation for how ``broken'' Iraq was \neconomically, socially, and politically, and the costs associated when \nwe invaded and the problems created by the mobilization of the Iraqi \nArmy and the role that our deBaathification policy played in stoking \nthe current insurgency.\n\n  It is my sincere hope that Dr. Gates' nomination signals that the \nadministration intends to pursue a new direction in Iraq, and the \nMiddle East region as a whole. The President should see the strong \nsupport for Dr. Gates as a call from Congress for moving away from the \n``stay the course'' strategy he has pursued.\n  I hope that Dr. Gates will work with Congress to establish a clear-\neyed and\n\n[[Page S11286]]\n\npragmatic approach toward our Nation's defense policy and seek to \nrestore the morale of our military.\n  I hope Dr. Gates will be open to dissenting views and allow the \nmilitary personnel around him to share unvarnished, independent advice.\n  Dr. Gates is a well-qualified candidate for this critical position. \nHis service at the top levels of the CIA and the National Security \nCouncil has provided close insights into the Pentagon's operations and \npolicies.\n  As a former member of the Iraq Study Group, ISG, Dr. Gates \nunderstands the complex challenges our Nation faces. He will be in a \nunique position to implement the recommendations in the ISG report, and \nother options for pursuing a new strategy.\n  It is clear to me that during the recent midterm elections the \nAmerican people voiced their disapproval with this administration's \nIraq policies and voted for a change of course.\n  And the time for changing the course is now.\n  The Iraq War has now lasted longer than the United States involvement \nin World War II. More than 2,900 troops have been killed since March \n19, 2003. More than 3,000 Iraqis are being killed in sectarian violence \nevery month.\n  Today our military is stretched thin and its readiness diminished. \nSome of our troops are now on their third and fourth rotations. And, \nover in Iraq and Afghanistan, our military's equipment is wearing out \nor being destroyed at a cost of nearly $20 billion a year.\n  Ultimately, this war can only be won politically.\n  Our Nation must make it clear to the Iraqi government that this is \nnot an open-ended commitment. Iraqis must step forward and take \nresponsibility for their own security. Only they can make their country \na stable state.\n  The administration's war planning was shortsighted and ill-conceived. \nBy failing to provide adequate troops to secure Iraq, its \ninfrastructure, its weapons depots, and its streets, this \nadministration placed the entire mission in Iraq in jeopardy.\n  Dr. Gates has stated that he intends to improve the Department of \nDefense's planning efforts in regards to postcombat operations--a \ncapability sorely missing from the current leadership.\n  I am also encouraged by Dr. Gates apparent willingness to involve \nIran and Syria in diplomatic dialogue--a stark contrast from the Bush \nadministration's current policy.\n  I hope that President Bush will accept the advice of the Iraq Study \nGroup and Dr. Gates to engage in diplomacy to solve this crisis.\n  Additionally, Dr. Gates has expressed concerns regarding the \nPentagon's continued expansion of intelligence activities since the \nSeptember 11, 2001, attacks.\n  I share these concerns and look forward to working with Dr. Gates and \nAmbassador Negroponte to ensure that there is an appropriate and \ntransparent division of responsibilities between military and civilian \nintelligence agencies.\n  Fifteen years ago, Dr. Gates came before the Senate as President \nGeorge H.W. Bush's nominee to become the Director of Central \nIntelligence, DCI.\n  During 4 days of hearings, a number of questions were raised \nregarding his involvement and knowledge of the Iran-Contra scandal. In \naddition, allegations were aired regarding the manipulation of \nintelligence for political purposes.\n  These are serious concerns.\n  But what is critical to me today is that he shows an independent mind \nand willingness to eschew ideology and partisanship to do what is best \nfor our men and women in uniform.\n  It is clearly time for instituting new leadership at the Pentagon--\nsomething I first called for almost a year ago. But such a change will \nonly matter if the President himself is willing to pursue a different \ncourse.\n  I am looking forward to working with Dr. Gates on defense matters, to \naddress the needs of our troops and their families, and to finally \nbring about a change in our Iraq policy--certainly the time is far past \ndue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Dr. Robert M. \nGates to be Secretary of Defense.\n  The position of Secretary of Defense has always been one of the most \nimportant Cabinet positions in our country. Never has that importance \nbeen more clear than now, as we must decide on a path forward in the \nglobal war on terror, including Iraq.\n  I share my colleagues' concerns about the deteriorating conditions in \nIraq. We must carefully assess the current situation in that country as \nwell as our future involvement in Iraq. I am hopeful that Dr. Gates \nwill help us accomplish these goals. He has experience with the current \nsituation in Iraq as a former member of the bipartisan Baker-Hamilton \nIraq Study Group. As part of that group, he has traveled to Iraq and \nmet with Iraqi leaders and U.S. military commanders. I am optimistic \nthat he will use this experience and knowledge to help chart a course \nin Iraq that results in the stabilization of that country.\n  I also hope that as a former member of the Baker-Hamilton Iraq Study \nGroup, Dr. Gates will carefully review and analyze the Iraq Study \nGroup's report, which was released this morning. I believe that report \nmakes some very good recommendations and can serve as a vehicle for \nsome changes relating to our policy in Iraq. I look forward to \ndiscussing those recommendations further in this Chamber.\n  The report recommends ``new and enhanced diplomatic and political \nefforts in Iraq and the region, and a change in the primary mission of \nU.S. forces in Iraq that will enable the United States to begin to move \nits combat forces out of Iraq responsibly.'' Renewed diplomatic and \npolitical efforts in the region make sense so that we can work with \nIraqis to stabilize their country in the spirit of reconciliation. As \nthe Baker-Hamilton report points out, ``if the Iraqi government moves \nforward with national reconciliation, Iraqis will have an opportunity \nfor a better future, terrorism will be dealt a blow, stability will be \nenhanced in an important part of the world, and America's credibility, \ninterests and values will be protected.'' In my mind, these have always \nbeen our goals in Iraq, and I look forward to working with Dr. Gates \nand my colleagues to accomplish those goals in a responsible way.\n  There are other recommendations in the report that are equally \nimportant. One such recommendation is that ``[t]he primary mission of \nU.S. forces in Iraq should evolve to one of supporting the Iraqi army . \n. .'' While I have never supported setting an artificial timetable for \nwithdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq, I believe the Iraqi Government must \ntake responsibility for their country. As such this recommendation \nregarding our troops' future role in Iraq makes sense, and I will work \nwith Dr. Gates on this recommendation.\n  One other recommendation that I want to briefly reference is that \n``the United States should provide additional political, economic and \nmilitary support for Afghanistan . . .'' The global war on terror is a \nmultifront war, and we must continue to focus on each of those fronts. \nI hope Dr. Gates will use his knowledge and experience to help Congress \nand the President make decisions about the full global war on terror, \nincluding operations in Afghanistan. Our work in Afghanistan is \nimportant, and I hope Dr. Gates will help us ensure that we do not lose \nsight of our near- and long-term goals in the overall global war on \nterror.\n  Dr. Gates has a long record of service in the area of national \nsecurity, which I believe will serve him well as Secretary of Defense. \nHe has 26 years of national security experience, including serving as \nan intelligence adviser to six different Presidents. He has worked at \nboth the Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, and the National Security \nCouncil, including serving as the Director of the CIA.\n  Dr. Gates also has a distinguished career in public service. That \nservice began almost 40 years ago when he was commissioned as an \nofficer in the Air Force in 1967. He has received the Presidential \nCitizens Medal and the National Security Medal, as well as two National \nIntelligence Distinguished Service Medals and three Distinguished \nIntelligence Medals.\n  Mr. President, for all of these reasons, I support the nomination of \nDr. Robert M. Gates to be Secretary of Defense. I look forward to \nworking with him in the coming years on issues relating to Iraq, the \nentire global war on terror, and other issues important to our \ncountry's defense.\n\n[[Page S11287]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee voted unanimously in favor of Robert Gates' nomination to be \nSecretary of Defense. Following robust debate in the Senate, I plan to \nvote in favor of Dr. Gates' nomination.\n  During Dr. Gates' testimony before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I was encouraged by his candid assessment of the situation \nin Iraq. Dr. Gates acknowledged that we are not winning in Iraq and the \nstatus quo is unacceptable. He signaled his willingness to actively \nsolicit the advice of military leaders on the ground and to work with \nmembers of both parties to develop a coherent strategy for Iraq. Dr. \nGates' testimony was straightforward and refreshing. It is a step in \nthe right direction toward resolving the crisis in Iraq.\n  At the same time the full Senate began debate on Dr. Gates' \nnomination, the Iraq Study Group released their recommendations for \noverhauling our policy in Iraq. The commission's report was stark and \nsobering and described the current situation in Iraq as grave and \ndeteriorating.\n  I wholeheartedly agree with the Iraq Study Group's assessment that \nour commitment to Iraq should not be open-ended. U.S. support for the \nIraqi government is strong, but Iraqi leaders must immediately make the \nnecessary political decisions to create a sustainable political \nsettlement.\n  As a member of the Iraq Study Group prior to his nomination, it is my \nhope Dr. Gates will heed the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group \nand encourage the Bush administration to change course in Iraq.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nRobert Gates to be Secretary of Defense. I believe that a change of \nleadership at the Pentagon will signal a new course of action in Iraq.\n  During his nomination hearing yesterday before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, Dr. Gates spoke the truth about the war in Iraq. In \na very plain spoken way, he leveled with the American people when he \nadmitted that we are not winning in Iraq. His ability to admit that \nIraq is in chaos leads me to believe that he will provide independent \nadvice to the President and speak truth to power.\n  Our brave military men and women in uniform have done everything \nasked of them in Iraq. The failure of this administration to develop a \nrealistic strategy for Iraq is the reason why we are not winning. Our \nmilitary defeated the armed forces of Iraq, captured Saddam Hussein, \nand helped provide for three elections in Iraq. They cannot force a \nnational reconciliation in Iraq and they cannot impose a political \ncompromise.\n  The stress on our military is causing readiness to suffer and placing \nour military families under tremendous strain. Today's Iraq Study Group \nreport says that ``U.S. military forces, especially our ground forces, \nhave been stretched nearly to the breaking point by the repeated \ndeployments in Iraq, with attendant casualties (almost 3,000 dead and \nmore than 21,000 wounded), greater difficulty in recruiting, and \naccelerated wear on equipment.'' This is an unsustainable situation.\n  I look forward to working with Dr. Gates on improving the mental \nhealth policies and programs of the Department of Defense. We must not \ndeploy military personnel with serious mental health conditions, such \nas posttraumatic stress disorder, and we should ensure that proper \ntreatment is provided for those in need.\n  It is time for a change in course in Iraq and a change at the \nPentagon is a step in the right direction.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of \nRobert Gates to be the 22nd Secretary of Defense.\n  Dr. Gates comes to this position with a lifetime of service to his \nNation and fellow Americans. He has served his country in uniform, as a \ncivil servant, a policymaker and as an adviser to six Presidents, both \nDemocrat and Republican. He has also served America by running one of \nour top institutions of higher learning, Texas A University and by \nserving on the boards of institutions such as the National Association \nof State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges and the National \nExecutive Board of the Boy Scouts of America. It is no coincidence that \nat his graduation from William and Mary, he was awarded the Algernon \nSydney Sullivan Award for making the greatest contributions to his \nfellow man.\n  However, it is his character and ability to lead that will be most \ncritical during this time of sweeping and historic challenges facing \nthe Nation and the Department of Defense. We must satisfy ourselves \nthat Dr. Gates not only has a plan to overcome these challenges but the \npersonality, the drive and the skills to do so. That he once again \naccepted the call to national service at a time of grave crisis, \nrequiring his departure from his beloved Texas A, to me speaks \nvolumes about his character and dedication to service.\n  As the Nation faces the imperative of charting a new course and \nstrategy in Iraq, rising violence in Afghanistan, global terrorism, the \nthreats posed by nuclear states such as North Korea and possibly Iran \nand the increasing strains on our military, America requires a leader \nof Bob Gates's caliber, who has the national security experience, the \npolitical acumen and the managerial style necessary to mend rifts that \nhave resulted in the loss of America's certainty and optimism. He will \nbe responsible for ensuring a strong working relationship between the \nDepartment of Defense and Congress, trust between the civilian and \nmilitary leadership in the Pentagon, and the credibility of the \nDepartment with the American public.\n  To accomplish this in the relatively brief but critical tenure he \nwill have at the Pentagon, he will have to rely on his pragmatism and \nhis ability to work with others to develop consensus in order to create \nthe unified approach that is currently lacking in meeting our Nation's \nchallenges. In his previous service, he has shown he has the ability to \nwork with both sides with a high degree of competency and integrity--\nand I believe this capacity to work in a bipartisan fashion is critical \nto our ability to work through the challenges we face today.\n  One of his primary goals at the Department will be to foster mutual \nrespect between our senior military leaders and the civilian leadership \nin the Pentagon. I look for him to provide our military leaders a clear \nvoice on military operations. I believe he will listen to them and take \ntheir advice on such matters as planning for postcombat operations and \nforce structure considerations in a manner that has been too long \ndormant.\n  As Dr. Gates assumes the helm at the Department of Defense he will be \nresponsible for a variety of challenges ranging from the ongoing \ntransformation of our forces, balancing operations, procurement and \nmodernization accounts so our military forces have the tools they need \nto prevail now and in the future, to preparing those forces to meet \nglobal challenges from the Taiwan Straits to the jungles of South \nAmerica.\n  Another issue of concern facing Dr. Gates is the Department of \nDefense's relationship with other executive branch agencies such as the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the intelligence agencies. In Dr. \nGates' written answers to the questions posed by the Armed Service \nCommittee, he states that DHS and DOD have the common goal of \nprotecting the United States and that he will support any steps that \ncan be taken to improve and strengthen interagency cooperation so that \nall agencies are prepared for and able to respond to threats facing the \nU.S. homeland.\n  As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I have \nwitnessed egregious intelligence failures and a sweeping reorganization \nof the entire community. I have also emphasized the need to improve \ninformation sharing and strengthen interagency cooperation.\n  Dr. Gates has recently written that he was ``unhappy about the \ndominance of the Defense Department in the intelligence arena and the \ndecline in the CIA's central role'' and that ``close cooperation \nbetween the military and the CIA in both clandestine operations and \nintelligence collection is essential.'' He also wrote that ``for the \nlast decade, intelligence authority has been quietly leaching from the \nCIA to and to the Pentagon, not the other way around.'' During General \nHayden's nomination hearing, I noted that one of General Hayden's \nprimary challenges would be synchronizing the gears of our Nation's\n\n[[Page S11288]]\n\nintelligence collection capability. I believe Dr. Gates will now meet \nthe challenge of synchronizing those gears at the Defense Department.\n  As someone who has had worked in the intelligence community for more \nthan 27 years, I am confident that he is up to the task. I implore Dr. \nGates to maintain that close cooperation so that, in his words, ``all \nagencies are prepared for and able to respond to the threats facing the \nhomeland.''\n  In fact, it was while he was the Director of Central Intelligence in \n1992 that he testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, of \nwhich I was a member, about the need for the Defense Department and the \nIntelligence Community to cooperate saying, ``Our national security \ninstitutions, especially defense and intelligence, must change--and \nthey are changing dramatically--to meet the new and different \nchallenges of this new and different world.'' At that hearing Dr. Gates \nalso warned us that aside from traditional issues of national security, \nwe should be alert to other dangers such as terrorism that cannot ``be \nresolved simply through the application of military force or \ndiplomacy.''\n  Dr. Gates clearly understood then and understands now America's \npreeminent role in leading the spread of democracy and performing \nglobal policing, yet he also recognizes the regional and sectarian \nnature of 21st century conflict. This sense of historical realism will \nstand him in good stead as he grapples with what is and will be his \ngreatest and most pressing challenge--the U.S. involvement in Iraq.\n  Dr. Gates is well versed in Middle East affairs, especially in Iraq \nand Afghanistan--having been the deputy national security adviser \nduring the 1991 gulf war and providing oversight of U.S.-sponsored \noperations in Afghanistan under President Reagan. More recently, he \ncochaired a study at the Council on Foreign Studies in 2004 on U.S. \nrelations towards Iran. Among the study's primary recommendations was \nthat the U.S. directly engage with Iran on a diplomatic level and \nregarding Iranian nuclear programs.\n  He also recently served as part of the Iraq Study Group that is \nreleasing its recommendations regarding U.S. strategic options this \nweek. By all accounts, Dr. Gates spent considerable time in Iraq \ntalking to Iraqis, soldiers, military leaders and diplomats to \nunderstand the myriad and intertwined complexities that will shape the \nfuture of Iraq. This understanding will be critical as he will have to \nproceed at full speed when he becomes Secretary--for we are long past \nthe point where time is of the essence.\n  I believe that Robert Gates understands that we are at a critical \njuncture. As he said in his testimony yesterday, we are not winning the \nwar in Iraq. He is straightforward in his approach and his language, \nand I believe he will offer a different and pragmatic approach. He \nrightly said during his testimony that there is not a military solution \nto Iraq--that this requires a political solution, and I believe he will \nsignal to the Iraqi government that they and the Iraqi people need to \ndecide if an Iraqi nation is more important to them than their \nsectarian interests. Because we can't decide that for them, and we \ncan't make that happen for them.\n  There is no question that staying the course in Iraq is neither an \noption nor a plan and that the patience of the Congress and the \nAmerican people is finite and our presence there is neither unlimited \nnor unconditional. I urge him to seek the advice of his military \ncommanders regarding the roles and missions of our troops and to work \nin a bipartisan fashion with Congress to implementing the findings and \nrecommendations of the Iraq Study Group.\n  In closing, it is critical is that this nomination represents a \ncommitment by the administration to unite our Nation to bring a lasting \nresolution to the war in Iraq. A new perspective at the Pentagon from a \nDefense Secretary confirmed on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis, \ncoupled with the release of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group's consensus \nrecommendations, must serve as a catalyst for cooperation in \nestablishing a unified plan for progress and transition in Iraq. In \nfact, with the confluence of these two events, this day must become a \npivot point for our presence in Iraq.\n  Bob Gates' temperament, reputation, and experience has prepared him \nwell for this challenging assignment and I have every faith that he \nwill serve our Nation well as the Secretary of Defense. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote to confirm Dr. Robert Gates to be our 22nd Secretary \nof Defense.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this legislation, S. 2568 and its House \ncompanion H.R. 5466, the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National \nHistoric Trail Designation Act, would create the Nation's first \nnational ``watertrail'' and honor one of America's earliest explorers, \nCaptain John Smith and the vital role he played in the founding of the \nfirst permanent English settlement in North America at Jamestown, VA, \nand in exploring the Chesapeake Bay region during the years 1607 to \n1609.\n  Many Americans are aware of the upcoming 400th anniversary of \nJamestown next year. The celebration is expected to draw record numbers \nof visitors to this area, including Queen Elizabeth II, as part of her \nrecently announced state visit. What may not be as well known is that \nJamestown and John Smith's voyages of exploration in present-day \nVirginia and Maryland were our Nation's starting points. America has \nits roots right here in the Chesapeake Bay region nearly 400 years \nago--13 years before the founding of the Plymouth colony--when the \nJamestown colonists disembarked from their three small ships on May 13, \n1607. Under the leadership of Captain John Smith, the fledgling colony \nnot only survived but helped ignite a new era of discovery in the New \nWorld.\n  With a dozen men in a 30-foot open boat, Smith's expeditions in \nsearch of food for the new colony and the fabled Northwest Passage took \nhim nearly 3,000 miles around the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries \nfrom the Virginia capes to the mouth of the Susquehanna. On his voyages \nand as president of the Jamestown Colony, Captain Smith became the \nfirst point of contact for scores of Native-American leaders from \naround the bay region. His friendship with Pocahontas is now an \nimportant part of American folklore. Smith's notes describing the \nindigenous people he met and the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem are still \nwidely studied by historians, environmental scientists, and \nanthropologists. Chief Justice John Marshall wrote of the significance \nof Smith's explorations: ``When we contemplate the dangers, and the \nhardships he encountered, and the fortitude, courage and patience with \nwhich he met them; when we reflect on the useful and important \nadditions which he made to the stock of knowledge respecting America, \nthen possessed by his countrymen; we shall not hesitate to say that few \nvoyages of discovery, undertaken at any time, reflect more honour on \nthose engaged in them, than this does on Captain Smith.''\n  What better way to commemorate this important part of our Nation's \nhistory and honor John Smith's courageous voyages than by designating \nthe Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail? The Congress \nestablished the National Trails System ``to provide for the ever-\nincreasing outdoor recreation needs of an expanding population and in \norder to promote the preservation of, public access to, travel within, \nand enjoyment and appreciation of the open-air, outdoor areas and \nhistoric resources of the Nation.'' National Historic Trails such as \nthe Lewis and Clark Trail, the Pony Express Trail, the Trail of Tears, \nand the Selma to Montgomery Trail were authorized as part of this \nsystem to identify and protect historic routes for public use and \nenjoyment and to commemorate major events which shaped American \nhistory. In my judgment, the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National \nHistoric Trail is a fitting addition to the 13 national historic trails \nadministered by the National Park Service.\n  Pursuant to legislation we enacted as part of the Fiscal 2006 \nInterior Appropriations Act, in September 2006 the National Park \nService completed a detailed study which found that the trail meets all \nthree criteria for designation as a national historic trail: it is \nnationally significant, has a documented route through maps or \njournals, and provides for recreational opportunities. Similar in \nhistoric importance to the Lewis and Clark National Trail, this new \nhistoric trail will inspire generations of Americans and visitors to \nfollow Smith's journeys, to learn about\n\n[[Page S11289]]\n\nthe roots of our Nation, and to better understand the contributions of \nthe Native Americans who lived within the bay region. Equally \nimportant, the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail \nwill serve as a national outdoor resource by providing rich \nopportunities for education, recreation, and heritage tourism not only \nfor more than 16 million Americans living in the bay's watershed but \nfor visitors to this area. The water trail would allow voyagers in \nsmall boats, cruising boats, kayaks, and canoes to travel from the \ndistant headwaters to the open bay--an accomplishment that will \ngenerate national and international attention and participation. The \ntrail would complement the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails \nProgram and help highlight the bay's remarkable maritime history, its \nunique watermen and their culture, the diversity of its peoples, its \nhistorical settlements, and our current efforts to restore and sustain \nthe world's most productive estuary.\n  This legislation enjoys strong bipartisan support in the Congress and \nin the States through which the trail passes. The trail proposal has \nbeen endorsed by the Governors of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, \nMaryland, and numerous local governments throughout the Chesapeake Bay \nregion. The measure is also strongly supported by the National \nGeographic Society, the Conservation Fund, the Garden Club of America, \nthe Izaak Walton League of America, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and \nthe Chesapeake Bay Commission as well as scores of businesses, tourism \nleaders, private groups, and intergovernmental bodies. I want to \nespecially recognize and commend Patrick Noonan, chairman emeritus of \nthe Conservation Fund, for his vision in conceiving this trail. I also \nwant to thank the cosponsors of this measure, Senators Warner, \nMikulski, Allen, Carper, Biden, Santorum, Specter, Representative Jo \nAnn Davis, and the cosponsors of the House companion measure, as well \nas the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources and the Subcommittee on National Parks. Finally, \nI want to recognize and thank Judy Pensabene and David Brooks of the \nSenate Energy Committee staff and Ann Loomis in Senator Warner's office \nfor the tremendous assistance they provided in moving the measure \nforward.\n  The Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail Act comes \nat a very timely juncture to educate Americans about historical events \nthat occurred 400 years ago right here in Chesapeake Bay, which were so \ncrucial to the formation of this great country and our democracy. I \nurge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Robert M. Gates to be the next Secretary of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  I believe that the defense and security challenges that our Nation \nfaces at this moment are greater than we have faced in decades, and the \nstrains on our Active Duty and National Guard and Reserve forces are \ncommensurate with those challenges.\n  After much careful thought, going back to this body's consideration \nof Dr. Gates' nomination to lead the Central Intelligence Agency in \n1991, I am convinced that he will provide the Department of Defense and \nour uniformed service members the competent leadership that they \ndeserve that he will approach the necessity to change course in Iraq \nwith great urgency and that he will provide the President with the \npragmatic advice that this country so desperately needs; that his \nstewardship of the Department of Defense will include developing a \ncooperative and productive relationship with Congress; and that his \ncareer in the intelligence community will benefit the Government as the \nreorganization of our intelligence community continues.\n  I have been impressed with Dr. Gates' sincerity in his comments \nregarding the obligation we as policymakers owe the uniformed service \nmembers who carry out the policies we make. His testimony yesterday \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee included a moving statement \nabout his relationships with members and former members of the Corps of \nCadets at Texas A University, 12 of whom have lost their lives in the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Like Dr. Gates, I am moved by the extraordinary sense of duty and \nservice that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines possess and by \nthe extraordinary sacrifices they make willingly on our behalf. We must \nmeet the fundamental obligation to serve them as well as they serve us. \nThey deserve thoughtful and effective policies; they deserve to be set \nup for success in their missions; they deserve to be properly trained \nand equipped; and they deserve to be ever confident that their welfare \nis never subject to partisan political considerations within their \ncivilian chain of command. Anything less is unworthy of these heroes.\n  I am strongly hopeful that Dr. Gates' long and distinguished career \nin public service, particularly in critical national security roles, \ngives him the proper perspective on the duties we owe our men and women \nin uniform. I am confident he will exercise these duties with great \ncare and concern, particularly with regard to those service members who \nare in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I also note Dr. Gates' candor and independence of thought, both in \nhis public comments of recent years and in answering the questions of \nthe members of the Senate Armed Services Committee during the \nconfirmation process. Prior to his nomination as the next Secretary of \nDefense, Dr. Gates served on two noteworthy bodies whose work is highly \nrelevant to the challenges he will undertake at the Department of \nDefense. First, in 2004 he cochaired a Council on Foreign Relations \ntask force with former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski \nthat resulted in a report entitled, ``Iran: Time for a New Approach.'' \nIt is my hope that ``time for a new approach'' is a phrase that \ncharacterizes Dr. Gates' overall approach to many of the issues he will \nencounter at the Pentagon, but I would make special note of the fact \nthat in this report, he recommended that the United States engage in \ndirect talks with Iran. If this recommendation of engagement and \nproactive diplomacy is characteristic of the advice he will provide to \nthe President in his new position, it will be a welcome change.\n  Second, prior to his nomination, Dr. Gates served on the Iraq Study \nGroup, whose recommendations for a major change in course in Iraq we \nheard today. Dr. Gates' service on this body shows that he recognized \nearly on that the administration's policy in Iraq was not working and \nneeded a change in course. Since his nomination, I have been very \npleased with his comments, particularly in his written answers to the \nSenate Armed Services Committee questions and in his testimony \nyesterday, regarding the urgent need for change in our Iraq policy. \nUnlike the previous Secretary of Defense and unlike the President \nhimself, Dr. Gates has acknowledged forthrightly that the number of \ntroops we sent to Iraq for the postwar period was insufficient. He \nrecognizes that the planning for the postwar period was both inadequate \nand flawed and that the result now is a status quo that is absolutely \nunacceptable and must be changed with great urgency.\n\n  As many of my colleagues have noted, this is a fresh and candid \nperspective that has been sorely lacking in this administration for 6 \nyears. It is my hope and expectation that Dr. Gates' independence of \nthought and bold push for necessary change will mark his tenure as our \nnext Secretary of Defense.\n  In my capacity as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence in the 110th Congress, I will be particularly interested \nin how Dr. Gates will handle the relationship between the Department of \nDefense and the intelligence community, which is still developing \nfollowing the recent intelligence reforms and which I will be focusing \non closely in the coming months.\n  This relationship is crucial to the production of accurate, unbiased \nintelligence, which in turn is essential for the development of sound \nnational security policy for our country. As vice chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, I have spent 3\\1/2\\ years reviewing \nprewar intelligence on Iraq. We have found inadequate intelligence, \ninaccurate intelligence, ignored intelligence, and distorted \nintelligence, the sum of which led to a disastrous decision to take \nthis country to war. This is a situation which cannot be repeated.\n\n[[Page S11290]]\n\n  One of the principal concerns throughout the Intelligence Committee's \nIraq inquiry has been the question of politicization of intelligence. \nThis is an issue well known to Dr. Gates because it was a charge \nleveled at him in 1991 during his confirmation to be Director of \nCentral Intelligence. Unresolved questions about possible \npoliticization greatly influenced my opposition to confirming him for \nthat position, and I am even more keenly concerned about maintaining \nthe integrity of the analytic process based on my experience with the \nIraq inquiry.\n  Fortunately, his service as the Director of Central Intelligence and \nhis continuing contribution to the Nation since then have allayed the \nconcerns I had in 1991. While his tenure as DCI was short, he \naccomplished a great deal. In a 1992 message to the CIA workforce he \nwrote ``seeking truth is what we are all about as an institution, as \nprofessionals and as individuals, the possibility--even the \nperception--that the quest may be tainted deeply troubles us, as it \nlong has and as it should.'' While he disputed the specific accusations \nof politicization, he learned from the process. He established a task \nforce to address politicization, and he implemented changes based on \nthe task forces recommendation. I am encouraged that he will bring that \nexperience to this new job as one of the primary consumers of \nintelligence.\n  I also am encouraged by Dr. Gates' views on the proper role of the \nDefense Department in relation to the CIA. Earlier this year he wrote \nof his unhappiness with what he viewed as an inappropriate dominance by \nthe Defense Department. There is plenty of work for all of our \nintelligence agencies, but that work needs to be properly distributed \nand coordinated, and I think he understands the importance of that \nbalance. I look forward to working closely with Dr. Gates on this issue \nif he is confirmed.\n  At his confirmation hearing, Dr. Gates demonstrated several qualities \nthat I think make him a good choice for this job. He is smart but not \narrogant. He is tough-minded without being closed-minded. And he is \nclearly taking on this enormous responsibility out of a sense of public \nservice. I will support his nomination, and I hope he is confirmed.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, our next Secretary of Defense will face \nunprecedented and wide-ranging challenges. Terrorist networks are \ndeveloping new capabilities and sources of support around the world, \nthe Taliban and al- Qaida are resurgent in Afghanistan, our military is \nover-stretched--all while the administration continues to devote so \nmuch of its resources to a self-defeating, Iraq-centric strategy.\n  I am not convinced that the President's nominee for this position, \nRobert Gates, has the will or ability to fix our failed Iraq strategy. \nOnce confirmed, Mr. Gates will answer to the President, and the \nPresident still fails to recognize the need for a new course--one that \nincludes a flexible timetable to redeploy troops from Iraq and re-focus \non the fight against terrorism. Until the President recognizes that his \nIraq policy is undermining our national security, simply changing one \nadvisor for another may not make that big a difference.\n  Nonetheless, I will vote to confirm Mr. Gates. I believe that a \npresident should be given great deference in selecting his cabinet. And \nMr. Gates showed a refreshing candor and humility in his testimony this \nweek--qualities that have been sorely lacking in this administration. \nHe acknowledged that the United States is not ``winning'' in Iraq and \nthat the status quo is not acceptable, and said that ``all options are \non the table.''\n  There remain serious questions stemming from his role in Iran/Contra \nand charges that he politicized intelligence. I do not take these \nlightly. However, Mr. Gates is intelligent, experienced and well \nqualified for the position. And I am pleased that he indicated a \nwillingness to work with the Director of National Intelligence ``to \nensure that he has the authority that he needs to fulfill his \nresponsibilities.'' I am also encouraged by his statement that he \nexpects intelligence professionals to ``call the shots as they see them \nand not try and shape their answers to meet a policy need.''\n  I hope that Mr. Gates will follow through on these and other \ncommitments. And I will continue working to change our Iraq policy so \nthat we can devote greater resources to our top national security \npriority--going after the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and their \nallies.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my opposition to \nthe nomination of Robert Gates to be Secretary of Defense.\n  The safety and security of the American people must be our \nGovernment's top priority. We need to continue to do everything we can \nto protect our homeland. We cannot place our heads in the sand and \nignore the fact that we remain a nation at war. Daily we face brutal \nenemies that despise the very principles that we stand for and our way \nof life.\n  At this time of war, our President and our Nation rely on the \nSecretary of Defense to provide sound advice and to lead our Armed \nForces as they continue to combat our enemies. The Secretary of Defense \nhas the responsibility of leading the strongest and most capable \nmilitary in the world. He must be a man of vision who can adequately \nassess threats against our national security and formulate the best \nresponse to these threats.\n  The President nominated Mr. Gates for a managerial post of great \ndifficulty and complexity, and I do not believe that he is the best \nperson to help us meet our Nation's critical challenges. Mr. Gates has \nrepeatedly criticized our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan without \nproviding any viable solutions to the problems our troops currently \nface. I am concerned with the message he is sending to our troops and \nour allies around the world. We need a Secretary of Defense to think \nforward with solutions and not backward on history we cannot change.\n  Mr. Gates also believes in directly engaging rogue nations such as \nIran and Syria that are known sponsors of terrorist groups in Iraq, \nLebanon and the West Bank and Gaza. I do not support inviting \nterrorists to the negotiating table. Such a shift in our Nation's \nforeign policy could have grave consequences for our national security.\n  Let me be clear that I am not here today to discredit Robert Gates' \nrecord of public service to our Nation. I am here to raise concerns \nwith his nomination to be Secretary of Defense. It is a position of \nimmense importance and carries a great deal of responsibility.\n  It is for these reservations that I find myself unable to support the \nnomination of Robert Gates for Secretary of Defense.\n  It is clear from following his Armed Services Committee nomination \nhearing and my colleagues' speeches that Mr. Gates will be confirmed to \nbe the next Secretary of Defense. However, we cannot afford to fail in \nIraq, Afghanistan, and other areas in the war against radical \nterrorists. I hope during Mr. Gates' tenure at the Department of \nDefense that we are able to make peace and progress on all these \nfronts. The future of our country depends on it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, yesterday the Armed Services Committee \nconducted a thorough hearing on the nomination of Dr. Robert Gates to \nbe the next Secretary of Defense. I commend Senator Warner and Senator \nLevin for their leadership in holding a hearing which may be regarded \nas one of the most informative, important hearings to take place before \nthat committee in recent years.\n  Dr. Gates also deserves credit for the forthright tone of the \nhearing. His testimony to the committee was marked by candor and a \nserious discussion of the complex challenges before our country. In a \nrefreshing change, rather than toeing the administration's line, Dr. \nGates's testimony appeared to reflect his own views on the situation in \nIraq, our Nation's approach to the Middle East, the difficulties facing \nour military, and a number of other issues.\n  He sensibly acknowledged that real changes are needed in the \nadministration's policy toward Iraq, that long-rumored plans of an \nattack on Iran or Syria would have dramatic consequences that would \nfurther endanger the region and the world, and that our military is \nbeing strained by the war in Iraq.\n  Dr. Gates appears to be set to be confirmed by the Senate as the next \nSecretary of Defense, but he will be walking into a buzz saw. The \ncurrent leadership of the Pentagon, in its arrogance\n\n[[Page S11291]]\n\nand disdain for the Constitution, has alienated Congress and has \nseriously undermined the credibility of the Defense Department in a \ntime of war. One of the first orders of business for the next Secretary \nof Defense will be to demonstrate to Congress and to the American \npeople that the Defense Department is not a power unto itself, but it \nis a servant of the people. I have urged Dr. Gates to take that mission \nto heart and to make meaningful consultation with Congress, as the \npeople's branch of Government, an absolute priority.\n  I have worked with Dr. Gates before, during his years of service in \nthe Central Intelligence Agency. But this experience alone would not be \nsufficient to secure my support of his nomination. My primary concern \nwith his nomination was not whether Dr. Gates had performed well in the \npast, but how he would approach the challenges that are before him.\n  Mr. President, I will support the nomination of Dr. Gates based upon \nthe candor and independence that he displayed at his nomination \nhearing. I caution, however, that Dr. Gates must be on guard against \nbecoming the moderate face of an administration which may yet be \nreluctant to make any real change in its deeply flawed policies toward \nIraq. The American people need more than a pragmatic spokesman for \nadministration policies, the people deserve a leader who will work to \nchange the administration's dangerous course.\n  I urge Dr. Gates to carry out the candor and fresh thinking that he \ndemonstrated at his confirmation hearing, and I hope the administration \nwill follow Dr. Gates in this new approach.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nconfirmation of Robert Gates to become our Nation's next Secretary of \nDefense.\n  I recently had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Gates in my office. I \nappreciated his frankness, both in my discussions with him as well as \nduring his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  He demonstrated candor and pledged independence that the current \nadministration has been sorely lacking up until now. He also \nacknowledged that at this point, our operations in Iraq must place far \nmore emphasis on finding a political solution rather than continuing to \nplace an undue burden on America's Armed Forces.\n  It is for these reasons that I hope that Dr. Gates will serve as a \ncritical voice for reason, leading our forces toward a proper exit from \nmajor operations in Iraq and toward rebuilding our war-battered Armed \nForces.\n  Dr. Gates seemed to discern the cost of the war in Iraq, which has \nbeen mainly measured in the number of lives lost and U.S. treasury \nspent. Over 2,900 brave American servicemembers have now been killed in \nIraq and over $400 billion in appropriations have been approved by \nCongress.\n  But there is another cost of war--our military's readiness. And, \napparently, unlike his presumed predecessor, who believes that ``you \nhave to go to war with the Army you have, not the Army you want,'' Dr. \nGates has promised to address this issue, if confirmed.\n  Some two-thirds of our Nation's combat brigades are currently unable \nto report for duty according to current reports, largely due to battle-\nworn and damaged equipment. Dr. Gates seems committed to restoring our \nmilitary's readiness and, I hope, will be willing to fully meet the \nArmy's request of $25 billion in fiscal year 2008 to fund the repair, \nreplacement, and recapitalization of this gear.\n  I concede that on a previous occasion I withheld my support for Dr. \nGates when he was nominated for the position of the Director of Central \nIntelligence in 1991. At the time, I raised concerns over his past \ntenure at the CIA, including prior allegations of politicized \nintelligence. By all accounts Mr. Gates did a credible job as the \nDirector of the CIA. It is my hope that his past experience has \nsensitized him to the danger that politicized intelligence can pose to \nour Nation's national security and to the ability of our military \ncommanders to understand and carry out the mission on the ground in \nIraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere as they seek to advance United States \ninterests.\n  In addition, I am also hopeful that Mr. Gates will work with me to \nrevisit the administration's military commissions policy. During our \ndiscussions, we talked about the bill that I introduced last month \ncalled the Effective Terrorists Prosecution Act of 2006 which addresses \nsome of the most serious problems with the bill that the President \nrecently signed into law. I hope that Dr. Gates will consult with \noutside military and legal experts, as well as J.A.G. staff regarding \nthe Military Commissions Act. I would further urge Dr. Gates to halt \nthe Defense Department's plan to award a $125 million contract to build \na new courthouse at Guantanamo Bay, to try detainees. This project was \nneither authorized nor appropriated by the Congress, and in my view, \nconstitutes an egregious waste and abuse of taxpayers dollars on a \nfacility designed to circumvent public and legal scrutiny into the \ntreatment and trying of detainees.\n  Our Nation and our Armed Forces are facing significant challenges, \nand, above all else, Dr. Gates needs to meet today's security concerns \nhead on, swiftly and effectively, without any ideological agenda. \nRecognizing the hard truth, that we are not winning the war in Iraq, \nwas a good first step.\n  Understanding why we aren't winning was a good second step. As Dr. \nGates explained in his testimony, and as many of us have been saying \nfor quite some time, we failed to deploy enough troops in Iraq to win \nthe peace, we mistakenly disbanded the Iraqi Army, and we banned \nthousands of Baath Party members from working in the Iraqi Government. \nOnly by recognizing and understanding that these specific policies have \ncaused so much damage can we begin the work of ameliorating the \nsituation in Iraq.\n  I look forward to working with Dr. Gates in a bipartisan and level-\nheaded manner to address these myriad problems, to adjust United States \npolicy in Iraq and to rebuild our Nation's Armed Forces. This fall, the \nAmerican people voted for change in our Government's policies, \nparticularly in Iraq, and I am hopeful that the confirmation of Dr. \nGates will represent one of these many vital changes.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, my vote today for Robert Gates is a vote \nfor significant change in our Iraq policy.\n  Last month, the American people uniformly rejected the policy-by-\nslogan approach to Iraq, rejected the false choice between ``cut-and-\nrun'' and ``stay the course'' rejected ideological, insular, and \nwrongheaded leadership at the Pentagon. Dr. Gates' challenge will be to \nhelp President Bush chart a new course that takes a realistic view of \nthe deteriorating situation in Iraq and makes the hard decisions to \nsalvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided war.\n  There are several signs that give me hope that Robert Gates is up to \nthis challenge. First and most important is the environment in which \nGates is taking the Pentagon's helm. Following the election, it is \nclear the American people expect significant change in Iraq. President \nBush nominated Gates with a mandate to find ``fresh perspective and new \nideas'' for Iraq. And today's Iraq Study Group's report helped create a \nframework to move forward, in a bipartisan fashion, with a shift in \nU.S. policy. As I laid out in a speech 3 weeks ago, I believe this \nshift must include a phased redeployment of U.S. forces in Iraq, a new \ndiplomatic effort that includes engagement with Iran and Syria and \nother key nations, and a stance that conditions further assistance to \nprogress in Iraq. All of these were also proposed by the Iraq Study \nGroup.\n  Second, in his own congressional testimony and comments, Dr. Gates \nhas expressed openness to new ideas, saying that all options should be \non the table for Iraq. He expressed refreshing candor in admitting past \nmistakes in Iraq. And Gates promised to work in a constructive, \nrespectful way with military commanders, the Iraq Study Group, and \nCongress to find a new way forward.\n  Third is Gates' extensive experience. He served for 26 years in the \nCentral Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council, and he \nwas the only career officer in the CIA's history to rise from entry-\nlevel employee to Director.\n  Everyone knows that Gates' job will not be easy. There are no good \noptions left in Iraq. There is no set of policy changes that can \nguarantee a good outcome. There is a great resistance to\n\n[[Page S11292]]\n\nchange in this administration, from the President down. Among \nPresidential appointees, there still is significant danger in speaking \ntruth to power.\n  The President, Senate, and the American people are putting a great \ndeal on Dr. Gates' shoulders. I am voting for him with the hope that he \ncan make us proud.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for \nthe nomination of Dr. Robert M. Gates to be the Nation's 22nd Secretary \nof Defense. His intelligence, candor, and many years of national \nsecurity experience make him an excellent choice to lead the Pentagon \nand our Nation's troops during this critical time in war on terror.\n  Dr. Gates wore his country's uniform as a U.S. Air Force officer; his \nservice includes time spent with the Strategic Air Command, the \nprestigious unit once charged with protecting America from a nuclear \nattack by the Soviet Union. Dr. Gates's career includes two decades \nwith the CIA, where he started as an entry-level employee and rose to \nthe top position. And he spent 9 years at the National Security \nCouncil. Throughout his Government service, he has advised six \nPresidents.\n  Having previously served as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence \nfrom 1986 to 1989, Assistant to the President and Deputy National \nSecurity Adviser from 1989 to 1991, and Director of Central \nIntelligence from 1991 to 1993, Dr. Gates is one of the most qualified \nnational-security specialists in the country.\n  As DCI he led over 100,000 employees and managed the Agency at a \ncritical juncture at the end of the Cold War. And he has spent the last \n13 years outside of government, giving him both a keen understanding of \nbest business practices and a fresh perspective to tackle America's \nsecurity challenges.\n  Dr. Gates has a proven record of bipartisan cooperation, demonstrated \nmost recently by his tenure with the Iraq Study Group. As a member of \nthat group, he has traveled to Iraq, met Iraqi leaders, and talked to \nour military commanders on the ground. He is ready to hit the ground \nrunning and lead the Pentagon from the day he is confirmed.\n  Five years into the war on terror, America has made great progress. \nBut much hard work still lies ahead, as we continue to defend Americans \nhere at home while fighting abroad the terrorists who would do us harm. \nThe position of Secretary of Defense is more important than ever, and I \nbelieve the President has made an outstanding choice.\n  Dr. Gates has the wisdom and the ability to succeed. He will be a \nstrong leader for the Pentagon and our brave men and women in uniform. \nI urge my colleagues to support his nomination, and I will \nwholeheartedly vote for his confirmation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I intend to support the nomination of Dr. \nRobert Gates as the new Secretary of Defense. I believe he will provide \nthe Department of Defense, and the President's senior team, the new \nperspective and fresh ideas so desperately needed. He is a \ndistinguished and seasoned public servant, and his long experience will \nserve him well in what will be a challenging post.\n  I want to thank Senators Warner and Levin for making sure Dr. Gates \nreceived an expeditious and thorough hearing. With our Nation at war, \nwe could not afford to let his confirmation drag.\n  I am hopeful that, when confirmed, Dr. Gates will serve as an agent \nof change in the administration--most importantly, on Iraq.\n  Yesterday, when asked if we are winning in Iraq, Dr. Gates said \n``no.'' Today, the Iraq Study Group said the situation in Iraq is \n``grave and deteriorating.''\n  The Iraq Study Group has done a tremendous and historic service to \nthe American people and to the troops serving in harm's way in Iraq. \nTheir report underscores the message the American people sent one month \nago: there must be change in Iraq, and there is no time to lose. It is \ntime for the Iraqis to build and secure their nation, and it is time \nfor American combat troops to be redeployed. Each day the situation in \nIraq continues to deteriorate. Time is not on our side.\n  This assessment rings particularly true today, as we learned that 10 \nU.S. troops were killed in fighting across Iraq, bringing the level of \nU.S. deaths to 27 in only the first 6 days of December. On average, \nalmost three U.S. troops are killed each day. We do not have time for \nfinger-pointing and pontificating from politicians--it is time for \naction and leadership.\n  Most experts agree that Iraq is now embroiled in a civil war, and our \ntroops are caught in the middle. Policing a civil war between Shia and \nSunni is not something for which our country or our military consented. \nWe must begin to transition our mission in Iraq, reduce our combat \nfootprint, and begin to extricate our troops from the middle of this \nsectarian strife. In short, we need more than a change in personality \nat the Defense Department, we need a change in policy. I urge the \nPresident to reach out to Congress and work with us to change course.\n  If the administration reaches out in a meaningful way, it will find \nCongress ready and willing to work as a partner. The Senate will do its \npart next year and conduct strong oversight to ensure the President \ncarries out an effective change in policy. Our troops in Iraq, \nincluding hundreds of Nevadans, have sacrificed so much. It is time for \nPresident Bush to reward their effort by bringing the country together \naround a new way forward.\n  Once Dr. Gates is confirmed, I look forward to the Senate working \nwith him and the President on this change of course in Iraq.\n  In addition, I look forward to working with Dr. Gates to change \ncourse on the other key challenges we face. Dr. Gates must come to \nCongress with a solid plan for addressing the readiness of our military \nwhich is under strain and at risk because of the administration's Iraq \nstrategy.\n  Dr. Gates must help the administration develop an effective approach \nfor curbing Iran and North Korea's nuclear ambitions. And Dr. Gates \nmust spearhead a new effort to ensure a successful outcome for \nAfghanistan, as part of a broader fresh look at our strategy for the \nwar on terror, the hunt for Usama bin Laden, and the struggle to \nempower moderates and combat violent extremists. These are serious \nissues that deserve to be addressed properly.\n  Hopefully, Dr. Gates can operate with the same level of candor and \nrealism as Secretary of Defense as he has during his nomination \nprocess. The stakes for our Nation are high, and his task is a great \none, but today, he has our support and a commitment to work together to \nsolve this Nation's national security challenges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I see no other Senators seeking \nrecognition, so I think we may as well--the standing order is the vote \nbegins at 5 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Is all time yielded back?\n  Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Robert M. Gates, of Texas, to be Secretary \nof Defense?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from North Carolina (Mrs. Dole).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from North Carolina (Mrs. \nDole) would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend a gentleman who \nhas served our country with honor, integrity, and distinction for the \npast 6 years and who has sacrificed his energy, a comfortable private \nlife, as well as his personal privacy in service to our men and women \nin uniform during the course of two wars that our country did not \ninvite and did not welcome. That gentleman is Donald Rumsfeld.\n  As I have worked with Secretary Rumsfeld over the last 6 years as a \nU.S. Senator and as a U.S. Representative, he and I have occasionally \ndisagreed, and those disagreements have been very public, very open, \nand very heartfelt on both sides. But there is no question in my mind \nthat Don Rumsfeld has given the President and the United States as much \ncommitment, energy, and service as any previous Secretary of Defense in \nthe history of our great country. For that, this entire country owes \nDon Rumsfeld a debt of gratitude.\n  It sometimes surprises me that we can convince high-quality, \nintelligent, committed people like Donald Rumsfeld to leave private \nlife, often near or at the end of their careers, to take jobs in \ngovernment that require an enormous amount of commitment, sacrifice, \nand sometimes offer few rewards. These individuals could, without \nquestion, be better off financially and sleeping much better and might \neven be happier if they were doing something else. Donald Rumsfeld has \nserved as Secretary of Defense during one of the more difficult times \nin our Nation's history. As a nation, we should be grateful that \nsomeone of his caliber has served as long and with as much distinction \nin the job as he has. I think we as a nation should be grateful, \nregardless of whether we agree or disagree with everything Secretary \nRumsfeld has done or tried to do during his tenure. We should be \ngrateful\n\n[[Page S11295]]\n\nthat one of our own has stepped up to the challenge and taken his job \nas seriously as anyone could have and done his absolute best on behalf \nof the American people.\n  Individuals who step into these jobs in government, particularly at \nthe Cabinet level, need to keep in mind a few basic principles \nregarding why they are there and what they are called to do. First and \nmost importantly, they need to remember they are there to serve the \nPresident and the American people. It is not and never can be about \nthem. Their reward is serving, not recognition or legacy or even \nsuccess. Their reward is answering the call and executing the job they \nhave been given to do to the best of their ability. Donald Rumsfeld has \ndone that, and for that he deserves the gratitude of this Nation.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld has unquestionably been a transformational \nSecretary of Defense. He took the helm at the Pentagon nearing a time \nwhen the Department of Defense was ripe for change, and within 9 months \nof being sworn in, we were a nation at war. However, even that did not \nstop the transformational vision Secretary Rumsfeld brought to the \nPentagon.\n  Some of the transformational actions the Department of Defense \nundertook under Secretary Rumsfeld's leadership include the following: \nappointing the first marine as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; \nappointing the first Navy Admiral to command USSOUTHCOM; returning a \nretired Army general to active duty to become Chief of Staff of the \nArmy; establishing the organization and position of Under Secretary of \nDefense for Intelligence; establishing the first Assistant Secretary of \nDefense for Homeland Defense; establishing the first Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs; creating the U.S. Northern \nCommand; establishing the Proliferation Security Initiative; creating a \nfour-star level task force to counter improvised explosive devices; \ninitiating a global basing posture review; converting Trident ballistic \nmissile submarines to guided-missile submarines; fielding the first \noperational V-22 squadron; and fielding the first operational F-22 \nsquadron.\n\n  Secretary Rumsfeld's accomplishments span the spectrum of DOD \noperations to include every service, procurement programs, research and \ndevelopment programs, personnel issues, DOD organization and \nmanagement, and virtually every facet of the Department's operations. \nHowever, let me focus on the Department's accomplishments in the global \nwar on terrorism during his tenure.\n  Overall: A multinational coalition has liberated 50 million people in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, with formation of representative governments and \nsecurity forces. We have liberated 31 million Afghans from Taliban \ncontrol and destroyed an al-Qaida sanctuary, conquering elements that \nsuccessfully fought off the Soviet Union for over 9 years, and stood up \na Loya Jirga governing council 8 months after operations began. Under \nhis leadership, 26.7 million Iraqis were liberated from a brutal \ndictatorship and turned over sovereignty of the country to a new Iraqi \nGovernment in 16 months. As of November 22, 2006, organized, trained, \nand equipped Iraqi and Afghan security forces into the following \nnumbers: 134,000 for Iraqi Ministry of Defense, 188,000 for Iraqi \nMinistry of Interior, 30,500 for Afghan National Army, and 50,000 for \nAfghan National Police.\n  Conducted safe and secure elections in Afghanistan and Iraq as \nfollows:\n  In Iraq: On January 30, 2005, there was an election to form a \ntransitional national assembly with a 55-percent turnout. On October \n15, 2005, there was an election for constitutional ratification with a \n63-percent turnout. On December 15, 2005, there was an election to form \na permanent national assembly with a 78-percent turnout. And on March \n16, 2006, there was an election to elect the permanent Iraqi \nGovernment, which was then subsequently seated.\n  In Afghanistan, there were the following elections: On January 5, \n2004, adoption of an Afghan Constitution. On October 9, 2004, the first \ndirect Presidential election, with roughly an 80-percent turnout. On \nDecember 7, 2004, an Afghan President was inaugurated. And on September \n18, 2005, the country of Afghanistan held an election to form the \nAfghan National Assembly and Provincial Council.\n  Senior leadership of America's enemies have been captured, killed, or \nput on the run under the leadership of Don Rumsfeld as follows:\n  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, al-Qaida's director of operations, was \ncaptured March 1, 2003. Saddam Hussein's sons were killed on July 22, \n2003. Saddam Hussein was captured on December 13, 2003. Ali Hassan \nMahmud al-Tikriti, AKA Chemical Ali, was captured on August 21, 2003. \nAl Zarqawi, leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, was killed on June 7, 2006. And \n45 of 55 of Saddam's top regime--the deck of cards--have been killed or \ncaptured under Donald Rumsfeld's leadership.\n  Again, we have conducted hundreds of intelligence and tactical \noperations, many with partner nations, throughout the world against \nterrorist organizations directly or loosely affiliated with al-Qaida.\n  President Bush appointed Secretary Rumsfeld to lead the men and women \nof our Armed Forces, and he has led by example. As a member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, I questioned Secretary Rumsfeld many \ntimes during hearings about our national security challenges and the \nneeds of our troops and their families, and I have always been \nconvinced that he had the very best interests of our Nation, as well as \nthe best interests of our men and women in uniform, in mind. I commend \nhim for his service and on behalf of our Nation thank him for his \ncommitment and sacrifice over the last 6 years and, indeed, over the \ncourse of his life, as he has served his country and the American \npeople well.\n  As we say goodbye and commend the service of one Secretary of \nDefense, I would like to also commend the President's choice for his \nsuccessor: Dr. Robert Gates. Dr. Gates and I had a very positive \nmeeting on Monday of this week, and I believe he has the experience, \nqualifications, and candor to serve in this capacity as we move forward \nin helping the Iraqi people take control of their own destiny and \ncontinue transforming the Department of Defense to confront the \nchallenges and opportunities of the 21st century. A fresh approach, new \nideas, and Dr. Gates' understanding of defense and intelligence issues \nwill be a tremendous asset in achieving victory and continuing on the \nlegacy and accomplishments of Secretary Rumsfeld.\n\n  I look forward to working with Dr. Gates as the new Secretary of \nDefense on the national security issues affecting our Nation, as well \nas the issues that affect Georgia's proud military community. Our men \nand women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to have my highest \nadmiration and praise for their good works. We will continue to do \neverything necessary to help them succeed in their mission and win this \nwar on terrorism. I know Dr. Robert Gates shares that commitment, and I \nlook forward to working with him and supporting him as he serves on \nbehalf of our Nation's military.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about why I voted \nagainst Dr. Gates and lay out in detail the concerns I have about the \nsecurity posture of the United States today and how I do not believe \nthat Dr. Gates is the appropriate choice to confront them. While I \nthink he certainly has a lot of positive qualities, and in normal times \nI would certainly defer to the President's judgment on this, we are not \nin normal times. I believe we need a Secretary--and I think we need \nleaders in this country, particularly the Secretary--who has insight \ninto the nature of our enemy and is willing to provide the vision \nnecessary, not just for our people in the military but the country, on \nhow to defeat them. On one particular vital aspect of that vision I \nthink he is in error, and that error causes me to object and to vote no \nto his nomination.\n  What I would like to do is lay out what I see as the problem \nconfronting America and the complexity of that problem, which I think \nhas grown more complex since the last time that we have been in this \nChamber, over 6 weeks ago. I would like to go back to two speeches I \ngave last summer, one at the National Press Club, and the other at the \nPennsylvania Press Club--one obviously in Washington, the other in \nHarrisburg. I gave those speeches because I thought it was important \nthat\n\n[[Page S11296]]\n\nat a time when our country is at war and our country is struggling with \nthis war that we have a better definition as to who the enemy is and \nwhat we need to do about it.\n  I made that issue, the issue I discussed in these two speeches and \nsubsequent speeches during my campaign, the centerpiece of the \ncampaign. Many political advisers suggested to me that this was a wrong \ntactic in a State where the favorabilities for the war and the \nPresident were in the low thirties to make this the centerpiece and, in \nfact, draw divisions between myself and the President where I put \nmyself in a position which some suggested was to the right of the \nPresident. But I thought it was important for the country and for me \npersonally as a U.S. Senator to address the issues that I thought were \ncritical to the time.\n  So I went out and gave two speeches about the importance of defining \nour enemy. If there has been a failing--obviously, for the last several \nweeks and months we have been talking about the failings of the \nadministration with respect to the policies within Iraq--I would make \nthe argument that the larger failing, not just of the administration \nbut of the Members of Congress and leaders in this country, is that we \nhave not had the courage to stand up and define the enemy as to who \nthey are and study and understand them and explain to the American \npeople who they are.\n  I defined the enemy back at the National Press Club speeches as \nIslamic fascism. I said that is the biggest issue of our time, this \nrelentless and determined radical enemy that is not just a group of \nrag-tag people living in caves but, in fact, people with an ideology, a \nplan, and increasingly the resources to carry out that plan, as well \nas, increasingly, a bigger and larger presence throughout the Islamic \nworld, these radical Islamic fascists.\n  As I said, I understand this is an unpopular war. When I stepped \nforward to define the enemy as radical Islamic fascists, I was \nridiculed by the media and others, saying that my words were too harsh, \nsaying that at worst my defining the enemy was incorrect, at best it \nwas inflammatory. But I did so because I believe words matter. If you \nare going to confront an enemy you have to understand who that enemy is \nand you have to communicate that to the people of America. And we must \ndo that.\n  Many people talk about this war as if it is an attempt simply to \ncreate fledgling democracies in Iraq and Afghanistan. While this may be \nan appealing possible outcome, we all must recognize that Iraq and \nAfghanistan are battlefields in a much more complex and broader war. \nThat includes every continent with the exception of Antarctica. The war \nis at our doorstep, and it is fueled, as I mentioned, literally and \nfiguratively by the evil of Islamic fascism.\n  Whether we know it or not, they have been at war with us, and the \nState of Iran specifically has been at war with us, since 1979 when \nthey declared war against the United States. They have not rescinded \nthat declaration. So when we talk about engaging Iran as the Secretary, \nthe new, future Secretary of Defense has talked about, we are talking \nabout engaging someone who is at war with us, who has declared war with \nus, and who has been at war and, and as I will talk about here, and I \nthink it has been widely reported in the press, has been doing a lot to \nsubstantiate the claim that they have been at war with us.\n  But this threat is not exclusively based in Iran. It is gaining \nstrength and spreading throughout every region of the world. I have \naddressed the issue of Islamic fascism but have not yet spoken to the \nsubject of Iraq. Iraq is the central front in the war on Islamic \nfascism. However, contrary to the Iraqi Study Group, the Baker-Hamilton \ncommission, the answer to this problem can be found--the answer to Iraq \ncan be found not in Iraq but in Iran. It is Iran and its client State \nof Syria that serve as the principal instigators and fomenters of the \nconflict in Iraq today.\n\n  The President gets advice from the CIA that the opposition in Iran is \nweak and divided and therefore we should do nothing in Iran because we \nhave no alternative. We have no one we can use in Iraq to confront the \nIranian Government to cause any kind of changes. So the President gets \nadvice from his intelligence team that we are without options in Iran.\n  The Pentagon advises the President and says we don't know if we have \nthe resources to open up a new battlefield or confront, militarily, \nIran, and therefore we have limited options in Iran.\n  The State Department--yes, State Department--they think that Iran is \nthe solution to the problem; that negotiating with them and getting \nthem to be our pals can in effect solve the problems; so confronting \nIran would be the absolutely wrong thing to do in solving the problem \nin Iraq.\n  So the President is being advised by all of his minions that Iran and \nconfrontation with Iran is not an option, as we heard from the \ntestimony of the new Secretary of Defense.\n  Let's look at other interested parties as we look at how we solve the \nproblem in Iraq and dealing with Iran. The American media seems to be \nvery focused and spends a lot of time talking about how poorly things \nare going in Iraq. They report daily--not just recently but repeatedly \nfor the past 3 years, daily--the body count in Iraq. It is the lead and \nhas been virtually every single day for 3 years.\n  Is their interest in shifting focus and covering the problems in \nIran? Not if we can drive home a story like this in Iraq.\n  Republicans and Democrats, leaders in the Congress, why don't they \nfocus and talk more about Iran? Democrats, if you look through--as \nunfortunately many Republicans and Democrats do--look at it through the \neyes of politics, why would we change focus and focus on Iran as the \nproblem? We saw from the last election there is grand political \nadvantage of keeping the focus on Iraq and the problems in Iraq. Why \naren't the Republicans, then, stepping forward and pointing to the \ndifficulty and problems that Iran is causing in Iraq and call for \nconfrontation? If we saw anything from the last election, the American \npublic has no appetite for a broadening of this war, increasing the \ncomplexity of this war. You might be seen as warmongering, digging us \ndeeper and more dangerously into a region of the world that we would \nrather not be in in the first place.\n  So what do we have? We have the Baker-Hamilton report which is a \nprescription for surrender. It is just a matter of time. It is \ncertainly not a prescription for victory. Nowhere does it mention, \nother than of course that we would like victory, nor is there a \nprescription for victory in that report.\n  So now we have the slow process of how we exit ourselves because we \nhave no option to confront the real problem. We have no willingness on \nthe part of any level of Government to confront it. So we are destined \nat this point to focus on something that is insolvable without \nconfronting Iran, and that is the war in Iraq.\n  Who are these Iranians? Who are these Islamic fascists? I do not mean \nto exclude Sunni Islamic fascists because they were the principal--or \nthey were the first, let's put it that way--in launching the war \nagainst the United States. I should not say the first. They were the \nfirst in recent times--certainly 9/11--in launching the war.\n  So this is not just a Shia problem, but it is increasingly becoming a \nShia-dominated field as they continue to spread control in Iran with \ntheir influence and money. But let's not leave out Saudi Arabia and \nothers that have used their resources to foment Islamic fascism all \nover the world with their resources--Sunni Islamic fascism.\n  So where are we? What can we do to confront this problem?\n  The interesting thing is that this problem is growing--I don't know \nabout exponentially, but I don't know of a single country in the Middle \nEast where the threat of radical Islam has not grown over the last 30 \nyears, since Iran took over control--since the radicals took over \ncontrol in Iran, the last 27 years. Every capital, every regime is \nfeeling the pressure. And not just since 2003, but systematically over \nthe years we have seen, particularly in Arab Muslim countries and \nMiddle Eastern Muslim countries, this rise. But, again, not exclusive: \nIndonesia, Malaysia--this is not exclusive to the Arab world. Obviously \nIran, which is Persia.\n  So what have we seen over the past 6 months? We saw a situation in \nthe central synagogue in Prague where the Islamic fascists intended to \ncarry out, on Rosh Hashanah, a mass kidnaping when large numbers of \nJews would be\n\n[[Page S11297]]\n\ncelebrating the new year. When the world's attention now was focused on \nPrague, they designed to make impossible demands and then blow up the \nsynagogue and everyone within it.\n  Those people were not marked for death because they supported the war \nin Iraq. They were not marked for death because they oppressed these \nIslamic fascists. They were targeted because they were Jews. This is \nevil.\n  Islamic terrorists organized an assault on civilian aircraft leaving \nLondon, planning to blow up 10 or more planes this summer as they flew \nover the North Atlantic. You may not know that two of those \nparticipants were a husband and a wife, a husband and a wife who were \ngoing to board that plane and explode that plane over the North \nAtlantic while holding in their arms their 6-month-old child.\n  This is evil.\n  Islamic terrorists slaughter innocent Iraqis every single day on both \nsides of the divide within Islam. As we know, in recent days they \nbeheaded an orthodox priest and crucified a 14-year-old boy guilty of \nnothing but being Christian.\n  This is evil.\n  Almost everyone has now heard of Iranian President Mahmoud \nAhmadinejad and the fact that he denies the existence of the Holocaust \nand called for Israel to be wiped off the face of the Earth. But he has \nbeen remarkably clear about his mission, remarkably clear about his \nmessianic vision of a Shiite religion, his vision to destroy the \nWestern world and impose a caliphate on the world in which the world \nwould submit to Islam or die in the process.\n  He said:\n\n       Is it possible for us to witness a world without America \n     and Zionism?\n\n  Then he answered himself:\n\n       But you had best know this slogan and this goal is \n     attainable and surely can be achieved.\n\n  So do we have any questions about the nature of our enemy? Do we have \nany questions about the capability of this oil-rich country? Yet just \nthis past week President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sent an open letter, a \nconciliatory letter, to the American people, addressed to the ``noble'' \nAmerican people. He called on America to withdraw from Iraq and end \nsupport for Israel, and, of course, to convert to Islam. This man may \nbe a fanatic, but let me assure you he is not a stupid fanatic. This \nman understands and studies America. The Islamic fascists respect us \nenough to get to know us. They respect us enough so they know what \nbuttons to push and how hard to push them. They respect us enough to \nfigure out what it will take to defeat us.\n  I wish that were the case for the American people.\n  He couched his warning in the words that are familiar and comfortable \nwith Americans--``freedom,'' trying to appeal that he would be free of \nthis illegitimate regime in his mind, which is the current \nadministration, and we would free them of this burden of fighting. It \nis a great appeal and many would like to see the end of this war, but \nwe should not be fooled.\n  Our troops in Iraq are being killed by Iranian weapons today paid for \nwith Iranian money smuggled into Iraq by Iranian logistics and utilized \nby Iranian-trained terrorists.\n  A couple of years ago you needed a security clearance to know this. \nNow, if you care to know, if you want to know this uncomfortable truth \nabout Iran, you can know it. Iran is the centerpiece in the assault \nagainst us and other countries in the civilized world, which is why I \nfought so hard for passage of the Iran Freedom and Support Act.\n  I stood on the Senate floor at this very desk and argued in May or \nJune of this year for passage of the Iran Freedom and Support Act. I \nsaid we should not be negotiating with Iran, that we should be \nconfronting Iran.\n  Bernard Lewis tells a familiar opinion that he has. He tells a lot of \nthem. He said that the oddity in particular of the Arab and Middle \nEastern Islamic world is that the more we have strong relations with \nthe government in an Arab Muslim country the more the people of that \ncountry hate us; and the more that we stand up and confront leadership \nof those countries the more the people like us. Is it no wonder he \nrecounts on the day of 9/11 when there was but one Middle Eastern \nMuslim capital there was a candlelight vigil in support of those who \ndied on 9/11, and that was in Tehran, Iran.\n  It is not hard to understand when you have regimes throughout the \nMiddle East who oppress their people that when you stand up and \nconfront those regimes and call them the evil they are the people \nunderstand and respect your honesty, agree with you, and support you.\n  This summer when we attempted to negotiate with Iran, we told the \npeople of Iran that we are not on their side, that we want to make \ndeals with people who oppress them, who torture them, who enslave them, \nwho abuse them, and who kill them. That is why we should not have \nentered into any negotiations in spite of the entreaties of Europe with \nthis evil regime in Iran. We should confront them, and only confront \nthem. If we want the support of the people of Iran, we have to earn it \nwith the integrity of our mission, and we are not doing that.\n  So I stood up on the floor of the Senate and said we needed to \nconfront Iran, that we needed to fund full democracy groups, that we \nneeded to use the public airwaves and the Internet to disseminate \ninformation to cause a change in the Government of Iran, and that we \nneeded to sanction them. And this administration opposed me. The Senate \nopposed me by, I think, a 54-to-46 vote. That is why I continue to work \non the Iran Freedom and Support Act.\n  Over the intervening months, what happened? Iran did as I predicted \non this floor back in the spring--they played us along. They said: \nWell, you know we will negotiate with you as long as we can continue to \nproduce nuclear materials and continue our nuclear program. So we \nnegotiated and we negotiated and they developed and they developed. So \nfinally in September of this year, enough people on both sides of the \naisle and enough people in the administration finally were convinced \nthat this was not a viable strategy anymore. What did we gain? We \npassed the Iran Freedom and Support Act, which probably surprised most \npeople in this Chamber. We passed it unanimously--one of the last \nthings we did before we broke. Most Americans don't know it. \nUnfortunately, most in the Middle East don't know it. I suspect if we \nwent into the bowels of the State Department they may know it, but they \nare not going to do a damned thing about it because that is not their \nintent. They do not want to do anything about it. My guess is they will \ntake that money and spend it on a lot of conferences and studies on \nwhat we should do instead of giving it to the bus drivers who went on \nstrike as a strike fund so they can stand up to the government. Instead \nof giving it to dissent groups so they can disseminate information, \ninstead of actively engaging we will appease. We will study, we will \ndelay, and they will have time to further build.\n\n  But we did pass the bill. That would be on one of my to-do lists in \nthe next Congress.\n  Is this bill going to be enforced? Are we going to confront Iran? Are \nwe going to try to do something or are we going to sit by and allow \nthem to develop these weapons? They are not developing them alone. No, \nthere are a lot of reports that they are working with others around the \nworld. Who are those others? I talk about Islamic fascism, and I keep \nfocusing on that. But, unfortunately, over the past several months it \nis increasingly clear to me that the situation is becoming even more \ncomplex. We are not just facing a group of people who are in the Middle \nEast desiring to overthrow the world and oppose a caliphate on us, but \nthey have allies--unlikely allies in some respects, unlikely allies as \nthe German Nazis and Japanese imperialists who had very conflicting \nideologies but had a common purpose, and that was destroy the West, \ndestroy the English-speaking world and the Western world, and put it \nunder the domination of those countries.\n  So it is today. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. What Iran has \nfound and the Islamic fascists have found is there are plenty of \nenemies of the United States. In fact, they had a meeting just this \nyear a couple of months ago in Havana, Cuba. The nonaligned states met. \nThere were 100 nations. On their agenda was to redefine the word \n``terror'' to include ``the U.S. occupation of Iraq'' and the ``Israeli \ninvasion'' of Lebanon. Of course, there\n\n[[Page S11298]]\n\nwas no mention about the incursion of Hezbollah. They found solace with \nthese countries.\n  We saw it played out at the United Nations just a couple of weeks \nlater where President Ahmadinejad, President Hugo Chavez, to thunderous \napplause of many in the United Nations community, demonized America. \nBut another member of that crew of nonaligned nations was North Korea.\n  I mentioned before that Iran is pursuing a nuclear program. They are \nindeed pursuing a nuclear program, and there have been many \nintelligence reports published that have suggested there were Iranian \nscientists there the day North Korea exploded their nuclear weapon. In \nfact, the scientist who had been working with North Korea, AQ Kahn, is \nthe same scientist who has been working with Iran in the development of \ntheir nuclear program. Some have suggested that they are working \ncollaboratively and jointly in their development of nuclear weapons \nwhich, of course, would have put Iran's nuclear program well ahead of \nwhere everyone believes it to be.\n  So we have not only the Islamic fascists led by Iran, but we now have \nan alliance between Iran and North Korea; North Korea, which is a \nthreat in their own right, now with nuclear weapons and their \nincreasing ability to deliver them with long-range missiles, including \nthe development of, as they hope to do, ICBMs which could reach the \nUnited States of America.\n  We confronted North Korea as soon as they detonated their explosives. \nWe had a U.N. resolution confronting them. North Korea condemned that \nnuclear U.N. resolution and called it ``a declaration of war'' and \nthreatened the United States by declaring:\n\n       We will deliver merciless blows without hesitation to \n     whoever tries to breach our sovereignty and right to survive \n     under the excuse of carrying out a United Nations Security \n     Council resolution.\n\n  Not only do we have a threat of North Korea now launching a nuclear \nweapon, but we have the clear threat of North Korea and Iran \nproliferating nuclear technology. In addition, as Iran, working with \nNorth Korea, develops their nuclear program, and as the world sits \nfecklessly by and lets them do it, others in the region legitimately \nhave their tensions increased and have talked about the need for those \nnations to develop nuclear weapons, Thus starting an arms race in a \nregion of the world where it is the last place we want a nuclear arms \nrace.\n\n  Finally, we have the issue of whether this nuclear material that is \nbeing developed in both North Korea and Iran will end up in the hands \nof terrorists, to be delivered in a nonconventional way. North Korea is \na new threat on the horizon, but it is not alone. In fact, North Korea \nhas expressed direct support for Iran's nuclear development program and \nstressed that the United States and the West have no right to defy such \na program.\n  The Iranians have also commented officially on friendly ties between \nTehran and Pyongyang after the Islamic revolution, saying Iran ``highly \npraises North Korea for its steadfastness against the domineering \npolicies of the United States.''\n  But the threat goes even further. Ahmadinejad, with Kim Jong Il, like \nMussolini and Hitler, intends to conquer Western civilization. Again, \nthat is not Hitler. But they also, like the Soviets under Nikita \nKhrushchev, see the advantage of placing weapons of mass destruction \nwithin short ranges of the United States.\n  Obviously, one likely candidate would be Venezuela. I don't know of \nany regime currently that is more vehement and more anti-American than \nHugo Chavez and the regime in Venezuela, so it probably comes as no \nsurprise that Ahmadinejad and Chavez have had meetings, and they are \nnow aligned and allies and working together and have, in fact, formed a \ndefense pact between the two countries.\n  Venezuela is a serious threat not just because of their relationship \nwithin Iran but because of what it has attempted to do throughout the \nregion, as well as its own potential threat.\n  Just a few weeks ago there was an election in Nicaragua, right before \nour election, where Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega won the election, took a \ncongratulatory call from Hugo Chavez, who said:\n\n       We're happy here. We're very proud of you.\n       Now, like never before, the Sandinista revolution and the \n     Bolivarian revolution unite, to construct the future, \n     socialism of the 21st century.\n\n  Chavez made no secret about his support for Ortega or his support for \nthe new rulers in Bolivia. Chavez is doing all he can to build military \npower and might and influence in the region of the world that is \nuncomfortably close to the United States.\n  As we know, Chavez has been clear about his disdain for America. What \nwe don't know is what Venezuela has been up to. I suspect that most \nMembers of this Senate do not know that Venezuela is the leading buyer \nof foreign arms and military equipment in the world today, that Chavez \nis building an army of more than 1 million soldiers. I suspect most in \nthis Senate do not know that over the next year he plans to spend $30 \nbillion to build 20 military bases in neighboring Bolivia which will \ndominate the borders of Chile, Peru, Paraguay, Argentina, assembling \nthose military bases on the borders of the countries I just mentioned. \nThese military bases, while they will be manned by Bolivian soldiers, \nwill be commanded by Venezuelan and Cuban officers.\n  How does he do this? How is he able to accomplish what Fidel Castro \nhas been seeking to accomplish now for 4\\1/2\\ decades? The answer to \nthat, of course, is very simple. It is a three-letter word: oil. Oil \nand its huge profits are financing this, just like oil and its huge \nprofits are advancing Islamic fascism in the Middle East. It is no \nwonder again that Venezuela and Iran have formed an oil pact. Why? As \nthey have clearly said before, oil is a ``geopolitical weapon,'' \naccording to Chavez. He also said:\n\n       I could easily order the closing of the refineries we have \n     in the United States. I could easily sell that oil that we \n     sell to the United States to other countries of the world . . \n     . to real friends and allies like China.\n\n  They have even closer relationships with the Islamic fascists in \nIran. A recent congressional report found that Hezbollah may right now \nhave established bases in Venezuela which have issued thousands of \nvisas to people from places such as Cuba and the Middle East, possibly \ngiving them passports to a vague United States border security.\n  To make matters worse, we see, with the help of Venezuela, Cuba and \nChina are now exploring for oil within 50 miles of the coast of the \nUnited States, while the Senate blocks a measure to allow us to explore \nfor oil within 100 miles of our own shore. So while China, Cuba, and \nVenezuela draw oil from our shores, we stand idly by and let them do it \nto arm against us.\n  Let's not overlook the role of Russia in working with all of these \ngovernments--Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela. Last summer, Russia \nsigned an arms deal with Venezuela to the tune of $1 billion. Last \nmonth, Russia began deliveries to Iran of highly sophisticated SA-15 \nanti-aircraft missiles valued at $700 million. The purpose of these \nmissiles? To defend Iran's nuclear program. That shouldn't come as a \nsurprise. Russia has consistently opposed the efforts of the United \nStates to sanction the other enemy, North Korea, for their nuclear \nprograms, and has insisted on diluting the effects of every resolution \nthat was passed condemning North Korea. The Russians claim sanctions \ndon't work. Yet, oddly enough, they just imposed sanctions on their \nneighbor, Georgia.\n\n  Yes, we live in a very complex time and we have enemies who are very \ndangerous, in which their relationships are growing, and so with it \ntheir commensurate power to confront terrorists of the world, and the \nrest of the world sits and hopes and hopes that we can negotiate our \nway out of this problem; that since we are people of reason and \nrational folks, we can deal with them on that level. Have we forgotten \nour history? We have been in this situation before.\n  I have titled this address ``The Gathering Storm of the 21st \nCentury.'' It is not a coincidence that I do so in harkening to the \nbook written by Winston Churchill, ``The Gathering Storm,'' talking \nabout the lead-up to World War II. Just like Britain in 1940, after the \nfall of France, we are engaged with a struggle now with the enemy--\nalone. Just like Britain in 1940, we entreated the rest of the world to \njoin us against this evil, and the world fell silent. For a year and a \nhalf until Pearl Harbor,\n\n[[Page S11299]]\n\nand actually long after that, since the United States was certainly not \nprepared for war, Britain fought this battle alone. And with the \nexception of the State of Israel, we are fighting this battle alone, \nand I suspect we will for quite some time.\n  So what lesson can we learn? What lesson can we learn from history? \nWhat we know is America is very reticent to get involved in wars, and \nrightfully so. In the First World War, we only entered after a German \nU-boat sank American civilian and commercial ships in the North \nAtlantic. World War I was the war to end all wars. After the defeat of \nthe German armies, it seemed as if peace was going to be with us for a \nlong time. But it did not last a generation. As I said, we ended up \nwith the situation in World War II. But even after the fall of Europe \nto the Nazis and the Italian fascists, America stood by, hoping this \nproblem would go away. It was not until Pearl Harbor that things \nchanged.\n  The Cold War was only after Stalin's aggression in the Middle East in \nGreece that we decided to engage and recognize that the Soviet Union \nwas not our friend as many thought after World War II but, in fact, our \nnew foe. And now, after the fall of the Soviet Union we thought we \nwould have a peace dividend, peace for a long time, and we find that \nother forces of evil have cropped up to confront us.\n  If it were not for the fact of September 11, we would be allowing \nthat to continue today. But we engaged the enemy because they attacked \nus directly here at home. But now we are growing tired. We are wearying \nof the battle. I said earlier that these Islamic fascists understand us \nbetter than we understand them. They understand our history better than \nwe understand their history. They need not look long to see how quickly \nAmerica tires of confrontation and conflict and death.\n  And so they plan and, more importantly, they kill, every day. It is \nrecorded here every day, and support for this war goes down every day. \nAnd they check another box in Tehran.\n  Winston Churchill wrote in ``The Gathering Storm'' a short \ndescription of the gathering storm:\n\n       How the English-speaking peoples, through their unwisdom, \n     carelessness and good nature allowed the wicked to rearm.\n\n  We are at such a moment. Are we going to allow the wicked to rearm? \nWe paid a terrible price for waiting. We lock at each war, each major \nconflict, we paid a terrible price for waiting. In many cases, it was a \nprice paid in America. In many other cases it was a price paid in \ncountries around the world. Are we going to pay that price at some day \nin the future or are we going to confront this enemy?\n  If we learned anything from the 20th century, it should be this \nlesson: When leaders say they are prepared to kill millions of people \nto achieve their goal, we must take them at their word. The enemy \nbefore us that I have described has said it clearly, repeatedly, and \npointedly, and even more threateningly, because this is an enemy who \ndoesn't see death as a tragic consequence of the war; they see it as \ntheir objective of war.\n  The ayatollah and the mullahs of Iran have repeatedly said that the \nobject of jihad is not success, it is death. It is reaching the next \nlevel. It is ending this miserable life which we have on Earth and in \npursuit of jihad, guaranteeing yourself eternal life with Allah.\n  Here in America, we refuse to recognize, many, that we are at war \nwith this great evil.\n  We shrink from the recognition of identifying the enemy and \nconfronting them, whether they be the Islamic fascists led by Iran or \nthe socialist rulers of North Korea and Venezuela. We are sleep-walking \nthrough the storm, as we have done in the past. We pretend it is not \nhappening or that it is simply because of the incompetency of the \ncurrent administration or of a member of that administration.\n  But how do those who deny this evil propose to save us from these \npeople? By negotiating through the U.N. or directly with Iran? By \nfiring Don Rumsfeld, now getting rid of John Bolton? That is going to \nsolve the problem? These people are now going to be nice to us because \nwe removed these people who were agitating them or causing problems? \nMaybe relocating our troops to Okinawa or Kuwait or some other place \nwill get these people to simply leave us alone? Maybe if we just \nabandon Iraq and Afghanistan to the chaos and slaughter of Islamic \nfascists, their thirst for blood will be met? Or maybe it is just \nengaging in one-on-one discussions with Iran and North Korea and other \nreasonable dictators?\n  No, I do not think any of those things will work. And history has \nproved they have not worked. We need to begin to confront our enemies. \nAnd that does not mean we have to launch a military mission into the \ncountries I spoke of. But we have to do more than just adjust tactics \nin Iraq. If the focus of the next year and a half is simply adjusting \ntactics within Iraq, it will fail. It will fail. We must go after the \nregimes that recruit, pay, train, and arm their surrogate militias in \nIraq. Again, I am not talking about military confrontation; I am \ntalking about political and economic warfare to bring down the terror \nregimes in Tehran and their satellite puppet state in Syria. The best \nway to do that is to work with their own people who want freedom.\n  I talked about the Iran Freedom and Support Act, but there is much \nmore we need to do. We need to implement it. And we need to use the \npublic diplomacy apparatus we have to motivate and change the hearts \nand minds. A free Iran will change the world because it will deprive \nthe terrorists of the single greatest source of support and isolate the \nlikes of Hugo Chavez and Kim Jong-il.\n  Why is a free Iran and a free Iraq so essential? Because neither the \nUnited States of America nor any of our Western allies can defeat \nradical Islamic fascism on our own. We cannot defeat radical Islamic \nfascism. The only thing we can do is, through democracy-building and \nthrough support of moderate Islam, give those who truly seek the true \nmeaning, the true moderate meaning of Islam the opportunity to be \nsuccessful in suppressing its radical elements. We have to create that \nenvironment, and we have not in Iraq because Iran and Syria have not \nlet us.\n  I remember reading commentaries from so many people talking about \nthat things went well originally in Iraq. It seems like things were \ngoing OK, and then, after a year or so, it really started to turn \nsouth. Well, immediately after we were there, the Iranians were scared \nto death of us and dared not play in that sandbox. But they quickly \nsurmised that we were not serious, that we were not going to confront \nthis evil, so they began what we now see.\n  We need to counter Hugo Chavez. We need to do more to develop closer \nrelationships with the countries in Central and South America, through \ntrade and through diplomatic negotiations. We must fight for the hearts \nand minds of Central and South America, and we must do so much more \ndeliberately and aggressively than we have. We have to do more to \nconfront North Korea and its threat. That includes options, \nparticularly missile defense. Finally, we have to confront the root \ncause of all of this, the root cause being oil.\n  There is one regret I have of not coming back here. It is--and my \ncolleagues know I can be somewhat single-minded--to focus the attention \nof this body and this country on energy security. It is lunacy, it is \nsuicidal to continue to allow the energy markets at the levels they are \nright now given the fact that a vast majority of those energy dollars \nare going to people who want to kill us and destroy everything we \nbelieve in. We can no longer play games with our energy security.\n  I spent a lot of time talking about this war, and I have fought very \nhard to pass legislation, both the Syrian Accountability Act and the \nIran Freedom and Support Act, that will try to hurt our enemies and \nstrengthen our country. I will do my best, after I leave this place, to \ncontinue to confront these enemies and to give the United States the \nopportunity to succeed in this war.\n  Osama bin Laden said:\n\n       In the final phase of the ongoing struggle, the world of \n     the infidels was divided between two superpowers: the United \n     States and the Soviet Union. Now we--\n\n  Understand this.\n\n       Now we have defeated and destroyed the more difficult and \n     the more dangerous of the two.\n\n  Understand what bin Laden is saying. ``We,'' these Islamic fascists--\nthey claim they defeated the Soviet Union, not Ronald Reagan and \nMargaret\n\n[[Page S11300]]\n\nThatcher, not Pope John Paul II, but Islamic fascism, the mujahedin in \nAfghanistan. History will make a plausible case for this assertion \nthat, in fact, they had a lot to do with defeating the Soviet Union. \nBut he continues with one final sentence:\n\n       Dealing with the pampered and effeminate Americans will be \n     easy.\n\n  You see, they think they understand us. They think they know how to \nget to America. Open a paper every day and see what their tactic is. \nOpen a paper every day, turn on a television every day, turn on your \nradio every day, sign on to the Internet every day and see what their \ntactic is and see how they believe they will defeat us.\n  I believe we need strong leadership to confront this greatest enemy \nthat we have. The stakes are high, too high not to join together--\nDemocrat, Republican, liberal, conservative, American, European--to \nconfront this dangerous enemy. We must stop them.\n  Winston Churchill, in June of 1940--I will close with this, for my \ncolleagues who have been patiently waiting--Winston Churchill, in 1940, \naddressed the British people as Britain stood alone:\n\n       What General Weygand called the Battle of France is over. I \n     expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin. Upon \n     this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization. \n     Upon it depends our own British life, and the long continuity \n     of our institutions and our Empire. The whole fury and might \n     of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows \n     that he will have to break us in this Island or lose the war. \n     If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the \n     life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit \n     uplands. But if we fail, then the whole world, including the \n     United States, including all that we have known and cared \n     for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more \n     sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of \n     perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to do our \n     duties, and so bear ourselves that, if the British Empire and \n     its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still \n     say, ``This was their finest hour.''\n\n  This is the call of this generation. This is America's hour. This is \nthe hour that we need leadership, Churchillian leadership, who had a \nkeen eye for the enemy and a resolve in spite of the political climate \nto confront it. I ask my colleagues to stand and make this America's \nfinest hour. I regret that the new Secretary of Defense is not up to \nthe task, in my opinion. I hope others are.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11300-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11300-S11301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ESCALATING CRISIS IN DARFUR\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this evening there was a meeting in my \noffice with the U.S. Special Convoy to the Sudan, Andrew Natsios. It \nwas an unusual meeting by Senate and Capitol Hill standards. It was a \nbipartisan meeting called by Senator Sam Brownback, my Republican \nfriend from Kansas, and myself, inviting our colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to try to address the escalating crisis in Darfur, in the \nSudan.\n  In the meeting, we talked about the urgent need for international \naction to stop this genocide. Hundreds of thousands of people have been \nkilled in Darfur over the last 3 years. Two and a half million people \nhave been driven from their homes. There are refugee camps not only in \nSudan but in Chad and neighboring countries filled with those from \nDarfur who have been driven out by the violence.\n  Nearly two-thirds of the people living in this region are now \ndependent on humanitarian aid, and hundreds of thousands are in need \nbut far beyond the reach of humanitarian organizations. Humanitarian \naccess, the ability to help those in such desperate straits, is, sadly, \ndiminishing when, in fact, we need more.\n  The Sudanese Government in the capital of Khartoum has orchestrated \nthis campaign of genocide. It continues to deny the death toll, and it \ncontinues to reject the United Nations peacekeeping mission.\n  On November 21, Special Envoy Natsios announced that the Bush \nadministration would resort to an unspecified ``Plan B,'' as they \ncalled it, if the Sudanese Government does not agree by January 1, \n2007, to allow an expanded international peacekeeping force in Darfur. \nMr. Natsios made clear to us in the meeting in my office just a short \ntime ago that this force is to be under the command and control of the \nUnited Nations. It is a very important part of our plan. In September, \nSecretary of State Rice warned that Khartoum faced a choice between \ncooperation and confrontation.\n  I believe it is time--it is well past time--for the world to make \nclear to Khartoum and the Sudanese Government that serious steps will \nimmediately follow the beginning of the new year if a United Nations or \ncombined United Nations and African Union force is not agreed to \nimmediately. The United States and the world have a number of things we \ncan do, things we can do to persuade the Sudanese that they have to \nstop this genocide in Darfur.\n  Militarily, the United Nations has authorized and the Senate supports \nthe principle of a no-fly zone over Darfur. It is not going to be easy \nto implement it, but it is possible. Although it is logistically \nchallenging, that is no excuse to allow the Government of the Sudanese \npeople to continue attacks on the Sudanese people themselves by air.\n\n  The United Nations should also be working with the International \nCriminal Court, sharing intelligence that could help accelerate \nindictments against those Khartoum officials and others guilty of \ncrimes against humanity. Economically, the United States has sanctions \nagainst U.S. companies doing business in Sudan, but most countries \ndon't. Sudan is a rich country when it comes to oil. They are expected \nto bring in $7.6 billion in revenue this year from oil. The major oil \ncompanies in the Sudan are owned and run by the Chinese, the Indians, \nand the Malaysians.\n  Independent reports estimate that 70 percent of that oil revenue is \nlikely to be used by the Sudanese Government in Khartoum for military \nexpenditures. Think of that. An otherwise poor African nation taking 70 \npercent of the revenues from oil, converting it into military equipment \nthat in many cases is being used to kill its own citizens. Those same \nmilitary expenditures have financed helicopter gunships, automatic \nweapons, and vehicles that have allowed the Sudanese Government and \ntheir militia to terrorize the population of Darfur.\n  The international community needs to join the United States in \nsanctions on Sudan. You can hardly pick up a newspaper in our country \nwithout finding a full-page ad exhorting our Government and people to \ndo something about the genocide in Darfur. I salute those who are \nsupporting that effort. I encourage them to take that information to \nother countries in Europe and other places so that they can engage with \nus in an effort to stop this genocide. Civilized nations should not do \nbusiness with genociders.\n  In the United States, we need to do more. We should close our ports \nto oil tankers that have operated in Sudan. The President could block \nthe assets of 17 individuals named in the United Nations investigation \nas responsible for crimes in Darfur. The list includes the Sudanese \nMinister of Interior, the Intelligence Director, and the Minister of \nDefense. To date, the President has only blocked the assets of four \npeople: Two rebel leaders, a former Air Force officer, and a Janjaweed \nmilitia leader. We need to move up the chain of command. We need to do \nmore, and we need to do it now.\n  All across America, State and local governments, universities, \norganizations, and private citizens are doing more by divesting their \npension and other investment funds from companies that do business in \nSudan, companies that support and enrich the Khartoum Government that \nis looking the other way when it comes to this genocide. Divestment is \na powerful tool. I believe Congress and the White House should support \nit.\n  My State of Illinois was one of the first to step forward and divest \nits State pension funds. Five other States followed. Recently, I joined \nSenator Brownback in writing to every other Governor, urging them to \njoin in the divestment effort. We have also each taken steps to \npersonally divest. There is an interesting side note here. After \nSenator Brownback and I sent a letter to all of these Governors in \nStates that have not divested from investments in the Sudan, an \nenterprising reporter reviewed my personal financial information on \nfile and reported to me that\n\n[[Page S11301]]\n\none of the mutual funds that I owned, owned stock in a company doing \nbusiness in Sudan. I was shocked to learn that. Quickly I sold it. But \nI think it is a warning to all that if you want to be participating in \nthis effort to try to get the message to the Sudanese, we should all \nstart with our personal savings and mutual funds and make sure that we \nare not supporting, indirectly, the Government of Sudan. I have sold \nthat mutual fund, and I will try to be vigilant that if another mutual \nfund I own purchases something in Sudan, that I divest very quickly.\n  All of these are small actions but cumulatively they can make a \ndifference. Tonight, as I have done before, I can't help but think \nabout Rwanda in 1994. I mentioned it this morning when I noted the \nretirement of my colleague from Vermont, Senator Jim Jeffords. In 1994, \nmass murder was launched in Rwanda. It was carried out by guns and \ntorches and by the grisly use of machetes.\n  Five weeks after the killings began, Illinois Senator Paul Simon, my \npredecessor and my closest friend in public life, who was chairman of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa, and Jim Jeffords, \nthen the ranking Republican on that same subcommittee, phoned General \nRomeo Dallaire, head of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda in Kigali \nand asked what he needed. A desperate Dallaire told them that if he had \n5,000 soldiers, he could stop the massacre in Rwanda. Those two \nSenators immediately drafted and hand-delivered a note to the White \nHouse, to the Clinton administration, requesting that the United States \nget the Security Council to authorize deployment of troops.\n  In their letter they wrote:\n\n       Obviously there are risks involved. But we cannot sit by \n     idly while this tragedy continue to unfold.\n\n  Sadly, they received no reply to their letter. The killings \ncontinued. At the end of the day, over 800,000 people died in Rwanda as \nvictims of the genocide. Last year, about this time, Senator Brownback \nand I went to Kilgali. People there don't talk about the Rwandan \ngenocide of 12 years ago unless it is brought up. As I looked down at a \nCatholic Church down the hill from the Hotel Rwanda made famous by the \nmovie, I thought it was just a simple church in an African capital. I \ncame to learn that over 1,000 people were hacked to death inside that \nchurch where they sought asylum during this massacre and the genocide.\n  Later, after it occurred, Paul Simon would say:\n\n       If every member of the House and Senate had received just \n     100 letters from people back home saying we have to do \n     something about Rwanda, when the crisis was first developing, \n     then I think the response would have been different.\n\n  Hundreds of thousands of innocent lives would have been saved. So \nmany times I have stood on this floor pleading for our Nation to \nintervene in Darfur, and I have been thinking about Paul Simon and what \nhe did in Rwanda. This time, during the latest chapter in the world's \nhistory of atrocities, hundreds of Americans, thousands of Americans \nare engaged. It is so encouraging to go to college campuses across the \nState of Illinois and find college groups that have made Darfur their \nissue. It is great to go to meetings of people old and young in my \nState and have someone afterward come up and discuss the genocide in \nDarfur. These people have not been silent. They have pleaded for \naction.\n  Paul Simon was right, in part. The response this time has been \ndifferent. It has been different than the world's response to genocides \nagainst the Armenians, the Jewish people, the Cambodians, the Bosnians, \nand the Rwandans. It has been different in that this time we recognize \nthat truly there is a genocide taking place on our watch, in our time \nin this world. But we haven't stopped it.\n  We are here today not as Democrats or Republicans but as advocates \nfor the people of Darfur. The U.S. special envoy to Sudan, Mr. Natsios, \nhas drawn a line in the sand. As of January 1, the Sudanese Government \nmust either accept the peacekeeping mission or face the consequences. \nPersonally, I believe this deadline comes too late. But I hope it is \neffective. I hope it convinces the Sudanese Government to accept the \npeacekeepers. If not, then the administration's plan B, the \nconsequences of refusal, must be meaningful and immediate and decisive.\n  Let me close with the words of Paul Simon and Jim Jeffords, who \nretires this week from the Senate:\n\n       We cannot sit idly by while this tragedy continues to \n     unfold.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from Illinois \nfor his very eloquent statement. He, along with Senator Brownback and \nothers, has been very much involved in this issue. We say ``issue,'' \nbut it is a lot more than an issue. It is something that is truly one \nof the great tragedies of our era. I salute him for his passion. I \nsalute him for his intellect and his drive and his determination to do \nsomething about it. We have made some progress and have a special envoy \nappointed. This was something Senator Biden and I worked on, along with \nothers, urged the administration to do. I am delighted that Andrew \nNatsios is in that position. He is a man of great talent. But we in \nCongress--and I will be leaving the Congress--and the American people, \nwe all have to continue to speak out. We all have to continue to make \nthis a priority. We all have to remember, as my colleague from Illinois \nhas so eloquently pointed out, the history of atrocities such as this \nin the past and that when good people do not speak up and do not, more \nimportantly, take action, these tragedies not only occur but they \ncontinue.\n  I salute my colleague from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11301-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR RICK SANTORUM\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I come to the Floor today to honor a brave \nOhioan, Marine LCpl Michael Cifuentes, from Fairfield, who was killed \nin the line-of-duty when his vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive \ndevice in Iraq on August 3, 2005. Michael is survived by his parents, \nGregory and Carolyn, his brother Daniel, and his fiance Tara Reynolds.\n  Friends, family, and fellow marines remember Michael, first and \nforemost, for his kind and generous spirit. A 1998 graduate of St. \nXavier High School in Cincinnati and then a 2002 graduate of my alma \nmarter, Miami University, Michael chose to postpone his upcoming \ngraduate studies in math education in order to serve in the U.S. Marine \nCorps.\n  Michael was known as having a soft spot in his heart for children, \nand eventually, he wanted to become a math teacher. To make the most of \nhis time before graduate school, Michael was a substitute teacher at \nTalawanda Middle School in Oxford, OH. Principal Sharon Lytle remembers \nthat he was an excellent teacher, who was well liked by his students \nand who exhibited a special willingness to help those requiring special \ninstruction. She said the following about Michael:\n\n       He was always willing to take the toughest cases. He was a \n     real team player [and] unfailingly polite and respectful. A \n     lot of college kids come in here just more relaxed. He was \n     just more mature.\n\n  Mark Hinkle, Michael's uncle, said that Michael was a great teacher--\na teacher who also always wanted to be a Marine. Michael taught Mark's \n10-year-old daughter at Talawanda Middle School. His uncle said that \nMichael ``just loved the kids.''\n  Michael held a graduate assistantship through iDiscovery, an online \nprogram for teachers, until he was called for duty in the Marine Corps\n\n[[Page S11302]]\n\nReserve. Sara Hayes, coordinator of this teaching program, said that \n``Michael was a bright, funny, caring personality, and he would have \nmade an excellent math teacher.'' Hayes' sentiments are frequently \nechoed by friends and family alike.\n  Michael was always a wonderful friend, and he made an impact upon \neveryone whom he met. St. Xavier marching band member Kyle Metzroth \nrecalls a particularly humorous moment with Michael:\n\n       I only knew Mike for a year. I was a freshman in the \n     marching band the year he was a senior. I can remember him \n     for always having a smile, and I remember a lot of laughs. \n     But, the one solid, concrete memory I have of Mike was a trip \n     up to Cleveland for the St. Ignatius football game that fall. \n     Mike was a sousaphone player in the band, and if I remember \n     correctly, he had forgotten it on this trip, or it was \n     broken, or something of that nature. The important fact was \n     that he was unable to march with it.\n       The band director was going to allow him to march anyway \n     without an instrument. But I guess to some true bandsmen, \n     marching without an instrument, just doesn't cut it. There \n     was one extra instrument lying around among the band. The \n     difficulty with this instrument was the fact that it had \n     strings--[it was] a banjo. One of the other bandsmen must \n     have brought it with him as something to do on the bus ride. \n     Little did we know that we were about to witness St. Xavier \n     High School's very first marching banjo! To this day, people \n     I know in the band still talk about it.\n\n  At Miami University, Michael continued to play in the marching band--\ntuba, actually--and was actively involved in the Acacia fraternity, was \nthe head manager for the women's basketball team, and was a member of \nMiami's Naval ROTC.\n  Miami University Marching Band Director David Shaffer said this about \nMichael:\n\n       [He] always gave 100 percent. He loved Miami football and \n     was the team's loudest voice from the stands. With great \n     enthusiasm, he was always the first in line for the tuba \n     snake and the one to ring the President's doorbell during the \n     Band Day parade. I know Mike was a very proud Marine and a \n     true American. We can only be thankful that Mike was with us \n     for 25 years. He was our friend, our brother, and our \n     defender.\n\n  It was at Miami University that Michael met his fiance Tara Reynolds. \nMichael's friends say that one of the happiest moments of Michael's \nlife was when Tara agreed to be his wife.\n  Friend Janice Hughes said that ``Michael was always looking for the \nright girl. When he met her, they clicked, (and) he was really excited \nto talk about her.''\n  Michael planned for the perfect proposal. In fact, he puts most \npeople to shame when it comes to creative proposals. After going over \nthe details for weeks with his fraternity brothers as a way to quell \nhis nervousness, Michael sat with Tara on an outdoor wooden bench with \na packet of recent photos. Mixed into the pile was a snapshot of him \nholding a sign reading: ``Will You Marry Me?'' She, of course, said \n``yes.''\n  A few months after their engagement, Michael's Marine reserve unit \nwas activated and left Oxford for Iraq.\n  Tom Fennell, president of the Acacia fraternity, said this about \nMichael:\n\n       Spending time with Mike in formal and social situations \n     immediately led us to understand his love for his friends, \n     family, fiance, and country. . . . The best word to describe \n     Michael was `committed.' He was committed to his fiance, and \n     he was committed to the Marines.\n\n  Pride is another recurring word used to describe Michael. Chris \nRhoton, assistant principal at Talawanda Middle School, said that pride \n``was how he felt about being called up. Michael was patriotic, mature, \nand respectful. He was a great role model. Students and anyone who met \nhim just respected him immediately. He enhanced the lives of several \nkids here.''\n  The Reverend John Ferone perhaps summed it up best when he said, \n``Michael was a lover, a reconciler . . . a person who was able to give \neverything away so that this world would be a better place.''\n  Michael's parents included a tribute to their son as part of the \nprogram distributed to attendees of his memorial service. This is what \nthey wrote:\n\n       We will celebrate Michael's life for the good that he \n     brought to this world. With his buddies and fellow Marines, \n     he was trying to bring a better life to a people who have \n     suffered for too long.\n\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Michael's family and friends in \nour thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                        SPECIALIST ROBERT SWANEY\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow Ohioan and a \nbrave soldier--Army SPC Robert Swaney, of West Jefferson, OH, who died \non July 30, 2005, from injuries sustained when his military vehicle \nstruck an improvised explosive device in Iraq. He was 21 years old.\n  Robert was an enthusiastic and passionate young man--someone who \napproached his life with a whole-hearted determination and zeal. In the \nwords of his Uncle Joe, ``Robert lived and died giving it his all.''\n  Robert graduated from Marion-Franklin High School in 2003, where he \nwas known for his love of football. Despite being one of the smaller \nplayers on the team, he fought with a true grit to prove himself on the \nfield. His passion, was an inspiration to his coach and his teammates. \n``He was our `Rudy','' said Marion-Franklin head football coach, Gary \nTucker, referring to the 1993 film about a football player, small in \nstature, who struggled against the odds to play college ball. As Coach \nTucker put it, ``Michael always gave 150 percent.''\n  A former teammate, then quarterback Tony McMichael, said that Robert \n``lived and breathed football. . . . He knew how to pump people up.''\n  After graduation, Robert would return to Marion-Franklin to cheer on \nthe younger players. ``He was so involved, so spirited, so upbeat,'' \nCoach Tucker said. ``He felt like he could conquer anything.''\n  Robert's enthusiasm and willingness to get involved stretched beyond \nthe football field. He was a summer school teacher's aide at Marion-\nFranklin and an aide for the Sunday school at Sts. Simon and Jude \nCatholic Church of West Jefferson. He was an avid outdoorsman, and he \nwas also very active in West Jefferson Youth Athletic Association.\n  Shortly after graduating from Marion-Franklin High, Robert moved in \nwith his Aunt Angie and Uncle Joe, and his cousins Jordan, Riley, \nLandon, and Ryan. ``He was a good kid,'' Angie said. ``We thought of \nhim as a son. He was just like one of the kids. He was such a beautiful \nsoul and spirit.''\n  Robert loved playing baseball, basketball, and football with his \nyounger cousins, as well as watching The Ohio State University Buckeyes \nfootball games. His Uncle Joe fondly remembers the eagerness with which \nRobert would help out at youth football games. ``He would run chains, \ndo the scoreboard, carry water, anything to help out the Peewee team,'' \nJoe said. ``He was so enthusiastic, you would have thought he was \ncoaching pro ball!''\n  Mr. President, Robert also loved animals and had a wicked sweet \ntooth. ``He was a junk-food junkie,'' his Aunt Angie said. ``He'd eat \n15 candy bars and three bags of chips in one sitting and never offer a \nbite.''\n  Robert lived with his aunt and uncle until he enlisted in the Army. \nHe was inspired by the example of his older brother Thomas McClellan, \nwho had joined the Air Force. Although family members tried to persuade \nRobert into either the Air Force or the Navy, Robert was adamant in his \ndecision to enlist in the Army. Robert's lifelong ambition, which he \nhad dreamed about since high school, was to become a nurse, and the \nArmy was where he could get the skills he needed to achieve that goal.\n  Robert was a good soldier. According to SGT Christopher Mills, Robert \nhad a ``determination to become a better soldier'' and ``never failed \nto get the job done.'' Robert's brother Thomas said that ``he knew what \nhe was getting into, but that's Rob. He had a big heart. He always \nwanted to help other people.''\n  Robert was assigned to the 3rd U.S. Armored Cavalry Regiment, Thunder \nSquadron, based at Fort Carson, CO. That October, he married the woman \nhe loved--Alexandria--while on leave. Alexandria said that Robert \n``would always be the first to let you know that he was the strongest \nin our family, and he would do anything to take care of us.'' She also \nremembers Robert's cheerful, outgoing nature. ``He was always trying to \nfind the good in people,'' she recalled. ``He would always love to \ntalk. He would always love to put a smile on [my] face.''\n  While in Iraq, Robert frequently wrote to his family. His last letter \nhome was sent to his 8-year-old cousin Riley. He wrote to Riley that \nkeeping her safe was all the encouragement he\n\n[[Page S11303]]\n\nneeded. He wrote: ``I can't promise that I will make it home . . . but \nI promise I will return a hero.''\n  Robert Swaney did, indeed, become a hero. He was a young man who \nalways put the well-being of others before his own. In recognition of \nhis outstanding service, the Army posthumously promoted him to \nspecialist.\n  I would like to conclude by quoting from a letter that Robert wrote \nto his mother. This is what he wrote:\n\n       I want you to know that I'm doing well and doing what I \n     enjoy the most--serving the people of the United States of \n     America.\n\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Robert's family and friends in \nour thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                   LANCE CORPORAL TAYLOR B. PRAZYNSKI\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fallen marine--LCpl \nTaylor B. Prazynski from Fairfield, OH. Lance Corporal Prazynski was \nkilled on May 9, 2005, by an indirect fire explosion while in combat in \nIraq. He was only 20 years old.\n  As a young boy growing up in Fairfield, Taylor dreamed of being a \nsoldier. He was born on Veterans Day at an Air Force base where his \nfather John was serving in the military. John remembers that Taylor \nloved to try on his dad's uniform as a boy and was simply destined to \njoin the military.\n  As a child, his favorite hangout was an Army surplus store. Today, a \nphoto of 6-year-old Taylor in a military camouflage jumpsuit and beret \nstill hangs there.\n  Taylor joined the Marines shortly after graduating from Fairfield \nHigh School in 2003. For him, there was simply no question of what it \nwas he wanted to do. As his father recalls, ``Taylor always said he was \nwhere he was supposed to be and doing what he was supposed to be \ndoing.''\n  Taylor was a compassionate young man who loved kids. While a senior \nin high school, he volunteered to serve as an aide for a classroom of \nmultihandicapped students. Some of the students he worked with \ncontacted Taylor's family when they heard news of his death.\n  Gary Staggs, an aide for the school's multihandicapped class, \ndescribed Taylor as a budding teacher who inspired students. He \nremembers Fairfield graduate Josh Dixon, who was among the first to \nline up to pay respects to Taylor at his funeral, which was held at the \nFairfield High School gym. Josh used a walker to enter the gym, and \nGary said it was Taylor's hard work in 2003 that helped Josh abandon \nhis wheelchair. According to Gary:\n\n       Taylor took it upon himself to set up Josh Dixon's braces \n     and lay down mats for his practice walks every school day. He \n     basically carried him. Then one day, Josh walks into the \n     classroom with Taylor by his side and both of them [were] \n     beaming with pride. . . . One person can make such a \n     difference in someone's life, and Taylor did that--and more.\n\n  Taylor was simply the kind of young man who cared so much for others. \nAs Gary Staggs put it:\n\n       He was big enough to bend over and help somebody else. He \n     was doing what he wanted to be doing. He helped kids, but he \n     also wanted to help society. He wanted to make a difference \n     in Iraq.\n\n  Friends describe Taylor as a hard-working man who loved art, played \nfootball, and participated in track and field. He was well liked and \ndeeply respected by all who knew him.\n  Scott Datillo, the head football coach at Fairfield High School, \nremembers Taylor's spirit of cooperation:\n\n       When you are a coach and want to develop a team, you want \n     kids like him. He bought into the team concept. He worked \n     hard and made the most of his abilities.\n\n  Taylor's tribute pages on the Internet continue to be filled in daily \nby those who knew and loved him. He is so deeply missed. One friend, \nElizabeth Williams, wrote the following message to her dear friend \nTaylor:\n\n       Taylor, words will never be able to express the void that I \n     have felt in my life and heart since you've been gone. . . .I \n     have always loved you with all of my heart, and I just hope \n     you knew that when you were here with us. There is not a \n     single day that goes by that I don't think about you and miss \n     you like crazy. Sometimes, I cannot help but think about \n     things that could have been; but, even on those days, all I \n     can think about are all the happy memories and the moments of \n     our lives together.\n\n  Fellow Marine Cpl Brent T. Willoughby, stationed in Afghanistan, says \nthis of Taylor:\n\n       I had the honor of meeting Taylor . . . in Louisville on \n     our way to Parris Island in November 2003. We were in the \n     same platoon and graduated on January 30, 2004. During our \n     time at Parris Island, I saw the love of life that Ski \n     (that's what we called him) possessed. As the lay reader for \n     a platoon, Ski asked me to pray with him on several \n     occasions, and he always let me know within a few days that \n     his prayers had been answered. His dedication and devotion to \n     this country and to his fellow marines will never be \n     forgotten. Rest assured that God has called him home and that \n     when we meet him again, he will be standing guard somewhere \n     in heaven smiling that timeless smile. Godspeed and Semper \n     Fi.\n\n  Taylor Prazynski was loved and admired by all those who knew him. He \nwill always be remembered. He had a bright future before him. His \nfather said that in the last months of his son's young life, Taylor had \nspoken in phone calls from Iraq about wanting to become a special \neducation teacher.\n  More than 1,500 people came to Fairfield High School's gym to pay \nfinal respects to Taylor. It was fitting that the stirring tribute to \nthe fallen hero took place at his high school, where the line of well-\nwishers waiting to file past Taylor's coffin stretched over 100 yards.\n  His father said:\n\n       Taylor loved the idea of ``once a marine always a marine.'' \n     Every time I spoke to him, I told him I loved him and that he \n     was my hero. We sent a boy to boot camp, and he came home a \n     man.\n\n  A compassionate young man, Taylor had a great big heart and a \ntremendous sense of dedication to his family, community, and his \ncountry.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep the family of Taylor Prazynski--\nhis father and stepmother, John and Carol, and his mother Claudia--in \nour thoughts and our prayers.\n\n\n                        Corporal Joshua D. Jones\n\n  Mr. President, this evening, I wish to pay tribute to Army Cpl Joshua \nJones, a soldier from Pomeroy, OH. On August 27, 2006, Joshua died in \nIraq when his humvee came under attack from enemy small arms fire. The \n24-year-old soldier was a member of the 3rd Battalion, 67th Armor \nRegiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division based out of \nFort Hood, TX. Joshua leaves his wife Tiffany, his daughter Cami, and \ntheir unborn child which Tiffany is expecting this coming March. He is \nalso survived by his mom Sandy, stepfather Arlyn, his father Gary, \nstepmother Cindy, brothers Caleb, Peter, and Jacob, and sister \nAlexandria.\n  Joshua completed his basic training at Fort Knox in May 2004 and went \nto Iraq in December 2005. Joshua knew his mission in Iraq. He knew it \nwell. He knew that he was fighting so that those he loved--his friends, \nfamily, and so many other Americans--would never have to. Friends tell \nus he joined the Army to protect them.\n  The role of protector was not a new one for Joshua. He was born on \nJanuary 2, 1982, and was one of six children. Growing up, Joshua always \nlooked out for his younger siblings. His love of family was evident in \nall his actions.\n  His dad beams with pride when talking about his son. Joshua's dad \nrecalls the passion and bravery Joshua showed when he talked with him \nnearly 3 years ago about his decision to join the Army. According to \nGary:\n\n       Whenever [Joshua] talked about joining the Army, he always \n     said he was going to go fight so that his siblings would \n     never have to.\n\n  Joshua is lovingly remembered by all who had the privilege of knowing \nthis brave young man. Those who knew him best recall his energy, his \noptimism, his warmth. They remember him doing the things he loved--\nsinging, traveling, racing remote-controlled cars, and riding all-\nterrain vehicles in the hills and trails of southeastern Ohio. Family \nfriend David Kelly remembers Joshua as a young man who knew what he \nwanted and that was simply to love and care for the people around him.\n\n  And there is no one whom Joshua loved more than his wife Tiffany. \nThis past September 12, they would have celebrated their 3-year wedding \nanniversary. Tiffany is making sure that Joshua's character and heroism \nare not forgotten. She made a book of pictures of their family and \nJoshua's time in Iraq. Before his death, she also kept a Web site with \npictures and updates on his activities in Iraq. To be sure, Tiffany's \nefforts will preserve Joshua's legacy for their children.\n  Joshua's family saw him for the last time in June, while he was home \non a 2-week leave after being in Iraq for half\n\n[[Page S11304]]\n\nof a year. They made the most of every moment they had together before \nhe had to return. Josh loved his family so much.\n  Joshua was the very best kind of person--a man who put family and \nNation above all else. He was a great son, husband, and father. He \nliked nothing more than to hold his wife and his daughter. Shortly \nafter his return to Iraq, Joshua received the wonderful news that \nTiffany was pregnant with their second child.\n  He called her every day from Iraq and often sent instant messages to \nhis parents. For Joshua, nothing was more important than staying in \ntouch with the people he loved.\n  Joshua's death is a loss to all of Meigs County. At his funeral, he \nwas remembered not just for his heroism but for the quality and \nintegrity of his life. As a soldier, he approached every task with \ndetermination and purpose. Army BG Bruce Berwick lauded Joshua for his \nservice when he said the following:\n\n       No one will ever say Corporal Jones did nothing. He \n     confronted evil. He drove it back. He made a difference. He \n     died doing nothing less than saving this world.\n\n  One of Joshua's friends, Tammi Adamson, left the following message \nfor him on an Internet tribute Web site. She reflected on his devotion \nto his country, his kindness, and the deep love he held for his family. \nThis is what Tammi wrote:\n\n       Thank you, Josh, for your most honorable and unselfish \n     service. I will never forget you, nor will I ever stop loving \n     you. You were like my brother, and I will miss you each and \n     every day. You are my hero and a hero to my children. Words \n     cannot express the sadness and the sorrow I feel for [your] \n     family. Anyone who knew [you would know that you were] a \n     wonderful person and husband who adored [your] wife and \n     [your] . . . daughter. May God keep you in His hand, and may \n     you rest now. Your mission is finished.\n\n  That was so beautifully said by his friend.\n  My wife Fran and I will continue to keep the friends and family of \nCpl Joshua D. Jones in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                      Specialist David H. Ford IV\n\n  Mr. President, this evening I pay honor and tribute to Army SPC David \nH. Ford, IV, from Ironton, OH. Specialist Ford was a member of the 4th \nBattalion, 64th Armor Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry, \nstationed at Fort Stewart, GA. On September 26, 2005, he was killed \nwhen an improvised explosive device detonated near his military vehicle \nwhile he was on patrol in Baghdad. He had turned 20 years old just 6 \ndays before his death.\n  On September 10, 1985, David was born to Violet Adams Ford and David \nFord, III, in Norfolk, VA. David's family then moved to Ironton, OH. In \n2003, David graduated from Ironton High School, where he was a big fan \nof the football team.\n  David also liked to bowl. ``He was an excellent person,'' his Aunt \nMinnie said. ``[H]e would give the last thing he could to anybody.''\n  David was a proud soldier. When he joined the Army, he was continuing \nhis family's tradition of military service. His father served in the \nNavy for 20 years, and his brother Ray also serves in the Army. As \nDavid's friend, Shannon Bare, said:\n\n       He always wanted to follow in his dad's footsteps.\n\n  His friends will remember him as a fun-loving young man who enjoyed \nlife. The Rev. Robert Pierce, David's pastor of 14 years, agrees that \nDavid always had a smile for everyone. He said:\n\n       I'll always remember him as that grinning little boy.\n\n  Life wasn't always easy for David, however. His father passed away \nwhile he was in junior high, and his house burned down before he \ngraduated from high school. But David always kept a brave smile on his \nface. He simply dealt with hardship with unusual grace. His friend and \nIronton classmate, Rebecca Dingus, considers him a true example of \ncourage. This is what she said:\n\n       He was wonderful, such a strong person. He had been through \n     so much. He lost his father at a young age. His house burned \n     down our senior year, but he kept going. He had such a big \n     heart.\n\n  Indeed, this is the strength and spirit that helped David and his \nfamily through their difficulties. David's friend Shannon remembers how \nDavid always stayed positive:\n\n       He never had a sad look on his face. He always kept a smile \n     on his face. He made friends with everybody. He called me a \n     couple months ago to ask how everyone was doing back here.\n\n  David cared about people and they cared about him. He was deeply \nloved by his family--his mother Violet, his fiancee Susie White, his \nbrother Ray, and his sister Kimberly. His mother said that David was a \nresponsible young man who loved life and was easy to love. He was her \n``pride and joy.'' But she knows that he ``died doing what he wanted.'' \nThat is what his mom said.\n  David joined the Army in 2003 after graduating from high school. He \nplanned to study forensic science after his military service was \ncompleted. His cousin, J.P. Harris, said that David was interested in \nforensic science and that ``[h]e wanted to get into CSI-type of \ninvestigations.'' J.P. also said:\n\n       It makes you proud he was a member of your family. He was \n     the type of person who did what he was supposed to do.\n\n  Repeatedly, that is what friends and families said about David--that \nhe was such a good person, that he cared for his family, that he did \nwhat was right and that made his family very proud. ``He was proud of \nbeing a soldier,'' his mother remembers. ``He believed in standing up \nfor what he believed in.''\n  One of David's former teachers, Sue Blagg, remembers that David ``was \na quiet student. He always had his work in on time, and he was never \nany trouble.'' David's work ethic, his kindness, and his optimism were \nalso apparent to those he served with in the Army. One of his comrades, \nSGT Heath A. Hutchison, left the following message in David's memory on \nan Internet tribute Web site. This is what he wrote:\n\n       There would never be enough to say about David. I knew him \n     well. He was always the guy to make me laugh, and now he \n     makes me cry. I will always remember him and all of the crazy \n     things that we did together. I will miss him, and I thank God \n     that I knew him.\n\n  At David's funeral, BG John C. Bartley read the following statement \nfrom David's commanding officer in Iraq noting David's unforgettable \nsmile:\n\n       When I saw him, I thought to myself: My goodness, this \n     soldier looks so young. But as time went on, I saw him mature \n     from a boy into a man. Watching him grow amazed me. As first \n     gunner, I could see he was nervous, but before I knew it, he \n     was standing before me grinning from ear to ear.\n\n  David will be remembered with pride by all who knew him. Internet \ntribute pages are full of comments from those individuals who remember \nhis warmth, his bravery, and how he could make any day brighter simply \nby being himself. He was a great friend to many, and his death is a \nloss for all. As his grandfather Ray Adams said:\n\n       I am proud of him. I am real proud. He was a fine boy. I \n     tell you, it is a great loss.\n\n  Indeed, David Ford was a remarkable person--a beloved son, grandson, \nand brother. He was also a gracious human being. He was bright and he \nwas kind. When confronted with challenges in life, he smiled. He didn't \ngive up. He kept going. He persevered.\n  David Ford will never be forgotten. We celebrate his life--a life \ndevoted to serving his country and loving and respecting his family and \nfriends.\n  My wife Fran and I will continue to keep David's family in our \nthoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                    First Sergeant Ricky L. McGinnis\n\n  Mr. President, this evening I would like to honor the memory of Army \n1SG Ricky L. McGinnis, who was originally from Hamilton, OH. First \nSergeant McGinnis was killed in Iraq when a roadside bomb detonated \nnear his patrol on October 26, 2006. He is survived by his wife Kerstin \nand their four daughters: Julia, Laura, Melissa, and Nina. He is also \nsurvived by his sisters, Rhonda Isaacs and Julie Wilson and his brother \nCarl Wilkerson. Ricky was 42 years of age at the time of his death.\n  Ricky McGinnis graduated from Hamilton High School in 1983 and joined \nthe Army soon after at the age of 18. His niece Nichole recalls how \nimportant the military was to Ricky. She said:\n\n       I remembered him always being in an Army uniform. Ever \n     since I was born, he was in the Army.\n\n  Ricky gave 23 years of dedicated service to our country and to the \nArmy, though he was planning to retire from the military when he \nreturned from his deployment in Iraq. Ricky's sister Rhonda remembers \nhow\n\n[[Page S11305]]\n\nproud he was to serve our country and how patriotic he was. Ricky's \ncommitment to the military took him around the world--from Germany to \nKorea to the Middle East.\n  It was in Germany where he met the love of his life, his wife \nKerstin. They were married over 20 years ago in Weisenbaden, Germany, \nin 1986. Ricky was a loving husband and a devoted, proud father of \ntheir four girls. He certainly loved his family unconditionally.\n  Relatives remember that Ricky's daughters meant everything to him. He \nloved coaching them in softball, basketball, and soccer. One family \nfriend wrote the following to Ricky on an Internet tribute Web site:\n\n       Coach Mac, we can't believe you are gone. God must have \n     needed a great coach and leader in Heaven to have taken you \n     so very soon.\n\n  In his 23 years of service, Ricky embodied the best of everything the \nArmy stands for: loyalty, courage, and selflessness. His passion and \ncommitment to the Army was seen by all who were privileged to serve \nwith him. Ricky inspired so many others to follow his example and join \nthe Army, including his 19-year-old nephew, PFC Joey Isaacs.\n  To Joey, his uncle was more than a mentor--he was a ``best friend'' \nand a ``second father.'' Joey's mother Rhonda--Ricky's sister--\nremembers that Joey saw his uncle as a hero. Joey remembers how proud \nRicky was when he decided to join the Army. This is what Joey says:\n\n       All we ever talked about was going to Iraq. My uncle and I \n     were inseparable. When I told him I joined the Army, he \n     couldn't have been more proud. He said it was going to be a \n     long year, but we were going to get through it. Whenever I \n     needed him, he was always there.\n\n  In Iraq, Ricky and Joey served in the same unit as part of the First \nCavalry Division. Every day they would meet to eat lunch together. \nAccording to Rhonda, ``Ricky was going to make sure nothing ever \nhappened to Joey.'' And that is exactly what Ricky did.\n  While both Ricky and Joey were in Iraq, Joey's father was \nhospitalized after an accident. Without hesitation, Ricky started \nworking to get his nephew home so that he could be with his family. \nRhonda remembers the last words Ricky spoke to her. He said:\n\n       Hey, Sis, I am doing everything to get Joey home. I love \n     you.\n\n  That conversation took place on Tuesday. The following Thursday, just \n2 days later, Ricky was killed.\n  Joey also recalls the last conversation he had with his uncle. Ricky \nhad come to his barracks to make sure that his nephew was doing all \nright, and doing all right with his dad's accident. This is how Joey \nremembers that last final meeting:\n\n       The last time I saw my uncle, he came to my barracks to \n     visit me because I was having a rough time with my dad and \n     his accident. He came in and told me he was there for me--I \n     could talk to him. He told me to be strong, to keep doing my \n     job, and he told me that he loved me.\n\n  Ricky's final mission was simply taking care of his family. He \nsucceeded. Joey was able to return home and his father recovered from \nhis accident. As Joey said:\n\n       God saved my dad and now my uncle is with God.\n\n  Without question, Ricky did his job in protecting his family, but his \ncompassion and strength were large enough to take care of others as \nwell. He was loyal to and protective of everyone with whom he served. \nLTC Keith Gogas, Ricky's squadron commander, remembers the dedication \nwith which he served. This is what he said:\n\n       Ricky was doing exactly what he loved doing: leading his \n     soldiers. He loved being a first sergeant because he loved \n     his troops. He loved training them. He loved watching them \n     mature, and he loved turning them into cavalrymen.\n\n  Indeed, Ricky was a leader in the truest sense of the word. With his \nwords and his deeds he trained a new generation of leaders. And he \ntruly believed in what he was doing. As his niece Nichole said:\n\n       Ricky was very patriotic. He said he was going to go to \n     Iraq just to get the job done. He was totally about just \n     getting over there and doing his job and worrying about the \n     men he supervised.\n\n  Ricky made it his job to look out for others. This is the type of man \nhe was.\n  The following words were once said by an American soldier:\n\n       What we have done for ourselves, alone, dies with us. What \n     we have done for others and the world remains and is \n     immortal.\n\n  These words could not be more fitting in describing the full life of \n1SG Ricky McGinnis. Ricky spent 23 years of his life working for \nothers, working for our Nation. This lifetime of service will remain, \nand it will be immortalized in all those who Ricky trained, led, and \ninspired. A devoted husband, father, uncle, and son, he impacted them \nand changed their lives in countless ways. He is deeply missed by all \nthose who knew him and all of those who loved him.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Ricky's family in our thoughts \nand in our prayers.\n\n\n                       Army Sergeant David Gordon\n\n  Mr. President, this evening I would like to honor the life of David \nGordon from Williamsfield, OH. David was a member of the 3rd Battalion, \n16th Field Artillery Regiment, 4th Infantry Division based in Fort \nHood, TX. On September 8, 2006, he was killed in Baghdad when an \nimprovised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. David was \nserving his second tour of duty in Iraq, and he was scheduled to return \nhome in just 2 months. He was 23 years of age at the time of his death.\n  David Gordon leaves his wife Kimber, his stepchildren Miguel and \nMatthew, his father Rodney, his mother Judy, his stepfather Bob, and \nhis three sisters Theresa, Tiffany, and Jean.\n  David was born in Westfield, NY. His family moved to Pennsylvania and \nthen to Ohio where he attended Pymatuming Valley School. David was \nknown for always helping his loved ones. A childhood friend, Michael \nReed, said David was the best friend anyone could ask for and that \nwhenever anyone said something bad about Michael, David would stick up \nfor him. Michael described David as tough, but that deep down he was \njust a big puppy dog.\n  In 2000, David graduated from South Ridge Christian Academy where he \nspent his senior year. David joined the Army immediately after \ngraduating high school. According to his aunt, Kathy Hicks, he wanted \npeople to be proud of him and wanted to model himself after others who \nhad gone into the military. David's grandfather Howard Gordon said that \nDavid was going to make the Army a career, and he really believed he \nwas making a difference.\n  A person with a great zest for life, David enjoyed so many different \nthings. He liked hunting, fishing, football, and wrestling, and he was \na fan of NASCAR. His sister Jean remembers that he was an outgoing \nperson. She says:\n\n       He liked to horse around. He liked to watch movies, play \n     video games, and to be on his computer.\n\n  David's wife Kimber remembers the impact he had on those whom he \nknew, and this is what she said:\n\n       David was an extraordinary man, husband, father to our \n     sons, and awesome son and brother. Anyone who had the \n     privilege of having him as a friend would say he touched \n     their life like no other. David is so deeply missed and will \n     always be loved and held in our hearts forever.\n\n  David's aunt Kathy wants people to remember that he was a great kid, \nthe kind of boy who always wanted to help out others. This is what she \nsaid:\n\n       David was so polite, especially to me. He would hug me \n     whenever he saw me. Most kids that age would not do that, but \n     David was a fun-loving kid who played video games. He was a \n     good kid all the way around.\n\n  His mom said:\n\n       He was the kind of boy that would make your darkest days \n     shine bright. He was not only my son, but also my best \n     friend.\n\n  A fitting tribute to David was given when his body was brought home \nto Andover, OH. Friends, neighbors, and strangers stood silently as his \nbody was brought through Andover Square, led by Wayne and Andover fire, \npolice, and emergency crews. Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts stood at \nattention and held candles to honor this brave fallen soldier. One of \nthe Scouts said:\n\n       I am here to honor him and to honor my country. It is so \n     sad, so sad that he is dead, but I can feel him in my heart.\n\n  Mr. President, the Andover Council president, Myra Brown, said it was \nimportant for the communities to support each other as they grieved for \ntheir hero. Mark Wilbur, president of the Andover Fraternal Order of \nEagles, said:\n\n       David won't just be honored in Andover, he will be \n     remembered forever as our hero. He reminds us that freedom \n     isn't free.\n\n  Friend Tim Haidon said the following about him:\n\n\n[[Page S11306]]\n\n\n       We met at the church a few years ago before we went back to \n     Iraq. He was a person of faith and we are fortunate to know \n     today he is in heaven.\n\n  David Gordon was a good person, someone who was passionate about the \nsecurity of others, who dedicated himself to protecting all of us.\n  David Gordon was an exceptional young man. He was simply the type of \nperson who never gave up. Today, we honor his life and we remember how \nhe was a devoted son, a caring brother, a loving husband and father. It \nis through the good deeds that he did--the service to our Nation that \nhe so selflessly gave--that his memory will never fade.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks with the heartfelt words of the \nfather of fallen Army soldier, SGT Gregory L. Wahl. He posted this \nmessage on a Web site honoring David. This is what he had to say:\n\n       To the Gordon family from the Wahl family--you are not \n     alone. Every fallen family and our family are with you. Our \n     heart and prayers are with you and David. He has not died in \n     vain. He is an American hero, and so much more to all who \n     knew him. David has touched the hearts of many. Be supportive \n     towards one another in honoring your son, David.\n\n  He continues on:\n\n       Each of you and all of us who knew him will reflect on the \n     very fond and precious memorable times we shared together \n     with David. Shed a smile, laugh, and tears. David would not \n     want anyone sad or unhappy. David is with Gregory. They \n     didn't know one another, yet both are brothers. David, you \n     will never, ever, ever be forgotten as you are remembered \n     today and always.\n\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep SGT David Gordon's family and \nfriends in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                      STAFF SERGEANT ELVIS BOURDON\n\n  Mr. President, I rise this evening to pay tribute to a fallen \nsoldier--Army SSG Elvis Bourdon, originally from Youngstown, OH. Staff \nSergeant Bourdon was killed in Baghdad on September 6, 2004, when his \nmilitary vehicle came under attack by enemy small-arms fire. He was 36 \nyears old, and was serving with the 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry \nRegiment, 1st Cavalry Division based out of Fort Hood, TX. Left to \ncherish his memory are his wife Mary, and their two children Corey and \nAllyssa, his father Juan, his mother Dalila, his brothers Ray and Juan, \nJr., and his sisters Elizabeth, Jenny, Thannia, and Barbara.\n  Although Elvis and his family resided in Texas, he will always be a \nproud son of Ohio. His home community of Youngstown mourns the loss of \na true hero. Family, friends, and neighbors will never forget Elvis. \nHis death was a loss for his entire community. Every day, he is \nremembered as a wonderful husband, father, and patriot.\n  A friend of Elvis' named Teresa Schaub from Killeen, TX, left him a \nmessage on an Internet tribute Web site. In it, she reflects upon the \nlove shared by Elvis and his wife, and the pride with which his life is \nremembered. This is what she wrote:\n\n       Elvis, I come to your grave side often. . . . You [and \n     Mary] were both always laughing and so happy. Nothing can \n     ever take that away. You both were always an inspiration to \n     everyone and continue to be. . . . Everyone is so proud of \n     you, Elvis. . . . Leaving us is like going through a stormy \n     season here on Earth, but then we think of you as the rainbow \n     that comes out after the storm and the clouds begin to fade. \n     You are our rainbow, our hope, and you will always be our \n     HERO.\n\n  Elvis was deeply respected and loved by those with whom he served in \nthe Army. They remember him as a man with whom new recruits could \nalways sit down and talk--whether it was about personal problems or any \nother questions that needed to be answered. Whatever it was, Elvis was \nalways willing to listen.\n  Elvis is also remembered for his humor. Those who served with him \nrecall that he was always joking, always smiling. He was a spirited and \nhumorous man--someone who shared great laughs with everyone around him.\n  SPC Christopher Beck served with Elvis and remembers how much Elvis \ntaught him during that time. In his honor, Specialist Beck wears a \nblack ``killed in action'' bracelet, on which is written Elvis' name, \nrank, hometown, military branch, and date of death. Specialist Beck \ndoes this so that he may never forget the sacrifice that Elvis made for \nour country and for those he loved.\n  Soldiers who served with Elvis at Fort Hood remember the respect with \nwhich the Staff Sergeant was regarded. ``He was always a great NCO,'' \nJoshua Roughton wrote. ``I respected him greatly, as I know all of us \nin 1-22 Infantry, B-Company did. He will be missed.''\n  And another of Elvis' comrades, Eric Kneffler, wrote the following in \nhis memory on an Internet tribute Web site:\n\n       Staff Sergeant Bourdon will be dearly missed by his family \n     and Fellow Soldiers. I had the opportunity to serve with him \n     at Fort Hood and considered him a good buddy and someone to \n     count on.\n\n  Aaron DeShay also served with Elvis. He wrote this on Elvis's tribute \nWeb page:\n\n       To the family and friends of Elvis Bourdon, may God bless \n     you and bring you comfort in this most painful of times. I, \n     like many others, served with Elvis in B-Company 1-22 and \n     found a good friend in him. I share your pain as he has left \n     his mark in my heart as he has with those who got to know \n     him. We had a lot of laughs together, and I know he will be \n     greatly missed as he truly was a great man.\n\n  Jeremy Cheney was another of Elvis' comrades who will never forget \nhim. This is what he wrote about Elvis:\n\n       Staff Sergeant Bourdon taught me many things as a soldier \n     and as a person. He was an excellent team member and was easy \n     to get along with, regardless of differences in rank. He will \n     be missed.\n\n  In these numerous messages left for Elvis, I think one thing is \nbeautifully clear--Elvis was a man who could be depended upon and was \nsomeone that so many looked up to. He was someone who could be trusted \nand who had a huge impact on everyone he met. Indeed, Elvis was a \ndedicated and respected soldier.\n  More importantly, though, he was a devoted family man, who deeply \nloved his wife, children, and siblings. Elvis' brother, who also serves \nin the military, remembers how they would laugh and talk over a cup of \ncoffee.\n  They would talk so that they could help each other cope through \ndifficult times. And, in the military, they fought side-by-side. They \nwere truly brothers-in-arms.\n  Elvis' sister remembers her brother as a true hero and a peacemaker. \nIt is for these traits that she remembers and honors him. She wrote the \nfollowing in honor of Elvis:\n\n       I would like to thank everyone for the blessing of my \n     brother and any fallen heroes. Our family sends love and \n     appreciation to those all over the United States. I loved my \n     brother dearly and he is a true hero in my book. He was a \n     good person, who loved his family and siblings. He was a \n     peacemaker, and I love him for that. Your family misses you, \n     little brother, and you will always be in our prayers. We \n     love you and miss you very much.\n\n  Elvis was dearly loved and respected by all who knew him. His tribute \npages continue to be filled with messages from family and friends. \nThese messages serve as living testaments to his legacy. Elvis had many \npeople who loved him. On the tribute page, his wife recognized the \noutpouring of support. She wrote the following, 2 years after Elvis's \ndeath:\n\n       It makes me feel good inside to know my husband had touched \n     so many soldiers' lives. He loved his job . . . and would be \n     proud and humbled by your words. The children and I are \n     strong, faithful people. God knew he was a good guy and \n     wanted to be with him, too. Continue to keep my husband's \n     advice going, and keep his family in your prayers. Thank you.\n\n  When I think of men like Elvis Bourdon, I am reminded of words once \nspoken by Sir Winston Churchill. He said that ``courage is rightly \nesteemed the first of human qualities, because it is the quality that \nguarantees all others.''\n  Without question, Elvis served his country with courage--and that \nguaranteed the rest. He will always be remembered. My wife Fran and I \ncontinue to keep his family and friends in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                      SPECIALIST RICHARD A. HARDY\n\n  Mr. President, I rise this evening to pay tribute to Army SPC Richard \nA. Hardy from Bolivar, OH. On October 15, 2005, Specialist Hardy was \none of five soldiers who died when an improvised explosive device \ndetonated near his military vehicle. He was 24 years old.\n  Rick--as he was called by family and friends--wasn't planning to join \nthe Army when he graduated from Timken High School in 2000. However, \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11th motivated him to enlist. He \nwanted to serve his country. He wanted to protect our homeland. Rick \nwas assigned to A\n\n[[Page S11307]]\n\nCompany, 2nd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, \nbased at Fort Benning, GA.\n  Rick's father Richard remembers his son as ``a great kid.'' He also \nrecalls the commitment Rick displayed in always trying to do his best. \nRick graduated in 2000. ``He was really proud of that,'' his father \nrecalls.\n  During Rick's funeral, BG Tod Carmony, the deputy commander for the \n38th Infantry Division, remarked upon the courage Rick displayed by \nenlisting in the Army after the 9/11 attacks. Rick knew it was wartime, \nand he knew the risks that he would be running. But, he enlisted \nanyway. This is what Brigadier General Carmony said about Rick:\n\n       He understood that we have no choice but to win this global \n     war on terrorism if his family, his community, and his \n     country are to be safe. So Richard put himself on the line, \n     and he died trying to keep that promise of safety to his \n     family and country.\n\n  Brigadier General Carmony also noted that Rick was an expert with a \ncarbine and a qualified Bradley gunner. According to the Brigadier \nGeneral, this ``is quite an accomplishment.''\n  Rick's father remembers that his son was proud of his role in the \nmilitary and took the dangers of it in stride. He said, ``Rick didn't \nmind at all. It was a job--that's the way he looked at it.''\n  Indeed, the Army was a job that Rick did exceedingly well. When he \ndied, he was on his second tour of duty in Iraq. And according to his \nfather, Rick had been sent back because the Iraq elections were \napproaching and they ``wanted some guys with experience in the \ncountry.''\n  Well, Rick was a guy with experience--and he used that experience to \nhelp further the goal of democracy in Iraq. In fact, the day Rick died \nwas also the day that millions of Iraqis braved death to vote for their \nnew constitution.\n  As Brigadier General Carmony put it, ``By being there, Richard gave \nthe Iraqi people a chance to move a step closer to freedom and \ndemocracy.''\n  Rick was scheduled to return home in December 2005. According to his \nfather, he was going to take some time off to relax and then planned on \ngetting a job as a welder.\n  Those who knew best Rick remember that his favorite pastime was \nriding dirt bikes. His father owns about 6 acres of land, and Rick \nsimply loved riding all over it. ``He was all over the place,'' his dad \nrecalls.\n  Rick also loved barbecue--steaks and ribs. His father said that Rick \nhad to have a barbecue every time he came home. According to his dad, \nRick ``said it beat the MREs--[that] there was nothing like a home-\ncooked meal.''\n  These barbecues were one of the many things Rick loved. He enjoyed \nlife, and he especially enjoyed the simple things--like coming home to \neat a good meal with his family.\n  Specialist Hardy was a courageous soldier--a true hero, who always \nstood on the front lines. His Internet tribute Web page continues to be \nfilled daily by family and friends with messages that serve as a living \ntestament to Rick's legacy. Rick had many people who loved him.\n  His Aunt ``Debbers'' posted the following message on the tribute Web \nsite. This is what she wrote:\n\n       Ricky! You were supposed to come home alive and well! I \n     guess God had other plans. You are so loved and missed. I \n     know you didn't want to be forgotten, but this wasn't the way \n     we wanted to remember you. May you at last find peace. You \n     will always be remembered, especially at the family \n     barbeques.\n       God bless you for what you have ultimately paid the price \n     for--our freedom. Give Gram a hug and kiss. All our love to \n     you.\n\n  Rick's Aunt Sandra posted this message:\n\n       To my nephew--you will be missed greatly, and we love you. \n     We are also very proud of you and all of your comrades who \n     are fighting this war. God bless all of you.\n\n  Rick's body was laid to rest with full military honors at St. \nStephen's Catholic Cemetery in Bolivar. For his brave actions, Rick was \nposthumously awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. During his \ncareer with the Army, he was also the recipient of the Army Good \nConduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraqi Campaign Medal, \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Combat \nInfantryman's Badge, and the Weapons Qualification Badge.\n  The world is a better place since Rick Hardy has been in it. A young \nman with courage and a sense of adventure, Rick was the model of what \nwe all hope our children will become.\n  My wife Fran and I will continue to keep Rick's father and step-\nmother, Richard and Jody, his mother Doris; and his sisters Kristy and \nJessica in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11307-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR MIKE DeWINE\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, I rise for a moment in morning business \nto address an issue that to some may appear only to affect the State of \nGeorgia and maybe even in particular the city of Atlanta. But in \npractice, I say to the distinguished Senator from Utah who is in the \nchair and others, this is an issue of major import to the United States \nof America.\n  An offer has been tendered for the purchase of Delta Airlines. Delta \nAirlines is a great American carrier that, like most airlines, has gone \nthrough terribly difficult times post-9/11. Delta went into bankruptcy. \nDelta has worked hard in bankruptcy to develop a plan to exit \nbankruptcy as a healthy, thriving, and dominate company. To Delta's \neternal credit, their management committed from the beginning that they \nwould honor and preserve the pension plans of their employees were we \nable in the U.S. Congress to modernize the pension laws in this country \nto allow them to do so.\n  Thanks in no small measures to yourself, Mr. President, and to \nSenator Hatch as well and the 97 Members of this body, the pension \nmodernization bill passed. We put in specific provisions for the \naviation industry, and great airlines and their employees now will be \nable to earn their pensions and not have them dispensed with because we \naddressed that crisis, and more importantly Delta Airlines' management \nhas worked to reduce its costs, and its employees have voluntarily \ntaken pay cuts. They have modernized their fleet. They have \nrepositioned their fleet. They have opened international marketplaces \nthat never before were available to people in this country. They have \npaid the heavy price that only in the great American free-enterprise \nsystem are you able to do where you take the problems and adversity and \nturn them into opportunities.\n  Now on the doorstep of exiting bankruptcy and filing that petition, a \nhostile takeover has been made to purchase that great airline.\n  Before I came to the Senate, I was in business. Nobody understands \nbuying and selling companies and opportunities better than I, and no \none would\n\n[[Page S11308]]\n\never diminish those who seek to take advantage of those opportunities \nwhich are there. But I rise for just a minute to make some points that \nI hope all of us in this Senate and the appropriate committees in this \nbody and the appropriate agencies of the United States are very careful \nto examine before any acquisition or merger of U.S. Airlines and Delta \nAirlines were to take place.\n  First, in our fragile aviation system it is critical to understand \nthat competition is still in the best interests of the American \nconsumer. If you overlay the routes of those two airlines, you will see \nmassive duplications, which ends up in many cases that where there are \ntwo competitors in an airport, it is reduced to only one. In the \nabsence of competition, prices rise and service is diminished.\n  Second, in the great hub-and-spoke airlines and the legacy carriers \nof this country, people in secondary markets have had access to the \nmajor airports such as O'Hare and Hartsfield and LAX in Los Angeles. \nBut as you merge two together, the first place they find savings is in \nreductions of those flights and those capacities from those secondary \nmarkets--the Augusta, Georgias; the Columbuses; the Meridian, \nMississippis; the Asheville, North Carolinas; and many other cities \nsuch as those around the country. It is very important for us to be \nsure, when we analyze the viability of such a proposal, that we not \ndiminish the opportunity for Americans in those cities to be able to \naccess aviation as they have in the past.\n\n  Equally important is the future of aviation in this country. A \nfurther consolidation of the airlines we have now would lead us to \nsingular service in many cities, an absence of competition, an \ninevitable increase in rates, and, unfortunately, less than the \nhealthiest aviation industry in the country.\n  As this proposal has now come forward, it is important for us in this \nbody to analyze from a competitive standpoint, from a competition \nstandpoint, from a consumer interest standpoint, from a marketplace \nstandpoint, from a secondary market standpoint, and from the heavy \nprices that have been paid by the American aviation industry to \nreposition itself post-9/11 to make sure we honor those that have paid \nthe price, are prepared to exit bankruptcy as a viable competitive \nairline, and not allow a quick, hostile takeover at the last minute and \nthreaten competition, secondary market service, lower flight costs, and \nthe great reward of America for paying the price to do the right thing, \nto exit bankruptcy and come back stronger than ever before.\n  I respect this great system. I respect greatly Delta Airlines and the \nprice its employees have paid. I respect greatly the management that \ncommitted itself even in bankruptcy to ensuring its employees come \nfirst, their pensions would be honored, and they did whatever to see to \nit that was a reality.\n  As one Member of this Senate, I will call on my colleagues to look \ndiligently at all of these questions as we move forward and make sure \nwe honor competition, that we honor the secondary market, that we honor \nthe employees of this great airline and do everything we can to \npreserve the modern competitive aviation system we have today and do \nnot succumb ourselves to the threat of massive consolidation and an \nabsence of competition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11308-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11308-S11310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Lance Corporal Ryan E.

He was always looking out for his family and \nfriends--especially his younger sister Tara.\n  Ryan's aunt Kathie Masters remembers how even when Ryan was just 4 \nyears old, he was always protecting Tara. One day, she had toddled \ntoward the end of the driveway. As she got close to the road, 4-year-\nold Ryan raced toward her to keep her from crossing into the street. As \nKathie recalls:\n\n       Tears were streaming down his face and he was screaming, \n     `No, Tara! No!' He ran to shield her from harm's way.\n\n  That story sums up the type of person Ryan Miller was throughout his \nentire life--selfless, caring, and always concerned first and foremost \nabout others.\n  Ryan graduated from DeSales High School in 2003, and enlisted in the \nMarines December of that same year. He told his parents that ``he \nthought he would come out of it a stronger, better person with lifelong \nfriendships.'' As Ryan told his father, Ed: ``There's nothing negative \nhere, Dad. This is all good.''\n  When Ryan was a child his father taught him how to shoot a pellet gun \nin the backyard. Even at an early age, Ed could see that Ryan was a \ngood marksman. Years later--after enlisting in the Marines--Ryan went \nto the School of Infantry at Camp Pendleton, CA, and graduated with the \nMilitary Occupational Specialty for rifleman.\n  Ryan's uncle Michael remembers that his nephew welcomed the challenge \nof the Marines. ``He wanted to be tested,'' he recalls. ``He wanted to \nserve as three past generations of the Miller family did so proudly. He \nwanted to be the best.''\n  Ryan was so proud of serving his Nation in the military, and his \nfather remembers that the Marines had made Ryan more confident, mature, \nand focused. Ryan was first deployed to Iraq in February 2004. After \nreturning that following September, he would give slide shows for \nanyone interested in what the experience had been like. And although \nRyan's second tour was more volatile than his first, he always \nmaintained his positive attitude--always told his parents not to worry. \n``I can handle anything they can throw at me,'' his father remembers \nRyan saying. ``I'll have a lot of good stories to tell you when I get \nback.''\n  Ryan was, indeed, an excellent Marine. He served with pride, honor, \nand dedication. Joseph Rivera, a fellow marine who had served with \nRyan, wrote the following message to Ryan's family on an Internet \ntribute Web site:\n\n       I'm very sorry for your loss. I knew Ryan shortly after he \n     got to the 3-2. I stood a lot of post with him. He was a good \n     Marine and an even better friend. He was one of the best guys \n     I've ever had the privilege of serving with. He will be \n     missed--but never forgotten.\n\n  Five days before his death, Ryan called his parents Ed and Mary. \nAfter 10 days of being in the field, he told them he was eager for a \nshower and a good meal. Assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine \nRegiment, 2nd Marine Division, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force out of \nCamp Lejeune, NC, Ryan anticipated heading out again soon.\n  For those who knew Ryan, it is easy to remember his sparkling blue \neyes, his ``trademark smile,'' and his love of athletics--especially \nbaseball, Ohio State football, and the Minnesota Vikings. People also \nremember his ``quiet work ethic'' and how his military service deepened \nhis maturity, focus, and confidence. They also will recall his strong \nCatholic faith and how he leaned on it during times of trouble.\n  At Ryan's funeral, his aunt Kathie remembered the dedication with \nwhich he served his country, and the way he inspired all he knew with \nhis courage. This is what Kathie said:\n\n       The one thing I can say about Ryan for sure [is that] Ryan \n     didn't sit out. For as long as he was able, he shielded us \n     from harm's way. He willingly put others before himself. He \n     died a hero--protecting us, our children, [and] our \n     grandchildren.\n\n  The Reverend Anthony P. Lonzo, speaking of Ryan's commitment to \nservice, said this about him:\n\n       [Ryan] was a man of God, a man of honor, a man of respect. \n     These are the values that made him the man he is and [the man \n     he] was when he joined the Marine Corps and made the ultimate \n     sacrifice of his life.\n\n  At a service held at a chapel in Iraq, SGT Jeff Weaver, who served \nwith Ryan, said the following:\n\n       Miller came with one of the greatest attitudes possessed by \n     any man. . . . [He] had a quiet demeanor, combined with a \n     powerful presence that was a source of inspiration for anyone \n     around him. . . . [Ryan]--you will not be forgotten and your \n     memory will be carried on by each and every one of us.\n\n  Ryan was a young man with a bright future before him. After returning \nfrom Iraq, he planned to go to college and\n\n[[Page S11309]]\n\nthen work in law enforcement. He was looking forward to playing in a \nsoftball league with his father and spending Christmas 2007 at home. He \nwas making plans to pay down his Nissan Altima--the car that was his \npride and joy. Ryan was simply the type of person who was always \nlooking forward to the future.\n  Ryan's death has been a loss to his entire community. There was a \nspecial prayer for his family at the DeSales High School chapel. School \nPrincipal Dan Garrick said that ``we're deeply, deeply saddened. \nThere's a very strong void in his community.''\n  Principal Garrick continued, his words summing up the sense of loss \nfelt by the entire Gahanna community. This is what he said:\n\n       We should all be so blessed at the end of our lives for \n     someone to use the word hero to describe us, and that's what \n     Ryan was. Sometimes our society uses that term too loosely. \n     Ryan truly lived the credo of the hero.\n       Ryan was a brave and courageous man who will always be \n     remembered for his strength and decency. He was a person of \n     both honor and respect--a devoted son, a protective older \n     brother, and a truly outstanding marine. As his father said, \n     ``I couldn't have asked for a better son.''\n\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep LCpl Ryan Miller's family in our \nthoughts and in our prayers.\n  Mr. President, I know the majority leader will be on the floor, and I \nwill tell my colleagues that I will give another tribute which should \nlast about 6 or 7 minutes, at which time the majority leader will be in \nthe Senate.\n\n\n                  PRIVATE FIRST CLASS HEATH D. WARNER\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow Ohioan who \ngave his life for the cause of freedom--Marine PFC Heath D. Warner from \nCanton. He was killed by a roadside bomb in Al Anbar province in Iraq \non November 22nd of this year. He was just six weeks shy of his 20th \nbirthday.\n  Heath Warner was a special young man, whose life was a model of \nselflessness and courage. And while it is right for us to honor him \ntoday and everyday and to grieve his loss, his childhood friend Brad \nMowery said it best:\n\n       [Heath] doesn't want people to feel sorry for him. He wants \n     people to realize he was doing what he wanted to do. He was \n     living his dream. How many people get to live their dream?\n\n  Serving in the military was indeed Heath's lifelong dream, and it was \nevident all along. When Heath was 12 years old, he visited Arlington \nNational Cemetery with his family. On those hallowed grounds, his \nfamily remembers him saluting a member of the honor guard at the Tomb \nof the Unknowns. Even at that young age, Heath understood the value and \nimportance of service and sacrifice.\n  His family pictures show countless other examples of Heath's interest \nin serving our Nation: There is a picture of him wearing the Army \nuniform of his grandfather, Randy Metzger, while another picture shows \nHeath standing at attention, while saluting at a fort in Virginia.\n  Even when he received his high school diploma, he walked straight as \nan arrow, like the splendid marine he would later become.\n  Heath's mother Melissa recalls that ``this is what he always wanted \nto do. It was his calling in life. I remember him over and over saying, \n`I'm gonna go fight for my country.'''\n  He did just that, and he did it with great honor and dedication.\n  Heath had many interests. He loved exotic foods, martial arts, and \nzombie movies. A passionate student, he taught himself German and \nJapanese and was taking Arabic during his tour in Iraq. And, like all \nteenagers, he loved hanging out with family and friends.\n  No matter what he was doing, his unique personality came through. As \nhis friend Brad explained:\n\n       He didn't care what anybody thought about him, he just did \n     what he wanted to do. He had his own way, his own style.\n\n  Part of Heath's personal style was his love for break dancing. All \nthroughout his time at McKinley High School, he performed at community \nand school events in the Canton area. But another essential element of \nHeath's character was to give freely of himself. So it is no surprise \nthat he took his passion for break dancing and turned it into a way to \nhelp others. In addition to performing, Heath taught break dancing to \nyounger kids at the Living Fountain Dance Company in Canton.\n  Kimberly Payne, an instructor at the dance company, remembers this \nabout Heath:\n\n       He decided to give a little bit of himself and his heart to \n     other kids. He really believed break dancing would keep kids \n     out of trouble. I'm crushed that such a positive kid has been \n     taken from this world.\n\n  Prompted by the terrorist attacks of September 11, Heath joined the \nMarines while still attending McKinley High. Upon graduation in 2005, \nHeath went through basic training and eventually became a member of the \n2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division, based in \nHawaii. He was trained as a gunner on a humvee--one of the most \ndangerous positions. It was exactly where Heath wanted to be--and that \nwas on the front lines.\n  Before his deployment in August, Heath's family decided to celebrate \nhis 20th birthday early. His father, Scott said that ``we knew he \nwouldn't be here [in Ohio at the time of his birthday in January]. So \nwe decided to have his 20th birthday [before he deployed to Iraq].''\n  After celebrating with friends and family, Heath deployed to Iraq. \nEarly on in his tour, he survived an IED explosion. Heath wrote in a \nletter home that he knew ``God was watching him.'' He spent his free \ntime in Iraq reading ``The Purpose Driven Life'' and studying the \nBible.\n  In his last letter home, Heath told his family that he loved them all \nand signed off with a word in Arabic, which meant goodbye. When the \nnews came in late November that Heath had given what Lincoln called \n``the last full measure of devotion,'' his family was, of course, \ndevastated. It would be a brokenhearted Thanksgiving for all who had \nthe privilege of knowing Heath Warner. Through tears, his mother \nremembered, ``Last year, [Heath] ate and ate until he got sick. He \nloved Thanksgiving and this time of year. He loved to smell the \nturkey.''\n  To honor Heath upon his death and in continued support of the troops, \nNortheast Ohioans flew their American flags. There has been an \noutpouring of support for Heath's family, with family, friends, and \neven strangers dropping by the Warner household to give them food, \nflowers, and cards. All wanted to remember and honor Heath, who had \nbrought so much happiness into this world.\n  In his short time on this earth, Heath Warner left a powerful legacy. \nHe was devoted to helping others--a trait best illustrated by the \ninstructions he left behind on the use of his death benefits. He asked \nhis parents to use them to pay for his two younger brothers Chandler \nand Ashton to go to college. This selfless act tells you all you need \nto know about the person Heath was.\n  Heath's dad summed it up this way:\n\n       I want people to know that Heath believed in what he was \n     doing. He believed in the fight he was involved in, and he \n     was willing to make the sacrifice. We honor that sacrifice. \n     He's our hero. We need men and women like Heath to serve our \n     country so that we can have the privileges we have. I am in \n     awe of my son.\n\n  Heath's life was a precious gift, and he made the most of it.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Heath's parents, Scott and \nMelissa, his brothers Chandler and Ashton, and all his family and \nfriends in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                  LANCE CORPORAL RYAN THOMAS MCCAUGHN\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to U.S. Marine \nCorps LCpl Ryan Thomas McCaughn, of Manchester, NH, a brave American \nwho has made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country.\n  Raised in a family that was familiar with the virtues of military \nservice, Ryan knew from an early age that it was his calling to be a \nU.S. marine. Graduating from Manchester's Central High School in 2005, \nRyan gave us a glimpse of the characteristics that would later make him \na remarkable marine. While others may have been deterred, Ryan rose to \nmeet the academic challenge by taking three English classes in one \nsemester during his senior year at Central in order to fulfill his \ndream of joining the Corps. This can-do attitude, as well as his sense \nof humor and creativity, will always be remembered by those who knew \nhim.\n  Like Ryan, another man who was in the service of his country and from\n\n[[Page S11310]]\n\nNew Hampshire, Daniel Webster said, ``God grants liberty only to those \nwho love it, and are always ready to guard and defend it.'' In this \nspirit, a week after graduating from Central, Ryan left for Marine \nCorps Recruit Training at Parris Island, SC. After completing his \ninitial training, Ryan went to the School of Infantry at Camp Lejeune, \nNC, where he graduated as mortarman. In February 2006, then Private \nFirst Class McCaughn joined 1st Battalion, 6th Marines at Camp Lejeune.\n  In March 2006, Ryan was promoted to Lance Corporal; 6 months later he \narrived in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Tragically, on \nNovember 7, 2006, this brave marine was killed during combat operations \nin Ar Ramadi, Iraq, when an improvised explosive device detonated while \nhe was conducting combat operations against enemy forces. Throughout \nhis short career, Ryan earned accolades which testify to the dedication \nand devotion he held for the Marine Corps, his fellow marines, and his \ncountry. Lance Corporal McCaughn's awards and decorations include the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Iraqi Campaign Medal, Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal, the Purple Heart Medal, and the Combat Action \nRibbon.\n  Patriots from the State of New Hampshire have served our Nation with \nhonor and distinction from Bunker Hill to Baghdad--and U.S. Marine \nCorps LCpl Ryan McCaughn served in that fine tradition. As he told his \nmother, he knowingly put himself in harm's way so that others did not \nhave to, and for this, we are eternally grateful. To his last day, \nLance Corporal McCaughn exemplified the motto of the U.S. Marine Corps, \n``Semper Fidelis--Always Loyal.''\n  My heartfelt sympathy, condolences and prayers go out to Ryan's \nparents, his brothers, and his family and friends who have suffered \nthis grievous hurt. The death of Ryan, only 19 years old, on a \nbattlefield far from New Hampshire is a true loss for our State, our \nNation and the world. Although he will be sorely missed by all, his \nfamily and friends may sense some comfort in knowing that because of \nhis devotion, sense of duty, and selfless dedication, the safety and \nliberty of each and every American is more secure. May God bless LCpl \nRyan Thomas McCaughn.\n\n\n                        Sergeant Jeremy Mulhair\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof U.S. Army SSG Jeremy Mulhair of Nebraska. Sergeant Mulhair died when \nan explosion hit his vehicle near Taji, Iraq.\n  Sergeant Mulhair grew up in the rural areas northwest of Omaha. He \nattended Omaha Central High School. Sergeant Mulhair enlisted with the \nArmy National Guard in 1995. He joined the Guard for both his deep \nsense of patriotism and a strong respect for his father Jerry, who \nserved in Vietnam.\n  Sergeant Mulhair turned his National Guard duty into a job in the \nregular Army. He had been in Iraq since October, serving with the \nApache Troop, 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment. This was his second \ntour of duty in Iraq. Sergeant Mulhair had served in South Korea as \nwell.\n  Sergeant Mulhair was a devoted family man. He and his wife Suzie had \nthree children: 9-year-old Celina, 8-year-old Jeremy, Jr., and 9-month-\nold Maybel. The family hoped to have another child when he returned \nfrom Iraq. Thousands of brave Americans like Sergeant Mulhair are \ncurrently serving in Iraq.\n  In addition to his wife and children, Sergeant Mulhair is survived by \nhis parents Jerry and Mildred of Kimballton, IA, brother Robert Mulhair \nof Mead, NE, and sisters Dixie Heisner and Tammy Lines of Omaha.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring SSG \nRobert Mulhair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11310-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CHAPLAIN BARRY BLACK\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as I depart this body, I would like to \nextend a heartfelt personal thank you to Chaplain Barry Black. From \ncomforting staff and Members in the wake of tragic deaths to leading \nerudite Bible study groups, to opening the Senate each morning with \nprayer, Chaplain Barry Black has shown himself the epitome of a great \nminister. He is a man of keen intellect, enormous oratorical skill, and \ngreat faith.\n  Personally, I have always been taken by his voice as he offers our \nopening prayers each morning we are in session. He has a voice that \nmakes everyone perk up, listen, and remain attentive.\n  I have seen Chaplain Black become a friend, an ally, and a helper to \nstaff and Members from all points on the political spectrum. He has \nkept his door open to people of all faiths and, as a Seventh Day \nAdventist minister himself, has helped many Christian Senators and \nstaff--including me--enter into a closer and more meaningful \nrelationship with Jesus Christ.\n  I am delighted that he will be continuing his service and I am \npleased that I could have the honor of appointing him. Barry Black, \nthank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11310-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11310-S11311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BILL PICKLE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, Since 2003, Bill Pickle has served this \nbody with enormous distinction. As the Senate's Sergeant at Arms, he \nhas helped us and he has protected us. Now, as he departs, I wish to \nthank him, recognize him, and honor him.\n  For over 3 years, he has excelled in one of the hardest jobs I know \nof, not just in the Senate, not just in our legislative branch, not \njust in our Federal Government but I honestly believe, in the entire \nNation.\n  When I came to the job as majority leader, I wanted to find the best \nprofessional possible in law enforcement, information technology, \nsecurity, and continuity planning to lead the Sergeant at Arms \noperation. I found him in Bill Pickle, and it was one of the smartest \ndecisions I made during my tenure as leader. Bill is the consummate \nprofessional. He is smart, with good instincts, and like my colleagues, \nI value his counsel and insight.\n  Originally, his office existed to keep order in the Senate Chamber \nand compel the attendance of Members for votes. In this body's early \ndays, the Sergeant at Arms would circulate through the drinking houses \nof what was then known as Washington City, rounding up recalcitrant \nMembers and dragging them--sometimes by the coattails--back to the \nSenate Chamber.\n  Perhaps today's members do a slightly better job showing up for \nvotes. To my knowledge, Bill Pickle has never had to bodily drag any of \nmy colleagues in for a vote, but that has not made his job easier.\n  Today's Sergeant at Arms is part security specialist, part corporate \nexecutive, and part management information systems administrator, and \nthat is just part of it. Every day, the Sergeant at Arms' office must \ndeal with the demands of 100 opinionated, demanding men and women, \nthousands of American citizens, officials from every part of our own \nGovernment, and people from around the world.\n  The duties that fall under his office range from running our \nrecording studio to serving on the board that oversees the U.S. Capitol \nPolice, but one thing unites them all their ability to connect this \nbody to the people of this Nation.\n  Through his leadership, his courage, and his vision, against immense \nchallenges, Bill Pickle has kept this building and this body open and \naccessible to the people we serve.\n  During the whole of Bill Pickle's time in office, our Nation has been \nat war against Islamic fascists, enemies who wish to strike at the \nprinciples of openness and democratic governance that this body \nrepresents. And he has kept us safe. Not a single serious assault has \noccurred on this body during his time in office. The Capitol is safer \nthan it has ever been. For that alone, we all owe him a debt of \ngratitude.\n  Every time his office has faced a challenge. Bill Pickle has risen to \nthe occasion. Time after time, he has tackled difficult tasks with \naplomb. He preside over a necessary expansion of the Capitol Police, \nappointed the Senate's first chief information officer, helped\n\n[[Page S11311]]\n\noversee expansion of our computer networks needed to deal with the \never-growing stream of e-mail sent to our offices, and, of course, the \ndemands to keep the Senate accessible amidst ever-changing security \nrequirements. In short, he has realized the goals he set out for \nhimself on his first day of work: Providing State-of-the art technology \nand world class security.\n  He has won the respect and admiration of people throughout the \nSenate, members of both parties.\n  Bill has taken continuity planning and security to a new level for us \nin the Senate, and I know his successor, our former police chief, Terry \nGainer, will follow Bill's lead on these critical issues.\n  As a person with a long and distinguished career in law enforcement, \nI trust that Mr. Pickle will not mind if I paraphrase the great \nAmerican police chief, August Vollmer. In his service to the Senate, I \nbelieve, Bill Pickle has shown ``the wisdom of Solomon, the courage of \nDavid, the leadership of Moses, the strategic thinking of Alexander the \nGreat, and the diplomacy of Lincoln.''\n  Bill Pickle: I thank you, the Senate thanks you, and the Nation \nthanks you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11311-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DOLLY PARTON\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a few days ago, an extraordinary \nTennessean, Dolly Parton, received one of the 2006 Kennedy Center \nHonors. As a singer, a songwriter, an actress, a television producer, \nand an entrepreneur, she has emerged as one of the preeminent cultural \nfigures of our era. Her life story, her talent, and her rise to success \ncan serve as an inspiration for all Americans.\n  Dolly Parton, in fact, could turn out to be the last prominent \nAmerican actually born in a log cabin. She was born at home on January \n19, 1946. Growing up, by her own description, ``dirt poor,'' in east \nTennessee's town of Sevierville, her family of 14 lived in a hand-built \nlog house. She discovered her gift for singing in church, gave public \nperformances before she turned 10, recorded her first tracks at age 12, \nand appeared at the Grand Ole Opry at 13. Well-known country artists \nrecorded her original compositions before she turned 20. Her own \nrecordings hit the country charts for the first time with the song \n``Dumb Blonde'' in 1966. Today, she has recorded more No. 1 Billboard \nhits than any other female artist ever and received 25 gold, platinum, \nand multiplatinum honors. She has been awarded a star on the Hollywood \nWalk of Fame, seven Grammy Awards, and two Oscar nominations. Her \nunique personal style and her sense of humor have influenced Americans \nacross the country.\n  Since 1986, her theme park, Dollywood, has generated thousands of \njobs and hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in the Great \nSmokey Mountains. As one of the most visited theme parks in the \ncountry, Dollywood now serves as an economic anchor for east Tennessee. \nToday, a statue of her sits Sevierville's town square. She has also \ngiven back: Her Imagination Library charitable program has shared her \nlove of reading with millions of children around the United States.\n  Dolly Parton stands as one of the most influential living \nTennesseans. We all owe her a debt of gratitude.\n  I must close in expressing my strong agreement with sentiments about \nher own musical genre: ``If you talk bad about country music, it's like \nsaying bad things about my momma. Them's fightin' words.''\n  Dolly Parton: I thank you. America thanks you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11311-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11311-S11312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GEORGE MANIAS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, tomorrow is an historic day in Peoria, IL. \nIt was exactly 60 years ago tomorrow--on December 6, 1946--that George \nManias opened his shoeshine business with one shoeshine chair in the \ncorner of a downtown barber shop.\n  George has been shining shoes in Peoria ever since--for working \nfolks, movie stars, famous athletes, and at least two presidents.\n  This evening, the Peoria City Council will honor George Manias with a \nspecial resolution in his honor. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof that resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Office of the Mayor--Proclamation\n\n 60th Anniversary, George's Shoeshine Parlor, ``World Headquarters'', \n                            Peoria, Illinois\n\n       Whereas, George Manias opened his shoeshine business in \n     1946, and he has been in the heart of Downtown for 60 years \n     and is recognized by the City of Peoria for his genuine \n     concern for people, his traditional work ethic, and his \n     ability to continue to operate a successful small business in \n     a changing environment; and\n       Whereas, George Manias has been locally and nationally \n     recognized for many years and has been featured in the U.S.A. \n     Today newspaper and on the Today Show on NBC; and\n       Whereas, George Manias has an open door to everyone from \n     all walks of life and has served the citizens of Peoria, as \n     well as local and national celebrities and elected officials, \n     including President Ronald Reagan and Senator Everett \n     Dirksen;\n       Now Therefore, I, Jim Ardis, Mayor of the City of Peoria, \n     Illinois, do hereby congratulate\n       George Manias in Peoria, Illinois, on the occasion of the \n     60th Anniversary of George's Shoeshine Parlor.\n       Dated this 5th day of December 2006 A.D.\n\n     Mayor\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The resolution notes that George's shoeshine parlor has \nbeen in the heart of downtown Peoria for 60 years. Some would say that \nGeorge's just flat is the heart of downtown Peoria.\n  Located across the street from the Peoria County Courthouse and \nkitty-corner from the world headquarters of the Caterpillar \nIncorporated, George's shoe shine parlor brings together people from \nall walks of life.\n  Among his customers are the judges, lawyers, police, politicians and \nother courthouse regulars; business leaders; celebrities; and other \nfolks who appreciate the importance of caring for leather and looking \nyour best.\n  They come in, sit down in one of George's nine shoe shine chairs with \ntheir shoes scuffed and dirty and five or six minutes later, they stand \nup with their shoes polished to a mirror finish, looking like new \nmoney. It's like the old 1950 song by Harry Stone and Jack Stapp, \nChattanooga Shoe Shine Boy:\n\n     He makes the oldest kinda' leather look like new\n     You feel as though you want to dance when he gets through.\n\n  And it only costs $3 a shine--the same price George has been charging \nfor over 15 years.\n  George Manias is a master of an almost lost art. He is a shoeshine \nprofessional. He wears a white dress shirt and a bow tie every day.\n  A lot of shoeshine men nowadays apply the polish with a cloth. Not \nGeorge. He's old school. He massages the polish into your shoes with \nhis bare hands. He explains: The polish gets into the leather better \nthat way. Then he buffs and shines and the next thing you know, your \nshoes look better than when you bought them.\n  Let me tell George's story. It is a great American story. George \nManias was born in Peoria 75 years ago, the son of proud Greek \nimmigrants, and he speaks with the accent of his parents' homeland. \nThat's because, when he was 3 or 4 years old, his parents took the \nfamily back to Crete, to see George's grandfather, who was very ill.\n  While the family was in Crete, the Nazis invaded and George's father \nwas taken prisoner.\n  In 1945, when the war ended, the Manias family was finally able to \nreturn to Peoria. They were practically penniless. Everyone had to work \nto support the family. George had to learn to speak English.\n  At 14, he started shining shoes at the old Paris Shoe Shine Parlor on \nMain Street, next to the Palace Theater. He charged 20 cents a shine.\n  Within a year, he had saved enough money to buy his own chair. He \nbecame an entrepreneur, working out of Ed and Roy Gibbs' Barber Shop.\n  In 1956, he opened his own 12-seat shoe shine parlor in the Old \nNiagara Building.\n  Over the years, George has had four different shops. The last three \nwere all torn down to make way for bigger, taller buildings. He moved \nto his current location almost 20 years ago.\n  Today, a professional shoeshine might seem like a minor indulgence. \nBut back when George started, a man\n\n[[Page S11312]]\n\ndidn't feel properly dressed without a hat and a shoe shine.\n  It was a time, as Arthur Miller's legendary Willie Loman said in \nDeath of a Salesman, when we were all salesmen, getting along with a \nshoe shine and a smile. For many men, the shine was a weekly ritual.\n  Back in the day, you could walk into George's and all nine chairs \nwould be occupied with customers--wingtips, next to oxfords, next to \nloafers--and George would be polishing all nine pair at once. It was \nlike an assembly line, but there was nothing automated about it.\n  At one point, he had four men working for him and he still worked 14- \nand 16-hour days, seven days a week.\n  He didn't take a vacation for 29 years, until 1975, when he went back \nto Greece for two weeks with his mother, brother and sister. After \nthat, he didn't take another vacation for 25 years.\n  He's been to Greece twice in the last three years to visit relatives. \nHe says he might take a vacation again someday--but only with family.\n  Work and family. Those are the things that matter to George Manias: \nHis sister Angie owns a small candy-and-nuts shop in Peoria, and his \nbrother Manny is a private detective who used to be the deputy sheriff \nin Peoria County.\n  In 1996, his widowed mother suffered a serious stroke that left her \nparalyzed. The siblings cared for her at home for the last 4 years of \nher life.\n  Customers come to George's for more than just the spit-polish shines. \nThey come to chat and to learn what's happening in town.\n  Mike McCuskey, a federal judge, has been a loyal customer for years. \nHe calls George's shoe shine parlor pure Americana and vintage Peoria.\n  You never know who you'll see there. One day, McCusky said, he looked \nover at the man in the chair next to him and blurted out, You're Gayle \nSayers, aren't you? That was when the Hall of Famer was still playing \nfor the Chicago Bears.\n  Over the years, George's Shoe Shine and Hattery--its official name--\nhas grown from a small business to a legend. It has been featured in \nlocal newspapers, radio and TV; in the Washington Times and the \nAssociated Press; on the Today Show; and on the front page of USA \nToday--twice.\n  The walls are covered with news clippings and photographs of famous \npeople who have dropped in for a shine: President Gerald Ford, during \nthe 1976 presidential campaign; President Ronald Reagan in 1982; \nEverett Dirksen, the Minority Leader of the U.S. Senate when LBJ was \nPresident; Former House Minority Leader Bob Michel; Congressman Ray \nLaHood; Former Illinois governors Bob Edgar and Richard Ogilvie; Peoria \nMayor Jim Ardis and a string of his predecessors; Barack Obama. Even my \nphotograph is there. Democrats and Republicans. In 2004, Congressman \nLaHood brought in then-CIA director George Tenet, a Greek-American, who \nwas in Peoria to give a speech. The two Georges chatted in Greek. There \nare photos of movie stars and singers. And judges--lots of judges.\n  But you don't have to be famous to feel welcome. George makes \neveryone in Peoria feel special. It doesn't matter if you're a well-\nknown politician or if the $3 you spend on that shoe shine is the only \n$3 you have, George makes you feel special.\n  Another reason people go to George's is because he listens to \neverything, and he knows everything that's going on in the local \nRepublican and Democratic parties, and in the Peoria business \ncommunity.\n  Says Judge McCuskey: It's like that Merrill Lynch commercial. When \nGeorge speaks, you want to listen. And sometimes when you speak, George \nlooks up at you with the slightest smile, and you never know if he's \nsmiling because he knows something you don't know--or because you've \njust given him another piece of a puzzle he didn't have. He's the \nkeeper of the secrets.\n  On Judge McCuskey's desk in the federal courthouse in Urbana sits a \nsmall scale of justice, a symbol that traces its origins to ancient \nGreece. It's a treasured gift that George Manias brought back from a \ntrip to Greece.\n  Across Peoria and far beyond, countless other people have been \nblessed with gifts from George, not the least of which is a perfect \nshine and the dignity of being treated with respect no matter who you \nare.\n  George Manias is a quintessential American in a quintessentially \nAmerican city, and I am proud to join the city of Peoria in honoring \nhim on his 60 years as a successful entrepreneur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11312-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11312-S11313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PREVENTING UNDERAGE DRINKING ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, just over 3 years ago, on September 30, \n2003, I held a hearing as chairman of the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Subcommittee on the problem of underage drinking. \nSenator Dodd, who later joined me in crafting a bill to help combat the \nproblem, joined me at that hearing. We were there to discuss this \nserious problem affecting the health and well-being of our Nation's \nyoung people--a problem that has been ignored for too long--a problem \nthat kills thousand of America's teenagers.\n  We all know that underage drinking is a significant issue for youth \nin this country. We have known that for a very long time. We have known \nthat underage drinking often contributes to the 4 leading causes of \ndeaths among 15 to 20-year-olds--that 69 percent of youths who died in \nalcohol-related traffic fatalities in the year 2000 involved young \ndrinking drivers--that in 1999, nearly 40 percent of people under age \n21 who were victims of drownings, burns, and falls tested positive for \nalcohol.\n  We have known that alcohol has been reported to be involved in 36 \npercent of homicides, 12 percent of male suicides, and 8 percent of \nfemale suicides involving people under 21. And we have known that \nunderage drinking accounts for 6.5 times more deaths among young people \nthan illicit drug use.\n  How did we get here? How did our Nation reach this point--a point \nwhere today, 12 percent of eighth graders--12 and 13-year-olds--binge \ndrink? These statistics are frightening. Too many American kids are \ndrinking regularly, and they are drinking in quantities that can be of \ngreat harm to them.\n  As a nation, we clearly haven't done enough to address this problem. \nWe haven't done enough to acknowledge how prevalent and widespread \nteenage drinking is in this country.\n  We haven't done enough to admit that it is a real problem with very \nreal and very devastating consequences. We haven't done enough to help \nteach America's children about the dangers of underage drinking. We \ntalk about drugs and the dangers of drug use, as we should, but the \nreality is that we, as a society, have become complacent about the \nproblem of underage drinking. This has to change. The culture has to \nchange.\n  In reaction to these problems, I worked with my friend and colleague \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Dodd, to write a bill that will provide some \nof the tools our communities need to combat underage drinking.\n  The Sober Truth on Preventing, STOP, Underage Drinking Act would be \nan important step toward reducing underage drinking on our college \ncampuses and in our schools and communities. This bill will provide \nauthorization for funding to encourage parental awareness of the \nproblem, such as the ongoing Ad Council campaign on underage drinking. \nIt will also provide authorization for grants on college campuses and \nin surrounding communities to change the culture of drinking that so \npermeates our institutions of higher education. It will also provide \ngrants to our communities to specifically target underage drinking \nreduction, as well as authorize additional research that is so \nimportant to helping us to further understand this problem and prevent \nthe negative consequences associated with it.\n  I want to thank Senator Dodd for his hard work on this bill. He has \nbeen a great champion for the prevention of underage drinking. He is a \ntireless fighter for America's children and youth. He cares about kids. \nHe cares about their well-being. I am privileged to have had the \nopportunity to work with him on many pieces of legislation to help \nprotect children and promote their health and welfare. I know that \ncombating teenage drinking has been and continues to be very important \nto him, and I thank him for his interest in this area. I also thank \nChairman Enzi and Ranking Member Kennedy for their help in passing this \nimportant legislation.\n\n[[Page S11313]]\n\n  Kids are beginning to drink earlier and earlier--at younger and \nyounger ages--and they are doing so in ways that could negatively \naffect their bodies, their minds, and their futures. I urge swift \npassage of this legislation and look forward to seeing the good work \nthat comes from it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11313-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF GENERAL JAMES L. JONES\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to GEN \nJames Logan Jones, USMC, who is concluding his extraordinary career in \nthe Marine Corps with his retirement as Commander, United States \nEuropean Command and as the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO.\n  For 5 decades, Jim Jones and his family have faithfully served our \nNation in peace and war. From 1965, when he led a platoon in the \njungles of Vietnam, to 1999, when he became the 32nd Commandant of the \nUnited States Marine Corps and subsequently led the Corps through 9/11 \nand the ensuing, turbulent years of the global war on terrorism, to the \npresent day as he ensures that NATO--the world's preeminent security \nalliance--is ready for the 21st century, Jim Jones is the embodiment of \nwhat a modern American military leader should be--warrior, statesman, \nvisionary.\n  My long association with General Jones began in 1972 when I was \nprivileged to take the oath of office as Secretary of the Navy at the \nhistoric Marine Barracks in our Nation's Capital. Years before, in the \nwinter of 1951 to 1952, I served in Korea, as a young Marine Corps \nground officer with the 1st Marine Air Wing. That modest service, \ncoupled with many years of reserve duty thereafter, prompted me to \nselect the Marine Barracks when I became the first Secretary in history \nto be sworn in on those grounds. Ten years later, I learned that one of \nthe Marine captains who commanded a company of marines that marched at \nthe ceremony that day was CPT Jim Jones. Years later, we were reunited \nwhen he was specially selected to come to the Senate to serve as a \nMarine Corps liaison officer. Our first trip, with Senator John Tower, \nthe chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee in the early 1980s, \nwas to go to Lebanon to inspect the tragic site where the U.S. Marine \nbarracks were blown up by suicidal terrorists.\n  Jim's service in the Corps is a lasting memory for me, and many other \nMembers, to name a few: Senators Hagel, Inouye, Levin, Lugar, McCain, \nRoberts, Stevens, Burns, and Thomas, because of his professionalism and \ndedication to the Senate's constitutional obligation ``to raise and \nsupport armies,'' and ``to provide and maintain a navy.''\n  As the years passed on, I have observed with great admiration as Jim \nJones applied his talents and abilities to the numerous opportunities \nand challenges he faced--from Vietnam to the halls of the Pentagon and \nSenate, to the deserts of the Middle East, to Eastern Europe and \nAfrica. Our Nation has produced such a courageous, skilled and dynamic \nofficer in Jim Jones.\n  Among his most challenging assignments was his last where he led the \nmost aggressive transformation efforts in NATO's history--including a \ncomprehensive headquarters realignment, developing NATO's global \nmilitary capabilities, creating the NATO Response Force, bringing new \nmembers into NATO's military structure, and embracing the concept and \npractice of out-of-area missions for NATO. Under his guidance, NATO now \nhas 30,000 troops deployed in locations across the globe and is leading \nthe International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.\n  Unlike his predecessors, Jim Jones would travel to any geographic \nlocation in his area of responsibility to personally brief traveling \nMembers of Congress--using charts galore.\n  As a steadfast, life-long supporter of NATO for its unparalleled \nsuccess in achieving peace through steadfast resolve, I was privileged \nto watch General Jones provide extraordinary leadership of NATO's \nmilitary forces as NATO expanded its membership and began to embrace of \nout-of-area missions. I share his view that: ``NATO has been, and needs \nto remain, a great Alliance: great Alliances do great things. It is \npossible, even probable, that NATO's most important days and most \nimportant missions lie ahead in the future.'' Thanks in no small \nmeasure to General Jones' contributions, I am confident that NATO is \nand will be always ready for those challenges.\n  For the years they have shared with him the burdens and joys of \narduous public service, it is also important that we publicly thank his \nwife Diane, and their children, James, Jennifer, Kevin, and Greg. They, \ntoo, have sacrificed much for their country. How proud they are, and we \nare, that their son Greg is an active duty captain in the Marine Corps \ntoday. In keeping with the finest traditions of the Marine Corps \nthroughout its 229-year history, General Jones and his family are \ngrateful for their opportunity to serve, and our Nation is equally \ngrateful for their contributions.\n  As GEN Jim Jones prepares to ``hang up'' his Marine Corps sword, our \nArmed Forces, the Congress, and our Nation owe him a huge debt of \ngratitude for his many years of commitment and service to this country.\n  General, sir, in the immortal words of the Navy-Marine Corps team, \nmay you have fair winds and following seas as you embark on your next \nendeavor. Semper Fidelis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11313-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IRAQ'S TOLL OF SLAIN JOURNALISTS CONTINUES TO RISE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Iraq is a dangerous and chaotic place for \nour brave American soldiers there, for our coalition partners, and for \nIraqi families who must struggle just to make it safely through each \nday. It is also a perilous place for the journalists who attempt to \ncover the situation on the ground. They are at the front of the front \nlines of this conflict, and the dispatches from Iraq produced by \nrepresentatives of a free and independent press are a vital conduit of \ninformation that helps the American people--and their representatives \nin government--to make more informed decisions. These are print \nreporters, television correspondents, photo journalists and the other \nprofessionals who help journalists in gathering and transmitting the \nnews.\n  We learned in recent days of the deaths of two more news \nprofessionals. Raad Jaafar Hamadi, a journalist with the daily Al \nSabah, was shot dead in his car in the east of Baghdad on November 22. \nFadhila Abdelkarim, an administrative staff worker of TV station \nNainawa, was shot outside her home in Mosul on November 26.\n  American media professionals have been among the casualties. They are \nas well known to us as NBC correspondent David Bloom, and those who we \nwill never know by their bylines or on our TV screens. Director General \nKoichiro Matsuura of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization--UNESCO--this week noted that the number of media \nprofessionals killed in Iraq continues to grow unabated, and that \n``since January more than 35 journalists have paid with their lives for \ntheir determination to fulfill their mission.''\n  According to Reporters without Borders--RSF--137 journalists and \nmedia assistants have been killed in Iraq since the start of the war in \n2003, while 51 have been kidnapped. According to RSF, four of the \nkidnap victims are still being held hostage.\n  Some in the administration have chosen over the years to disparage \nthe journalists serving in Iraq--for instance, labeling them ``lazy'' \nor unwilling to leave their bureaus or hotels.\n  The reality is far different. Day after day, journalists in Iraq \nface, and accept, incredible dangers just to do their jobs. As news \nprofessionals on one of the most challenging and important news beats \non the planet, they deserve great credit for their courage and their \ncommitment, and they deserve our appreciation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11313-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11313-S11314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   A PLAN FOR IDAHO'S ROADLESS AREAS\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, on November 29, 2006, Idaho Governor James \nRisch presented Idaho's petition for our Roadless Areas to the Roadless \nArea National Advisory Committee here in Washington, DC. I strongly \nsupport this collaborative and comprehensive petition.\n  The Idaho Roadless process was of a thorough and collaborative \nnature.\n\n[[Page S11314]]\n\nEvery effort was made to involve county commissioners, members of the \npublic, and a diverse array of participants. Idaho leaders and agency \nrepresentatives have done an excellent job of including everyone who \nwished to provide input.\n  In this case, we have had decades of uncertainty. This petition, as \nset forth by Governor Risch, has potential to resolve these disputed \nand difficult issues in a collaborative manner.\n  The petition is the result of thoughtful hard work intended to reach \nconsensus on a very tough issue. Such decisions seldom provide any one \ngroup or individual with everything they had hoped or negotiated to \nachieve. In this case, it appears to be a fair petition and sets a path \nforward that will encourage all parties, including those who are in \nsupport and in opposition, to resolve their differences and establish \nIdaho's future road management policy. This is a beginning, not an end.\n  I commend Governor Risch and his team for their efforts and render my \nsupport in behalf of their earnest and diligent effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11314-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ESTHER MARTINEZ NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGES PRESERVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, this week marks the opening of a film \nthat has already gotten a lot of attention, Warner Brothers' ``Blood \nDiamond.'' Many will flock to theaters to see this Hollywood \nblockbuster, but I hope these audiences will remember more than the \ncelebrities and action sequences.\n  So-called blood diamonds finance criminal activity that threatens the \nlives and environments of civilians, the stability of communities and \ncountries, and national, regional, and international security. Innocent \ncitizens, many of them children, are forced to mine the gems in \nhazardous conditions while rebel groups reap large profits, which are \nused to pay for weapons that breed brutal violence. In the past decade, \nthe sale of blood diamonds fuelled civil wars resulting in over 4 \nmillion deaths and the displacement of millions of people in Angola, \nSierra Leone, Liberia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and now in \nIvory Coast.\n  In 2003, Congress passed the Clean Diamond Trade Act, which sought to \nensure that the United States does not participate in the conflict \ndiamond trade by prohibiting the importation of diamonds from countries \nthat fail to implement a clearly articulated system of controls on \nrough diamonds. It was designed to implement the multinational \nKimberley Process scheme launched earlier that year by 70 governments \nand the global diamond industry, which requires governments to certify \nthat diamond shipments through their countries are conflict-free. The \nscheme's objectives are to: (1) stem the flow of rough diamonds used by \nrebels to finance armed conflict; and (2) protect the legitimate \ndiamond industry, upon which several African countries depend for their \neconomic and social development.\n  A 3-year review of Kimberley Process implementation held earlier this \nmonth in Botswana revealed that while important progress has been made, \nserious loopholes remain and must be closed to stop diamonds from \nfunding conflict in Africa and elsewhere. This meeting comes on the \nheels of a U.N. report which found that $23 million in conflict \ndiamonds from Ivory Coast are being sold around the world, and that \ndiamonds continue to cause instability and brutal human rights abuses \nin the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n  As the largest consumer of diamonds in the world and a strong \nadvocate for transparency and human rights, the U.S. should be setting \nan example by ensuring that its domestic certification system is \neffective and by working to strengthen the Kimberley Process. Just 2 \nmonths ago, however, the U.S. Government Accountability Office released \nan in-depth study that revealed blood diamonds may be entering the \nUnited States due to poor enforcement of the Clean Diamond Trade Act \nand a failure by the U.S. diamond industry to abide by its promise to \npolice itself in support of the Kimberley Process.\n  The 2003 Clean Diamond Act commissioned this GAO study to identify \nareas for improvement in domestic and international implementation of \nthe Kimberley Process scheme, so it is now Congress's responsibility to \nensure that the responsible government agencies and departments act \nupon the report's recommendations.\n  The GAO reports that the U.S. does not inspect rough diamond imports \nor exports and so must rely on importers to confirm the legality of \ntheir wares. Official statistics show an excess of diamond exports over \nimports of 300,000 carats last year that cannot be accounted for, \nsuggesting that some diamonds are entering the U.S. through informal \nchannels. Clearly, existing U.S. controls are not strong enough and are \ninsufficiently enforced. Similarly, the GAO study finds that \nimplementation of the Kimberley Process scheme in Africa is severely \nconstrained by the limited capacity and resources of these countries \nand the need to harmonize diamond trade and certification policies \namong these and other countries in the region.\n  Both to discourage the mining and sale of blood diamonds and to \npromote legitimate diamond trade, the United States must initiate \nregular, independent, and systematic monitoring of diamond imports and \nexports. The American diamond industry must also adopt and enforce a \ncredible system to make sure that companies are verifiably adhering to \nthe scheme and responsibly sourcing diamonds. In addition to conducting \noversight of these domestic activities, Congress needs to advocate and \nappropriate U.S. assistance for regional efforts to strengthen \nimplementation of the Kimberley Process in Africa.\n  The release of the film ``Blood Diamond'' coincides with the holiday \nshopping season, and it should remind us all that much work remains to \nput an end to the illicit diamond trade that continues to fuel \nviolence, finance criminals, and exploit innocent people and their \nenvironments. I remain committed to improving the Kimberley Process \nscheme at home and abroad and promoting active leadership by the U.S. \ngovernment and the American diamond industry towards ensuring that \ndiamond mining contributes to sustainable development in Africa, rather \nthan fueling conflict by financing criminal activity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11314-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11314-S11315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CONDITIONS IN DARFUR\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am grateful for the opportunity to join \nwith my colleagues on the vitally important topic of Darfur and the \nentire humanitarian crisis facing that part of the world.\n\n[[Page S11315]]\n\n  When we look at a current map of Africa, we are looking, for the most \npart, at national boundary lines that were formed by the arbitrary \ndictates of Western European nations during their primacy as colonial \npower brokers in the 19th century. Those lines were, essentially, \nsimple longitude or latitude lines that had no relevancy, at all, to \nthe social, cultural, or tribal structures that had existed on those \nlands for centuries. Suddenly, the simple, clean-cut decisions of 19th \ncentury Europeans have become, in the late 20th and early 21st \ncenturies, far more complex than any diplomats in London, Paris, \nBerlin, or even Washington, could have imagined in those relatively \ndistant times.\n  Darfur is serious. Clearly, it is not the only place on this planet \nwith unspeakable atrocities and unbelievable conditions. People who \nonce farmed wheat in western Afghanistan are now facing desperate \nconsequences due to the confluence of floods and drought. There are \ncountless people--women, children, and the infirm--in camps like Dadaab \nin eastern Kenya who are not only trying to cope with the political and \nmilitary chaos streaming out of Somalia but also the natural calamity \nof floods bringing food shortages, waterborne disease, and other human \nheartbreaks to our attention. We cannot ignore these other tragedies. \nDarfur is not the only place in need of assistance.\n  But there remains Darfur. It is etched in our conscious because of \nthe pictures we see on television, the stories we read in the paper, \nand more importantly, what we know to be true. The facts are before us.\n  The crisis in Darfur is an outgrowth of a decades-long struggle \nwithin Sudan extending back nearly to 1956 when Sudan gained \nindependence from Britain and Egypt, resulting in an estimated 2 \nmillion deaths due to war and famine in the last two decades alone. \nMillions more have been displaced. In February of 2003, the conflict \nspilled into Darfur with tragic consequences when local rebel militias \ndetermined to challenge the Khartoum Government on grounds related to \ndiscrimination of ethnic groups in the region. The central government's \nresponse was to unleash a harsh policy against the people of Darfur, \nincluding use of armed militias against civilians. The U.S. Congress \nand the Bush administration pronounced these actions in 2004 as \ngenocide.\n  In 2005, condition in Darfur only got worse. Attacks by the Khartoum \nGovernment-backed jingaweit against civilian populations continued \nunabated. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan announced that abduction of \nnational staff of humanitarian relief NGOs had reached alarming \nproportions. In June of 2005, the International Criminal Court formally \nbegan an investigation into charges of atrocities in Darfur. And in \nrecent months, reports indicate that atrocities in Darfur are peaking \nagain.\n  Slowly, the African Union began exercising limited authority in \nDarfur. Further attempts by the United Nations to introduce \npeacekeeping forces or a similar presence met with continuing \nresistance from the Khartoum Government. Just last week, the Peace and \nSecurity Council of the African Union adopted a proposal concerning a \nhybrid force for peacekeeping in Darfur. The African Union will extend \nits mission for another 6 months beginning January 1, 2007, in order to \nprovide additional time for clarification and implementation of how a \nhybrid force will be composed and deployed. Progress may be seen in \nthese actions, but it moves very slowly.\n  To date, since the Darfur crisis began in 2003, an estimated 450,000 \npeople have been killed and more than 2 million displaced. In addition, \nsome 220,000 Sudanese have been forced into refugee camps in \nneighboring Chad, and an additional number are in refugee camps in \nKenya. Even though the Bush administration has declared that acts of \ngenocide have occurred in Darfur, such declaration has not resulted in \nany major shift in U.S. policy. A shift should occur. We must intensify \npressure on the Khartoum Government regarding its policies toward \nDarfur, and we must firmly pursue the Addis protocols that were \nachieved last week.\n  As the current ranking member of the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies, \nand during the tenure I hope to continue in the next Congress, I know \nthat humanitarian food assistance is a very large piece of the solution \nto the crisis in Darfur. Under the jurisdiction of the Agriculture \nSubcommittee is an array of programs of importance to food insecurity--\nwhat in this country we once called hunger--such as Public Law 480 and \nreimbursements to the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust.\n  In fact, a little more than 1 month ago, my appropriations staff was \nsent on a mission to Sudan which would have brought them to within a \nfew kilometers of the border of South Darfur. Unfortunately, the El \nBashir government in Khartoum refused to issue them the appropriate \nvisas, but they were able to participate with the World Food Program on \nan air drop of food over Southern Sudan that, at least, gave them a \nfirsthand experience of the hardships in that country. They also met \nwith refugees from Darfur in the U.N. camp at Kakuma in northwestern \nKenya, where the original ``Lost Children'' of Sudan found shelter in \nthe early 1990s. While at Kakuma, my staff was presented with the \nfollowing written request by Darfur refugees:\n\n                                                 October 13, 2006.\n       The current situation in Darfur was not acceptable and \n     every day getting worse and we Darfurian we have worried and \n     we don't know how our future will be and what are you \n     planning for us.\n                                                 Mubarak Suleiman,\n                                                 Darfur Committee.\n\n  I have watched, and I will continue to watch with keen interest the \ndevelopments in this part of the world and take to heart the charge \nthat these things shall not occur ``on our watch.'' To the extent that \nI can continue to direct food aid programs in the coming Congress, this \npart of the world, and all the other parts in dire need, will have my \nfull attention, and I will seek the support of fellow Senators when the \ntime comes to make emergency assistance available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11315-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11315-S11316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING HELEN CHENOWETH-HAGE\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a former \ncongressional colleague and a personal friend, Representative Helen \nChenoweth-Hage.\n  Just weeks ago, our Nation lost a true American patriot in a tragic \ncar accident in central Nevada. On October 2, 2006, Helen Chenoweth was \nriding in her daughter-in-law's car, cradling her baby grandson in her \narms. The car was overturned, and she and her grandson were thrown from \nit. Helen held her grandson so tightly that he came away with minor \ninjuries--but she was not so lucky.\n  I take this time to honor Representative Chenoweth and her \ncontributions to Idaho and this Nation, as some may not be aware of how \nmuch she gave of herself.\n  Helen was born in Topeka, KS, on January 27, 1938. She graduated from \nWhitworth College in Spokane, WA, and started her lifelong career of \npublic service. She ran her own medical and management consulting firm, \nwhich led to her job as manager at the Northside Medical Center in \nOrofino, ID. In 1975, she was appointed as the first woman to serve as \nthe state executive director of the Idaho Republican Party. Soon after, \nshe became the chief of staff and then campaign manager for long-time \nfriend, First District Congressman Steve Symms. A close friend \ndescribed the Chenoweth-Symms team as a ``fun and inspiring team to \nwork with.''\n  After establishing herself in Idaho as a trusted leader, she won the \nRepublican nomination to Idaho's First Congressional District in 1994. \nA strong advocate for term limits, she pledged to serve no more than \nthree terms, if elected. Helen Chenoweth won the 1994 November \nelection, beating the Democratic incumbent by nearly 11 percent. She \nwas known as one of the ``true believers'' in the 1995 Republican \nfreshman class and was one of the most conservative. She even made \nconservative grammatical choices, insisting on being called \n``Congressman Chenoweth,'' instead of Congresswoman.\n  Helen easily won reelection two more times and was asked by many to \nrun for a fourth term, but having pledged to serve three terms, she was \ntrue to her word and retired in 2000. Idaho Govenor Jim Risch is quoted \nas saying, ``When the six years were up, she could have easily been \nreelected, she could\n\n[[Page S11316]]\n\nhave easily carried on, but she said `no, I made that promise and I'm \ngoing to stick with that promise.' ''\n  I was always impressed by her unwavering ideological positions, even \nif sometimes they were unpopular. I learned that she was driven by a \nclearly defined and articulated philosophy that allowed her to stand \nstrong in the middle of a storm of criticism and persist in forcing \nchanges for the betterment of Idaho and the Nation.\n  She was a strong advocate for the American people and a true believer \nin the balance of powers. During the Balkan crisis in the 1990s, she \nargued for the involvement of the legislative branch, writing, \n``Congress played no role in defining those political aims, which means \nthat the American people--in whose name Congress is empowered to act--\nwere not permitted to play any role in the decision to commit our \nNation to war.'' She was known for quoting the Founders when giving her \narguments, pulling her colleagues back to our Nation's constitutional \nroots if they were veering in another direction. On this same issue she \nquoted Alexander Hamilton writing, ``It is the province and duty of the \nExecutive to preserve to the Nation the blessings of peace. The \nLegislature alone can interrupt those blessings, by placing the Nation \nin a state of War.''\n  Helen Chenoweth was a champion for property rights and constitutional \ngovernment. She fought hard for the rights of property owners and \nagainst the heavy hand of Federal regulation and taxation that affected \nfamily farms, ranches, and businesses. In Idaho she was known as a \n``true environmentalist'' who worked to preserve Idaho's natural beauty \nwhile also balancing the rights and needs of humans. Her passion and \nhard work demonstrated her belief in the inalienable rights of all \ncitizens, and she fought to keep them protected by the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  On September 21, 2000, she was awarded the first ``Friend of American \nFreedom Award'' by the National Center For Public Policy Research and \nthe Committee For a Constructive Tomorrow. The award honored \nCongressman Chenoweth's ``distinguished record of defending the United \nStates against environmental treaties, United Nations programs and \nother global policies that pose a threat to the Nation's sovereignty.'' \nParticular appreciation was given for her work on the American Land \nSovereignty Protection Act, which would require the executive branch to \nseek Congressional approval before designating any U.S. landmark as a \nworld heritage site. The director of the National Center's \nEnvironmental Policy Task Force said of Helen, ``Congressman Chenoweth-\nHage has been one of the leading champions of U.S. sovereignty and the \nU.S. Constitution during her 6-year tenure in Congress. The `Friend of \nAmerican Freedom Award' represents our profound thanks to the \nCongressman for her valiant work defending constitutional liberties.''\n  While I served as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nSubcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management, she served as \nchairman of the House Subcommittee on Forests and Forest Health. I \nenjoyed this opportunity to work together on land management issues \nsuch as the Roadless Initiative. We shared a passion to protect our \ngreat western lands. Much of her work survives in the Healthy Forest \nRestoration Act.\n  Helen was a strong advocate for women and families. She supported \nfunding for women's health and also for family health care. Many women \nlooked up to her as a woman politician who earned every bit of respect \nshe received and held her ground in an environment predominately of \nmen. She was known as a true feminist who never asked for special \ntreatment because of her gender.\n  Even after her retirement from Congress she worked tirelessly with \nher husband, Nevada rancher Wayne Hage, in the lawsuit Hage vs. U.S. \nWayne had purchased his ranch in 1978 and testified that over the years \nFederal agency interference made it nearly impossible to run a \nlivestock operation and ultimately resulted in the taking of his ranch. \nWayne and Helen's court victory was a triumph for all private property \nowners.\n  Helen Chenoweth-Hage was not only a great politician; she was also a \nloving wife and mother and a loyal friend. Her strong Christian faith \ninspired many, guided her throughout her life, and served as a base on \nwhich she built her philosophy. Among her many endearing qualities were \nher unfailing graciousness, charm, and her warm smile. She will be \nsorely missed, not only by her children and other family members, but \nby legions of friends, colleagues, and admirers.\n  Let me end by quoting her daughter Meg Keenan, who spoke for many of \nus when she said: ``Helen was the most amazing, gracious person I ever \nhad the privilege to know. She was fearless in life, and I know she \nwelcomes the opportunity to be in the presence of God the Father.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11316-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    2005 COUNTRY REPORT ON HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES IN THE PHILIPPINES\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep distress \nabout the human rights violations reportedly committed in the \nPhilippines. The U.S. Department of State's 2005 Country Report on \nHuman Rights Practices in the Philippines, released in March 2006, is a \nvery troubling account and, at times, a cynical report on the current \nstate of Philippine human rights problems. The Report cites the \nPhilippine National Police as the worst abuser of human rights in the \ncountry, and it describes numerous violations, including extrajudicial \nkillings, disappearances, and physical abuse of suspects and detainees. \nIt cites instances of torture, arbitrary arrests, trafficking of \npersons, and harassment of human rights personnel and political \nactivists.\n  In light of the report's troubling findings, I respectfully urge my \ncolleagues to review this document and recognize the significance of \nthese extremely serious transgressions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11316-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11316-S11317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AUSTRALIAN WHEAT BOARD\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I would like to discuss today the gross \nmisconduct of the Australian Wheat Board in its dealings with Saddam \nHussein under the U.N. Oil for Food Program and to introduce \nlegislation regarding the potential impact AWB's actions may have had \nU.S. farmers.\n  Last week, a commission in Australia led by former Supreme Court \nJustice Terence Cole released a detailed report documenting extensive \ncorruption, fraud, and deceit on the part of the Australian Wheat \nBoard, commonly called AWB. The report showed that AWB paid more than \n$221 million in under-the-table kickbacks to the Hussein regime to \nsecure exclusive, illegal access to the Iraqi wheat market. I applaud \nSir Terence Cole and his commission for the thorough and comprehensive \nmanner in which they have dealt with this issue.\n  As chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I \nconducted an investigation for almost 3 years into abuses of the U.N. \nOil-for-Food Program. During my investigation, I held numerous hearings \nand issued several detailed reports that exposed significant graft \nassociated with the program.\n  In particular, my subcommittee exposed corruption involving public \nofficials from the United Kingdom, Russia, France and the United \nNations, along with corrupt transactions by companies in the United \nStates, United Kingdom, and elsewhere around the world.\n  However, when my subcommittee considered investigating the AWB, we \nfaced insurmountable legal challenges that prevented us from initiating \nthe kind of exhaustive review that this case required. Unlike other \nforeign entities that voluntarily cooperated with the subcommittee's \nefforts, AWB declined to cooperate with the subcommittee by providing \ndocuments or witnesses. Given that AWB is a foreign entity, the \nsubcommittee could not compel its cooperation through subpoenas.\n\n  Moreover, the U.N.'s investigators at the Independent Inquiry \nCommittee issued a report in October 2004, which suggested that it \nwould examine AWB's transactions along with the other deals executed \nunder the program. Unlike the subcommittee's efforts, that inquiry \nwould have complete access to U.N. files and unfettered access to \ndocuments from relevant Iraqi ministries and would likely have access \nto the files and banking records of AWB.\n\n[[Page S11317]]\n\n  Instead of launching a duplicative investigation with no ability to \ncompel the AWB to cooperate, I encouraged the Australian Government and \nthe AWB to cooperate with the IIC and the Cole inquiry whose findings \nhave just been released.\n  The Cole report has left me with a few lingering questions to which I \nplan to find some answers. My subcommittee is continuing its review of \nthe Cole report to determine whether U.S. affiliates of the AWB should \nbe held accountable here in the United States.\n  But the most important question to ask in the wake of the Cole \nreport's findings is whether American wheat farmers have suffered as a \nresult of the fraud and abuse on the part of the monopolistic AWB. I am \nintroducing legislation today to address that question, and if we find \nproof of harm, to make our farmers whole.\n  I would like to introduce today the Australian Wheat Board \nAccountability Act of 2006. The purpose of this legislation is just \nthat: to hold the Australian Wheat Board accountable for their illegal, \ndeceitful, trade-distorting actions. The bill directs the Office of \nU.S. Trade Representative to use its authority to investigate and \ncombat these practices.\n  This legislation is a simple bill with two distinct elements. First, \nthe bill directs USTR to investigate whether U.S. wheat farmers have \nsuffered economic damage due to the actions of the Australian Wheat \nBoard. Second, if we find harm, we seek compensation.\n\n  I have spoken many times on this floor about the great experiences I \nhave had meeting with farmers of my State. I just finished traveling to \nall 87 counties in Minnesota this year, and I will be the first to tell \nthis body that some of the most enriching visits I had took place with \nfarmers. Those who make a living by working the land, Mr. President. \nThose who produce the food and fiber of our Nation and have done so for \ngenerations. Those who contribute so much to the social fabric we hold \nso dear.\n  And they don't ask for much in return. They didn't ask me to come to \nthe floor today or to introduce this legislation. All they ask is that \nwhen it comes to trade, everyone ought to play by the same rules. They \nwant a level playing field because they know they can compete with \nanyone in a fair global market.\n  The fact is the Australian Wheat Board hasn't been playing by the \nrules. The Cole report has proven that the AWB unfairly monopolized \nwheat exports to Iraq under the Oil for Food Program. By paying Saddam \nand his henchmen millions in illegal kickbacks, they may have distorted \nthe wheat market to the detriment of the honest, hard-working farmers \nacross Minnesota and the United States while they reaped the benefits \nof a corrupt regime for their own ill-gotten gain.\n  I intend to find out if AWB's criminal actions hurt the bottom lines \nof our farmers, and that is what part one of this legislation does.\n  Part two of this legislation is about compensation. Under this bill, \nif it is found that our wheat farmers have suffered economic damage, \nUSTR will seek appropriate compensation to make our farmers whole. If \nwe cannot come to a negotiated settlement, we will impose duties on \ncertain Australian goods until we collect a sum equivalent to the \nfinancial loss brought on by the AWB. Either way, I want any \npossibility of financial loss looked at, and if proven, I want \ncompensation for our farmers.\n  Mr. President, I realize this is the final week of the 109th Congress \nand that this legislation probably doesn't make the priority list for \npassage this week. You can bet I will be back here again when we \nreconvene in January offering this bill in the 110th Congress. We owe \nit to our farmers to further investigate AWB's actions, and this \nlegislation will make that happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11317-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11317-S11318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PANDEMIC AND ALL-HAZARDS PREPAREDNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wanted to give my thanks to Senators \nBurr and Kennedy for working with me and my esteemed colleagues, \nSenators Cochran, Obama, Kohl, and Landrieu, to pass a bill that \ntogether makes a difference to the health and well-being of Americans \nin the event of a public health emergency--natural or man-made. We saw \nin Hurricane Katrina that local, State, and Federal governments were \nnot adequately prepared for a situation that could have been much \nworse. Also, much of the public was not prepared and could not get out \nof harm's way because of issues of capacity and trust. Regardless of \nour preparation then, it is clear that the government and the public \nmust become better prepared now. We must come up with a disaster \npreparedness and response system which does a better job of knowing \nwhat is happening not in government cubicles but on the ground, which \nis able to prioritize the allocation and delivery of finite resources, \nand which utilizes our cumulative man and woman-power to work together \nto get anything that needs to be done, done.\n  This is not a perfect bill, but S. 3678, the Pandemic and All-Hazards \nPreparedness Act, does improve the ability of the Federal Government to \ncoordinate response to emergencies and disasters. It centralizes \ncommand and control of Federal public health and medical emergency \nresponse and for the first time ever, lists the needs of at-risk \nindividuals in emergencies as a national preparedness goal.\n  Considering the needs of at-risk populations in public health \nemergencies and disasters is perhaps the most vital way to reduce \ncasualties when treatment options are limited, environmental exposures \nplace the public at risk and or when evacuation is necessary to get \npeople out of harm's way. In disasters, the burden of casualties almost \nalways fall on populations with unequal ability to protect themselves. \nThese populations are termed special-needs populations, at-risk \npopulations or at-risk individuals. They are populations who possess \nunique needs or limitations and may as a result not be able to receive, \ncomprehend, or respond to public health messaging during emergencies in \nthe way that bests support their safety and well-being. They are \npopulations that may not able to fully address their own preparedness \nfor, response to, and recovery from public health emergencies. At-risk \nindividuals include the elderly, children, pregnant women, the poor, \ndisabled, individuals with limited English proficiency, and others. \nForty million Americans are over 65 years old, a number that will reach \n71 million by 2030. There are over 70 million children under age 18. \nThere are approximately 7 million pregnant women. Fourteen percent of \nAmericans are limited in activity due to a chronic health condition.\n  I thank Senators Burr and Kennedy for having the vision to address \nat-risk individuals in S. 3678 but also the willingness to work with \nSenators Cochran, Obama, Kohl, and Landrieu and me to make the language \nconcerning at-risk individuals even stronger. The Lieberman-Cochran \namendment, which has been incorporated into the final S. 3678 managers' \npackage, publicly designates a person with a budget, who would ideally \nbe called the Director Office of At-Risk Individuals, to oversee the \nimplementation of the national preparedness goal concerning at-risk \nindividuals; assist Federal agencies responsible with planning for, \nresponding to, and recovering from public health emergencies in \naddressing the needs of at-risk individuals; provide guidance to State \nand local public health grant recipients as to how to incorporate the \nneeds of at-risk individuals in emergency preparedness and response \nstrategies; and develop and disseminate best principles and practices \nregarding outreach to and care of at-risk individuals in public health \nemergencies.\n  Senators Cochran, Obama, Kohl, and Landrieu and I believe that a new \ndirector of At-Risk Individuals will be a great resource to the \nAssistant Secretary in keeping the needs of at-risk individuals central \nas the Secretary works to implement the Nation's disaster preparedness \ngoals across the Federal agencies. In the past, the Nation has not done \nenough to break down the artificial silos between the agencies charged \nwith the health aspects of disaster planning and response, which is \nvital for the public in general but particularly to at-risk individuals \nin disasters. At-risk individuals are not monolithic, and their \nidentities change depending upon the type, location, and character of \ndisasters. Yet they are many, and their existence poses consistent \nchallenges which must be addressed. These groups include people\n\n[[Page S11318]]\n\nwith disabilities, the elderly, non-English speakers, children, the \npoor, and the homeless. We understand that there is often significant \noverlap between at-risk groups. Individuals who are homeless, for \nexample, are also poor and often disabled.\n  Senators Cochran, Obama, Kohl, and Landrieu and I also believe that a \nnew director of At-Risk Individuals will also be a great resource to \nStates, which will now have to incorporate the needs of at-risk \nindividuals into disaster plans as a condition of receiving Federal \ndisaster preparedness funding. The process by which the needs of at-\nrisk individuals are incorporated into State, let alone Federal \ndisaster plans is not obvious and will require both accumulation and \ndissemination of expertise. The committee envisions the Office of At-\nRisk Individuals as an ideal repository and resource for information in \nthis regard. This information can be gathered from entities already \ndoing excellent work in the field. Within HHS, this includes the \nAdministration on Aging, the Office on Disability, and Administration \non Developmental Disabilities. Within DHS, this includes the Office for \nCivil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Preparedness Directorate, and the \nInteragency Coordinating Council on Emergency Preparedness and \nIndividuals with Disabilities. Within the community, this includes \norganizations like C.A.R.D. in California and the Kellogg Foundation's \nRedefining Readiness Projects. Within Academia, this includes work done \nby the Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies in Maryland and the New \nYork Academy of Medicine. Nationally, this includes the National \nOrganization on Disability's Emergency Preparedness, Initiative, the \nCenter for Disability and Special Needs Preparedness, and the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics.\n  Finally, Senators Cochran, Obama, Kohl, and Landrieu and I believe \nthat a new Director of At-Risk Individuals can be an important source \nof funding and support for a community engagement process focused on \norganizing ordinary citizens to prepare and to respond to public health \nemergencies. The public is not a passive entity and must be viewed as a \nvaluable partner in disaster planning and response. Communities are \nbetter able, for example, to identify the location of their special \nneeds populations, to communicate with them, and to intervene in ways \nthat are consistent with the reality of people's lives. In addition, \nduring disasters, the governmental response is often delayed, and \npeople must be able to protect themselves why they wait for help. Last \nof all, community-derived public health emergency plans must be \ncoordinated with local, State and Federal disaster plans and the new \nOffice of At-Risk Individuals can fund opportunities to bring all key \nstakeholders together.\n  The AARP, the American Red Cross, United Cerebral Palsy, and the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics have all endorsed this important \namendment. These are groups that most would agree know much about at-\nrisk individuals, disaster preparedness and response.\n  In short, the process of addressing the needs of at-risk individuals \nduring public health emergencies is a necessary and immense task that \nmust be overseen. A new Director of At-Risk Individuals with a budget \nof up to $5 million as specified in S. 3678 will provide the focus, \nexpertise, personnel, and institutional memory to assure that the at-\nrisk language in S. 3678 is followed and that the Government, in \nplanning for and responding to emergencies, keeps the needs of all \nAmericans, front and center.\n  I thank Senators Burr and Kennedy again for writing and passing S. \n3678 and being open to the Lieberman-Cochran language.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11318-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MAJOR STEPHEN G. PURDY\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Major Stephen G. \nPurdy, Jr., of the U.S. Air Force for the outstanding contributions he \nrendered this year while serving as a legislative fellow on my staff. \nStephen will soon complete his Capitol Hill fellowship, and it is my \nhope that he has benefited as much from this experience as I have \nbenefited from having him on my staff.\n  In the course of Stephen's military career, he has served rotations \nin the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Matters and the \nOffice of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisitions, \nSpace and Nuclear Programs. While working at the Space and Missile \nSystems Center, Stephen was the Atlas V Program chief engineer. \nAdditionally, Stephen has served as the Joint Counterair Acquisition \nManager at the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for \nAcquisitions, Global Power Directorate. Finally, before joining my \noffice Stephen was posted to the Secretary of the Air Force Office of \nLegislative Liaison.\n  To my great benefit, Stephen joined my office in a year when the Air \nForce was searching for a new mission for Cannon Air Force base in New \nMexico. Cannon was originally targeted for closure on the Department of \nDefense's, DOD, Base Closure and Realignment, BRAC, list. However, the \nBRAC Commission ultimately found that the DOD ``substantially \ndeviated'' on several BRAC selection criteria and required that DOD \nshall seek a new mission for Cannon. Stephen's experience proved \ncritical in our successful efforts to secure a new mission for Cannon. \nI have no doubt that his tireless work and dedication were important to \nthe Air Force's decision to relocate the Air Force Special Operation \nCommand's 16th Special Operations Wing to Cannon, which has ensured \nthat Cannon will continue to play an important role in securing our \nNation.\n  I must also thank Stephen's family for enduring his many late nights \nat work. So to Wendy, Stephen's wife, and the Purdy children, Taylor \nand Holly, I say thank you. And without question, you can be extremely \nproud of Stephen's dedication to our country.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I give my heartfelt thanks to Stephen for his \nservice. His can-do attitude and tireless work ethic were infectious. \nHis willingness to tackle issues which were new to him and to embrace \nthe goals I've set for my staff on behalf of both the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces and the citizens of New Mexico were truly commendable. \nI have no doubt that as Stephen continues his military career he will \nachieve great things for both the U.S. Air Force and his country, and I \nwish him the very best of luck in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11318-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11318-S11319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATION 2006\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate briefly turned to \nH.R. 5384, the Agriculture Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2007. \nThis bill appropriates about $98 billion in spending, an amount that is \napproximately $4.9 billion over the administration's budget request, \nand $4.7 billion more than the House-passed bill. Although we were \nunable to complete work on H.R. 5384, I want to explain my objections \nto the passage of this bill in its current form.\n  I believe that some Federal involvement is necessary to assist low-\nincome families under the food stamp program, and that we should ensure \nthat our farmers stay out of the red, and to this end, many of the \nprograms under the Agriculture Department are worthwhile and I support \ntheir funding. I know that many of my colleagues have spoken before the \nSenate about the economic struggles of America's farmers. But as \nCongress looks ahead toward legislating a new farm bill in the near \nfuture, next year in fact, we once again conform to the practice of \ndiverting taxpayer dollars into an array of special interest pork \nprojects which have not been authorized or requested by the \nAdministration.\n  Let's take a look at some of the earmarks that are in this bill and \naccompanying report:\n  $3.5 million for fruit fly control in Texas, which was not in the \nadministration's budget request.\n  $400,000 for codling moth research in Kerneysville, WVA, which was \nnot in the administration's budget request.\n  $200,000 for research into the genetic enhancement of barley in \nAberdeen, ID, which was not in the administration's budget request.\n  $300,000 for grass research in Burns, OR which was not in the \nadministration's budget request.\n  $750,000 to the Denali Commission to improve solid waste disposal \nsites in Alaska, which was not in the administration's budget request.\n  $200,000 for the Utah State University's Space Dynamics Laboratory to\n\n[[Page S11319]]\n\nstudy gaseous emissions from agriculture operations, which was not in \nthe administration's budget request.\n  $100,000 to study crop pollination by bees, Logan, UT, which was not \nin the administration's budget request.\n  $600,000 for the U.S. Dairy Forage Research Center in Madison, WI, \nwhich was not in the administration's budget request.\n  $250,000 for shellfish and salmon research, Franklin, ME, which was \nnot in the administration's budget request.\n  $250,000 for the Great Lakes Aquaculture Center, Coshocton, OH, which \nwas not in the administration's budget request.\n  $158,000 for cranberry research, Massachusetts.\n  $1.4 million for potato research (State not listed).\n  $453,000 for seafood safety research, Massachusetts;\n  $4.1 million for shrimp aquiculture research in AZ, HI, MA, MS, SC, \nand TX.\n  $780,000 for milk safety research at Pennsylvania State University, \nPA, which was not in the administration's budget request.\n  $170,000 for blackbird management in the State of Kansas, which was \nnot in the administration's budget request.\n  It is worth noting what we are already doing to support our Nation's \nagriculture producers. Last year, Federal farm subsidies grew to more \nthan $23 billion despite near-record farm revenue which reached $76 \nbillion. While some of these farm programs make good fiscal sense, \nother have become alarmingly wasteful and counterproductive.\n  For example, The Washington Post recently exposed a USDA program, \nknown as ``direct and counter-cyclical payments,'' that in 2005 paid \nout $1.3 billion to farmers irrespective of high or low market prices \nor whether they grew any crops at all. This program was intended to be \na temporary subsidy that would prop up farmers during poor market \nconditions, but the special interests and the farm lobby convinced \nCongress to keep this unneeded program, which has become perhaps the \nmost abused farm subsidy in existence.\n  The Washington Post also discovered that in 2002 and 2003, $635 \nmillion in drought assistance went to ranchers and dairy farmers whose \nlivestock experienced mild or no drought at all. Thanks to strong \nlobbying by cattle growers, the Congress modified the payment \nrequirements under the Livestock Compensation Program for 2002-2003, so \nthat ranchers weren't required to prove they suffered any actual \nlosses. So long as a the disaster was declared, the Government simply \nmailed checks to ranchers dependent only on the number of cattle they \nowned.\n  In an offshoot of the USDA's drought relief efforts, the Federal \nGovernment paid $34 million to compensate catfish farmers for feed they \npurchased during the 2002 drought year, even though feed prices were at \na 10-year low. Much like the cattle program, catfish farmers were not \nrequired to prove they suffered any losses. All they had to do was tell \nthe USDA how much feed they bought that year.\n\n  Who is at fault for this egregious waste? The farmer? The Department \nof Agriculture? In reality, both are the victims of bad policy. \nUnfortunately, the biggest victim is the taxpayer, and the blame rests \nwith us, the Congress. Our current farm policy is riddled with waste. \nYet we compound matters by furthering the out-of-control earmarking of \npork.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the record \ncopies of The Washington Post articles I cited: Farm Program Pays $.13 \nBillion to People Who Don't Farm (July 2, 2006), No Drought Required \nFor Federal Drought Aid (July 18, 2006), and When Feed Was Cheap, \nCatfish Farmers Got Help Buying It (July 18, 2006).\n  It is difficult to overlook the $4.5 billion disaster assistance \npackage that appropriators have attached to this bill. None of this \nfunding under this agricultural title is included in the \nadministration's request, and in fact, was strongly opposed by the \nadministration when similar provision were added to the 2006 Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations bill. My colleagues may recall that the \nemergency supplemental faced a veto threat because of the billions of \ndollars in unrequested agriculture handouts appropriators were seeking. \nFortunately these agriculture subsidies were removed in conference, and \nthe bill was finally enacted enabling crucial funding to reach our \ntroops overseas.\n  Let's take a look at some of the provisions in this latest \nAgriculture disaster package:\n  $1 billion in crop disaster assistance to compensate farmers for \ndamage that occurred in 2005 due to weather. This also specifically \napplies to the Mormon cricket infestation in Nevada, and flooding in \nCalifornia, Hawaii and Vermont.\n  $13 million to help ewe lamb farmers who have suffered populations \nlosses.\n  $6 million to owners of flooded crop and grazing land in North \nDakota.\n  $6 million to assist a sugarcane transportation cooperative in \nHawaii.\n  $100 million for grants to each State to promote specialty crop \nproduction.\n  $1.7 billion in assistance to dairy farmers who suffered losses in \n2005.\n  This appropriations measure is not expected to receive any further \naction during this session of Congress. Instead of debating and passing \nour annual spending bills, our constitutional obligation, we are \nresorting to passing continuing resolutions to maintain our government \nfunctions well into fiscal year 2007. This failure is partially because \nof our habit of earmarking. When members frantically look for \nappropriation bills as vehicles for pet projects and unrequested \nearmarks, the appropriation process becomes a game of ``you vote for my \npork, I'll vote for yours.'' This is the sad state of our \nappropriations process, when we would rather postpone funding for \ncritical programs for our farmers, soldiers, veterans, seniors, and \nnearly everything until next year if it means our pork isn't included \nthis round.\n  Again I want to make it clear that I support doing all that we can \nfor the American farmer. Agriculture production is part of the backbone \nof our great country. However, we do more bad than good by raiding the \nnational treasury, and, in some cases other Agriculture programs, to \npay for pet projects that in many cases benefitl1l certain constituency \nwhich is not representative of the larger needs of the farming \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11319-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11319-S11320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF JOHN TREZISE\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Interior and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Subcommittee, I wish to speak for a few moments \nabout the coming retirement of one of the most dedicated public \nservants I have had the pleasure of knowing. Shortly after the first of \nthe year, John Trezise will be leaving the Department of the Interior \nafter 35 productive years..\n  Since 1998, John has served as the Director of the Interior \nDepartment's Office of Budget and for the 5 years before that as the \nChief of the Office's Division of Budget. In short, John has been \n``running the numbers'' at the Interior Department for the past 13 \nyears. And I can vouch for the fact that during those years, no one has \nknown more about the Department's budget than John. He is, to put it \nbluntly, a walking ledger.\n  John first got his start with the Department in 1971 when he hired on \nas a young attorney in the Office of the Solicitor. For a number of \nyears, he was Assistant Solicitor for administrative law and General \nLegal Services, specializing in appropriations law issues.\n  It is this legal background that has made John such an important \nasset to those of us on the Appropriations Committee. The guidance and \ncounsel John has been able to offer our Members and our staff has been \ninvaluable. It is no exaggeration to say that without his help, we \nwould have been, if not lost, at least temporarily delayed in getting \nour appropriations bill done each year on time and within our budget.\n  As he prepares to leave the Department, I wish to take this \nopportunity to say thank you to John Trezise for all he has done and to \nlet him know that he will be sorely missed by the members of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Interior \nappropriations subcommittee, I wish to join my colleague from Montana \nin extending our congratulations and our best wishes to John Trezise as \nhe prepares to leave Federal service.\n  Each spring, the Interior Subcommittee holds a budget hearing to\n\n[[Page S11320]]\n\nreview the Interior Department's budget request for the coming fiscal \nyear. The Interior Secretary is always seated, front and center, at the \nmain table in our hearing room ready to answer the myriad of questions \ncoming from our subcommittee's members. And despite the sometimes \nobscure nature of the questions asked, the Secretary has always been \nable to offer a timely, if not credible, answer. That ability to \nrespond is more often than not due to the fact that, seated immediately \nnext to the Secretary, has been John Trezise and the fattest looseleaf \nbinder any of us has ever seen. No matter what is asked, John has been \nable to reach into that book and almost instantly retrieve a figure or \nsome other pithy explanation that nearly always seems to satisfy the \ninquiring Senator. It is a magical exercise that must be seen to be \nbelieved.\n  Mr. President, too often the word ``bureaucrat'' is used as a \npejorative. But in the case of John Trezise, those of us on the \nInterior Subcommittee have come to learn that he exemplifies the best \nin civil service. And so I join Senator Burns in saying to Mr. Trezise \nthat he can be justly proud of his service to the American people and \nthat we wish him and his family all the best in the coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11320-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RETIREMENT OF MR.

On January 3, Anthony J. ``Tony'' Zagami will leave \nthe U.S. Government Printing Office, having been the longest serving \ngeneral counsel in the agencies history.\n  Tony Zagami began his career as a page in the U.S. Senate in the mid \n1960s as I was completing my first term as a U.S. Senator from Hawaii. \nHis late father, Dino, also served the U.S. Senate at that time as a \nmember of the Official Reporters of Debates. I had the pleasure of \nknowing and working with both of the Zagami's during that period of \ntime. Dino retired in 1972 as Tony's congressional career was just \ngetting underway.\n  Tony held a number of positions on the Hill while pursuing an \nundergraduate and law degree. He spent a total of 25 years working for \nthe Congress in positions ranging from Senate page to committee general \ncounsel, before leaving in 1990 to become the general counsel for the \nGovernment Printing Office. As you know, the GPO is responsible for \nproducing and distributing our Congressional Record and other vital \nGovernment documents on a daily basis.\n  After 40 years of dedicated Government service, Tony Zagami has \ndecided to move on to the next chapter of his life. As he ends a \ndistinguished career, I would like to take this opportunity to thank \nTony Zagami for his many years of public service to our Nation and wish \nhim and his family the very best in all future endeavors.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, at the end of this year, Anthony ``Tony'' \nZagami will retire after 40 years of public service, including the last \n16 years at the Government Printing Office, which publishes the \nCongressional Record for all of us every day.\n  I first met Tony when I served in my first term in the Senate. He was \nworking as a legislative assistant in the Democratic cloakroom. He \nspent 25 years working in the Congress, including general counsel to \nthe Joint Committee on Printing.\n  In 1990, Tony left to become the general counsel at the Government \nPrinting Office. When he retires it will be with the distinction of \nhaving been the agency's longest-serving general counsel.\n  As he moves on, I know all my colleagues join me in thanking him for \nhis dedicated service, and wish him the best for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11320-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n                       TRIBUTE TO PAIGE McPHERSON\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, today I honor Shirley Hills Primary \nSchool, in Mound, Minnesota, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  Shirley Hills Primary School is truly a model of educational success. \nThe teaching staff believes wholeheartedly that all children can \nsucceed, a philosophy that has led to performance rates that are among \nthe best in the State. The learning environment values strong character \nin addition to academic achievement. In addition, the vibrant school \ncommunity offers a preschool program, to help ensure a smooth \ntransition to kindergarten.\n  Shirley Hills Primary School is particularly proud of its designation \nas a Minnesota five-star school, recognized for excellence by the \nMinnesota Department of Education. The school recently received the \nParent Involvement School of Excellence Award from the National PTA, \nrecognizing its strong partnership with parents. The Westonka School \nDistrict which includes Shirley Hills Primary School has also earned \nthe What Parents Want Award, given by SchoolMatch, the Nation's largest \nschool-selection consulting firm. The award was earned by fewer than 15 \npercent of the Nation's public school districts. The Westonka District \nwas also 1 of 22 Minnesota school districts named academic \noutperformers by Standard & Poor's School Evaluation Services.\n  Shirley Hills Primary fosters the development of strong character by \nrecognizing children for demonstrating responsibility, respect, and \nhonesty. An all-school assembly every month includes the presentation \nof a trophy, given successively in due course to a child who has \ndemonstrated one of these qualities. Shirley Hills pupils know that \ngood character is lived out, in all areas of life; it is how they \nchoose to live, not just how they behave in school.\n  In the belief that children can succeed better in the global economy \nwhen knowledgeable about other languages and cultures, Shirley Hills \noffers before- and after-school Spanish classes for kindergarten \nthrough fourth grade. The school district is also pursuing a secondary-\nlevel educational exchange program with China.\n  Shirley Hills' staff encourages families to expect great test scores \nbut not to settle for that alone. The school proudly has high \nexpectations for achievement and behavior, and just as proudly provides \neducational experiences that take into account the whole child. \nTeachers know each child's strengths and growth areas, and they work \ntogether with parents to help every child grow as a learner, as well as \na valued human being.\n  Much of the credit for Shirley Hills Primary School's success belongs \nto its principal, Ann Swanson, and the dedicated teachers. The pupils \nand staff at Shirley Hills Primary School understand that, in order to \nbe successful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success; it \nmust also provide a nurturing environment where pupils can develop the \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout life. All of \nthe faculty, staff, and children at Shirley Hills Primary School should \nbe very proud of their accomplishments!\n  I congratulate Shirley Hills Primary School in Mound for winning the \nAward for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional contributions \nto education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11320-4", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11320-S11321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          LAKE MARION ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, LAKEVILLE, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Lake Marion \nElementary School, in Lakeville, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence\n\n[[Page S11321]]\n\nin Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements in \neducating children.\n  Lake Marion Elementary School is truly a model of educational \nsuccess. Three factors that make the school particularly outstanding \ninclude: a high level of involvement by parents, innovative programs, \nand academic achievement.\n  Lake Marion Elementary School takes great pride in involving parents \nin their children's school experiences. Lake Marion's Parent Teacher \nOrganization has provided volunteer and financial support for the \nArtist of the Month program, for which parent volunteers teach a class \nabout an artist and his/her works; the Junior Great Books program; the \nLake Marion Yearbook, which has set the standard for elementary school \nyearbooks; the fifth-grade trip to Camp Saint Croix Environment Camp; \nthe school directory; Family Fun Night; cultural awareness programming; \nmini-grants for selected staff projects; and field trip transportation \ncosts.\n  Lake Marion Elementary provides the children innovative programming \noutside the school day. Targeted Services offers additional reading and \nmath support in classes which run before school and are very popular \nwith the children and their families. Additional programs include \nbefore- and after-school athletics, art, and world languages.\n  The school's many successes are reflected in the pupils' outstanding \nacademic accomplishments. Lake Marion Elementary School's Math Masters \nTeams have finished first two times, second four times, and third five \ntimes in Regional Math Masters competitions. In addition, Lake Marion \nElementary has received a five-star rating from the Minnesota \nDepartment of Education in reading and math every year since the \ninception of the Minnesota School Report Card system.\n  Much of the credit for Lake Marion Elementary School's success \nbelongs to its principal, John W.

Mr. President, today I honor Orchard Lake \nElementary School, in Lakeville, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  Orchard Lake Elementary School is truly a model of educational \nsuccess. The staff at OLE, always seeking to improve professionally, \nvalue in-service days and use this time to study new and innovative \nteaching techniques. Every year the school does a book study that \naddresses ways to increase achievement for students. The teaching staff \ntakes on new challenges, studies best-practice ideas, has conversations \nacross grade levels, offers mutual support, and applies solutions.\n  In the spring of 2004, Orchard Lake Elementary was the first school \nin Minnesota to receive the Tekne Award for Innovations in Teaching. \nMark Deming, the media specialist, had pupils in grades 5 and 6 arrive \nbefore school and called them the ``Morning Crew.'' The children \nlearned to design segments of school news, interview classmates and \nstaff, and videotape and edit productions so that they could produce \nthe morning announcements. In addition, they created their own music \nusing the Garage Band program on the school computers. The morning \nannouncements were shown over the school's media system and produced \nexclusively by children for all classrooms to enjoy. This system is \nstill in place for use by fourth- and fifth-graders.\n  Orchard Lake Elementary teachers work with parents as partners in \neducation. Five years ago, when space became a concern, the PTO \npurchased a portable computer lab. Last year, the PTO purchased 14 new \ncomputers and has entered Phase 2 of purchasing all new computers for \nthe lab classroom. The PTO recently held a fund-raiser to purchase new \nplayground equipment. OLE had a 99 percent parent-participation rate at \nparent-teacher conferences. The school has a gifted education program, \nas well as a targeted services program, which offers extra instruction \nin reading and math for struggling students. Involved parents support \ntheir children by working together with teachers, who value the \nparents' active contributions.\n  Orchard Lake Elementary provides a safe and nurturing environment, \nboth educationally and emotionally. Teachers build relationships with \npupils through a community circle and discussions of life skills. The \nchildren take part in student council, art shows, music concerts, \nmorning announcements, band, and academic choice in the classroom.\n  Orchard Lake Elementary School was recognized by the State Department \nof Education as a five-star school in both math and reading. This \ndistinction is particularly impressive, considering that Orchard Lake, \nwhich has a high concentration of low-income students, is a Title 1 \nschool.\n  Much of the credit for Orchard Lake Elementary School's success \nbelongs to its principal, Karen Roos, and the dedicated teachers. The \npupils and staff at Orchard Lake Elementary School understand that, in \norder to be successful, a school must go beyond achieving academic \nsuccess; it must also provide a nurturing environment where pupils can \ndevelop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout \nlife. All of the faculty, staff, and children at Orchard Lake \nElementary School should be very proud of their accomplishments!\n  I congratulate Orchard Lake Elementary School in Lakeville for \nwinning the Award for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional \ncontributions to education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11321-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11321-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and two withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11321-4", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11321-S11322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R.395.

A bill to authorize the implementation of the San Joaquin \nRiver Restoration Settlement; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce--with my \ncosponsor Senator Boxer--a historic bill that will end 18 years of \nlitigation between the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Friant \nWater Authority, and the U.S. Department of the Interior. The \nlegislation will enact a settlement that accomplishes the restoration \nof California's second longest river, the San Joaquin, while \nmaintaining a stable water supply for the farmers who have made the \nValley bloom and have supplied low-cost agricultural products to \nAmericans from coast to coast.\n  The alternative to a consensus resolution to this long-running \nwestern water battle basis is to continue the fight. To my knowledge, \nevery farmer and every environmentalist who has considered the \npossibility of continued litigation believes that an outcome imposed by \na judge is likely to be worse for everyone on all counts: more costly, \nriskier for the farmers, and less beneficial for the environment.\n  Because the settlement provides a framework that all interests can \naccept, this legislation has the strong support of the Bush \nadministration, the Schwarzenegger administration, the environmental \nand fishing communities and numerous California farmers and water \ndistricts, including all 22 Friant water districts that have been part \nof the litigation.\n  In announcing the signing of this San Joaquin River settlement in \nSeptember, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior praised it as a \n``monumental agreement.'' And when the Federal court then approved the \nsettlement in late October, Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne \nfurther praised settlement for launching ``one of the largest \nenvironmental restoration projects in California's history.'' The \nSecretary further observed that ``This Settlement closes a long chapter \nof conflict and uncertainty in California's San Joaquin Valley . . . \nand open[s] a new chapter of environmental restoration and water supply \ncertainty for the farmers and their communities.''\n  I share the Secretary's strong support for this balanced and historic \nagreement, and it is my honor to join with Senator Boxer and a \nbipartisan group of California House Members in introducing legislation \nto approve and authorize this settlement before we end the 109th \nCongress.\n  The legislation indicates how the settlement agreement forged by the \nparties is going to be implemented. It involves the Departments of the \nInterior and Commerce, and essentially gives the Secretary of the \nInterior the additional authority to:\n\n     take the actions to restore the San Joaquin River;\n     reintroduce the California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook \n     Salmon;\n     minimize water supply impacts on Friant water districts; and\n     avoid reductions in water supply for third-party water \n     contractors.\n\n  One of the major benefits of this settlement is the restoration of a \nlong-lost salmon fishery. The return of one of California's most \nimportant salmon runs will create significant benefits for local \ncommunities in the San Joaquin Valley, helping to restore a beleaguered \nfishing industry while improving recreation and quality of life.\n  The legislation provides for improvements to the San Joaquin River \nchannel to allow salmon restoration to begin in 2014. Beginning in that \nyear, the river would see an annual flow regime mandated by the \nsettlement, with pulses of additional water in the spring and greater \nflows available in wetter years. There is flexibility to add or \nsubtract up to 10 percent from the annual flows, as the best science \ndictates.\n  A visitor to the revitalized river channel in a decade will find an \nentirely different place providing recreation and relaxation for \nresidents of small towns like Mendota, and a refuge for residents of \nlarger cities like Fresno.\n  The legislation I am introducing today includes provisions to benefit \nthe farmers of the San Joaquin Valley as well as the salmon: In wet \nyears, Friant contractors can purchase surplus flows at $10 per acre-\nfoot for use in dry years, far less than the approximately $35 per \nacre-foot that they would otherwise pay for this water. The Secretary \nof the Interior is authorized to recirculate new restoration flows from \nthe Delta via the California aqueduct and the Cross-Valley Canal to \nprovide additional supply for Friant.\n  Today's legislation also includes substantial protections for other \nwater districts in California that were not party to the original \nsettlement negotiations. These other water contractors will be able to \navoid all but the smallest water impacts as a result of the settlement, \nexcept on a voluntary basis.\n  In addition, the restoration of flows for over 150 miles below Friant \nDam, and reconnecting the upper river to the critical San Joaquin-\nSacramento Delta, will be a welcome change for the more than 22 million \nCalifornians who rely on that crucial source for their drinking water.\n  Finally, restoring the San Joaquin as a living salmon river may \nultimately help struggling fishing communities on California's north \ncoast--and even into southern Oregon. The restoration of the San \nJoaquin and the government's commitment to reintroduce and rebuild \nhistoric salmon populations provide a rare bright spot for these \ncommunities.\n  In addition to congratulating the parties for making a settlement \nthat will enable the long-sought restoration of the San Joaquin River, \nI am mindful of and remain committed to progress in implementing and \nfunding the December 19, 2000, Trinity River restoration\n\n[[Page S11327]]\n\nrecord of decision and the Hoopa Valley Tribe's comanagement of the \ndecision's important goal of restoring the fishery resources that the \nUnited States holds in trust for the tribe.\n  Support of this agreement is almost as far reaching as its benefits. \nThis historic agreement would not have been possible without the \nparticipation of a remarkably broad group of agencies, stakeholders and \nlegislators, reaching far beyond the settling parties. The Department \nof the Interior, the State of California, the Friant Water Users \nAuthority, the Natural Resources Defense Council on behalf of 13 other \nenvironmental organizations and countless other stakeholders came \ntogether and spent countless hours with legislators in Washington to \nensure that we found a solution that the large majority of those \naffected could support.\n  Last month, California voters showed their support by approving \nPropositions 84 and 1E that will help pay for the settlement by \ncommitting at least $100 million and likely $200 million or more toward \nthe restoration costs. Indeed, this legislation includes a diverse mix \nof approximately $200 million in direct Water User payments, new State \npayments, $240 million in dedicated Friant Central Valley Project \ncapital repayments, and future Federal appropriations limited to $250 \nmillion. This mix of funding sources is intended to ensure that the \nriver restoration program will be sustainable over time and truly a \njoint effort of Federal, State and local agencies.\n  I would like to emphasize that the Federal funding in the bill is for \nimplementation of both the restoration goal to reestablish a salmon \nfishery in the river, and the water management goal to avoid or \nminimize water supply losses supplied by Friant Water Districts. It is \nimportant to recognize that these efforts are of equal importance.\n  At the end of the day, I believe that this agreement is something \nthat we can all feel very proud of, and I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to move quickly to approve this legislation and provide the \nadministration the authorization it needs to fully carry out its legal \nobligations and the extensive restoration opportunities under the \nsettlement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 4084\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (iii) measures that shall be implemented to mitigate \n     impacts.\n       (B) Deadline.--The study under subparagraph (A) shall be \n     completed prior to restoration of any flows other than \n     Interim Flows.\n       (2) Report.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary shall file a report with \n     Congress not later than 90 days after issuing a \n     determination, as required by the Settlement, on whether to \n     expand channel conveyance capacity to 4500 cubic feet per \n     second in Reach 4B of the San Joaquin River, or use an \n     alternative route for pulse flows, that--\n       (i) explains whether the Secretary has decided to expand \n     Reach 4B capacity to 4500 cubic feet per second; and\n       (ii) addresses the following matters:\n\n       (I) The basis for the Secretary's determination, whether \n     set out in environmental review documents or otherwise, as to \n     whether the expansion of Reach 4B would be the preferable \n     means to achieve the Restoration Goal as provided in the \n     Settlement, including how different factors were assessed \n     such as comparative biological and habitat benefits, \n     comparative costs, relative availability of State cost-\n     sharing funds, and the comparative benefits and impacts on \n     water temperature, water supply, private property, and local \n     and downstream flood control.\n       (II) The Secretary's final cost estimate for expanding \n     Reach 4B capacity to 4500 cubic feet per second, or any \n     alternative route selected, as well as the alternative cost \n     estimates provided by the State, by the Restoration \n     Administrator, and by the other parties to the Settlement.\n       (III) The Secretary's plan for funding the costs of \n     expanding Reach 4B or any alternative route selected, whether \n     by existing Federal funds provided under this Act, by non-\n     Federal funds, by future Federal appropriations, or some \n     combination of such sources.\n\n       (B) Determination required.--The Secretary shall, to the \n     extent feasible, make the determination in subparagraph (A) \n     prior to undertaking any substantial construction work to \n     increase capacity in Reach 4B.\n       (3) Costs.--If the Secretary's estimated Federal cost for \n     expanding Reach 4B in paragraph (2), in light of the \n     Secretary's funding plan set out in paragraph (2), would \n     exceed the remaining Federal funding authorized by this Act \n     (including all funds reallocated, all funds dedicated, and \n     all new funds authorized by this Act and separate from all \n     commitments of State and other non-Federal funds and in-kind \n     commitments), then before the Secretary commences actual \n     construction work in Reach 4B (other than planning, design, \n     feasibility, or other preliminary measures) to expand \n     capacity to 4500 cubic feet per second to implement this \n     Settlement, Congress must have increased the applicable \n     authorization ceiling provided by this Act in an amount at \n     least sufficient to cover the higher estimated Federal costs.\n\n     SEC. 10. CALIFORNIA CENTRAL VALLEY SPRING RUN CHINOOK SALMON.\n\n       (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the implementation of the \n     Settlement to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation \n     regarding restoration of the San Joaquin River and the \n     reintroduction of the California Central Valley Spring Run \n     Chinook salmon is a unique and unprecedented circumstance \n     that requires clear expressions of Congressional intent \n     regarding how the provisions of the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) are utilized to achieve the \n     goals of restoration of the San Joaquin River and the \n     successful reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring \n     Run Chinook salmon.\n       (b) Reintroduction in the San Joaquin River.--California \n     Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon shall be \n     reintroduced in the San Joaquin River below Friant Dam \n     pursuant to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 (16 U.S.C. 1539(j)) and the Settlement, provided that \n     the Secretary of Commerce finds that a permit for the \n     reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring Run \n     Chinook salmon may be issued pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A) \n     of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1539(a)(1)(A)).\n       (c) Final Rule.--\n       (1) Definition of third party.--For the purpose of this \n     subsection, the term ``third party'' means persons or \n     entities diverting or receiving water pursuant to applicable \n     State and Federal law and shall include Central Valley \n     Project contractors outside of the Friant Division of the \n     Central Valley Project and the State Water Project.\n       (2) Issuance.--The Secretary of Commerce shall issue a \n     final rule pursuant to section 4(d) of the Endangered Species \n     Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(d)) governing the incidental take \n     of reintroduced California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook \n     salmon prior to the reintroduction.\n       (3) Required components.--The rule issued under paragraph \n     (2) shall provide that the reintroduction will not impose \n     more than de minimis: water supply reductions, additional \n     storage releases, or bypass flows on unwilling third parties \n     due to such reintroduction.\n       (4) Applicable law.--Nothing in this section--\n       (A) diminishes the statutory or regulatory protections \n     provided in the Endangered Species Act for any species listed \n     pursuant to section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1533) other than the reintroduced population of \n     California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon, \n     including protections pursuant to existing biological \n     opinions or new biological opinions issued by the Secretary \n     or Secretary of Commerce; or\n       (B) precludes the Secretary or Secretary of Commerce from \n     imposing protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) for other species listed pursuant to \n     section 4 of that Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) because those \n     protections provide incidental benefits to such reintroduced \n     California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon.\n       (d) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than December 31, 2024, the \n     Secretary of Commerce shall report to Congress on the \n     progress made on the reintroduction set forth in this section \n     and the Secretary's plans for future implementation of this \n     section.\n       (2) Inclusions.--The report under paragraph (1) shall \n     include--\n       (A) an assessment of the major challenges, if any, to \n     successful reintroduction;\n       (B) an evaluation of the effect, if any, of the \n     reintroduction on the existing population of California \n     Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon existing on the \n     Sacramento River or its tributaries; and\n       (C) an assessment regarding the future of the \n     reintroduction.\n       (e) FERC Projects.--\n       (1) In general.--With regard to California Central Valley \n     Spring Run Chinook salmon reintroduced pursuant to the \n     Settlement, the Secretary of Commerce shall exercise its \n     authority under section 18 of the Federal Power Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 811) by reserving its right to file prescriptions in \n     proceedings for projects licensed by the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission on the Calaveras, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, \n     Merced, and San Joaquin rivers and otherwise consistent with \n     subsection (c) until after the expiration of the term of the \n     Settlement, December 31, 2025, or the expiration of the \n     designation made pursuant to subsection (b), whichever ends \n     first.\n       (2) Effect of subsection.--Nothing in this subsection shall \n     preclude the Secretary of Commerce from imposing \n     prescriptions pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Power Act \n     (16 U.S.C. 811) solely for other anadromous fish species \n     because those prescriptions provide incidental benefits to \n     such reintroduced California Central Valley Spring Run \n     Chinook salmon.\n       (f) Effect of Section.--Nothing in this section is intended \n     or shall be construed--\n       (1) to modify the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1531 et seq.) or the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et \n     seq.); or\n       (2) to establish a precedent with respect to any other \n     application of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1531 et seq.) or the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et \n     seq.).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 4086. A bill to improve data collection efforts with respect to \nthe safety of pregnant women and unborn children in motor vehicle \ncrashes, provide for research and development of appropriate \ncountermeasures, educate the public regarding motor vehicle safety \nrisks affecting pregnant women and unborn children, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, during my 12 years in the Senate, I have \nalways fought to increase our Nation's commitment to children's health \nand safety. One of the areas where I have had the privilege of working \ntogether with Democrats and Republicans on children's issues is highway \nsafety. Whether the matter at hand was making school buses safer or \nenacting new motor vehicle safety standards that protect small children \nin crashes, I have always been fortunate to find fellow Senators \ncommitted to crafting legislation that will make a difference in \nchildren's lives.\n  One of the things I have learned over the years is that the research, \ntesting, and public awareness programs operated by the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration--NHTSA--play a major role helping prevent \ninjuries and saving lives on our roads. We lose over 42,000 lives each \nyear in motor vehicle crashes, but that total would be astronomically \nhigher without the work done by NHTSA and its partners. As vehicles \nhave changed, technologies\n\n[[Page S11330]]\n\nhave matured, and the safety challenges facing the driving public have \nshifted over time, NHTSA has responded by instituting new programs. \nSometimes, however, it takes a little action by Congress to get NHTSA \nmoving on these important safety objectives.\n  Today, I rise to introduce a measure that I hope my colleagues will \nconsider in the future as they continue to work on highway safety \nissues. I also hope that this bill might spur additional action by \nNHTSA.\n  In speaking with leading safety advocates, I have come to understand \njust how significant the safety challenges are for pregnant women and \ntheir unborn children in motor vehicle crashes. Yet despite these great \nchallenges and the importance we all place on ensuring maternal health \nand safety, we know very little about the way crash forces affect \nmothers and their unborn children over both the short-term and long-\nterm. While university researchers have begun to document some of the \nchief safety challenges facing pregnant mothers, we need to do more to \nfully understand these issues and to develop ways of applying what we \nhave learned in manufacturing vehicles that are safer for pregnant \nwomen and their unborn children.\n  Additionally, we need to do a better job communicating the immediate \nand lifelong safety risks associated with motor vehicle crashes to \npregnant mothers so that they can do everything possible to ensure not \nonly their own health, but that of their babies. Sometimes, these steps \nmay be as simple as making sure that safety belts are worn and \npositioned properly. At some point, technologies may become available \non the market designed specifically to cater to the motor vehicle \nsafety needs of pregnant women.\n  To achieve these goals and ultimately to prevent injuries and save \nlives, we need NHTSA to act and we need to provide new resources for \nresearch and testing. The bill I am introducing today does precisely \nthat.\n  The Maternal Motor Vehicle Crash Safety Act of 2006 addresses these \nissues in a number of ways. First, the bill presents findings defining \nthe challenges facing pregnant women and their unborn children in motor \nvehicle crashes. I particularly want to thank Dr. Hank Weiss of the \nUniversity of Pittsburgh for his assistance in bringing this important \nresearch to my attention.\n  Second, the bill contains sections providing incentives for states to \nlink various databases in a way that will lead to a better \nunderstanding of the number of mothers and babies that are impacted by \nmotor vehicle crashes each year and what the long-term health impacts \nare for children who were involved in crashes before being born. \nFurthermore, the bill sets several high priority research areas for \nNHTSA, including an investigation into computer modeling systems and \nbiofidelic crash-test dummies capable of simulating a pregnant woman \nand her child during dangerous crashes. Sadly, we have functional \ndummies that accurately simulate men, women, and children--but none for \npregnant women.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to take up and pass this legislation \nduring the 110th Congress. Members of the Senate and leaders at NHTSA \nwork hard every year to do their best to improve highway safety here in \nthe United States, and I believe the measures outlined in this bill \nhave the potential to make a lasting contribution to those efforts in \nthe years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, the \nMaternal Motor Vehicle Crash Safety Act of 2006, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 4086\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Maternal Motor Vehicle Crash \n     Safety Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration.\n       (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee \n     on Appropriations and Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Appropriations and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of \n     the House of Representatives.\n       (3) Biofidelic.--The term ``biofidelic'' means having the \n     property of responding to and being impacted by crash and \n     other external forces in a manner directly consistent with \n     the way in which a live human being would respond to and be \n     impacted by such forces.\n       (4) Data linkage system.--The term ``data linkage system'' \n     means an information system that is capable of accurately \n     tracking adverse health effects and birth outcomes for \n     pregnant women who are occupants of a motor vehicle that is \n     involved in a crash and the unborn children of such women, \n     through the connection and analysis of multiple data sources.\n       (5) Unborn child.--The term ``unborn child'' means a member \n     of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who \n     is carried in the womb.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Injuries are the leading cause of pregnancy-associated \n     deaths in the United States.\n       (2) Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of injury \n     deaths in women of reproductive age and the leading cause of \n     injury hospitalizations among pregnant women.\n       (3) Studies have indicated that motor vehicles are \n     estimated to account for up to 80 percent of injury related \n     deaths among unborn children.\n       (4) Transportation Research Board publications indicate \n     that deaths among unborn children due to motor vehicle \n     crashes are more frequent than several notable fatal \n     childhood injuries, including bicycle related deaths in \n     children aged 0 through 15, firearm related deaths in \n     children aged 0 through 9, and motor vehicle crash related \n     deaths in children aged 0 through 1.\n       (5) Studies suggest that approximately 3 percent of all \n     babies born in the United States are involved in a motor \n     vehicle crash while in utero.\n       (6) Studies have shown that elevated risks of birth-related \n     threats and obstetric complications following crashes \n     involving pregnant women include--\n       (A) premature childbirth;\n       (B) low birth weight;\n       (C) placental injury;\n       (D) uterine rupture; and\n       (E) amniotic rupture.\n       (7) Despite advances in vehicle safety, pregnant women have \n     not received the special attention and consideration needed \n     to understand, reduce, and prevent the risks of adverse \n     pregnancy outcomes related to crashes.\n       (8) There is a need for more research and application using \n     anthropometric test devices and computerized modeling systems \n     that represent pregnant women during all stages of pregnancy.\n       (9) During pregnancy, the risks of traumatic injury to a \n     woman is shared by the woman's unborn child. Assessing the \n     magnitude and characteristics of those risks through data \n     linkage systems, comparing the risks to other injuries and \n     diseases, and reducing them, are important unmet challenges \n     for improving maternal and child health.\n       (10) A better understanding is needed about what can happen \n     during, and after, a pregnant woman is involved in a motor \n     vehicle crash.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax \ncredit to individuals who enter into agreements to protect the habitats \nof endangered and threatened species, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues--Senator \nLincoln from Arkansas, Senator Charles Grassley from Iowa, and Senator \nMax Baucus from Montana--to introduce the Endangered Species Recovery \nAct or ESRA. Nearly a year ago, Senator Lincoln and I introduced the \nCollaboration for the Recovery of the Endangered Species Act, or CRESA, \nan earlier bill to amend the Endangered Species Act or ESA. This new \nbill, which does not amend the current ESA, builds on ideas set forth \nin CRESA. It creates new policies that finance the recovery of \nendangered species by private landowners. ESRA makes it simpler for \nlandowners to get involved in conservation and reduces the conflict \noften emanating from the ESA. It will be an important codification of \nmuch-needed incentives to help recover endangered species.\n  Over 80 percent of endangered species live on private property. Under \nthe current law, however, there are too few incentives and too many \nobstacles for\n\n[[Page S11332]]\n\nprivate landowners to participate in conservation agreements to help \nrecover species under the ESA. ESRA, like the voluntary farm bill \nconservation programs that inspired its creation, will make it more \nattractive for private landowners to contribute to the recovery of \nspecies under the ESA.\n  This bill resulted from effective and inclusive collaboration among \nkey stakeholders most affected by the implementation of the ESA. \nLandowner interests include farmers, ranchers, and those from the \nnatural resource-using communities. For example, some current \nsupporters of ESRA who contributed invaluable advice are the American \nFarm Bureau, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, and the Society \nof American Foresters. This could not rightly be called a collaborative \nproject without the vital and necessary input received from the \nDefenders of Wildlife, Environmental Defense and the National Wildlife \nFederation--key environmental groups that made significant \ncontributions. And they further understand that landowners must be \ntreated as allies to ensure success in the long-run for the \nconservation of habitat and species. Finally, while the genesis of this \nbill has many roots, a passionate catalyst was James Cummins of \nMississippi Fish and Wildlife Foundation, whose passion for the \noutdoors provided inspiration to move these ideas forward.\n  This collaborative expertise worked together to craft the ESRA, which \nprovides new tax incentives for private landowners who voluntarily \ncontribute to the recovery of endangered species. The tax credits will \nreimburse landowners for property rights affected by agreements that \ninclude conservation easements and costs incurred by species management \nplans. For landowners who limit their property rights through \nconservation easements, there will be 100 percent compensation of all \ncosts. That percentage declines to 75 percent for 30-year easements and \n50 percent for cost-share agreements not encumbered by an easement.\n  It is worth noting that this is the same formula that works \nsuccessfully for farm bill programs such as the Wetlands Reserve \nProgram. Private property owners are appropriately rewarded for crucial \necological services that they provide with their property. The public \nbenefits from those actions which ensure biodiversity; instead of \nplacing the financial burdens on the landowner, we ought to find \nappropriate ways to compensate them. While the primary returns from \nthis investment are protection and recovery of endangered species, the \npublic will also undoubtedly gain additional benefits such as \naesthetically pleasing open space, combating invasive species and \nenhanced water quality.\n  The legislation provides a list of options that give landowners a \nchoice, and this is a crucial element for the success of this proposal. \nFor some landowners, a conservation easement will be the most \nattractive option. Easements are flexible tools that can be tailored to \neach landowner and species' interests. An easement restricts certain \nactivities, but it still works well with traditional rural activities \nsuch as ranching and farming. For agreements without easements, there \nis flexibility to do what is necessary for the concerned species \nwithout the need to sacrifice property rights into perpetuity.\n  The tax credits provide essential funding that is necessary to \nrespect private property rights. Wildlife should be an asset rather \nthan a liability; which is how it has sometimes been viewed under the \nESA. With wildlife becoming valuable to a landowner, those who may been \nreluctant to participate in recovery efforts in the past will be more \nlikely to contribute with these incentives. When people want to take \npart in the process and do not fear it, the likelihood of conflict and \nlitigation is reduced. For years, this type of conflict has proven \ncostly not only in dollars to individuals and the government, but also \nin terms of relationships between people who share the land and natural \nresources. With a new trust and new model for finding conservation \nsolutions, we can do more and better conservation work.\n  Provisions have been made to accommodate landowners whose taxes may \nbe less than the tax credit provides. Partnerships in the agreements \nwill allow any party to an agreement to receive a credit as long as \nthey pay or incur costs as a result of the agreement. This language \nwill allow creative collaboration among governments, landowners, \ntaxpayers and environmentalists, further increasing the number of \npeople involved in finding new solutions for conservation.\n  Furthermore, this bill also expands tax deductions for any landowner \nwho takes part in the recovery plans approved under the ESA, and allows \nlandowners to exclude from taxable income certain federal payments \nunder conservation costshare programs. This will allow both individuals \nand businesses to deduct the cost of recovery work without bureaucratic \nobstacles.\n  This bill not only sets forth the financing for private landowners, \nbut it also makes it easier to implement the agreements. Landowners \nwill receive technical assistance to implement the agreements. Also, to \nremove some legal disincentives to recover species, liability \nprotection may be provided to protect the landowners from penalties \nunder the ESA. This removes the fear of trying to help species; \ncurrently, more species usually just means more liability for a \nlandowner.\n  As a result of these incentives, I expect to see a phenomenal \nincrease in the number of success stories. These stories will sound \nfamiliar to those creative collaborators working on the ground now \nwhere we have learned that the types of tools provided in this bill can \nwork if consistently offered.\n  The Endangered Species Recovery Act is very exciting to those of us \nwho value protecting our natural resources. It provides collaborative, \ncreative ways to balance resource conservation with economic uses of \nour natural resources and preserving rural ways of life. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues in the Senate and House to move ahead \nwith this legislation which will allow better, more effective \nconservation work for future generations.\n  I am deeply grateful to my colleagues from Arkansas, Iowa and Montana \nfor their essential expertise and support to create ESRA. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 4087\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to modernize and expand the reporting requirements \nrelating to child pornography, to expand cooperation in combating child \npornography, to require convicted sex offenders to register online \nidentifiers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Stop the Online \nExploitation of Our Children Act of 2006. This legislation would reduce \nthe sexual exploitation of our children, and punish those who cause \nthem physical and emotional harm through sex crimes.\n  Twenty-two years ago, President Ronald Reagan inaugurated the opening \nof the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, known as \nNCMEC. At a White House ceremony, he called on the center to ``wake up \nAmerica and attack the crisis of child victimization.'' Today, thanks \nto the efforts of NCMEC and many others in the public and private \nsectors, America is more conscious of the dangers of child \nexploitation, but our children still face significant threats from \nthose who see their innocence as an opportunity to do harm. The \ncontinuing victimization of our children is readily and all too \npainfully apparent in the resurgence of child pornography in our world.\n  In recent years, technology has contributed to the greater \ndistribution and availability, and, some believe, desire for child \npornography. I say child pornography, but that label does not describe \naccurately what is at issue. As emphasized by a recent Department of \nJustice report, ``child pornography'' does not come close to describing \nthese images, which are nothing short of recorded images of child \nsexual abuse. These images are, quite literally, digital evidence of \nviolent sexual crimes perpetrated against the most vulnerable among us.\n  Experts are also finding that the images of child sexual exploitation \nproduced and distributed today involve younger and younger children. As \nemphasized by NCMEC, 83 percent of offenders surveyed in a recent study \nwere caught with images of children younger than 12 years old. Thirty-\nnine percent had images of children younger than 6. Almost 20 percent \nhad images of children younger than 3. These are not normal criminals, \nand I cannot fathom the extent of the physical and emotional harm they \ncause their victims.\n  The violence of the images continues to increase as well. Dr. Sharon \nCooper, a nationally recognized expert on this subject, stated before a \nSeptember Senate Commerce Committee hearing that the images often \ndepict ``sadistic gross sexual assault and sodomy.'' This view was \nunderscored by Mike Brown, the sheriff of Bedford County, VA, and the \ndirector of the Blue Ridge Thunder Internet Crimes Against Children \nTask Force, who also testified to his direct experience with \nincreasingly violent and disturbing images of child sexual \nexploitation.\n  The Federal Government has in place a system for online companies \nsuch as Internet service providers to report these images to NCMEC. The \ncenter is directed by law to relay that information to Federal and \nState law enforcement agencies. This reporting system has been \nsuccessful, but it is in need of several vital improvements.\n  The bill would enhance the current reporting system by expanding the \nrange of companies obligated to report child pornography to NCMEC; \nstating specifically what information must be reported to the center; \nmoving the reporting obligations into the Federal\n\n[[Page S11335]]\n\ncriminal code; imposing higher penalties on companies that do not \nreport child pornography to NCMEC in the manner required by law; and \nproviding greater legal certainty around the child pornography \nreporting requirement.\n  As suggested by NCMEC, the reporting of child pornography should be \nmore widespread. To that end, the bill would expand and clarify the \ntypes of online companies that would be obligated to report child \npornography to the center. Today, Federal law requires electronic \ncommunication service providers and providers of remote computing \nservices to report child pornography they discover to NCMEC through the \ncenter's CyberTipline. However, what types of companies fall into each \ncategory is sometimes unclear. To better define and expand the types of \nonline companies obligated to report child pornography, the legislation \nwould require a broad range of online service providers--including Web \nhosting companies, domain name registrars, and social networking \nsites--to report child pornography to NCMEC.\n  Another weakness in the current reporting system is that the law does \nnot say exactly what information should be reported to NCMEC. This \nfailure to set forth specific reporting requirements makes the current \nstatute both difficult to comply with and tough to enforce, and this \nomission may have led to less effective prosecution of child \npornographers. According to testimony submitted by the center to the \nSenate Commerce Committee, ``because there are no guidelines for the \ncontents of these reports, some [companies] do not send customer \ninformation that allows NCMEC to identify a law enforcement \njurisdiction. So potentially valuable investigative leads are left to \nsit in the CyberTipline database with no action taken.'' This is \nunacceptable.\n  The bill would cure this problem by requiring that reporting \ncompanies convey to the center a defined set of information, which is \nin large part the information that is provided to NCMEC today by the \nNation's leading Internet service providers. Among other things, the \nbill would require online service providers to report specific \ninformation about the individual involved in producing, distributing, \nor receiving child pornography such as that individual's e-mail \naddress. In addition, it would require reporting companies to NCMEC \ngeographic location of the involved individual such as the individual's \nphysical address and the IP address from which the individual connected \nto the Internet.\n  To ensure that law enforcement officials have better odds of \nprosecuting involved individuals, the bill would also require online \nservice providers to preserve all data that they report to NCMEC for at \nleast 180 days, and to not knowingly destroy any other information that \nthey possess that relates to a child pornography incident reported to \nNCMEC.\n  The legislation would help ensure greater compliance with the child \npornography reporting requirements under Federal law by increasing \nthreefold the penalties for knowing failure to report child pornography \nto NCMEC. It would also move the reporting requirement from title 42, \nwhich relates to the public's health and welfare, to title 18, our \nFederal Criminal Code. This is to underscore that a breach of the \nreporting obligations is a violation of criminal law. In addition, the \nact would eliminate the legal liability of online service providers for \nactions taken to comply with the child pornography reporting \nrequirements.\n  The bottom line is that this legislation should result in more \nthorough reporting of child pornography to NCMEC. I expect that more \nand better information provided to the center will lead to a greater \nnumber of prosecutions and enhanced protection of our children. As \nstated by NCMEC, with improvements to the reporting system there would \nbe more reports that are actionable by law enforcement, which will lead \nto more prosecutions and convictions and, more importantly, to the \nrescue of more children.\n  In addition to the provisions relating to child pornography, the bill \nalso would ensure that sex offenders will register information relevant \nto their online activities on sex offender registries. Specifically, it \nwould require sex offenders to register their e-mail addresses, as well \nas their instant messaging and chat room handles and any other online \nidentifiers they use. If a sex offender failed to do so, he could be \nprosecuted, convicted, and thrown into jail for up to 10 years. The \nbill would also make the use of the Internet in the commission of a \ncrime of child exploitation an aggravating factor that would add 10 \nyears to the offender's sentence.\n  To help address the international nature of child pornography, the \nbill would permit NCMEC to share reports with foreign law enforcement \nagencies, subject to approval by the Department of Justice. In \naddition, the act would state the sense of Congress that the executive \nbranch should make child pornography a priority when engaging in \nnegotiations or talks with foreign countries.\n  Finally, the act would authorize $20.3 million for our Nation's \nInternet Crimes Against Children Task Forces. This increase of $5 \nmillion above that currently requested by the Administration is \nrecommended by NCMEC, Sheriff Brown, and others who believe that the \nadditional amount would significantly improve the efforts of these \nteams of Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials dedicated \nto identifying and prosecuting those who use the Internet to prey upon \nour Nation's children.\n  Mr. President, protecting our children is a top priority for Members \nof Congress, regardless of party affiliation. This legislation would \nhelp us achieve that goal. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto debate and move this bill through the legislative process during the \nnext Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. \n        Vitter):\n  S. 4097. A bill to improve the disaster loan program of the Small \nBusiness Administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Kerry, Landrieu \nand Vitter to introduce The Small Business Disaster Response and Loan \nImprovements Act of 2006, a bill that would provide a comprehensive; \npackage of reforms to improve the Small Business Administration's, SBA, \ndisaster loan program.\n  As you know, the entire gulf coast of the United States was ravaged \nin 2005 by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. These natural disasters, \nunprecedented in scope and economic impact, presented a prime \nopportunity for the SBA to showcase its programs and resources for \nsmall businesses. Unfortunately, SBA's response was subpar at best, \nleaving some disaster victims waiting three months or more for disaster \nloans to be processed.\n  As chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I remain committed to doing everything in my power to \nprovide small businesses and homeowners with the tools they need to \nrecover from disasters. The SBA is and must be at the forefront of \ndisaster relief efforts. We must ensure that victims of future \ndisasters have access to the resources they need to restore their \nlives, their businesses, and their dreams.\n  Many of the provisions in this bid have already passed unanimously \nthrough the Small Business Committee this year as part of the Small \nBusiness Reauthorization and Improvements Act of 2006 S. 3778, \nbipartisan legislation I authored that features sweeping reforms to \nhelp the SBA lead with the same dedication to excellence found in the \nentrepreneurs it serves. The committee unanimously approved this \nlegislation and reported it to the full Senate, where it awaits \nconsideration.\n  This bill before the Senate today includes essential provisions that \nwould better assist victims applying for SBA disaster loans. Among \nother items, this legislation would increase the maximum size of an SBA \ndisaster loan from $1.5 million per loan to $5 million per loan and \nwould make it possible for non-profit institutions to be eligible for \ndisaster loans.\n  Recognizing the increased demand disasters place on all small \nbusiness lending programs, the legislation establishes a private \ndisaster loan PDL program that allows for PDLs to be made to disaster \nvictims by private banks, which would have to apply to the SBA for \neligibility. A business would be eligible for a PDL if the county in \nwhich the business is located was\n\n[[Page S11336]]\n\ndeclared a disaster area anytime in the last 24 months. The business \nwould not have to show a nexus between its need for a loan, and the \ndisaster that occurred. It would be enough to be located in that \ncounty. The SBA would provide an 85 percent guarantee for the loans.\n  In addition, our legislation would provide authorization for the SBA \nto enter into agreements with qualified private contractors to process \ndisaster loans. It also would require the SBA to provide Congress with \na report on how the disaster loan application process can be improved, \nincluding methods to expedite loan processing and verification for \nsources vital to rebuilding efforts.\n  This legislation would also require the SBA to promulgate rules \nwithin 6 months that would create a new ``expedited disaster assistance \nbusiness loan program.'' These short-term loans would have low interest \nrates similar to regular disaster loans. The program is intended to \nrespond to major disasters, but at the discretion of the SBA \nAdministrator, it can be implemented in the event of any disaster.\n  I firmly believe the product before us is the best package to aid \nfamilies, businesses, and communities through challenging times \nfollowing disasters. We must not forget their pain, their \ndetermination, and their resolute refusal to walk away from the \ncommunities and small businesses they cherish.\n  When a disaster strikes, the spirit, determination, and will of \nAmerica's small businesses help to create the firm economic foundation, \npropelling our nation's economic growth forward. Therefore, we in turn \nmust create an atmosphere favorable for small businesses and provide \nthis assistance package to the SBA. We must allow our Nation's small \nbusinesses to do what they do best--create jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Too much is at stake for \nsmall businesses, and the economy as a whole, to allow this critical \nlegislation to languish. Clearly, if we strive for anything less, we \nfail to support the backbone of our economy, our hope for new \ninnovation, and the entrepreneurs reach for the American dream.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4097\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, in the 15 months since Hurricane Katrina \ndecimated gulf coast communities, Senators Snowe, Landrieu, Vitter, and \nI have worked to produce a comprehensive package to reform the SBA's \ndisaster loan program. The SBA's failed response in a time of unmatched \nneed demonstrated to everyone that this program is broken and needs \nfixing.\n  Immediately after Hurricane Katrina hit, I introduced an amendment \nwith Senator Landrieu to the fiscal year 2006 Commerce, Justice and \nScience appropriations bill to address the needs of gulf region small \nbusiness and homeowners. The amendment was adapted with input from \nChair Snowe, and a subsequent bipartisan amendment passed the Senate \nwith a vote of 96 to 0. Although the entire Senate supported the \namendment, it was stripped out of the bill conference.\n  On September 30, 2005, I again worked with Chair Snowe and Senators \nLandrieu and Vitter to introduce the Small Business Hurricane Relief \nand Reconstruction Act of 2006, S. 1807. Although this bill presented a \nbipartisan, comprehensive approach to hurricane relief, it stalled in \nthe face of the Administration's opposition. In June, I introduced the \nSmall Business Disaster Loan Reauthorization and Improvements Act of \n2006, S. 3487, which once again attempted to comprehensively address \nthe shortcomings of this program. Finally, in August, and with \ncontinued opposition from the administration, the, committee \nunanimously reported S. 3778, the Small Business Reauthorization and \nImprovements Act of 2006, which again put forward a bipartisan, \ncomprehensive fix for this program.\n  Many of the provisions included in the bill we are introducing today \nwere included in one or more of these previous proposals. The bill \nincludes directives for the SBA to create a private disaster loan \nprogram, to allow for lenders to issue disaster loans. To ensure that \nthese loans are borrower friendly, we provide authorization for \nappropriations so that the agency can subsidize the interest rates. In \naddition, the administrator is authorized to enter into agreements with \nprivate contractors in order to expedite loan application processing \nfor direct disaster loans.\n  The bill also includes language directing SBA to create an expedited \ndisaster assistance loan program to provide businesses with short-term \nloans so that they may keep their doors open until they receive \nalternative forms of assistance. The days immediately following a \ndisaster are crucial for business owners--statistics show that once \nthey close their doors, they likely will not open them again. These \nshort-term loans should help prevent those doors from closing.\n  A Presidential declaration of catastrophic national disaster will \nallow the administrator to offer economic injury disaster loans to \nadversely affected business owners beyond the geographic reach of the \ndisaster area.\n  Nonprofit entities working to provide services to victims should be \nrewarded and given access to the capital they require to continue their \nservices. To this end, the administrator is authorized to make disaster \nloans to nonprofit entities, including religious organizations.\n  Construction and rebuilding contracts being awarded are likely to be \nlarger than the current $2 million threshold currently applied to the \nSBA Surety Bond Program which helps small construction firms gain \naccess to contracts. This bill increases the guarantee against loss for \nsmall business contracts up to $5 million and allows the administrator \nto increase that level to $10 million, if deemed necessary.\n  The bill also provides for small business development centers to \noffer business counseling in disaster areas and to travel beyond \ntraditional geographic\n\n[[Page S11342]]\n\nboundaries to provide services during declared disasters. To encourage \nsmall business development centers located in disaster areas to keep \ntheir doors open, the maximum grant amount is waived.\n  So that Congress may remain better aware of the status of the \nadministration's disaster loan program, this bill directs the \nadministration to report to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship of the Senate and to the Committee on Small Business \nof the House of Representatives regularly on the fiscal status of the \ndisaster loan program as well as the need for supplemental funding. The \nadministration is also directed to report on the number of Federal \ncontracts awarded to small businesses, minority-owned small businesses, \nwomen-owned businesses, and local businesses during a disaster \ndeclaration.\n  Finally, gas prices continue to fluctuate, and fuel-dependent small \nbusinesses are struggling with the cost of energy. This bill provides \nrelief to small business owners during times of above average energy \nprice increases, authorizing energy disaster loans through the Small \nBusiness Administration and the Department of Agriculture to companies \nthat depend on fuel.\n  Residents of the gulf coast continue to rebuild from last year's \nhurricane season. By all accounts, Administrator Preston has \nimplemented policies that are helping gulf coast victims get back on \ntheir feet. However, the SBA needs the tools offered in this bill in \norder to comprehensively address the needs of business owners following \na large-scale disaster. As the 109th Congress prepares to adjourn, it \nis unconscionable that we have not yet put in place the reforms needed \nfor this program to function effectively. I urge my colleagues in the \nfinal days of this session to support this legislation, so that God \nforbid another region has to deal with a disaster the size and scope of \nthe 2005 gulf coast hurricanes, the SBA will be fully able to provide \nthe assistance that homeowners and business owners require.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we all know, there was a tremendous \namount of criticism of the Federal Government's response to Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita last year. Things are better now and the region is \nslowly recovering. But having just finished the 2006 Hurricane season, \nand with the 2007 season a few months away, we must be sure that if we \nhave another disaster, the Federal Government's response will be better \nthis time around. Disaster response agencies have to be better \norganized, more efficient, and more responsive in order to avoid the \nproblems, the delays, mismanagement, and the seeming incompetence that \noccurred last year.\n  Today, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of legislation to \nimprove the disaster response of one agency that had a great deal of \nproblems last year, the Small Business Administration, SBA. This bill, \nthe Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act, makes \nmajor improvements to the SBA's disaster response and provides them \nwith essential tools to ensure that they are more efficient and better \nprepared for future disasters--big and small. I should also note that \nthis bill is a result of intensive bipartisan work over the past few \nmonths. As such, it is reflective of the priorities from Senators Snowe \nand Kerry, respectively chair and ranking member of the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee, as well as Senator Landrieu. For my part, I have \nheard loud and clear from our impacted businesses that SBA reforms \nshould be implemented as soon as possible. That is why in September, I \nsent a letter to the new SBA Administrator Steve Preston, expressing \nconcerns on the lack of progress on SBA Disaster reforms, which were \nincluded in S. 3778, the fiscal year 2007 SBA reauthorization bill \nreported out of the Senate Small Business Committee. In this letter, I \nrequested his cooperation, along with our committee, to pass this \nimportant legislation before Congress adjourns at the end of the year. \nThe introduction of this bill today, shows the progress that the \ncommittee made since September on this issue. I hope that this spirit \nof bipartisanship continues well into the 110th Congress and that I can \ncontinue to work with my colleagues on the Senate Small Business \nCommittee to reform SBA.\n  This legislation offers new tools to enhance SBA's disaster \nassistance programs. In every disaster, the SBA disaster loan program \nis a lifeline for businesses and homeowners who want to rebuild their \nlives after a catastrophe. When Katrina hit, our businesses and \nhomeowners had to wait months for loan approvals. I do not know how \nmany businesses we lost because help did not come in time. Because of \nthe scale of this disaster, what these businesses needed was immediate, \nshort-term assistance to hold them over until SBA was ready to process \nthe tens of thousands of loan applications it received.\n  That is why this legislation provides the SBA Administrator with the \nability to set up an expedited disaster assistance business loan \nprogram to make short-term, low-interest loans to keep them afloat. \nThese loans will allow businesses to make payroll, begin making \nrepairs, and address other immediate needs while they are awaiting \ninsurance payouts or regular SBA disaster loans. However, I realize \nthat every disaster is different and could range from a disaster on the \nscale of Hurricane Katrina or 911, to an ice storm or drought. This \nlegislation gives the SBA additional options and flexibility in the \nkinds of relief they can offer a community. When a tornado destroys 20 \nbusinesses in a small town in the Midwest, SBA can get the regular \ndisaster program up and running fairly quickly. You may not need short-\nterm loans in this instance. But if you know that SBA's resources would \nbe overwhelmed by a storm--just as they were initially with Katrina--\nthese expedited business loans would be very helpful.\n\n  This legislation also would direct SBA to study ways to expedite \ndisaster loans for those businesses in a disaster area that have a \ngood, solid track record with the SBA or can provide vital recovery \nefforts. We had many businesses in the gulf coast that had paid off \nprevious SBA loans, were major sources of employment in their \ncommunities, but had to wait months for decisions on their SBA disaster \nloan applications. I do not want to get rid of the SBA's current \npractice of reviewing applications on a first-come- first-served basis, \nbut there should be some mechanism in place for major disasters to get \nexpedited loans out the door to specific businesses that has a positive \nrecord with SBA or those that could serve a vital role in the recovery \nefforts. Expedited loans would jump- start impacted economies, get \nvital capital out to businesses, and retain essential jobs following \nfuture disasters.\n  This bill also makes an important modification to the collateral \nrequirements for disaster loans. The SBA cannot disburse more than \n$10,000 for an approved loan without showing collateral. This is to \nlimit the loss to the SBA in the event that a loan defaults. However, \nthis disbursement amount has not been increased since 1998, and these \ndays, $10,000 is not enough to get a business up and running. That is \nwhy this bill increases this collateral requirement to $14,000 and \ngives the Administrator the ability to increase that amount, in the \nevent of another large-scale disaster. I believe this is a reasonable \nand fiscally responsible increase, and at the same time gives the \nAdministrator flexibility for future disasters which will inevitably \noccur.\n  As you may know, pushed to get language in the last hurricane \nsupplemental appropriations bill in June 2006 to require SBA to develop \na disaster plan and report to Congress on its contents by July 15, \n2006. SBA provided this status report in July, and I am pleased that, \nsince then, SBA has been working on a comprehensive disaster response \nplan. That said, I believe that with the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season \nfast approaching, and other disasters possible before then, the SBA \nshould be looking at additional ways to improve upon this plan. This \nlegislation requires SBA to report to Congress, by March 15, 2007, on \nthe current status of its response plan and to provide us with a \nsnapshot of where they were with Katrina and where they are now. The \nreport also requests SBA feedback on suggested improvements. These \nimprovements include better incorporating State disaster assistance \nefforts into SBA's response, as well as better coordination with \nFederal response agencies like FEMA.\n\n[[Page S11343]]\n\n  The Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act will \nprovide essential tools to make the SBA more proactive, flexible, and \nmost important, more efficient during future disasters. Again, I look \nforward to working with both Senator Snowe and Senator Kerry during the \n110th Congress to ensure that the SBA has everything it needs to meet \nthese goals.\n  I thank the Chair and ask that my entire statement appear in the \nRecord. I also ask unanimous consent that a copy of my September 27, \n2006, letter to SBA be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 2006.\n     Hon. Steven C. Preston,\n     Administrator, U.S. Small Business Administration,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Preston: Let me take this opportunity to \n     again congratulate you on your confirmation as Administrator \n     of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). Your \n     management experience and passion to serve will prove \n     extremely helpful to you in this challenging position.\n       I write you today because, as member of the Senate \n     Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, as well as \n     senator from a state hit hard by both Hurricanes Katrina and \n     Rita, I believe it is my duty to ensure that we implement \n     substantive changes to SBA's Disaster Assistance Program \n     during this session of Congress.\n       The SBA's response to Katrina and Rita was too slow and \n     lacking in urgency--threatening the very survival of our \n     affected businesses. A year has passed since Hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita, yet while Congress is currently acting on \n     extensive reforms for the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     (FEMA), there has been only incremental changes to SBA's \n     Disaster Assistance Program. That is why I am pleased to \n     learn that you have recently created the Accelerated Disaster \n     Response Initiative to identify and help implement process \n     improvements to enable the SBA to respond more quickly in \n     assisting small businesses and homeowners in need of \n     assistance after a disaster. I applaud these efforts and your \n     leadership on this issue. But much more must be done to \n     address the systemic problems that led to delays and inaction \n     post-Katrina and Rita.\n       For our part, the Senate is also attempting to address the \n     multiple problems that hampered SBA's ability to assist \n     impacted Gulf Coast small businesses and homeowners. Under \n     the leadership of the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate \n     Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Senators \n     Snowe and Kerry, the committee voted unanimously to approve \n     S. 3778, the ``Small Business Reauthorization and \n     Improvements Act of 2006'' and sent it to the full Senate for \n     consideration. A copy of the bill is attached for your \n     convenience. This bipartisisan legislation re-authorizes SBA \n     programs, and also of great importance to me and my \n     constitutents, makes essential reforms to SBA's Disaster \n     Assistance Program. However, since S. 3778 was introduced on \n     August 2, 2006, almost nine weeks ago, it has been blocked \n     from consideration and the Committee is still waiting for \n     budget information so that it may file its report on the \n     bill. It is my understanding that the administration and SBA \n     has several concerns about this bill in its current form.\n       I am very concerned at this apparent deadlock, a deadlock \n     which threatens our bipartisan efforts to implement \n     comprehensive SBA Diaster Assistance reforms before the end \n     of the year. In particular, I believe that there must be SBA \n     reforms in the following areas:\n       Short-Term Assistance: Following Katrina and Rita small \n     businesses waited, on average, four to six months for \n     approvals and disbursements on SBA Disaster Loans, In order \n     to ensure the long-term survival of small businesses impacted \n     by a catastrophic disaster, SBA needs to be in the business \n     of short-term recovery--by providing either emergency bridge \n     loans or grants.\n       Disaster Loan Process for Homeowners: While SBA's mission \n     is to ``aid, counsel, assist and protect, insofar as is \n     possible, the interests of small business concerns'' it also \n     has the added responsibility of helping affected homeowners \n     rebuild their housing post-disaster. Katrina and Rita \n     resulted in record numbers of SBA Disaster Loan applications, \n     from homeowners, which strained SBA's existing resources and \n     personnel. If the SBA must bear this responsibility, the \n     agency should improve the process as well as possibly seek \n     greater coordination and cooperation with the U.S. Department \n     of Housing and Urban Development on disaster housing \n     assistance.\n       Expedited Disaster Loans to Businesses: The SBA currently \n     has no mechanism in place to expedite Disaster Loans to \n     impacted businesses that are either a major source of \n     employment or that can demonstrate a vital contribution to \n     recovery efforts in the area, such as businesses who \n     construct housing, provide building materials, or conduct \n     debris removal. The SBA needs the ability to fast-track loans \n     to these businesses, in order to jumpstart local economies \n     and recovery efforts.\n       Economic Injury Disaster Loans: Although Katrina and Rita \n     directly affected businesses along the Gulf Coast, additional \n     businesses in the region, as well as the rest of the country, \n     were economically impacted by the storms. The SBA must have \n     the ability to provide nationwide, or perhaps regional, \n     economic injury disaster loans to businesses which can \n     demonstrate economic distress or disruption from a future \n     major disaster.\n       Loss Verification and Loan Processing: Following the Gulf \n     Coast hurricanes, the SBA struggled for months to hire enough \n     staff to inspect losses and process loan applications. \n     Although SBA now has trained reserves to handle such surges \n     in demand, the SBA also needs the permanent authority to \n     enter into agreements with qualified private lenders and \n     credit unions to process Disaster Loans and provide loss \n     verification services.\n       Administrator Preston, I was impressed by your expressed \n     willingness to be a bridge between Congress and the White \n     House. For the SBA truly bring its disaster capabilities to \n     the next level, I believe that it must work in concert with \n     the Congress. Together, we must remove layers of bureaucracy \n     and red tape, which, following Katrina and Rita, both \n     overwhelmed and frustrated dedicated SBA employees and those \n     affected by the hurricanes. We must also give the SBA new \n     tools to ensure that problems that occurred post-Katrina and \n     Rita never happen again.\n       Last month we marked the 1-year anniversary of Hurricane \n     Katrina, and now mark the 1-year anniversary of hurricane \n     Rita. It is essential that we take action now to make \n     substantive reforms to the SBA Disaster Assistance Program. \n     We owe nothing less to our small businesses. I ask that you \n     continue working with my office on this important issue and \n     respond to our approach in writing no later than October 31, \n     2006. This will help us develop a proposal which can address \n     the concerns of the SBA as well as provide a better and more \n     responsive SBA Disaster Assistance Program for our small \n     businesses.\n       Thank you in advance for your assistance with this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mary L. Landrieu,\n                                            United States Senator.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 4098. A bill to improve the process for the development of needed \npediatric medical devices; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pediatric \nMedical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2006. I want to begin by \nthanking Senator Mike DeWine for joining me in introducing this \nlegislation and for his leadership on children's health. He has been my \npartner over the years as we fought to make drugs safer and more widely \navailable for children. I believe the legislation we are introducing \ntoday will achieve a similar goal for pediatric medical devices. I \nwould also like to especially thank the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS \nFoundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Thoracic \nSociety and the National Organization for Rare Disorders for their \nexpertise in helping craft this legislation as well as their tireless \nsupport for making medical devices safer for use in children.\n  This legislation provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring that \nchildren are not left behind as cutting-edge research and revolutionary \ntechnologies for medical devices advance. Like drugs, where for too \nlong children were treated like small adults and could just be given \nreduced doses of adult products, many essential medical devices used \nextensively by pediatricians are not designed or sized for children. In \nfact, the development of new medical devices suitable for children's \nsmaller and growing bodies can lag 5 or 10 years behind those for \nadults.\n  While children and adults suffer from many of the same diseases and \nconditions, their device needs can vary considerably due to differences \nin size, rates of growth, critical development periods, anatomy, \nphysiological differences such as breathing and heart rate, and \nphysical activity levels. To date, because the pediatric market is so \nsmall and pediatric diseases relatively rare, there has been little \nincentive for device manufacturers to focus their attention on \nchildren. The result has been that pediatric providers must resort to \n``jerry-rigging'' or fashioning make-shift device solutions for \npediatric use. When that is not an option, providers may be forced to \nuse more invasive treatment or less effective therapies.\n  For example, at present, left ventricular assist devices, LVADs, do \nnot exist in the U.S. for children less than 5 years old. An LVAD is a \nmechanical pump that helps a heart that is too weak to pump blood \nthrough the body.\n\n[[Page S11344]]\n\nSo infants and children under 5 years of age who have critical failure \nof their left or right ventricles have to be supported through \nextracorporeal membrane oxygenation, ECMO. An ECMO consists of a pump, \nan artificial lung, a blood warmer and an arterial filter, which is \ninstalled by inserting tubes into large veins or arteries located in \nthe right side of the neck or the groin. While ECMOs can help children \nfor short periods of time, they are problematic. They can cause \ndangerous clots and the blood thinners that prevent these clots may \nlead to internal bleeding. In addition, children must remain bedridden \nwhile using the device.\n  For young children needing to be on a ventilator to assist their \nbreathing, the lack of non-invasive ventilators with masks that \nsuitably fit babies has led to respiratory treatments that are \ninadequate or invasive treatment options such as placing a tube in the \nbaby's throat.\n  Children needing prosthetic heart valves face a disproportionately \nhigh failure rate. Because of the biochemistry of children's growing \nbodies, prosthetic heart valves implanted in children calcify and \ndeteriorate much faster than in adults. Typically, children with a \nheart valve implant who survive to adulthood will need four or five \noperations. Additionally, devices currently available for children must \nbe better able to expand and grow as the child grows.\n  Over the past 2 years, several efforts have been launched to better \nidentify barriers to the development of pediatric devices and to \ngenerate solutions for improving children's access to needed medical \ndevices.\n  Beginning in June 2004, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the \nElizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, the National Organization \nfor Rare Disorders, NORD, the National Association of Children's \nHospitals, and the Advanced Medical Technology Association, AdvaMed, \nhosted a series of stakeholders meetings that yielded recommendations \nfor improving the availability of pediatric devices. In October 2004, \nin response to a directive in the Medical Devices Technical Corrections \nAct of 2004, the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, released a report \nthat identified numerous barriers to the development and approval of \ndevices for children. And in July 2005, the Institute of Medicine, IOM, \nissued a report on the adequacy of postmarket surveillance of pediatric \nmedical devices, as mandated by the Medical Device User Fee and \nModernization Act of 2002. The IOM found significant flaws in safety \nmonitoring and recommended expanding the FDA's ability to require \npostmarket studies of certain products and improving public access to \ninformation about postmarket pediatric studies.\n  Our legislation seeks to address the equally important issues of \npediatric medical device safety and availability. To begin with, the \nbill creates a mechanism to allow the FDA to track the number and types \nof medical devices approved specifically for children or for conditions \nthat occur in children. It also allows the FDA to use adult data to \nsupport a determination of reasonable assurance of effectiveness in \npediatric populations and to extrapolate data between pediatric \nsubpopulations.\n  The market for pediatric medical devices simply isn't what it is for \nadults. Therefore, many device manufacturers have been reluctant to \nmake devices for children. Our bill creates an incentive for companies \nby modifying the existing humanitarian device exemption, HDE, provision \nto allow manufacturers to profit from devices that are specifically \ndesigned to meet a pediatric need.\n  To prevent abuse, our bill reverts to current law which allows no \nprofit on sales of devices that exceed the number estimated to be \nneeded for the approved condition. This provision is modeled after the \nexisting Orphan Products Division designation process. Under no \ncircumstances can there be a profit on sales if the device is used to \ntreat or diagnose diseases or conditions affecting more than 4,000 \nindividuals in the U.S. per year which is the same as under current \nlaw. Already approved adult HDEs upon date of enactment are eligible \nfor the HDE profit modification but only if they are meet the \nconditions of the bill. The lifting of the profit restriction for new \npediatric HDEs sunsets in 2012 and FDA is required to issue a report on \nits impact within 5 years.\n  In order to encourage pediatric medical device research, our bill \nrequires the National Institutes of Health, NIH, to designate a point \nof contact at the agency to help innovators and physicians access \nfunding for pediatric medical device development. It also requires the \nNIH, the FDA, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ, \nto submit a plan for pediatric medical device research that identifies \ngaps in such research and proposes a research agenda for addressing \nthem. In identifying the gaps, the plan can include a survey of \npediatric medical providers regarding unmet pediatric medical device \nneeds.\n  To better foster innovation in the private sector, our bill \nestablishes demonstration grants for non-profit consortia to promote \npediatric device development, including matchmaking between inventors \nand manufacturers and federal resources. These demonstration grants \nwhich are authorized for $6 million annually require that the federal \ngovernment mentor and help manage pediatric device projects through the \ndevelopment process, including product identification, prototype \ndesign, device development and marketing. Under the bill, grantees must \ncoordinate with the NIH's pediatric devices point of contact to \nidentify research issues that require further study and with the FDA to \nhelp facilitate approval of pediatric indications.\n  Finally, in its 2005 report on pediatric medical device safety, the \nIOM found serious flaws in the postmarket safety surveillance of these \ndevices. Our legislation allows FDA to require postmarket studies as a \ncondition of clearance for certain categories of devices. This includes \n``a class II or class III device the failure of which would be \nreasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences or is \nintended to be (1) implanted in the human body for more than one year, \nor (2) a life sustaining or life supporting device used outside a \ndevice user facility.''\n  The legislation also gives the FDA the ability to require studies \nlonger than 3 years with respect to a device that is to have \nsignificant use in pediatric populations if such studies would be \nnecessary to address longer term pediatric questions, such as the \nimpact on growth and development. And, it establishes a publicly \naccessible database of postmarket study commitments that involve \nquestions about device use in pediatric populations.\n  The legislation we are introducing today has been many years in the \nmaking. In addition to the lead republican bill sponsor, Senator \nDeWine, and the public health organizations I mentioned earlier, I \nwould like to thank the Advanced Medical Technology Association and its \nmember company Johnson & Johnson, for their contributions to this \nlegislation. The bill we are introducing today reflects many of the \ncomments and suggestions they provided through the development of this \nlegislation. Several device manufacturers including Respironics, \nSeleon, Breas Medical AB, and Stryker have submitted letters of support \nfor this legislation and I ask unanimous consent that their letters as \nwell as the letters of all organizations supporting this bill be \nentered in the record following my remarks.\n  I look forward to working with patient groups, physicians, industry \nand my colleagues--including the chairman and ranking member of the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senators Enzi and \nKennedy--to move this legislation next year when the committee \nconsiders medical device legislation. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation and I am hopeful that it will become law as soon as \npossible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters and the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Elizabeth Glaser\n\n\n                                    Pediatric AIDS Foundation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 5, 2006.\n\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd and DeWine: On behalf of the Elizabeth \n     Glaser Pediatric AIDS\n\n[[Page S11345]]\n\n     Foundation, I would like to express our strong support for \n     the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of \n     2006. Your leadership on this issue has been outstanding and \n     I applaud your efforts to introduce legislation that will \n     improve the health and well-being of children across the U.S.\n       While cutting-edge research and revolutionary technologies \n     have led to the development of countless innovative medical \n     devices, as science and medicine move forward children are at \n     risk of being left behind. Physical differences such as \n     children's size, anatomy, and growth provide challenges that \n     limit children's access to safe and effective medical \n     devices. With very few devices available for pediatric use, \n     pediatric providers must resort to ``jury-rigging'' or \n     fashioning make-shift device solutions for their patients. \n     When that is not an option, providers may be forced to use \n     more invasive treatment or less effective therapies.\n       This legislation recognizes the urgent need for improved \n     access to medical devices designed specifically for children \n     and provides a comprehensive approach to addressing this \n     issue that includes providing assistance to innovators, \n     streamlining regulatory processes, elevating pediatric device \n     issues at the FDA and NIH, and improving incentives for \n     devices for small markets--while still preserving the ability \n     to ensure the safety of new products.\n       Thank you for your leadership and commitment to this issue. \n     We look forward to working closely with you to ensure that \n     children across the U.S. benefit from this important piece of \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Pamela W. Barnes,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    American Thoracic Society,\n\n                                 New York, NY, September 11, 2006.\n\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: On behalf of the American Thoracic \n     Society, I want to encourage you to continue your efforts to \n     improve access to medical devices for children by introducing \n     legislation this fall.\n       The ATS represents over 13,000 physicians, researchers, and \n     allied health professionals, who are actively engaged in the \n     diagnosis, treatment and research of respiratory disease and \n     critical care medicine. Many of the patients we treat are \n     children suffering from respiratory diseases.\n       You have long been a champion of the health needs of \n     children and you are well aware that children are not \n     ``little people.'' Children have specific health needs and \n     challenges. This is particularly true in the case of medical \n     equipment.\n       The medical device industry has excelled in developing new \n     products that improve the care and well being for patients \n     with respiratory diseases. However, due to the reduced market \n     size, many of these breakthrough respiratory devices are not \n     available to children. Children do not have the same access \n     to ventilators, sleep apnea machines, masks and other \n     respiratory related equipment that adults enjoy. The device \n     access issue for children is a persistent problem in other \n     fields of medicine.\n       The research and regulatory requirements for making \n     pediatric specific devices can be daunting and may outweigh \n     the business potential for entering the pediatric device \n     market.\n       We have worked with our colleagues at the American Academy \n     of Pediatrics and members of your staff to develop a \n     legislative proposal that would remove many of the barriers \n     that exist to binging pediatric specific medical devices \n     products to the market. We strongly encourage you to \n     introduce this legislation this fall.\n       The American Thoracic Society looks forward to working with \n     you to bring this legislative proposal to fruition.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John E. Heffner,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               American Academy of Pediatrics,\n\n                          Elk Grove Village, IL, December 4, 2006.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd and DeWine: On behalf of the 60,000 \n     primary care pediatricians, pediatric medical subspecialists, \n     and surgical specialists of the American Academy of \n     Pediatrics who are committed to the attainment of optimal \n     physical, mental and social health and well-being for all \n     infants, children, adolescents, and young adults, we write \n     today to express our gratitude and support for the \n     ``Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of \n     2006.'' This legislation is an important step towards \n     improving the process for the development of needed pediatric \n     medical devices.\n       Children and adults often suffer from many of the same \n     diseases and conditions, however their medical device needs \n     vary considerable. Children are not just small adults and \n     medical device technologies manufactured for adults often do \n     not fit the needs of children. This problems forces \n     pediatricians to ``jury-rig'' adult medical devices that are \n     often too large in order to make them fit smaller bodies. \n     This practice, however, is not always effective and leaves \n     children without optimal treatment. Additionally, children's \n     device needs vary considerable, due not only to size, but \n     also to different rates of growth, anatomy, physiological \n     differences and physical activity levels.\n       This legislation offers incentives to manufacturers to \n     create needed medical devices specifically designed to meet \n     the needs of pediatric patients and it gives the Food and \n     Drug Administration the authority to require post-market \n     studies to ensure continued efficacy and safety of these \n     devices. The need for pediatric medical devices to treat or \n     diagnose diseases and conditions affecting children is clear. \n     Hence, it is essential that medical devices be manufactured \n     with children's needs in mind.\n       Thank you for your continued commitment to improving the \n     health and well-being of children. The American Academy of \n     Pediatrics looks forward to working with you as this \n     important legislation moves through Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     American Academy of Pediatrics.\n     The American Pediatric Society.\n     The Association of Medical School Pediatric Department \n     Chairs.\n     The Society for Pediatric Research.\n                                  ____\n\n                                 Murrysville, PA, August 16, 2006.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine, Respironics, Inc. is a global medical \n     device company based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We are the \n     worldwide leader at anticipating needs and providing valued \n     solutions to the sleep and respiratory markets. We employ \n     approximately 4,700 employees and have annual sales in excess \n     of one billion dollars.\n       In our business, we often are called upon to work with \n     pediatric patients. Based on this work, it is clear that \n     changes are needed to facilitate an improvement in the \n     availability of diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices \n     for children.\n       Currently, a draft of a bill entitled ``To improve the \n     process for the development of needed pediatric medical \n     devices'' is being circulated among some Senators for \n     discussion. After reviewing this bill, Respironics believes \n     that the changes contemplated by this bill could help improve \n     the availability of medical devices for children. Therefore, \n     Respironics supports enactment of the bill.\n       We hope that you will join Respironics in supporting this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   David P.

Thank you for your ongoing \n     support of children's health and this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Michael Lauk,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             Breas Medical AB,\n\n                               Molnlycke, Sweden, August 17, 2006.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd and DeWine, On behalf of Breas Medical, \n     I would like to thank you for your efforts to expand the \n     availability of medical devices for children. We appreciate \n     your long-standing leadership on behalf of children and \n     welcome your interest in ensuring that they are not left \n     behind when it comes to critical medical advances. Our \n     devices were developed in Europe and are available for home \n     use in the pediatric population there. We have partnered with \n     companies in the United States, including Sleep Services of \n     America, and now have FDA approval for device use in adults. \n     We are seeking approval for the use of our devices in \n     children where there is a great need.\n       While children and adults suffer from many of the same \n     diseases and conditions, their device needs can vary \n     considerably. Cutting-edge research and revolutionary \n     technologies have led to the development of many innovative \n     medical products; however, very few are designed specifically \n     for children. We support your efforts to address the barriers \n     to pediatric device development through legislation, \n     particularly in the following areas:\n       1. Improving the ability of the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) to track how many and what types of \n     devices are approved for children each year;\n       2. Streamlining pediatric device approvals by allowing the \n     extrapolation of adult data to support pediatric indications, \n     as appropriate;\n       3. Encouraging device manufacturers to create products for \n     conditions that affect small numbers of children by removing \n     existing restrictions on profit;\n       4. Improving federal support for pediatric device \n     development by creating a coordinated research agenda and \n     establishing a\n\n[[Page S11346]]\n\n     contact point at the National Institutes of Health to help \n     innovators access existing funding;\n       5. Improving pediatric device availability by establishing \n     demonstration grants to promote pediatric device development, \n     including connecting inventors and manufacturers, product \n     identification, prototype development, and testing;\n       6. Improving post-market safety of pediatric devices by \n     allowing FDA to call for postmarket pediatric studies, \n     establishing a publicly accessible database of postmarket \n     studies, and giving FDA the ability to require studies longer \n     than 3 years if needed to answer longer-term pediatric \n     questions.\n       Thank you for your leadership and commitment to this issue. \n     We look forward to working closely with you toward passage of \n     legislation to improve children's access to medical devices.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ulf Jonsson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Stryker Corporation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 4, 2006.\n     Senator Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: On behalf of Stryker Corporation \n     (``Stryker''), I am pleased to announce our support for your \n     legislation to improve the availability and safety of \n     pediatric medical devices--the Pediatric Medical Device \n     Safety and Improvement Act of 2006. Like you and your \n     colleagues, we want our children to have access to the \n     fullest and best range of possible medical treatments, even \n     if that means doing or inventing something new just for them.\n       We view this as our responsibility both as the leading \n     manufacturer of orthopaedic oncology prostheses in the United \n     States and as a global medical technology company with a \n     significant presence in other medical specialties, including \n     craniofacial deformities such as cleft lip and palate. We \n     take pride in partnering with and sponsoring a range of \n     medical organizations, including one which last year was able \n     to provide free cleft lip surgeries to 8,531 children in 23 \n     countries. The surgery took only about 45 minutes and cost \n     $750 per child, but the corrective surgery changed, in a \n     positive way, forevermore the lives of each and every child \n     and the lives of their families too.\n       We sincerely appreciate your leadership role on children's \n     issues. We take very seriously not only our commitment to \n     children with cancer and craniofacial deformities but also \n     our responsibility to ensure that our devices are safe and \n     effective for use in pediatric patients.\n       As you may know, there has been significant progress over \n     the past two decades in the management of patients with \n     musculoskeletal cancers that has improved both the survival \n     rates and quality of life of afflicted individuals. Twenty \n     years ago, the standard treatment for any primary malignant \n     bone and soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity was amputation \n     of the affected arm or leg. Since that time, Stryker is proud \n     to have partnered with leading pediatric oncology surgeons to \n     develop limb-sparing, surgical solutions, including the \n     implantation of a growing prosthesis that can be elongated to \n     account for children's growth.\n       As with cancer, the treatment of craniofacial deformities \n     is an area in which Stryker has also significantly improved \n     and broadened its range of available medical products and \n     solutions. With continued innovation of new and improved \n     craniomaxillofacial technologies, Stryker hopes to continue \n     to transform the lives of children with craniofacial \n     deformities, such as craniosynostis and cleft lip and palate \n     too.\n       It is our hope that your legislation will further spur the \n     evolution of novel health care solutions for children. The \n     bill's efforts to streamline approvals for devices with \n     pediatric indications, improve incentives for the development \n     of devices for small pediatric populations, and encourage the \n     establishment of non-profit consortia for pediatric device \n     development should be commended.\n       Stryker stands ready to assist you in your drive to \n     stimulate the further development of child-centered medical \n     technologies while closely monitoring the safety of such \n     products after they have entered the market. Thank you again \n     for your leadership on this important issue, and we look \n     forward to working with you to advance your bill as medical \n     device reauthorization legislation moves forward in the 110th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Ed Rozynski,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Global Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 4098\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I join my colleague Senator Dodd to \nintroduce a bill designed to help protect our Nation's children. Simply \nput, our bill would help ensure that our children have access to \nlifesaving medical devices that are designed specifically for their \nsmall bodies. Since the beginning of my career, my No. 1 priority has \nbeen to ensure that our children are healthy and safe. There is no \nother issue more important to me.\n  Today, many medical devices used by pediatricians are not designed \nfor children. That means that doctors have to fit adult sized devices \ninto children's bodies. This is not right. We need to encourage the \ndevelopment of devices that are sized appropriately for children. \nAccording to pediatricians, medical devices sized appropriately for \nchildren are developed sometimes 5 to 10 years behind those for adults. \nThe Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act takes a step \ntowards fixing this problem by providing incentives for manufacturers \nto develop devices for children while also ensuring the safety of new \nproducts once on the market.\n  By introducing this bill, we are saying that we care about our \nchildren. We are saying that we care that children have access to \nlifesaving medical devices that are designed specifically for their \nsmall bodies. We are saying that we know we can do better for our \nchildren and this bill will do just that.\n  We all want to see better health care options for our sick children. \nI believe that with this bill we are taking the first step to resolve a \nserious national health problem. While this legislation obviously will \nnot pass this year, I know that Senator Dodd will continue to work on \nit next year and encourage my Republican colleagues to take a close \nlook at this bill and support it in the 110th Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11348-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11348-S11349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 624--TO HONOR THE MEMORY OF ARNOLD ``RED'' AUERBACH\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Kerry) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 624\n\n       Whereas Arnold ``Red'' Auerbach was born on September 20, \n     1917, in Brooklyn, New York, the son of immigrants from \n     Minsk, Russia;\n       Whereas Red started playing basketball as a public school \n     student in Brooklyn and later became a star guard for Eastern \n     District High School, making all-scholastic second team in \n     his senior year;\n       Whereas Red started his coaching career at St. Albans \n     Preparatory School and Roosevelt High School in Washington, \n     D.C., before serving in the United States Navy from 1943 to \n     1946;\n       Whereas, in 1946, Red began his professional coaching \n     career with the Washington Capitols in the Basketball \n     Association of America (BAA) and led the team to the 1947 and \n     1949 division titles, then joined the Boston Celtics as coach \n     in 1950 after the BAA merged with the National Basketball \n     Association (NBA);\n       Whereas Red's record of success on the basketball court and \n     in the Celtics' front office is unmatched;\n       Whereas, during Red's 16 years coaching the Boston Celtics, \n     the team won 9 NBA championships, with a record 8 in a row;\n       Whereas, when Red retired from coaching in 1966 to become \n     General Manager of the Celtics, he had won more games than \n     any other coach in NBA history with 1,037 victories and had \n     won almost two-thirds of the\n\n[[Page S11349]]\n\n     games he coached over a 20-year NBA coaching career;\n       Whereas during his nearly 57-year tenure with the Celtics \n     as Head Coach, General Manager, Vice Chairman of the Board, \n     and President, Red was the architect of one of the greatest \n     dynasties in the history of professional sports;\n       Whereas Red infused the Celtics organization with the \n     values of teamwork, respect, tenacity, and loyalty, creating \n     a culture known as ``Celtic Pride'' that will be forever \n     associated with the Boston Celtics franchise;\n       Whereas Red's imprint on the Celtics, the NBA, and the game \n     of basketball is permanent and visible today in innovations \n     that Red developed, including the ``sixth man'' role and fast \n     break style of play;\n       Whereas Red was an effective and tireless ambassador for \n     the game of basketball, both in the United States and \n     overseas, conducting clinics, barnstorming with the Celtics, \n     starring in the successful television series ``Red on \n     Roundball'', writing 7 books on basketball, including the \n     influential ``Basketball For The Player, The Coach, and The \n     Fan'', and participating with Celtics great and Hall of Famer \n     Larry Bird in the instructional video, ``Winning \n     Basketball'';\n       Whereas Red received numerous awards and honors in \n     recognition of his extraordinary achievements, such as \n     selection as the NBA Coach of the Year in 1965, induction \n     into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1969, \n     designation as the NBA Executive of the Year in 1980, and \n     selection as ``The Greatest Coach in the History of the NBA'' \n     by the Professional Basketball Writers' Association of \n     America in 1980;\n       Whereas Red's lighting of his cigar in the closing moments \n     of an imminent Celtics' victory became an enduring symbol of \n     success in Boston and around the world;\n       Whereas Red's legacy extends beyond the game of basketball \n     and includes his important contributions to the advancement \n     of a colorblind society through his decisions to draft the \n     NBA's first African-American player, Chuck Cooper, in 1950, \n     hire the first African-American head coach in professional \n     sports, Bill Russell, in 1966, and field the first starting \n     lineup in the NBA consisting entirely of African-American \n     players in 1964; and\n       Whereas the name Red Auerbach will forever be synonymous \n     with winning, intensity, integrity, and charitable causes: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Arnold ``Red'' Auerbach was a basketball genius who \n     embodied the values of creativity, determination, \n     versatility, and commitment to helping the less fortunate;\n       (2) Red Auerbach was a leader in the effort to remove \n     racial barriers and allow merit to prevail in professional \n     sports, through his decisions to draft, hire, and prominently \n     feature African-Americans on the Boston Celtics basketball \n     team; and\n       (3) Red Auerbach's place among the greatest coaches and \n     executives of all time is assured, his contributions to the \n     betterment of society will always endure, and his life \n     exemplifies the very best ideals of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11349-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 625--EXTENDING THE AUTHORITY FOR THE SENATE NATIONAL \n                         SECURITY WORKING GROUP\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Reid) submitted the following \nresolution;

Continued State regulation and licensing \n     of the manufacture, importation, sale, distribution, \n     transportation and storage of alcoholic beverages are clearly \n     in the public interest and are critical to promoting \n     responsible consumption, preventing illegal access to alcohol \n     by persons under 21 years of age from commercial and non-\n     commercial sources, maintaining industry integrity and an \n     orderly marketplace, and furthering effective State tax \n     collection.\n       ``(c) Interagency Coordinating Committee; Annual Report on \n     State Underage Drinking Prevention and Enforcement \n     Activities.--\n       ``(1) Interagency coordinating committee on the prevention \n     of underage drinking.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Secretary, in collaboration with the \n     Federal officials specified in subparagraph (B), shall \n     formally establish and enhance the efforts of the interagency \n     coordinating committee, that began operating in 2004, \n     focusing on underage drinking (referred to in this subsection \n     as the `Committee').\n       ``(B) Other agencies.--The officials referred to in \n     paragraph (1) are the Secretary of Education, the Attorney \n     General, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of \n     the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Surgeon General, \n     the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, the Director of the National Institute on Alcohol \n     Abuse and Alcoholism, the Administrator of the Substance \n     Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Director \n     of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Assistant \n     Secretary for Children and Families, the Director of the \n     Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Administrator of \n     the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the \n     Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention, the Chairman of the Federal Trade \n     Commission, and such other Federal officials as the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services determines to be appropriate.\n       ``(C) Chair.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall serve as the chair of the Committee.\n       ``(D) Duties.--The Committee shall guide policy and program \n     development across the Federal Government with respect to \n     underage drinking, provided, however, that nothing in this \n     section shall be construed as transferring regulatory or \n     program authority from an Agency to the Coordinating \n     Committee.\n       ``(E) Consultations.--The Committee shall actively seek the \n     input of and shall consult with all appropriate and \n     interested parties, including States, public health research \n     and interest groups, foundations, and alcohol beverage \n     industry trade associations and companies.\n       ``(F) Annual report.--\n       ``(i) In general.--The Secretary, on behalf of the \n     Committee, shall annually submit to the Congress a report \n     that summarizes--\n\n       ``(I) all programs and policies of Federal agencies \n     designed to prevent and reduce underage drinking;\n       ``(II) the extent of progress in preventing and reducing \n     underage drinking nationally;\n       ``(III) data that the Secretary shall collect with respect \n     to the information specified in clause (ii); and\n       ``(IV) such other information regarding underage drinking \n     as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.\n\n       ``(ii) Certain information.--The report under clause (i) \n     shall include information on the following:\n\n       ``(I) Patterns and consequences of underage drinking as \n     reported in research and surveys such as, but not limited to \n     Monitoring the Future, Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance \n     System, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, and the \n     Fatality Analysis Reporting System.\n       ``(II) Measures of the availability of alcohol from \n     commercial and non-commercial sources to underage \n     populations.\n       ``(III) Measures of the exposure of underage populations to \n     messages regarding alcohol in advertising and the \n     entertainment media as reported by the Federal Trade \n     Commission.\n       ``(IV) Surveillance data, including information on the \n     onset and prevalence of underage drinking, consumption \n     patterns and the means of underage access.

Mr. President, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription \nDrug Consumer Protection Act represents a too-rare-but-productive \nalliance between Democrats and Republicans and between consumer groups \nand FDA-regulated products manufacturers. This is a significant \nconsumer protection measure. On behalf of my cosponsors, Senators \nDurbin, Harkin, Enzi, Kennedy, and Cornyn, I want to express our \nenthusiasm that the bill will be approved by the Senate tonight.\n  Senator Durbin, Senator Harkin, and I have been working on this \nlegislation for more than 2 years. Our effort has been enhanced by the \nexpertise of Chairman Enzi and Senator Kennedy. More recently, we were \npleased that Senator Cornyn joined our ranks. I must also pay great \ntribute to our lead House sponsor, Representative Chris Cannon.\n  We have consulted broadly with all who have an interest in this \nissue--dietary supplement and nonprescription drug manufacturers, \nconsumer and public health groups, retailers, wholesalers, and, of \ncourse, their lawyers! .\n\n[[Page S11379]]\n\n  We have had meeting after meeting with the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  Wherever possible, we have incorporated provisions to address their \nconcerns.\n  The result--some 24 months and 21 drafts later--is the bill we \nconsider tonight.\n  Some of my colleagues may ask, ``Why is this bill necessary?'' Let me \nanswer that question.\n  Over half our population regularly uses dietary supplements. In fact, \none government survey in 2004 indicated that nearly 60 percent of \nAmericans regularly use dietary supplements to maintain or improve \ntheir healthy lifestyles.\n  Millions more use nonprescription or over-the-counter drugs, such as \naspirin or cold tablets.\n  Although the FDA has a voluntary system to receive reports of \nproblems with dietary supplements, and a mandatory system that covers \nsome OTC drugs, there is no requirement for mandatory reporting for all \nof these products, as there is for prescription drugs and medical \ndevices.\n  I happen to believe supplements are vastly more safe than \nprescription drugs. Indeed, the law which sets out the regulatory \nframework for supplements--the Dietary Supplement Health and Education \nAct, DSHEA, which Senator Harkin and I authored with then-\nRepresentative Bill Richardson, explicitly treats most supplement \nproducts as foods. So, I in no way am suggesting that supplement \nproducts should be treated the same as prescription medications.\n  When we enacted DSHEA, we separated supplements into two categories--\nthose that were on the market in the United States at the time of \nenactment, and those which would be marketed in the future--new dietary \ningredients''. The presumption of DSHEA, which by and large has worked \nwelt, is that products already on the market were being used safely. \nSome of these products, in fact, have been used safely for decades, if \nnot millennia.\n  Those ``grandfathered'' products are not subject to any kind of \npremarket clearance by the FDA.\n  And for good reason.\n  The cost and time alone required to see a product through FDA \napproval would sound the death knell for this industry. Most supplement \nproducts cannot be patented, and there is no incentive for a \nmanufacturer to put its product through this costly and onerous process \nwhen any other manufacturer could benefit equally from the fruits of \nthe research and investment.\n  Finally, we also authorized the FDA to establish good manufacturing \npractice standards, GMPs, for supplements. Unfortunately, some 12 years \nlater, those GMPs are still in the development stage, even though they \nwere first finalized by the Clinton administration.\n  Senator Harkin and I have spent several years trying to free them up, \nbut that is a story for another time.\n  So, in essence, grandfathered products are assumed to be safe. But, \nin case some may not be, we inserted in the law a strong safety \nprovision and we also added an ``imminent hazard'' authority so that \nFDA can immediately remove from marketing a product it suspects to be \nunsafe, no questions asked.\n  In 1994, we had no way of knowing what products would be marketed in \nthe future. But to allay any concerns about the safety of new products, \nwe required all manufacturers to submit information about new \ningredients to the FDA before they are marketed. This NDI provision has \nby and large has worked well. It does allow the FDA premarket review \nfor new products.\n  The reason I mention this is to explain the regulatory framework we \nset up in 1994 to help assure supplements are manufactured and marketed \nsafely. We provided the FDA with an arsenal of tools to enforce the \nlaw. Some they have used, others not.\n  Since that time, the industry has grown. By some estimates, it is a \n$20 billion industry today.\n  Critics of the industry have decried this growth as a negative \ndevelopment, and they have repeatedly said that the industry is \n``unregulated.'' Every time I read that in the paper, or see it on TV, \nI cringe. And I know Senator Harkin does as well. For it is simply \nwrong to suggest the industry is unregulated.\n  Indeed, under DSHEA, we set out a legal definition of what could be \nmarketed as a dietary supplement. We set out a safety standard that \nproducts must have to meet. We allowed the FDA to develop good \nmanufacturing process standards for supplements, and we have repeatedly \nasked the agency to issue those standards so they can be applied to \nproducts as they are being manufactured. We clarified what types of \nclaims could be made about the products and what could not. We said \nthese statements must be truthful and not misleading.\n  All of these requirements are set out in the law and are to be \nadministered by the regulatory agency, the FDA.\n  And while the great, great majority of supplement products are used \nsafely, there have been problems with some products. Some of these \nproblems relate to manufacturing. Some relate to labeling.\n  Critics of supplements attribute any problem which might crop up to \nthe fact that the industry is ``unregulated.''\n  As I have proven, the industry is indeed regulated. It is just not \nregulated in the same fashion as drugs or devices. And it is worth \nhighlighting that this is an industry largely comprised of men and \nwomen of good will, who want to provide the public with health \nenhancing products.\n  Let me hasten to add that we all recognize there are bad actors in \nthe supplement industry, those who break the law and mislead consumers. \nThey should be subject of swift and sure punishment by the FDA and the \nFederal Trade Commission, FTC. Their products should be removed from \nthe marketplace and the full weight of the law should be brought down \non these bad actors.\n\n  It is no secret that the FDA is a woefully underfunded agency, which \nwill be the first to admit that its oversight of the dietary supplement \nindustry is hampered by a lack of resources. For several years, Senator \nHarkin and I have worked to rectify that short-coming, and we are \ngratified that our Utah colleague, Senator Bennett, chairman of the \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, has joined hands with us to \ninfuse some badly needed resources into the FDA.\n  For those who are new to this body, let me mention that in 1994, the \nSenate agreed not once, but twice, to approve DSHEA by unanimous \nconsent. The House also passed this bill by UC. It was not \ncontroversial.\n  Members recognized then, as they should now, that supplements are \nlargely safe. But just to make doubly sure there was adequate \nregulation, we provided the FDA with an arsenal of tools to take action \nagainst problematic products.\n  Then comes ephedra.\n  I do not think it is a constructive exercise to rehash the history of \nephedra. There were mistakes and problems all around in how this \nproduct's safety was evaluated and addressed.\n  But something did stand out: one company had literally hundreds, if \nnot thousands, of reports about products with this product, none of \nwhich were revealed to Federal authorities.\n  There is no question in my mind that the too-long safety evaluation \nof ephedra would have been shortened considerably had we known earlier \nabout these reports.\n  Two years ago, I began discussing with those who are interested in \ndietary supplement regulation whether it would be wise to implement a \nsystem of mandatory adverse event reporting, AER, for those products.\n  While I am reluctant to argue for greater government regulation, in \nthis case it seemed to me a good case could be made that an AER system \nfor supplements could complement the work we achieved with DSHEA and \nimprove the government's ability to address the relatively few problems \nwhich arose.\n  Senator Durbin and Senator Harkin were also having similar thoughts.\n  We joined forces and after much study, discussion and negotiation, \nproduced S. 3546.\n  It may be surprising to many of our colleagues that Senators Hatch, \nDurbin, Harkin, Enzi and Kennedy stand together on this legislation--we \ncome from very different perspectives on dietary supplement regulation.\n  And while we are each very passionate about our views, we are united \nin a common goal: improving the public health.\n  The premise for this bill is simple: mandating a system to provide \nthe\n\n[[Page S11380]]\n\ngovernment with information about serious adverse events associated \nwith the use of two types of FDA-regulated products--dietary \nsupplements and over-the-counter drugs--provides Federal authorities \nwith a better tool to respond to any problems which might occur. This \nis an important public health initiative, which at the same time \nsafeguards access to dietary supplements and over-the-counter drugs.\n  There is currently a voluntary reporting system for supplements and \nsome OTC drugs our bill would replace that with a mandatory system.\n  Senator Harkin and I have a longstanding interest in regulation of \nthese products; stemming back to our work on DSHEA.\n  Senator Durbin, as the former chair of the House Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee, is one of the most knowledgeable senators \nin this body when it comes to FDA matters.\n  Our collaboration on this legislation, along with the distinguished \nchairman and ranking minority member of the committee of jurisdiction, \nthe Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, both of whom were \nintegral to this process, has produced a bill which strikes the right \nbalance between necessary regulation and over-regulation.\n  This is how the new system will work:\n  Manufacturers, packers or distributors of OTC drugs or dietary \nsupplements marketed in the United States must provide to the FDA \nwithin 15 business days any reports of a serious adverse event \nassociated with their products. Accompanying that report must be a copy \nof the label on or within the retail packaging of the supplement.\n  The definition of serious event is proscribed within the legislation. \nIt is either an event that results in a death, life-threatening \nexperience, inpatient hospitalization, persistent or significant \ndisability or incapacity, or congenital anomaly or birth defect... or \nit is an event that requires based on reasonable medical judgment a \nmedical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes I have \njust listed.\n  The bill requires that those reporting must, for one year, provide \nany new medical information related to the serious adverse event \nreport. Again, that information must be submitted within 15 days.\n  In addition, manufacturers, packers and distributors must keep for 6 \nyears records of any adverse event associated with the product, even \nthough there is no reporting requirement unless the event meets the \ndefinition of serious.\n  For over-the-counter drugs, the definition of ``adverse event'' is a \nhealth-related event associated with the use of a nonprescription drug \nthat is adverse, including: an event occurring from an overdose, \nwhether accidental or intentional; an event occurring from abuse of the \ndrug, or withdrawal from the drug; or any failure of pharmacological \naction.\n  For dietary supplements, an ``adverse event'' means any health-\nrelated event associated with the use of a dietary supplement that is \nadverse.\n  The reports will be submitted on the current MedWatch form, unless \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services chooses to modify that form \nat some point.\n  The bill makes clear that State health officials may have access to \nthe adverse event reports, but that the Federal reporting system would \nsupersede any state reporting laws.\n  As we met to develop this legislation, one thing we struggled with \nwas the need to encourage responsible reporting in a way that \nmanufacturers could implement. Some manufacturers indicated to us, for \nexample, that they were not medical experts and could not determine in \nevery case if a reporter's problem met the definition of ``serious'' \ncontained in the bill.\n  To address this, we allow manufacturers to contract with third \nparties to handle the collection of reports. The manufacturers, of \ncourse, would still be ultimately responsible for reporting.\n  Another concern was making certain we appropriately defined the role \nof retailers, who are selling a range of products, some supplements, \nsome OTCs, some not. We determined that retailers would not be \nconsidered reporting parties. If, however, a retailer contracts \nwith manufacturers to distribute ``private label'' products, they may \nauthorize the manufacturer or packer to submit reports, as long as the \nretailer directors to the manufacturer all reports it receives.\n\n  We also wanted to allow the FDA the flexibility to manage this \nprogram. At its request, we made the program self-implementing. We also \nincluded a provision to allow the Secretary, after notice and comment \nfrom interested parties, to establish an exemption to the reporting \nrequirements if there would be no adverse effect on public health.\n  Finally, there are provisions in the bill to impose penalties for not \nreporting, not providing on the product label an address or phone \nnumber for reporting, and for providing a false report.\n  The law will go into effect one year after the date of enactment.\n  Before I close, I want to address some of the concerns that \nrepresentatives of the dietary supplement industry have voiced with \nthis legislation.\n  First, some have suggested there is no need for this legislation from \na public policy or a consumer safety perspective. I disagree.\n  Many have unfairly criticized the industry over media reports that \nsupplements are unsafe because there is no pre-market approval. While I \ncan never support any system that requires premarket approval for \nsupplements, I have become convinced that having a system in place to \nidentify problems quickly can only enhance the authorities we gave the \nFDA with DSHEA.\n  It is also good policy. As the industry matures, we need to separate \nout the good actors from the bad. This is one way to show that this \nindustry is a respectable, mainstream industry. Other major industries, \ne.g. pharmaceuticals, devices, are subject to mandatory AER reporting. \nSupplements are only handled through the voluntary reporting system.\n  And, I disagree with you those who avow there is no consumer safety \nbenefit. Let's take an easy case--where there is a bad batch of a \nproduct. Enabling the FDA to know quickly there is a problem can help \nindustry and the public.\n  Other critics note that the FDA fails to pursue egregious violations \nof DSHEA. They question why this program will help. As I discussed \nearlier, Senator Harkin and I have been working to increase FDA's \nfunding for responsible enforcement of DSHEA. I have also discussed \nthis with the Commissioner-nominee, Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach, whom I \nexpect we will confirm tomorrow.\n  I listened carefully to one of my constituents who opposes this \neffort. He suggested that the FDA's voluntary system, the CAERS system, \nshould be able to handle any reports of problems. Public health experts \nwill agree that a voluntary system is not as good a sentinel as a \nmandatory system. In addition, those who report under the voluntary \nsystem are more likely to be physicians. Encouraging consumers to \nreport to manufacturers through a phone number or address on the \nproduct's label will ensure a more thorough reporting system.\n  Yet another concern I have heard is that this bill has a significant \neconomic impact that has not been studied appropriately. One estimate I \nhave heard is that it could cost tens of millions of dollars a year to \nindustry and consumers.\n  I have to say that these estimates do not seem to be supported by \nother industry representatives who already are instituting reporting \nsystems of their own. During the drafting of this bill, we worked very \nhard to keep requirements to the minimum that would be necessary for a \ncomplete and full reporting of serious adverse events.\n  In addition, I have heard a suggestions that a better alternative to \nthis bill would be a 1-800 number that consumers can use to contact FDA \ndirectly to report complaints. I discussed this idea with my colleagues \nand the FDA and found little support for this idea. What this could do \nis shift onto FDA the majority of reports about product problems. In \nother words, FDA fears that consumers would start phoning the agency, \nrather than the manufacturer, to report complaints for things like \nbroken bottles or tablets, or to answer questions about usage. It is \neasy to see how this could end up relieving manufacturers of some of \ntheir consumer-related responsibilities and shift that onto the FDA.\n  Let me hasten to add that I understand the motivation behind these \nconcerns. I will keep a close watch on this\n\n[[Page S11381]]\n\nnew program as it is implemented, and pledge to reexamine it should \nproblems of implementation arise.\n  In closing, I want to thank my colleagues for the spirit of \ncollaboration which led to development of this legislation. In \nparticular, I want to thank Senator Durbin for his leadership on this \nissue. While we may not have always agreed on every provision, we did \nforge a bill on which we can agree. His top-notch staffer, now a \ndistinguished professor, Krista Donahue, worked with us every step of \nthe way.\n  Senator Harkin is a steadfast supporter of the dietary supplement \nindustry, and his guidance undoubtedly made this bill a better product. \nWe benefitted greatly from the counsel of his legislative director, Pam \nSmith, and before her, Peter Reinecke, his former chief of staff. Peter \nwas instrumental in drafting DSHEA as well.\n  Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy, both long-time experts in food and \ndrug law, have both been most generous in their time and in moving the \nprocess forward. Chairman Enzi's FDA expert, Amy Muhlberg, helped guide \nus through this process and was key in our success. Senator Kennedy's \nstaffer, David Dorsey, once a top FDA, lawyer, was instrumental in the \ndrafting and made countless invaluable suggestions.\n  I will take this opportunity to thank my own staff--Patti DeLoatche, \nwho always stood for common sense and reason during heated arguments, \nthe elusive Bruce Artim, now a top staffer at Eli Lilley, and of \ncourse, Patricia Knight, who helped draft DSHEA with me as well.\n  Finally, we couldn't have done it without Liz King and Stacey Kern-\nScheerer in Legislative Counsel, who patiently produced the 21 drafts \nleading to the bill today.\n  I must also note the groups that also support the bill--the \nConsumer's Union, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the \nConsumer Healthcare Products Association, the Natural Products \nAssociation, the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the American Herbal \nProducts Association, and finally and most importantly, the Utah \nNatural Products Association.\n  That these groups, not often united--at least on this subject--can \nrally around our bill today is a testament to good policy, good \npolitics, and a surviving bipartisan spirit.\n  It is my hope the Senate will give swift approval to this bipartisan \nmeasure and that the House will shortly thereafter do the same.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, the Senate adopted a bipartisan \nbill that provides the Food and Drug Administration with the tools it \nneeds to help monitor the safety of dietary supplements.\n  Dietary supplements are safely consumed by millions of Americans \nevery day. I myself take a multivitamin every morning. The vast \nmajority of these supplements do not result in harm to the consumer.\n  Unfortunately, this is not the case for all supplements. Some cause \ndangerous health problems: increased blood pressure, heart attack, \nstroke, seizures and liver failure. Ephedra is the most well-known \namong these.\n  Under the Dietary Supplement Heath and Education Act, DSHEA, which \npassed in 1994, supplement manufacturers are not required to prove \ntheir products are safe or effective before they are marketed: \nsupplements are assumed safe until proven unsafe.\n  The bill we passed today will help the FDA identify products that may \nbe causing harm to consumers.\n  In 2000, the FDA contracted with the Institute of Medicine at the \nNational Academies of Science to develop a scientific framework for the \nevaluation of dietary supplements under DSHEA.\n  IOM's proposals flowed from their first and essential recommendation \nto Congress: Make adverse event reporting mandatory. They asserted that \n``adverse event reports have considerable strength as potential warning \nsignals of problems requiring attention, making monitoring by the FDA \nworthwhile.''\n  Unfortunately, under current law, reporting is voluntary and it is \nnot working. The Office of the Inspector General at the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, HHS, estimated in 2001 that less than 1 \npercent of all adverse events associated with dietary supplements are \nreported to the FDA.\n  My own experience reinforces the need for a mandatory system of \nreporting. Metabolife told the FDA in February of 1999 that, \n``Metabolife has never been made aware of any adverse health events by \nconsumers of its products. Metabolife has never received a notice from \na consumer that any serious adverse health event has occurred because \nof ingestion of Metabolife 356.''\n  The Justice Department began investigating the truthfulness of that \nstatement and found that Metabolife was holding 16,500 adverse event \nreports, including almost 2,000 significant cardiac, neurological and \npsychiatric reports.\n  The Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection \nAct will prevent this scenario from ever happening again. Manufacturers \nof over-the-counter drugs and dietary supplements will be required to \nsend these reports to the FDA.\n  I would like to thank Senators Hatch, Harkin, Enzi and Kennedy, who \nhave worked with me for the last 3 years on this important issue.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-\nreported amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nthat any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 4093, introduced earlier \ntoday by Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 4093) to amend the Farm Security and Rural \n     Investment Act of 2002 to extend a suspension of limitation \n     on the period for which certain borrowers are eligible for \n     guaranteed assistance.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I introduced along with several \ncolleagues legislation that will extend the current waiver of the 15-\nyear term limit on USDA guaranteed loans which will expire on December \n31, 2006. Starting January 1, 2007, many producers nationwide will \nbecome ineligible for Farm Service Agency, FSA, guaranteed loans. These \nloan guarantees enable producers to obtain credit to purchase farmland, \nlivestock, feed, seed, farm equipment, and fuel essential to their \nfarming operations. Without the Government guarantee many farmers will \nbe unable to secure operating credit and will be forced out of their \nlivelihood.\n  The FSA guarantee loan allows lenders to make agricultural credit \navailable to farmers who may not meet the lenders' normal underwriting \ncriteria. Borrowers apply for a guaranteed loan through an agricultural \nlender who then secures a guarantee from FSA. The guarantee covers up \nto 95 percent of the loss to the lender of principal and interest on a \nloan in case of default. Admirably, default rates on these loans are \nvery low at 1.4 percent.\n  While the 15-year limit on eligibility is intended to graduate \nproducers to commercial credit, we have found that in many cases \nproducers simply are unable to meet lenders' standards without the \nguarantee. Term limits on guaranteed loans do not adequately take into \nconsideration economic and weather conditions. In recent years, many of \nAmerica's producers have suffered through high energy costs, droughts \nand hurricanes. Without this legislation, producers who have suffered \nthrough bad years due to these weather and economic conditions will no \nlonger be eligible for loan guarantees they need to continue their \noperations.\n  Our bill will extend the term limit waiver until September 30, 2007. \nThis step will help farmers and ranchers nationwide and allow Congress \nto address term limits on FSA guaranteed loans in the coming farm bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelated to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 613\n\n       Whereas William Wilberforce, born August 25, 1759, used his \n     position as a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons to \n     stop the slave trade in Great Britain, proclaiming, ``I \n     [will] never rest until I have effected [slavery's] \n     abolition.'';\n       Whereas William Wilberforce displayed remarkable \n     perserverance in answering the call of social justice and \n     fought the slave trade in Great Britain and slavery itself \n     for 46 years, despite the national and personal financial \n     interests aligned against him, the public criticism and \n     slander he endured, and the stress and pain placed on his \n     family;\n       Whereas William Wilberforce rested his political career on \n     the ideals of stewardship, respect for the rights of others, \n     advancing the views of others, and promoting the happiness of \n     others, and proclaimed, ``Let every one . . . regulate his \n     conduct by the golden rule . . . and the path of duty will be \n     clear before him.'';\n       Whereas William Wilberforce defended the rights of slaves \n     who had no voice in the legislature of Great Britain and \n     committed himself to sweeping social reform in his country;\n       Whereas William Wilberforce joined with Sir Thomas Fowell \n     Buxton, Thomas Clarkson, Olaudah Equiano, Harriet Martineau, \n     Hannah More, and other great abolitionists in Great Britain;\n       Whereas William Wilberforce inspired abolitionists in the \n     United States, including William Lloyd Garrison, John \n     Greenleaf Whittier, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, \n     and Harriet Beecher Stowe;\n       Whereas William Wilberforce also influenced John Quincy \n     Adams, James Monroe, John Jay, Abraham Lincoln, and Benjamin \n     Franklin, along with many leaders in the African-American \n     community, among them William Wells Brown, Paul Cuffe, and \n     Benjamin Hughes;\n       Whereas Frederick Douglass said, ``it was the faithful, \n     persistent and enduring enthusiasm of . . . William \n     Wilberforce . . . and [his] noble co-workers, that finally \n     thawed the British heart into sympathy for the slave, and \n     moved the strong arm of the government in mercy to put an end \n     to his bondage.''; and\n       Whereas March 25, 2007 marks the 200th anniversary of the \n     abolition of the slave trade in Great Britain: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the life and work of William Wilberforce; and\n       (2) commemorates the 200th anniversary of the abolition of \n     the slave trade in Great Britain and its impact on similar \n     efforts in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11385-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SUPPORTING THE STATE OF NEW YORK TO DEVELOP THE NATIONAL PURPLE HEART \n                             HALL OF HONOR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1751) to amend title 18, United States Code, \n     to protect judges, prosecutors, witnesses, victims, and their \n     family members, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been a difficult struggle to pass a \nmeasure to improve court security. It should not have been. This bill \nshould have been enacted months ago with bipartisan support. I thank \nthe Democratic leader, Senator Reid, the Senate Judiciary chairman, \nSenator Specter, and the assistant Democratic leader, Senator Durbin, \nfor their leadership and hard work in finally passing the Court \nSecurity improvement Act of 2006, to increase protections for the \ndedicated women and men throughout the Judiciary in this country.\n  I hope the House of Representatives will take up and pass this \nmeasure. By so doing, they can bring to fruition before the end of this \nCongress our efforts to provide increased security, an effort that \ngained new urgency after the tragedy that befell Judge Joan Lefkow of \nChicago. She is the Federal judge whose mother and husband were \nmurdered in their home. As we heard in her courageous testimony in May \n2005 before the Judiciary Committee, this tragedy provided a terrible \nreminder not only of the vulnerable position of our judges and their \nfamilies, but of the critical importance of protecting judges both \nwhere they work and where they and their families live. The shooting \nlast summer of a State judge in Nevada provided another terrible \nreminder of the vulnerable position of our Nation's State and Federal \njudges. We cannot tolerate or excuse or justify violence or the threat \nof violence against judges.\n  It is most unfortunate that some in this country have chosen to use \ndangerous and irresponsible rhetoric when talking about judges, \ncomparing judges to terrorists and threatening judges with punishment \nfor decisions they do not like. This rhetoric can only foster \nunacceptable violence against judges and it must stop, for the sake of \nour judges and the independence of the judiciary. Judicial fairness and \nindependence are essential if we are to maintain our freedoms. Let no \none say things that might bring about further threats against our \njudges. We ought to be protecting them physically and institutionally. \nEasy rhetorical pot shots put judges in real danger.\n  The bill that passes today is a consensus, bipartisan bill. I hope it \nis a model for what we can achieve with bipartisan cooperation in the \n110th Congress. Its core provisions, which previously passed the Senate \nin June as part of the managers' package of the John Warner National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007, S. 2766, come from S. \n1968, the streamlined Court Security Improvement Act of 2005, CSIA, \nwhich Chairman Specter and I introduced last November.\n  The bill responds to requests by the Federal judiciary for a greater \nvoice in working with the United States Marshals Service to determine \ntheir security needs. It enacts new criminal penalties for the misuse \nof restricted personal information to harm or threaten to harm Federal \njudges, their families or other individuals performing official duties. \nIt enacts criminal penalties for threatening Federal judges and Federal \nlaw enforcement officials by the malicious filing of false liens, and \nprovides increased protections for witnesses. The bill also contains \nprovisions making available to states new resources to improve security \nfor State and local court systems as well as providing additional \nprotections for law enforcement officers. In particular, I thank \nChairman Specter for agreeing to include in the bill an extension of \nlife insurance benefits to bankruptcy, magistrate and territorial \njudges.\n  Finally, the bill contains provisions that have passed the Senate \nseveral\n\n[[Page S11387]]\n\ntimes extending and expanding to family members the authority of the \nJudicial Conference to redact certain information from a Federal \njudge's mandatory financial disclosure. This expired redaction \nauthority was used in circumstances in which the release of the \ninformation could endanger the filer or the filer's family. I hope that \nthe House of Representatives finally takes up and passes this much \nneeded extension and expansion of redaction authority.\n  We owe it to our judges to better protect them and their families \nfrom violence and to ensure they have the peace of mind necessary to do \ntheir vital and difficult jobs.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Specter \nsubstitute amendment that is at the desk be agreed to; that the bill, \nas amended, be read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Murray\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Marine SGT \nJeremy E. Murray, from Atwater, OH. On November 16, 2005, Sergeant \nMurray was killed when a roadside bomb hit his military vehicle in \nIraq. He is survived by his wife Megan and his young son, Ian. Twenty-\neight-year-old Sergeant Murray was also the devoted son of Harold and \nPam Murray, and the brother of Lisa Murray.\n  Jeremy lived a life that was a model of commitment and bravery. At \nthe time of his death, Jeremy was serving his third tour of duty in \nIraq. But before leaving, this is what he told his father Harold:\n\n       If I don't come home, Dad, you know I died proudly. I died \n     for what I wanted to do. This is my lifetime dream.\n\n  Serving his Nation in the military was, indeed, the childhood dream \nof SGT Jeremy Murray--something that had been ingrained in him at a \nyoung age through a love of the outdoors. Born on February 5, 1978, \nJeremy was only 2 years old when his father started taking him into the \nwoods. From there, he never once looked back.\n  Jeremy's strong appreciation for and love of the outdoors translated \ninto a childhood obsession with all things Daniel Boone--who Jeremy \nbelieved was the greatest hunter of all time. Indeed, Jeremy wanted to \nbe Daniel Boone.\n  His parents made him a Daniel Boone hunting outfit, complete with a \nraccoon skin cap and a rabbit pelt vest. A family friend contributed by \nmaking Jeremy a metal Bowie knife. And, his dad even made a replica \nflintlock for him.\n  Jeremy loved his Daniel Boone outfit. But, when he outgrew it, he \nfound another uniform waiting for him--military fatigues. And according \nto his father, Jeremy ``never was out of those. Never.''\n  Jeremy's mother remembers that her son grew up talking constantly \nabout joining the military. He joined the Army after graduating from \nWaterloo High School in 1996. After his enlistment ended, Jeremy came \nhome and worked for awhile. But, only a few months later, he joined the \nMarines. It was simply the career Jeremy was meant to have. According \nto his father, Jeremy ``wasn't happy with anything but the military.''\n  Jeremy's mother agrees. ``He really joined [the military] at birth,'' \nshe said. Pam also remembers how ready her son was for the military. \nShe tells the following story:\n\n       [Jeremy] was so prepared for military service that when he \n     entered boot camp, he broke down a rifle faster than his \n     drill sergeant. The drill sergeant didn't like that!\n\n  Jeremy made the military his career, and he gave it his all. He was \nserving his third tour of duty in Iraq when he died. SGT John McLemore \nwas a friend of Jeremy's who served with him in Iraq. This is what John \nhad to say about Jeremy's service overseas:\n\n       He was an uncompromising legend. We live in a world today \n     where people compromise for their own comfort and give in \n     just to accommodate other people. My friend Jeremy didn't do \n     that. When we were in Iraq, he was by far the most competent \n     leader for our section. He didn't hesitate to take the lead, \n     and he definitely went out there and put himself directly in \n     the line of fire on every patrol. . . . He knew what he had \n     to do, and he got out there and did it. That's what makes him \n     a legend. He'll be remembered forever.\n\n  Indeed, Jeremy served his country with heroic bravery. His leadership \nhas earned him more awards than I could name here, but they include the \nPurple Heart, a Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal with a Gold \nStar for heroic achievement.\n  But Jeremy was much more than a dedicated marine. He was also a \ndevoted husband, father, son, and brother, who loved his family deeply. \nHis 10-\n\n[[Page S11397]]\n\nyear-old niece Torey showed her love by writing Jeremy the following in \na letter, ``I know he's a hero in my heart. I will always miss you.'' \nAnd his sister Lisa wrote: Jeremy was my hero all my life. I looked up \nto him my whole life and miss him greatly every day.\n  Jeremy's wife Megan was simply his soul mate. And his mother \nremembers that Jeremy's son Ian could always make him laugh. Perhaps \nJeremy's love for his wife and son is best captured in a picture that \nwas displayed at his funeral. In it, he could not stop gazing at Ian, \nwho was then a newborn, and his wife Megan--not even to look at the \ncamera. You can just see the deep devotion he felt for them.\n  Jeremy's funeral was held at his old high school on a Monday when it \nwas already closed for the first day of hunting season--fitting, \nconsidering Jeremy's great love for the outdoors. Along with her class, \nhis niece Torey decorated the cafeteria and auditorium with colored \nflags and yellow ribbons. On that day, Jeremy's dad took time to watch \nthe tree line of the woods he had once scouted with Jeremy. He said:\n\n       I told my wife if any deer came up, I would pull up a chair \n     beside him and watch it. Jeremy would have liked that.\n\n  Jeremy's dad presided over his son's funeral. In his eulogy, he \nremembered both Jeremy's strong faith and his love of the outdoors. He \nsaid:\n\n       I know right now, as he's standing at the right hand of \n     God, he's looking down on his grandfather and me because \n     today is the first day of hunting season, and we're not out. \n     He's gonna give me heck for that next time I see him.\n\n  Jeremy was a young husband and father with a bright future ahead of \nhim. He was a shining example of not only a marine but also of a human \nbeing. He will always be remembered.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep the family of SGT Jeremy Murray \nin our thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                        SERGEANT JEREMY M. HODGE\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fallen hero, Army SGT \nJeremy Michael Hodge from Rushsylvania, OH. On October 5, 2005, \nSergeant Hodge died in Iraq in a suicide bomber attack. He was just 20 \nyears old.\n  As a member of the National Guard, Jeremy was an unselfish, \nhardworking leader, whose life exemplified the values of honor and \nduty. On dangerous missions, he was always the one wanting to take the \nlead. Growing up in Rushsylvania--a small Ohio village of 530 \nresidents--Jeremy became known as a young man who would drop whatever \nhe was doing to help with community tasks, like setting up for events \nat the school gym.\n  A sports enthusiast, he became a member of the baseball, football, \nand track-and-field teams at Ridgemont High School. A well-rounded \nstudent with many talents, he was also a member of the school choir and \nperformed in musicals.\n  Principal Chad Cunningham remembers that Jeremy was the type of \nperson who was always offering to help his fellow students and the \nschool faculty. This is what he said about him:\n\n       Jeremy's positive outlook was evident in all he did. If \n     Jeremy was sitting on the bench, he wasn't pouting. He was \n     cheering on his teammates and helping encourage them.\n\n  Jeremy graduated from high school in 2003, and soon after the \nNational Guard. By joining the military, he was following in family \nfootsteps. His father, Mike, was an Air Force veteran, and Jeremy had \nbeen born on an Air Force Base in Japan.\n  In Iraq, Jeremy's mission was to patrol the streets of Baghdad to \nfind and destroy roadside bombs. According to military officials, the \nlives of three servicemen are saved by every bomb rendered useless. \nCommand Sergeant Major Paul Trickett served with Jeremy in Iraq. He \nsaid that ``by my count, Jeremy saved the lives of 225 other soldiers. \nHe put himself in the line of danger to save others. To me, that's a \nhero.''\n  At Jeremy's funeral, Sergeant Major Trickett also spoke proudly of \nserving with Jeremy, and of the young soldier's bravery:\n\n       He volunteered to lead. He wanted to lead--he wanted to be \n     out front. Without hesitation, he took on the challenge to \n     protect his brothers in arms.\n\n  Jeremy's service to our Nation did not go unnoticed. A Specialist at \nthe time of his death, the Army honored him with a posthumous promotion \nto Sergeant. Jeremy's bravery also earned him the Purple Heart, the \nBronze Star, and the Ohio Distinguished Service Medal.\n  ``He was a fighter, all right,'' Jeremy's father said. ``Whatever he \ndid, he did full bore--non-stop since almost the day he was born.''\n  Jeremy was a young man with a bright future before him. He had hoped \nto go to college and play football again after serving in Iraq. He also \nhad dreams of one day becoming a NASCAR driver.\n  Scott Gillfillan was Jeremy's high school baseball coach, and his son \nVince grew up alongside Jeremy. Scott remembers that Jeremy was a \n``well-liked kid who didn't have a bad bone in his body. He had the \nbiggest heart you'd want to know.''\n  Living only 7 miles apart, Jeremy and Vince played sports together \nand grew as close as brothers. Scott coached them both in baseball and \nremembers that they never came straight home after practice. He said, \n``They'd stay over at the field, going at it over and over until they \ngot it right. That's what Jeremy was about.''\n  Vince graduated from high school and enlisted in the Army just one \nyear before Jeremy did. And on the day Jeremy died, Vince was only one \nvehicle behind him in the convoy. As Scott said:\n\n       There they were, together, in the same unit, in the same \n     convoy. Now, we're just trying to work through this together. \n     They were practically brothers. How do you get over something \n     like that? I don't think you ever do.\n\n  Vince spoke the following words at Jeremy's funeral:\n\n       Jeremy would say how cool it would be to grow up together, \n     to go to school together, join the Army, serve in Iraq \n     together, and then come back home together. What we need to \n     do right now is help each other because I'm sure Jeremy is in \n     Heaven right now probably racing Dale Earnhardt.\n\n  Jeremy Hodge was a true patriot. Always willing to be on the front \nlines, he displayed courage and tenacity. He was also loved and deeply \nrespected by all who knew him. More than 400 hundred family members, \nfriends, and soldiers attended his memorial service at Rushsylvania \nChurch of Christ. After the funeral, more than 100 vehicles led by a \ncamouflage humvee proceeded through the village to the Rushsylvania \nCemetery.\n  Three vehicles from the front, Jeremy's father drove his son's 1999 \nDodge Ram 1500 four-wheel drive pickup truck. It was adorned with both \na U.S. flag and a flag for NASCAR driver Mark Martin.\n  Jeremy will always be remembered as an all-American boy who loved \nfour-wheeling, motorcycles, hunting and fishing, watching NASCAR and \nrooting for Mark Martin. He dearly loved his family and made his \nparents, family, and community very proud. He had a big heart was \ntremendously dedicated to his family, friends, and country.\n  My wife Fran and I will continue to keep Jeremy's father Mike; his \nmother and step-father Michelle and Steve Norris, and his sisters \nAlyssa, Nicole, and Denise in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                    Private First Class Adam Johnson\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fallen soldier--Army \nPFC Adam Robert Johnson. Private First Class Johnson, from Clayton, OH, \ndied on October 31, 2005, when a roadside bomb detonated near his \nmilitary vehicle in Iraq. Three other members of his unit--the 101st \nAirborne--also lost their lives that day. Private First Class Johnson \nwas 22 years old and had been in Iraq for just 5 weeks.\n  A.J.--as he was known to family and friends--was an outgoing and \noptimistic young man, who always had a smile on his face. His positive \nattitude and love for others will be missed by all who knew him.\n  Growing up, A.J. loved nothing more than playing soccer. It was his \npassion. He became a star player for Northmont High School's varsity \nteam. As a senior, his hard work and dedication earned him the starting \ngoalkeeper position. He had an extraordinarily successful season. Not \nonly was he selected as the Goalie of the Year for the Greater Miami \nValley Conference, but he was also selected as the overall Player of \nthe Year. A.J. was also honored as a student-athlete when he was \nselected as a first-team pick on the Miami Valley Scholastic Soccer \nCoaches Association All-Dayton North Team.\n\n[[Page S11398]]\n\n  A.J. enjoyed sharing his passion for soccer with others. After \ngraduating from Northmont in 2001, he volunteered as an assistant coach \nfor the next two years, helping the players who came after him become \nbetter athletes and team members.\n  A.J. is deeply missed by those who knew him through soccer. Mark \nSpirk, Northmont's head coach, watched A.J. grow up playing soccer. He \nremembers how much A.J. enjoyed working with others. ``He had helped \nout every year at our Northmont soccer camp, working with the younger \nkids,'' he recalls. ``He worked hard at that just like he had as a \nplayer.''\n  When A.J. joined the Army, he brought with him that same dedication \nand work ethic that had made him a star soccer player. Joining the Army \nwas something he had always dreamed of doing. He enlisted without \ntelling his parents. Afterward, he told his father Randy Johnson that \nthis was what he had always wanted to do. ``He didn't want me to talk \nhim out of it,'' Randy said. ``He said it was something he always \nwanted to do.'' Randy said he was proud of his son, who was always \nsmiling and showing a positive attitude.\n  A.J.'s mother Fran recalls that ``we all supported Adam's decision, \neven though, especially for me, it was very, very hard to do. I am \nproud of the man he became.''\n  After joining the Army, A.J. was stationed at Fort Campbell in \nKentucky. He was deployed to Iraq in September 2005. He carried his \npositive spirit with him into the Army. According to a sergeant who was \nhis team leader in Iraq, A.J. fit right in ``with his easygoing \npersonality, sense of humor, and never-quit attitude.''\n  The members of A.J.'s community have rallied around his family. Five \nhundred mourners attended his funeral at the Salem Church of God, and \nthe procession from the church to the cemetery stretched a mile long. \nAlong the way, an elementary school class and its teacher stood quietly \nto pay their silent respect, and cars pulled over. Some motorists got \nout and covered their hearts.\n  Army BG John R. Bartley spoke at A.J.'s funeral, saying that the \nyoung soldier was an American hero who understood the meaning of duty, \nhonor, and country. ``All of us in uniform share your sorrow,'' he \nsaid. ``We, too, are grieving.''\n  Displayed at A.J.'s funeral, in a wooden box before his flag-draped \ncoffin, were the ribbons and medals he had earned. They included a \nCombat Infantry Badge, a Bronze Star, and a Purple Heart.\n  Indeed, A.J. is missed by his entire community. Abbie Harrison, who--\nalong with her parents, Doug and Theresa, and her sister Natalie--were \nlike a ``second family'' to A.J. Abbie wrote the following in his \nmemory on an Internet tribute Web site:\n\n       A.J. was my best friend. We shared so many happy memories. \n     I miss him so much, and I know we will all see him again. He \n     brought out the best in everyone, and he loved with all his \n     heart. I wish I could be at least half the person he was. I \n     will never forget him, and he will always be in my heart.\n\n  A.J.'s high school observed a school-wide moment of silence to honor \nhis memory. Robin Spiller, the district's athletic director and an \nassistant principal at the high school, had A.J.'s name added to a \nmemorial outside the high school stadium. It is a memorial honoring all \nof the community's fallen servicemembers from past wars. ``It's \nimpacted us all.'' she said.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks with the words of A.J.'s former \nroommate, Bryan, from Englewood, OH. This is what he said:\n\n       Adam--we all miss you dearly. You're the truest American \n     Hero. Thank you and all the soldiers who have paid ``the \n     ultimate price'' for our freedom. You will live forever in \n     the hearts and minds of all of your friends. We all have lots \n     of great stories to tell to remember you by . . . and we will \n     never forget.\n\n  Indeed, we will never forget Army PFC Adam Johnson. He was a good \nsoldier and a young man who exemplified a great spirit of caring and \nsacrifice.\n  My wife Fran and I keep his parents Randy and Fran, his brothers \nMatthew, Brad, and Ryan, and his grandparents Robert and Lois Marcus in \nour thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                       Lance Corporal Joseph Nice\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor a young man who lost his life in \nservice of our Nation. LCpl Joseph Nice, from Newark, OH, was killed by \nenemy fire during Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was serving in the 3rd \nBattalion, 7th Marines, 1st Division, Expeditionary Force, Marines Air \nCorps Ground Combat division at Twenty-nine Palms, CA. He was 19 years \nold.\n  In the pursuit of his dream and in the footsteps of his relatives, \nJoseph Nice carved out a path for himself while serving the country he \nloved. Left to cherish his memory are his father Lloyd Nice III, his \nmother Marilyn Nice, his five sisters, his two brothers, his \ngrandparents, and his aunts and uncles.\n  Today, we remember Joseph Nice--who was know as ``Joey'' to his \nfamily and friends. Joey was born in Newark on April 6, 1985. As a \nyoung boy, he was interested in football, soccer, baseball, cars, and \nthe military. As a young boy, Joey loved to ask his grandfather about \nhis own service in the Marines. From a very early age, Joey was \ninterested in serving his country.\n  In 1998, Joey and his five siblings moved to Oklahoma for a time. \nThere, Joey attended Choctaw High School, where he was well liked and \ninvolved in many activities. He was a straight-A student, worked in the \nschool library, played saxophone in the band, and taught himself the \ndrums. He played on the soccer team and loved to draw landscapes.\n  Joey was also known as a great friend. Teammate and fellow band \nmember Cody Largent had this to say about Joey: ``If you had a problem, \nhe was always there for you. He was very brave, and I'm proud that he \nwas my best friend.'' Joey used to tell Cody that he wanted to be a \nlawyer so that he could help his friends get out of trouble in the \nfuture.\n  Joey was very close to his grandmother Mary. One of her favorite \nmemories of Joey is how she would joke with her grandson about how much \ntime he spent in the bathroom, making sure he looked ``just so.'' She \nremembers his polite and easy-going nature--and his cooking talents.\n  When Joey decided to enlist after high school, it did not surprise \nanyone. After all, he had made his intentions known since he was a \nlittle boy. High school classmates recall that while watching coverage \nof Operation Iraqi Freedom at school, Joey would tell them that he \ncouldn't wait to fight for his country.\n  Joey loved being a marine--something his grandmother quickly noticed: \n``The Marines were his life,'' she said. ``If you didn't know any \nbetter, you'd think he'd been in the Marines for 30 or 40 years. That's \nhow devoted he was.''\n  Joey was, indeed, a devoted marine, and he did not shy away from \nserving in Iraq. His Aunt Susan remembers a phone conversation she had \nwith her nephew before he left. Joey told her:\n\n       I know it's not easy. I know I might not make it back. But, \n     I want to do this for you, our family, and our country.\n\n  Joey wanted to make his family proud--and he did. His grandmother \ndescribed the feeling she got whenever she saw her grandson--it made \nher chest swell ``200 miles.''\n  Joey was stationed near Baghdad, and although he was on the other \nside of the world, he made sure to keep in touch with his family at \nhome. He called his grandfather, Lloyd Nice, Jr., to tell him how happy \nhe was to have qualified for the military law program. Joey also made \nsure to call his grandmother every few weeks, and the two were making \nplans for his return home. Joey couldn't wait to buy a car and have a \nbelated birthday celebration.\n  Tragically, Joey did not celebrate his birthday with his family. He \nwas killed by an enemy sniper on August 4, 2004, in Al Anbar Province, \nIraq.\n  At the memorial service held in his honor, friends and family \nremembered Joey as a patriot--a man who put his country ahead of \nhimself. They remembered that he was quick to smile and eager to raise \nthe spirits of all those around him. They remembered a young man full \nof love for his family and for his country. As Reverend Robert Knox \nsaid so well at a ceremony for Joey at the American Legion Post 85, ``A \nlot of people say they believe in our Nation. This man proved he did.''\n  LCpl Joseph Nice was an extraordinary marine, but more than that, he \nwas an extraordinary person. Though he is truly missed, I know that \nJoey will live on in the hearts and minds of all those who had the \nprivilege of knowing him.\n\n[[Page S11399]]\n\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep the family of Marine LCpl Joseph \nNice in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                 Master Sergeant Joseph J. Andres, Jr.\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army MSG Joseph J. \nAndres, Jr., of Seven Hills, OH. On December 24, 2005, Master Sergeant \nAndres was wounded when his Special Operations Unit came under small \narms fire in Iraq. He died later that day. He was 34 years old.\n  Joe, as he was known by family and friends, was a selfless man, \ndeeply devoted to his family, friends, and community. Joe was always \nthere for someone who needed him, whether it was to talk over the big \nissues of life or simply to fix a friend's computer.\n  Joe's generosity was truly exceptional and rare. Once, shortly after \nbuying his first house, he insisted that a comrade's family stay there \nwhile closing on their own home. According to Joe, it was they who \nwould be doing him a favor. This is simply the kind of man Joe was--he \nalways wanted to lend a hand to those who needed it.\n  Joe grew up surrounded by family and friends. He was the only boy in \na family with five sisters. He liked being outdoors, fishing with \nfriends and riding his dirt bike through the woods. His father, Joseph, \nSr., said that his son was ``adventurous,'' but also responsible. Joe \nrode dirt bikes, skateboarded, and snowboarded, but he was also on the \nhonor roll, played drums in the symphony orchestra, wrestled, and ran \ntrack. He was funloving but also hard working.\n  Tim Vojta had been a friend of Joe's since third grade and ran track \nwith him at Padua Franciscan High School. Tim remembers his friend's \nstrong work ethic. He said that Joe ``wasn't the fastest guy on the \nteam, but he was the one who worked hard and was really dedicated.'' \nAccording to Tim, Joe displayed a capacity for commitment and \nenthusiasm as a child that followed him throughout life.\n  It was these qualities of commitment and enthusiasm that made Joe \nsuch an excellent serviceman. After graduating from high school in \n1989, he studied materials engineering at the University of Cincinnati \nfor 2 years before deciding that he had another calling in life. For \nJoe, that meant serving his country in the Army. According to his \nfather, ``Joe decided he didn't want to spend his life behind a desk.''\n  Joe enlisted in the Army Reserve as a combat medic in February 1992. \nThe following April, he volunteered for active duty, eventually serving \nas a medic and medical noncommissioned officer at Fort Bliss, Texas, \nand in Germany. When he died, Joe was serving with the U.S. Army \nSpecial Operations Command, based in Fort Bragg, NC.\n  One of the most remarkable things about Joe was his simple bravery. \nHe shrugged off the dangers of his job, often telling strangers that he \nwas a greeter at Wal-Mart. But Joe also knew there was nothing funny \nabout anything he did. According to his family, he knew and appreciated \nthe risks of his job. If the worst should happen, he told them, he \nwanted to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery, which, indeed, \nbecame his final resting place.\n  Joe's bravery and dedication to the Army have been recognized with \nnumerous awards, including the Bronze Star, a Meritorious Service \nMedal, and an Army Commendation Medal. He was also posthumously \npromoted to the rank of master sergeant.\n  Joe's family was making preparations for his return when he died. His \nsister Sharon says that he had spoken to their mother just a few days \nbefore his death. ``She told him she was praying for him,'' Sharon \nremembers.\n  Although it was expected that Joe would return to Iraq, he was \nscheduled to be home for New Year's Eve 2005. Plans were being made to \ncelebrate in Cleveland's Warehouse District and to attend a Cleveland \nBrown's game the following day. And almost daily, Joe was e-mailing his \nbest friend Chuck Carlin, making plans for what they would do over the \nholidays.\n  Tragically, these plans were never realized. The Christmas \ndecorations were already up, but new ones were then added. Six small \nAmerican flags joined the manger scene, the snowman, and a Merry \nChristmas sign. And other houses throughout the Seven Hills community \ndisplayed flags and red bows honoring Joe's memory.\n  Joe was a young man who was deeply connected to his church and \ncommunity. Before his burial at Arlington, a memorial mass was held in \nhis honor at St. Columbkille Roman Catholic Church. An unofficial honor \nguard of school children lined a street as the procession drove past.\n  During the ceremony, family and friends fondly recalled Joe's playful \nside. They remembered that he loved cartoons, fluffy towels, hot tubs, \nand hot sauce. They remembered that Joe would bring his laundry home \nwhen on leave and would call ahead to make sure that his favorite \ntakeout sandwich was waiting for him.\n  Family and friends also paid tribute to Joe's love for and dedication \nto his country. ``He was the best of the best,'' declared his sister \nPamela. ``He really believed in what he did,'' said his sister Debbi. \nAnd sister Maureen added, ``Reflect and remember why men like my \nbrother serve this great country with such passion and conviction.''\n  Joe made friends easily--and then kept those friends for his whole \nlife. His Internet tribute pages are filled with messages from those \nwho knew him from as far back as elementary school. All of these \nmessages are incredibly moving. They speak of Joe's bravery, his \ndedication, and the simple way in which he could make anything fun. \nThere is one message, in particular, that I would like to share today. \nA childhood friend, Michael Stutz, wrote the following in a message \naddressed to Joe:\n\n       To anyone who would ever hear the half of it, our time \n     together over years long gone sounds like a giant roll call \n     of the idylls of youth: scouting, fishing, swimming, biking, \n     the autumn football games, camping at the lake, our first \n     band, that double-date to the ice cream stand, mopeds, \n     skateboarding, shooting rifles, exploring the woods, riding \n     in the Triumph Spitfire, wandering out among the Erie \n     islands.\n       But today, what I remember most is one brief moment on our \n     eighth grade field trip to Washington, where you stood next \n     to me at Arlington. We paid our respects and thought of the \n     long glory of the nation and for just a moment everything was \n     quiet. In my heart, I stand by you there again, but you are \n     suddenly a whole lot taller, and I am looking up to you.\n       I salute you, pal.\n\n  Joe Andres was an exceptional soldier and an exceptional human \nbeing--someone who knew the importance of both service and generosity. \nHe will never be forgotten.\n  He is survived by his parents Joseph and Sandra and by his five \nsisters Deborah, Pamela, Christine, Maureen, and Sharon. My wife Fran \nand I continue to keep his family and his friends in our thoughts and \nin our prayers.\n\n\n                      Sergeant Larry R. Kuhns, Jr.\n\n  Mr. President, this evening, I rise to honor Army SGT Larry R. Kuhns, \nJr., from Austintown, OH. On June 13, 2005, Sergeant Kuhns died when \nhis military vehicle came under a grenade attack during combat \noperations in Iraq. He was 24 years of age at the time.\n  Born on April 9, 1981, Larry grew up an avid fan of the Cleveland \nBrowns and was a lover of the outdoors. His father Larry, Sr., \nremembers him as a big, rambunctious boy, who was patriotic and \nadventurous--the type of person who was always looking for new ways to \nchallenge himself. And in the Army, Larry always found new challenges.\n  After graduating from Fitch High School, Larry worked driving a \ntractor-trailer truck before joining the Army Reserves, where he became \na heavy equipment operator. While in the Reserves, Larry also worked at \nan Army recruiting office in Boardman, OH, during late 2003. SFC \nAnthony Catrucco, who worked at the recruiting office with Larry, said \nthis about him:\n\n       It's a sad moment every time we hear something like this. \n     [Larry] knew what he was getting into. He accepted it, and he \n     was proud to serve his country.\n\n  Larry enlisted for active duty with the Army in February 2004. \nAccording to his father, Larry enjoyed serving in the military so very \nmuch. In his dad's words:\n\n       [Larry] was a very dedicated soldier. All he thought about \n     was the Army. He wanted to make it his life.\n\n  By joining the Army, Larry was also carrying forward his family's \nlong tradition of military service. Larry's grandfather had served in \nWorld War II, and his great-grandfather had served in World War I. But, \nthe family history went back even further--Larry's great-great \ngrandfather fought\n\n[[Page S11400]]\n\nin the Civil War. As Larry's grandmother Norma said, ``We were very \nproud of him.''\n  Larry, himself, took great pride in his military service. He joined \nthe Army and simply loved what he was doing. His father remembers \ntalking to his son at Christmas 2004, and even though Larry had \nshrapnel in his shoulder at the time, he was still positive and \nremained proud of what he was doing in Iraq.\n  When Larry died, he was a 7-year veteran, who was serving his second \ntour in Iraq and had been recently promoted to sergeant. SFC Herb \nCampbell remembers the dedication with which Larry served his country. \nHe wrote the following in Larry's memory on an Internet tribute Web \nsite:\n\n       I was there as [Larry's] recruiter when he joined, and he \n     could not have been prouder to serve his country. I will \n     never forget Larry as we formed a close bond--as soldiers and \n     friends. He had the biggest heart, the greatest sense of \n     humor, but was ultimately dedicated to what he believed in, \n     serving his country.\n\n  And, SPC Eric Rodman wrote this, as well on the Web site, in \nremembrance of his friend:\n\n       I served with Sergeant Kuhns in the same platoon in Ramadi, \n     Iraq. It was hard for me to deal with the loss. He was like a \n     brother to me. I miss him so much.\n\n  Not only was Larry Kuhns a dedicated soldier, he was a devoted son, \nhusband, and father. He loved his wife Courtney and their daughter \nMackenzie more than anything else in the world. According to his dad, \nLarry thought and talked constantly about his family. Mackenzie was \nalways uppermost in his mind. As Larry, Sr., said, ``That little girl \nwas his pride and joy.''\n  Larry's devotion to his family was also clear to his comrades in \nIraq, who saw everyday the love he had for his wife and daughter. His \nroom in Iraq was simply plastered with pictures of his family--most of \nthem featuring Mackenzie and Courtney. PFC Jason McCully, who served \nwith Larry in Iraq, remembers how excited his friend was whenever he \nheard from those he loved and how he shared that excitement with his \nfellow soldiers. Private First Class McCully said that ``every time \n[Larry] received a letter from home, everybody knew about it.''\n  Even while serving in Iraq, Larry's family came first to him. The day \nbefore he died, he talked to his grandmother Norma. She recalls that \nthe only thing Larry wanted to talk about was those he loved. ``He \ndidn't talk much about the war,'' she remembers. ``He talked about \nfamily.''\n  To Larry's cousins, he was like a brother. His cousin Jennifer Myers \nremembers both his strong belief in service and his wonderful sense of \nhumor. She wrote the following in tribute to her beloved cousin:\n\n       The last time I saw Larry, he was home between assignments \n     in Iraq, and a big group of us all went out. I remember how \n     proud he was of his service, how much he loved being in the \n     Army and serving his country. I remember how much fun we all \n     had that night, and seeing him laughing and just being good \n     ol' Larry. That's how I will always remember Larry--my \n     cousin, my friend.\n       [He was] a great guy, with a great smile and a beautiful \n     heart. When I think of him, I think of him as he was that \n     night--happy, smiling, laughing.\n\n  Indeed, Larry is missed by everyone who knew and loved him. Family \nmembers always fondly remember Larry the sports lover, Larry the \noutdoorsman, and Larry the devoted husband, father, and son. They will \nnever forget him. As his father said, ``I know the Army didn't make a \nmistake, but I still keep thinking the phone will ring and I'll hear \nhim say, `Hey, old man.' ''\n  Army SGT Larry Kuhns lived a life that was a model of service and \ndedication. He was devoted to his family, his fellow soldiers, and his \nNation. As a soldier, he served with conviction and honor. My wife Fran \nand I will continue to keep his family in our thoughts and in our \nprayers.\n  Mr. President, I have one final tribute tonight and appreciate the \nChair's generosity and time.\n\n\n                      Senior Airman Alecia S. Good\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Air Force Senior Amn \nAlecia Sabrina Good. Alecia was assigned to the 92nd Communications \nSquadron, Fairchild Air Force Base in the State of Washington. On \nFebruary 17, 2006, Alecia lost her life from injuries sustained in a \nhelicopter collision while on assignment in the Gulf of Aden off the \ncoast of Djibouti, Africa. She was 23 years old.\n  She is survived by her 2-year-old daughter Tabatha, her twin sister \nAshley, her brother Paul, and her parents, Paul and Claire.\n  Alecia grew up in Ohio and joined the Air Force 1 month after the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks. After basic training and technical \nschool, she was assigned to Fairchild's 92nd Communications Squadron as \na tactical radio operator and maintainer.\n  In early February, Alecia was deployed to the Combined Joint Task \nForce Horn of Africa mission, supporting Operation Enduring Freedom. \nThe Combined Joint Task Force Horn of Africa was set up in Djibouti in \n2002 and is responsible for fighting terrorism in eight African \ncountries and in Yemen.\n  Alecia was flying her first training mission when she was killed in \nthe helicopter crash. The training mission involved two Marine \ntransport helicopters in the Aden Sea. Alecia was on board the \nhelicopter to provide satellite communication back to the Joint \nOperations Center at Camp Lemonier.\n  Alecia's death has been felt by many. She was a devoted, \ncompassionate, and vivacious young woman, and possessed all the \nqualities that make a servicemember exceptional.\n  Alecia's twin sister Ashley described her sister as a vibrant, \noutgoing, young woman, who was full of fun and lived life to the \nfullest. ``She was the silliest, quirkiest person. . . . She really \nknew how to cut loose,'' Ashley said. ``We'd go dancing and she'd make \nup these really crazy dances. There was one she called the `Pepper \nGrinder' and [one she called] the `Lawn Mower.' She was very hard not \nto love.''\n  Ashley also said that Alecia was extremely devoted to her family, \nespecially her 2-year-old daughter Tabatha. Alecia wished the absolute \nbest for her family,'' Ashley said. She wanted her little girl to grow \nup in a world that was safe and a world that was free.\n  Friends, family, and comrades recall Alecia's passion for living. \nBut, they also recognize her dedication and perseverance. U.S. Air \nForce Chaplain MAJ Donald Hoffman noted how Alecia enlisted in the Air \nForce exactly 1 month to the day after the September 11 attacks. ``By \nher mother's own words, she was not afraid,'' Hoffman said.\n  Pastor Bruce Gallaher said that people should remember Alecia's \nspirit and make the most of their own lives. ``She looked at life \nadventurously and wanted to live passionately,'' Gallagher said. The \nenergy and spirit that drove Alecia Good shall remain an inspiration to \nmany long after her death. We owe it to Alecia to celebrate her life.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks with a message that was posted on \nan Internet tribute website in honor of Alecia. A man named Leo Titus \nof Grayslake, Illnois--someone who never met Alecia or her family--\nrecognized her service and bravery. He wrote the following eloquent \nwords:\n\n       Thank you Alecia Good. You will not be forgotten. Your \n     bravery goes beyond words. I want to express my deepest \n     gratitude for your sacrifice. To [your] family and friends, \n     [I send] my prayers and deep condolences in your loss. May \n     God strengthen you from knowing that fellow Americans and \n     people around the world care about you and grieve with you in \n     your loss. God bless you all.\n\n  This message is signed simply--``A very appreciative fellow \nAmerican.''\n  Airman Good was buried with full military honors in Dixon, CA, on \nFebruary 28, 2006. My wife Fran and I continue to keep her family and \nfriends in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n  I thank the Chair and the staff and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/06/senate-section/article/S11400-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 TOMORROW\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
