Under the order of the Senate of January \n24, 1901, as modified on February 2, 2006, the Senator from Colorado, \nMr. Salazar, having been appointed by the Vice President, will now read \nWashington's Farewell Address.\n  Mr. SALAZAR, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n  To the people of the United States:\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the\n\n[[Page S1452]]\n\ndischarge of this trust, I will only say that I have, with good \nintentions, contributed towards the organization and administration of \nthe government the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was \ncapable. Not unconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my \nqualifications, experience, in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the \neyes of others, has strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; \nand, every day, the increasing weight of years admonishes me more and \nmore that the shade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be \nwelcome. Satisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value \nto my services, they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe \nthat, while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, \npatriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend \nthe deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my \nbeloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still \nmore for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and \nfor the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my \ninviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, though in \nusefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country \nfrom these services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as \nan instructive example in our annals, that, under circumstances in \nwhich the passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, \namidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently, want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support \nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the plans by \nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall \ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows \nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; \nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free \nconstitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly \nmaintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped \nwith wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \nthese states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so \ncareful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will \nacquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the \naffection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite movement that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national Union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The \nSouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nNorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength to which itself is unequally adapted. The East, in a like \nintercourse with the West, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies \nrequisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of still \ngreater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of \nindispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, \nand the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, \ndirected by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation. Any \nother tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage, \nwhether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and \nunnatural connection with any foreign power, must be intrinsically \nprecarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which \ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate \nand embitter. Hence likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand\n\n[[Page S1453]]\n\nvirtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a primary \nobject of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, \naffecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have \ndemonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to \ndistrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to \nweaken its bands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourself too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen, in the \nnegotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous ratification by the \nSenate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthat event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by \nwhich they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such they are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a Constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the Constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize \nfaction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, \noften a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; \nand, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make \nthe public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and \nincongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent \nand wholesome plans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual \ninterests. However combinations or associations of the above \ndescription may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in \nthe course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which \ncunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the \npower of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of \ngovernment; destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted \nthem to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the Constitution, alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal \nand permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \nabsolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief of \nsome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation \non the ruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through\n\n[[Page S1454]]\n\nthe channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one \ncountry are subjected to the policy and will of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in \ngovernments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \npopular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \nto be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will \nalways be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there \nbeing constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of \npublic opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, \nit demands a uniform vigilance to prevent it bursting into a flame, \nlest instead of warming, it should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution \ndesignates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, \nin one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary \nweapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must \nalways greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient \nbenefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the \nfoundation of the fabric?\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that the \npublic opinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt but, in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be that Providence has not connected the \npermanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity, or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead \nit astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation \nagainst another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, \nto lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and \nintractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. \nHence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. \nThe nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to \nwar the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The \ngovernment sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts \nthrough passion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \nanimosity of the nation's subservient to projects of hostility, \ninstigated by pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious \nmotives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty of nations, has \nbeen the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducements or justifications. \nIt leads also to concessions, to the favorite nation of privileges \ndenied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \nretained and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a disposition to \nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \nit gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote \nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \ninterests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with \npopularity gilding with the appearances of virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare\n\n[[Page S1455]]\n\nparticularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot. \nHow many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic factions, \nto practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, to \ninfluence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small or \nweak towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the \nsatellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake, since history and experience prove, that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \nthat jealously to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the \ninstrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \nagainst it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive \ndislike for another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on \none side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on \nthe other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, \nare liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes \nusurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their \ninterests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \nor enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. (I hold the maxim no less \napplicable to public than private affairs, that honesty is always the \nbest policy)--I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed \nin their genuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would \nbe unwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in \norder to give trade a stable course--in order to give to trade a stable \ncourse, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the \ngovernment to support them, conventional rules of intercourse, the best \nthat present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but \ntemporary, and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as \nexperience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view, \nthat it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from \nanother--that is must pay with a portion of its independence for \nwhatever it may accept under that character--that by such acceptance, \nit may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for \nnominal favors and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not \ngiving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate \nupon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which \nexperience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress, without \ninterruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever\n\n[[Page S1456]]\n\nfavorite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our \nmutual cares, labors and dangers.\n     GEO.

Mr. President, I received a letter from the director, \nlegislative liaison of the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, on \nbehalf of the Air Force Chief of Staff. He called to my attention an \nessay that was written by a fourth class cadet at the U.S. Air Force \nAcademy. His name is Joseph R. Tomczak. I was moved by this essay to \nthe point that I want to take my time this morning to read it to \nMembers of the Senate because it articulates, in a very succinct way, \nwhy our young people today look to the Armed Forces as a career, and \nwhy they make the decisions they do to fight for freedom and to fight \nfor this country.\n  We all greatly respect all people who take the time to serve in our \nArmed Forces, whether it is during a short enlistment period or they \nmake it their lifetime career. This essay is well stated, and I think \nnot only does it speak as to why a cadet would decide to serve in one \nof our academies--in this case, it happens to be the Air Force \nAcademy--but it gives us insight as to why people would pick the Armed \nForces to serve in during part of their adult lifetime or why they \nwould dedicate their entire life to a career in the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  So here is the essay. It is titled, ``Winter Break.''\n\n       So after our sunburns have faded and the memories of our \n     winter break have been reduced to pictures we've pinned on \n     our desk boards, and once again we've exchanged t-shirts and \n     swim suits for flight suits and camouflage, there still \n     remains the question that every cadet at the U.S. Air Force \n     Academy in Colorado Springs has asked themselves at some \n     point: Why did we come back? Why, after spending two weeks \n     with our family would we return to one of the most demanding \n     lifestyles in the country? After listening to our friends who \n     are home from State or Ivy League schools chock full of \n     wisdom about how our war in Iraq is unjust and unworldly, why \n     would we return? And after watching the news and reading the \n     papers which only seem to condemn the military's every \n     mistake and shadow every victory, why would we continue to \n     think it is worth the sacrifice of a normal college life?\n       Is it because the institution to which we belong is \n     tuition-free? Anyone who claims this has forgotten that we \n     will, by the time we graduate, repay the U.S. taxpayer many \n     times over. in blood, sweat, and tears. Is it because the \n     schooling we are receiving is one of the best undergraduate \n     educations in the country? While the quality of the education \n     is second to none, anyone who provides this as a main reason \n     has lost sight of the awesome responsibility that awaits \n     those who are tough enough to graduate and become \n     commissioned officers in the U.S. Air Force.\n       I come back to the academy because I want to have the \n     training necessary so that one day I'll have the incredible \n     responsibility of leading the sons and daughters of America \n     in combat. These men and women will never ask about my \n     academy grade point average, their only concern will be that \n     I have the ability to lead them expertly--I will be humbled \n     to earn their respect.\n       I come back to the academy because I want to be the \n     commander who saves lives by negotiating with Arab leaders . \n     . . in their own language. I come back to the academy \n     because, if called upon, I want to be the pilot who flies \n     half way around the world with 3 mid-air refuelings to send a \n     bomb from 30,000 feet into a basement housing the enemy . . . \n     through a ventilation shaft 2 feet wide. For becoming an \n     officer in today's modem Air Force is so much more than just \n     command; it is being a diplomat, a strategist, a \n     communicator, a moral compass, but always a warrior first.\n       I come back to the Air Force Academy because right now the \n     U.S. is fighting a global war that is an away game in Iraq--\n     taking the fight to the terrorists. And whether or not we \n     think the terrorists were in Iraq before our invasion, they \n     are unquestionably there now. And if there is any doubt as to \n     whether this is a global war, just ask the people in Amman, \n     in London, in Madrid, in Casablanca, in Riyadh, and in Bali. \n     This war must remain an away game because we have seen what \n     happens when it becomes a home game. . . I come back to the \n     academy because I want to be a part of that fight. I come \n     back to the academy because I don't want my vacationing \n     family to board a bus in Paris that gets blown away by \n     someone who thinks that it would be a good idea to convert \n     the Western world to Islam. I come back to the academy \n     because I don't want the woman I love to be the one who dials \n     her frantic cell phone call while huddled in the back of an \n     airliner with 100 other people seconds away from slamming \n     into the Capitol building. I come back to the academy because \n     during my freshman year of high school I sat in a geometry \n     class and watched nineteen terrorists change the course of \n     history live on television. For the first time, every class \n     currently at a U.S. Service Academy made the decision to join \n     after the 2001 terror attacks. Some have said that the U.S. \n     invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan only created more \n     terrorists. . . I say that the attacks of September 11th, \n     2001 created an untold number of American soldiers; I go to \n     school with 4,000 of them.--And that's worth missing more \n     than a few frat parties.\n\n  That essay has been submitted by Joseph R. Tomczak, cadet fourth \nclass, U.S. Air Force Academy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Allers, III\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to reflect on \nthe tremendous dedication and sacrifice that our country's soldiers \nexhibit every day. In particular, I want to call to my colleagues' \nattention a personal portrait of a young man who laid down his life \ndefending freedom--a freedom this country has known for centuries, and \nthat the people of Iraq have recently embraced.\n  While words cannot soothe the anguish of those who knew and loved \nhim, they can help explain the heroism of his sacrifice, and so we \npause today to remember and celebrate the life of SSG William A. \nAllers, III.\n  Sergeant Allers was accustomed to combat situations, as the battle-\nhardened veteran of more than 150 combat patrols and 50 security \nescorts while serving in Iraq. In fact, Sergeant Allers served \nvaliantly in more than 25 combat engagements in his time there.\n  On Tuesday, September 20, 2005, a Kentucky National Guard armored \nHumvee ran over an improvised explosive device on a dusty road near Al \nKhalis, Iraq--a dangerous city located within the Sunni Triangle, known \nas the hideout of killers and criminals who kidnap innocents for \nransom. The Guard unit was patrolling the streets of this city, located \nabout 40 miles north of Baghdad, when they were attacked. Three \nsoldiers from the distinguished 617th Military Police Company were in \nthe Humvee. Of the three, two were injured, and Sergeant Allers was \nkilled. He was 28 years old.\n  For his service to a grateful Nation, Sergeant Allers was awarded the \nBronze Star, the Purple Heart and the Combat Action Badge. He had also \nreceived the Army Commendation Medal\n\n[[Page S1457]]\n\nand the Kentucky Distinguished Service Medal. His commanding officer, \nCaptain Todd Lindner, made clear to all that the 617th Military Police \nCompany had lost an outstanding soldier. ``Bill worked hard to keep \nhigh morale in his team,'' Capt. Lindner said, ``and was a catalyst for \nthe morale in our entire company.''\n  To fully appreciate the impact Bill Allers had on those around him, \nhowever, it helps to know something about how he grew up. Billy, as he \nwas known as a kid, was an adventurer. His father, William Allers II, \nhas said that if there was a puddle of water, you would find Billy \nplaying in it. A neighborhood friend of Bill's added, ``if you [went] \nto look for Billy, you found him up in a tree.''\n  Through this sense of adventure, Billy earned his childhood nickname. \nOne day when Billy was about 4 or 5, his dad brought home a truckload \nof mushroom soil for the vegetable garden. Out of pure luck, this pile \nwas deposited at the end of the long driveway of the Allers' home--and \nto Billy and his best friend, it had all the makings of a great jump \nramp.\n  Before Mr. Allers had time to finish a glass of ice water inside the \nhouse, the two boys lined up their Big Wheels, sped down the blacktop \nand launched themselves nearly six feet into the air. Ever since that \nintrepid stunt, whenever they were seen together, the two were called \nthe ``Dukes of Hazzard'' Boys. Billy's father jokes that this \nexperience taught him that his son was a true ``country boy.''\n  Growing up, Bill Allers impressed people not only with his daredevil \nBig Wheel jumps, but also with his big heart and ability to lead \nothers. During Bill's 4 years on the Fallston High School track team, \nin Fallston, MD, where he grew up, his strength of character began to \nshine through. His high school track coach put it this way: ``As we \nwent through the 4 years, he molded into a leader, and he wanted to be \npart of the team, and he wanted the team to do as well as possible, and \n[he] would always encourage the younger participants when he became one \nof the seniors.''\n  Coach Greg Thompson went on to say, ``He was selfless. He just was \nfor everyone else and he wanted to see everybody else excel. And he \nwasn't worried about himself.''\n  A truly gifted athlete, Bill mastered the high jump. He was also the \n``anchor'' of the two-twenty and four-forty relay teams, meaning he was \nthe one to carry the baton for the final stretch toward the finish \nline. If the relay team was behind, they trusted Bill to make up the \nground and win the race.\n  Bill took pride in his team and his role on it, and he worked very \nhard to become the best competitor he could be. Evidently, he mastered \nthat too, because Bill's relay team won medals at the Maryland High \nSchool State Championships in 1994.\n  When he was not running track, Bill worked part-time for a local \nlandscaping and nursery company in Fallston. Part-time might not be a \nfair description, however, since it was all his parents could do to \nkeep him from working 40 hours a week. Bill loved digging his hands \ninto the soil and working to improve the environment that surrounded \nhim.\n  In Iraq, that urge to build and create gave Bill his greatest joy--\nthe gratitude the Iraqis had for the work he and his squad were doing \nto restore their country. A few months before Sergeant Allers reached \nhis final resting place in Arlington National Cemetery, on a peaceful \nslope in a section reserved for those honored soldiers who have fallen \nin Iraq, he told his family about the work he was doing to restore that \ndesert nation.\n  Bill's father said that Bill took great comfort from the gratitude \nthe children of Baghdad showed to the American soldiers. His younger \nbrother, Dave Allers, added, ``He told us the kids over there really \nadored seeing soldiers out there. The soldiers handed out stationery, \ncandy and gum. It opened up a whole new world to them. [Bill] was \necstatic that he was doing something good.''\n  Sergeant Allers's love of the great outdoors also explains his \naffinity for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Bill may have grown up in \nMaryland, but he was first exposed to the Bluegrass State when he was \nassigned to Fort Knox, KY, to learn the tradecraft of the cavalry \nscout.\n  After serving a tour of duty that took him around the world and back, \nBill decided to leave active-duty Army life and make Leitchfield, KY, \nhis home. He was captivated by our rolling hills, champion horses, and \nfriendly people. Wanting to continue his service to our country, he \nalso decided to join the Kentucky National Guard, where he served with \ndistinction until his final sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, in just these few short words I think I've made clear \nthat this was a young man who gave so much of himself to better the \nlives of those around him. Now he is gone. We wish we could ease the \ngrief of his family: his father, William, his brother, Dave, and his \ngrandmother, Virginia, who have joined us today in the gallery, and his \n9-year-old son, Gregory.\n  I hope their heartache is tempered by the knowledge that America will \nforever celebrate Sergeant Allers's heroism, and his sacrifice. As will \nthe Iraqi children he safeguarded. And his courage, his bonds of love \nand friendship, and his spirit will not be forgotten.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in his radio address on December 17, 2005, \nPresident Bush disclosed that after September 11, 2001, he authorized \nthe National Security Agency, NSA, to undertake wiretapping of American \ncitizens to try to prevent terrorist attacks. The President argued that \nhis actions were, in his words, ``fully consistent'' with his \nconstitutional responsibilities.\n  The President wrongly asserted--Mr. President, the President wrongly \nasserted--that his authority to order warrantless electronic \nsurveillance of U.S. citizens on American soil is supported by his \ninherent Presidential powers and the joint congressional resolution \nthat authorized the use of force after September 11.\n  A huge swath--a huge swath--of America, including many expert legal \nminds, does not--I say, does not--agree\n\n[[Page S1458]]\n\nwith the arguments put forth by the administration. These arguments are \ntransparently contrived, intellectually deficient, indefensible excuses \nbeing served up like tripe to silence legitimate criticism of the White \nHouse.\n  Let me say that again. A huge swath of America, including many expert \nlegal minds, does not agree with the arguments put forth by the \nadministration. These arguments are transparently contrived, \nintellectually deficient, indefensible excuses being served up like \ntripe to silence legitimate criticism of the White House, a White House \nso infused with its own hubris that it has talked itself into believing \nthat its inhabitants are above the law. But they are not. They are not \nabove the law. President Bush is not above the law. No President is \nabove the law. No United States Senator is above the law. No man is \nabove the law. No one in the United States of America is above the law. \nRemember, this is a nation of laws, not of men.\n  Yesterday, the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence jettisoned \nits constitutional responsibility to make certain that our laws are not \nbeing breached, and that the spirit and text of our revered \nConstitution remain in force. It is a sad day, indeed, to see such an \nimportant committee wilt under political pressure applied by the Vice \nPresident in partisan meetings held behind closed doors. The committee \nadjourned last night without considering a Democratic proposal to begin \nan investigation of the warrantless spying program, even though Senator \nJay Rockefeller, the vice-chairman of the Intelligence Committee, had \nbeen assured that his proposal would receive a vote.\n  I want to commend my colleague, Senator Rockefeller. He has worked \nhard to protect the people's liberties, to make sure that this \nadministration, even in its most secret circles, follows the law and \nthe Constitution. It has not been an easy task, but it is one that \nSenator Rockefeller has carried diligently.\n  Like Senator Rockefeller, I will not sit idly by and allow the \nPresident's possible breaking of the law to be swept under the rug. I \nrefuse to go quietly into the night, abdicating my responsibility as a \nU.S. Senator to a secretive executive branch, which refuses to brief \nthe Congress of the United States on its clandestine spying on U.S. \ncitizens without a warrant--an administration that believes it can, on \nits own, nullify constitutional provisions intended to protect the \nfreedoms of millions of Americans for over 200 years.\n  This travesty must not stand. The peeping and snooping and spying \nmust be investigated.\n  I am today announcing my intention to submit to the Congress \nlegislation that will establish a nonpartisan, independent, 9-11-style \ncommission to investigate and determine the legality of the President's \nactions.\n  There is a critical need for a thorough investigation of all domestic \nsurveillance programs.\n  As I stated on Wednesday in my remarks on this subject, we, the \nAmerican people--not just the NSA or the White House--have a legitimate \nneed to know what is being done, by whom, and to whom. If there is a \njustifiable and valid reason to surveil a potential terrorist in the \nU.S., we certainly can find a way to do it legally. If there is a need \nto provide more efficient tools to fight terror, Congress has the \nresponsibility to deliberate and, if warranted, to approve them. The \nPresident should ask Congress for them; not seize new powers that have \nnever been enumerated by any U.S. court.\n  Congress would be pleased to entertain his request, as we have in the \npast, by updating FISA and the PATRIOT Act, but not--I repeat, not--\nbefore a full investigation to determine if laws have been broken--an \ninvestigation which will give members a fuller understanding of just \nwhat these surveillance programs entail. A little sunshine on this \nprocess is long overdue. Congress cannot fix what the White House does \nnot want us to fully understand.\n  Congress needs to know if the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nor any other U.S. law has been broken, and whether the constitutional \nrights of thousands of Americans have been violated without cause. It \nis essential that Congress obtain the answers to these questions, not \nfor partisan political reasons, but because our system of checks and \nbalances requires it.\n  James Madison advised in Federalist 47 that: the accumulation of all \npowers, legislative, executive and judiciary, in the same hands, \nwhether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, \nor elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\n  The assumption of power by an unchecked executive, who arrogantly \nbelieves that he can seize the authority to spy on innocent Americans \nand wantonly violate the fourth amendment is the beginning of the \ntyranny Madison so feared.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the fourth \namendment of the Constitution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  U.S. Constitution: Fourth Amendment\n\n       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n     houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and \n     seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue \n     but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, \n     and particu1arly describing the place to be searched, and the \n     persons or things to be seized.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, our country needs additional funding for \nLIHEAP. Temperatures in rural Alaska have reached 62 below zero. These \ntemperatures have frozen heating systems and water and sewer lines in \nmany of our villages. Alaskans are struggling this winter and paying \nover $5 per gallon to heat their homes. In fact, the mayor of a North \nSlope community told me that at one point, a village paid $8 per \ngallon.\n  While the home heating picture is not as bleak in other parts of our \ncountry, all Americans are feeling the effects of high energy prices.\n  In December, I tried to address this situation by including emergency \nLIHEAP funding in the Defense Appropriations Bill. Our bill created a \nnew revenue stream by authorizing oil and gas development in the \nCoastal Plain of ANWR--and used this revenue to provide funding for \nseveral emergencies. Our bill included $2 billion for LIHEAP and \nfunding for the hurricane victims, first responders, and farmers.\n  The ANWR provision would have created a long-term, dedicated funding \nstream for home energy assistance.\n  Most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle successfully \nfilibustered consideration of this package under the guise of a Rule \nXXVIII violation. They then noted to remove the ANWR provision and the \nfunds it provided from the bill, including emergency funding for \nLIHEAP.\n  It was a sad display of good policy dying a quick death at the hands \nof partisan politics. It was a particularly sad day for the people this \nfunding was designed to help.\n  Despite this, Americans still need heating assistance this winter. I \nhoped the Senate would put partisan politics aside and create a long-\nterm funding stream for LIHEAP in December. I believe that would have \nbeen the best solution.\n  The measure before us today is the only other solution available, and \nI urge my colleagues to pass emergency LIHEAP assistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/17/senate-section/article/S1458-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1458-S1459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               S.

RES. 376 (PASSED THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President pursuant to Senate Resolution 213, 109th \nCongress, the Senate authorized the Senate legal counsel to represent \nSenators John McCain and Jon Kyl in a pro se civil action in which the \nplaintiff complained that the Senator defendants violated their duties \nunder the common law and the Federal Criminal Code by failing to \ninvestigate or prosecute the alleged commission of 1.6 million crimes. \nAfter the Senate legal counsel moved to dismiss the action, the \nplaintiff sought to amend the complaint to name 29 additional \ndefendants, including Senators Bill Frist, Joseph I.

The \ncourt held that plaintiff's criminal claims failed on the merits and \nthat plaintiff's civil claims were barred under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct for plaintiff's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies \nunder the act.

Mr. President, I rise today to announce to the Senate the \narrival in this world of Laura Dale Duffield. Miss Duffield was born to \nher parents Cara and Steven this last Friday, and is reported to weigh \nover 7 pounds. Her father, Steven, is the Judiciary Policy Analyst and \nCounsel for the Republican Policy Committee, which I chair.\n  I would like to take a moment to note for posterity some of the \nevents taking place in the world at the time that young Laura joins us. \nMost important among the matters recently before the Senate, I think, \nis the confirmation several weeks ago of the nomination of Samuel Alito \nto be a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. In the fall \nof last year, the Senate also confirmed the nomination of John Roberts \nto be the Chief Justice of the United States. Steven played an \nimportant role in both confirmations, supplying Republican Senators \nwith information and draft speeches about the nominees, and even \nstaffing me on the Judiciary Committee during the nominees' hearings. \nThis is the first time that there has been a change in the membership \nof the Supreme Court since 1994--before Laura's parents even began law \nschool. Chief Justice Roberts replaces Chief Justice Rehnquist, who \noriginally had been appointed to the Court in 1971, in between the time \nthat Laura's parents were born. Justice Alito replaces Justice \nO'Connor, who had been appointed to the Court when Laura's parents \nstill were in grade school.\n  In the years to come, we of course will have many opportunities to \nevaluate these two new Justices and their impact on the law. At the \npresent time, based on what I saw ofthese nominees at their hearings \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, I think that they give us reason to be \nhopeful about the future. I think that we can reasonably expect both \nnominees to usher in a new era of the rule of law in this country--to \nrestore the Supreme Court to its intended role, of declaring what the \nConstitution means in light of how it was reasonably understood when it \nwas enacted. For many years now, Americans often have felt powerless at \nthe hands of a Court that has pursued its own political agenda--an \nagenda without a basis in the text, structure, or history of the \nConstitution. I am optimistic that in the years to come, the Supreme \nCourt might play a less prominent role in American life, and might \nallow the American people and their elected representatives a more \nprominent role in making the laws that govern them.\n  This year also marks the 5th year since the terrorist attacks on the \nTrade Center in New York and on the Pentagon. Those attacks still set \nmuch of the national agenda, from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to \nthe legislation that we are considering in the Senate. On the day that \nLaura was born, last Friday, the headline in the Washington Post was, \n``Patriot Act Compromise Clears Way for Senate Vote.'' I will include \nthis news story in the Record following my remarks. Last December, the \nPATRIOT Act--an important antiterrorism law that enhances investigators \nability to detect and disrupt terrorist plots--was held up in a \nlegislative filibuster. Occasionally, the Senate takes to heart its \nintended role as a brake on legislative action and throws one of its \nperiodic tantrums. But fortunately, just in advance of Laura's arrival, \nthe impasse over this indispensable law has been cleared.\n  Finally, this moment in time also is marked in this place by \nlegislative action on a slew of reforms to our civil-justice and \nbankruptcy laws; an attempt to reform our immigration system and \ncontrol our border; and an attempt to reverse the verdict of the Civil \nWar by authorizing Native Hawaiians to secede from their State. Mention \nof these projects, however, serves only to highlight their \ninsignificance relative to the arrival of a new child in the world. I \ndoubt that Steven even will remember the laborious policy papers that \nhe produced on all of these topics as he watches Laura grow older.\n  I congratulate Steven and Cara on the arrival of their daughter--on \nthe fact that there is now one more person in the world whom we will \nall call ``Duffield''--and I wish them good fortune in caring for and \ncultivating their new charge.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following Washington Post news story \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From washingtonpost.com, Feb. 10, 2006]\n\n           Patriot Act Compromise Clears Way for Senate Vote\n\n                         (By Charles Babington)\n\n       Efforts to extend the USA Patriot Act cleared a major \n     hurdle yesterday when the White House and key senators agreed \n     to revisions that are virtually certain to secure Senate \n     passage and likely to win House approval, congressional \n     leaders said.\n       The law--passed in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks \n     and scheduled to lapse in key areas last year--makes it \n     easier for federal agents to secretly tap phones, obtain \n     library and bank records, and search the homes of suspected \n     terrorists. Several Democrats said the compromise announced \n     yesterday lacks important civil liberties safeguards, and \n     even the Republican negotiators said they had to yield to the \n     administration on several points.\n\n[[Page S1460]]\n\n       But with virtually all 55 GOP senators now on board, and \n     Democrats joining them, the plan appears to have enough \n     support to overcome the Senate filibuster that has thwarted a \n     four-year renewal of the statute for months. Senators said \n     they think the White House will be able to coax the \n     Republican-controlled House to agree as well, even though \n     House leaders have complained that senators' demands had \n     weakened the measure.\n       ``It was a bipartisan group of us that really believed we \n     could do better . . . to protect civil liberties even as we \n     gave law enforcement important tools to conduct terrorism \n     investigations,'' Sen. John E. Sununu (R-N.H.) told \n     reporters. He said that he and his fellow negotiators had to \n     make more concessions to the administration than they wanted \n     to, but that Congress will monitor the law's application over \n     the coming years and perhaps revise it.\n       Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), one of several Democrats who \n     agreed to back the compromise yesterday, said ``it falls far \n     short'' of the bill that was passed by the Senate last year \n     but rejected by the House. ``But if you measure it against \n     the original Patriot Act . . . we've made progress'' toward \n     ``protecting basic civil liberties at a time when we are \n     dealing with the war on terrorism,'' Durbin said.\n       Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) called the \n     compromise ``a step in the right direction.''\n       The proposal would restrict federal agents' access to \n     library records, one of the Patriot Act's most contentious \n     provisions. A form of secret subpoena known as a National \n     Security Letter could no longer be used to obtain records \n     from libraries that function ``in their traditional capacity, \n     including providing basic Internet access,'' Sununu and \n     others said in a statement. But libraries that are ``Internet \n     service providers'' would remain subject to the letters, \n     Durbin said.\n       The Senate proposal would no longer require National \n     Security Letter recipients to tell the FBI the identity of \n     their lawyers.\n       The compromise bill also addresses ``Section 215 \n     subpoenas,'' which are granted by the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act court. Recipients of such subpoenas \n     originally were forbidden to tell anyone about the action. \n     The proposed Senate measure would allow them to challenge the \n     ``gag order'' after one year, rather than the 90-day wait in \n     earlier legislation.\n       Sununu said the administration insisted on the longer \n     waiting period. ``You now have a process to challenge the gag \n     order,'' he said, defending the concession. ``That didn't \n     exist before.''\n       Sununu said he and his allies were disappointed that the \n     compromise does not require agents to ``show a connection to \n     a suspected terrorist or spy'' before obtaining a Section 215 \n     subpoena. Instead, a FISA judge would have to agree that \n     there are reasonable grounds to believe the items being \n     sought are relevant to an investigation into terrorism.\n       Several liberals condemned the bill. ``I am gravely \n     disappointed in this so-called deal,'' said Sen. Russell \n     Feingold (D-Wis.). ``The White House agreed to only a few \n     minor changes'' that ``do not address the major problems,'' \n     he said, adding: ``We've come too far and fought too hard to \n     agree to reauthorize the Patriot Act without fixing those \n     problems.''\n       But Justice Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said the \n     Senate compromise ``maintains the tools necessary to fight \n     terrorism while further strengthening safeguards to protect \n     civil liberties.''\n       ``We are hopeful that the Congress will now move forward to \n     renew the Patriot Act,'' he said.\n       In a related area yesterday, several Democrats said the \n     administration must do more to explain and justify the \n     domestic surveillance program conducted by the National \n     Security Agency.\n       ``If they came with the idea that this is going to stop an \n     investigation on the part of the Senate intelligence \n     committee, they were wrong,'' committee Vice Chairman John D. \n     Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.) told reporters after a closed \n     briefing by two top administration officials. ``There were \n     certain kinds of questions which could easily have been \n     answered but weren't. . . . Where we really wanted hard \n     information that was important to us, that gave us the size \n     and the scope and the reach and the depth of the program,'' \n     he said, ``they were not forthcoming.''\n       Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said after the briefing: \n     ``For the life of me, I don't understand why the \n     administration won't say, `Sure, you have a right to look at \n     this. We'd like to expand it.'

COOPER\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, earlier this week, I paid tribute \nto Mr. William A. Cooper, honoring his career and service to the State \nat the occasion of his retirement. Today, I would like to have printed \ninto the Record the following statement from the esteemed Minnesotan \nand former Senator Rudy Boschwitz in honor of our friend Bill Cooper.\n  The statement follows:\n\n\n                   The Taxpayers' Friend Retires (?)\n\n       Not many people can say they saved the taxpayers billions. \n     Bill Cooper can. Well, some credit must be given to the team \n     he brought to Minnesota and some locals that he found here \n     and made a part of that team. But Bill was clearly the \n     leader. Without him it is highly doubtful that TCF would have \n     survived.\n       It must be mentioned at the very outset that without his \n     wife, Sherry, it would have been highly doubtful that Bill \n     himself would have survived, much less be able to endure the \n     pressures and hours that first saving and then building a \n     major institution entails.\n       It started about 20 years ago in the midst of the Savings & \n     Loan crisis when S's were going broke left and right \n     including some big ones here in Minnesota. The eventual cost \n     to the taxpayer was in the neighborhood of $100 billion. \n     Extraordinarily high interest rates combined with poor \n     management and complicated by the lugubrious sounding \n     phenomena of disintermediation had brought S's nationwide \n     to their knees. Twin City Federal Savings and Loan (TCF), the \n     largest and mightiest of them all in the Upper Midwest, \n     appeared to be the next candidate for failure and a \n     Government bailout to protect its depositors.\n       But, finally the Directors of TCF acted. By a single vote \n     margin (many credit Community Activist and Leader, Harry \n     Davis, with casting that vote) their decision was to bring in \n     a fellow named Bill Cooper to save the sinking ship--though I \n     suspect those embattled Directors must have had considerable \n     doubt about the prospects for success.\n       My estimate may be wrong, but I suspect a TCF failure would \n     have been one of the bigger ones nationally and cost the \n     taxpayer $3 billion or more.\n       Instead, today TCF National Bank with its 500+ branches is \n     a strong growing institution with stockholder value exceeding \n     $3 billion. And much to Bill Cooper's credit, that value has \n     been spread generously to his team (and other stockholders) \n     returning riches beyond the dreams of the many who joined \n     under Bill's leadership to create a new TCF.\n       This commendation could as well be entitled ``Only in \n     America.'' I don't know the intricacies of Bill's life from \n     his boyhood forward, but I do know that he was a policeman on \n     the beat in Detroit; that he went to college in the evenings; \n     got his degree in accounting and joined the many other young \n     aspirants as an ``associate'' at a large national accounting \n     firm. There he was put to work auditing bank clients and the \n     rest, as they say, is history.\n       I joined the Board of TCF in 1991. The stock was about \n     $2\\1/2\\ at the time (naturally I didn't buy enough of it). I \n     served on the Board for about 9 years till my 70th birthday \n     when the by-laws stipulated my retirement, though my feeling \n     of closeness to the institution and its people continues \n     unabated. It should! I continue to contribute to it's PAC and \n     am the recipient (for another 3-4 years) of a retirement \n     income from TCF.\n       I have been a Director of a number of national \n     corporations. None has been as well managed as TCF. A single \n     word summarizes Bill Cooper's role: Leadership. It is a \n     totally focused leadership. At TCF there is no question about \n     who is in charge. It is Bill Cooper (and with Lynn Nagorske \n     as CEO I suspect there will continue to be no question). Bill \n     has no problem in being tough, direct and fair. Bill does not \n     turn away from the vagaries of the most difficult decisions. \n     He is a remarkable leader both at the Bank and in his \n     Community. The fact that in my 15-year association there have \n     been few leadership changes at TCF--other than through \n     retirements--attest to the quality and strength of Bill's \n     leadership which includes delegating responsibility and \n     expecting and very objectively measuring performance.\n       Does such a man really retire? I don't think so. Certainly \n     not entirely. Not a man of Bill's curiosity and drive. \n     Besides, he still has young kids in school and college \n     educations loom ahead. The idea of Bill sitting around, \n     playing golf, and not rising to new challenges is \n     incongruous. It won't happen. And it will be fun watching \n     what develops.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/17/senate-section/article/S1460-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1460-S1461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PENSION RIGHTS CENTER'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the great \nachievement of the Pension Rights Center as it celebrates its 30-year \nanniversary. Since its founding on February 17, 1976, the center has \nchampioned the pension rights of working Americans and their families. \nThe center is one of the country's foremost leaders on pension issues \nfrom a consumer perspective and has made an enormous difference in the \nlives of millions of workers, retirees and their families.\n  Over the years, the center has played a key role in identifying \npension inequities and promoting reasonable solutions. They have played \nan instrumental role in shaping and ultimately helping to secure \nFederal laws and regulations that have expanded pension rights for \nwidows, divorced spouses, and working people. The center is also the \nmost trusted resource for pension information for policymakers, \nresearchers, and the media on the highly complex pension issues \ntranslated from a consumer perspective.\n\n[[Page S1461]]\n\n  The center has led the way in helping individuals with their pension \nproblems and in helping develop and coordinate the country's first \nnationwide pension information and assistance services for older \nAmericans. The center provides backup legal training and technical \nassistance for the U.S. Administration on Aging's Pensions Counseling \nand Information Program. There are now currently six regional \ncounseling projects that provide free assistance to thousands of \nindividuals in 17 States.\n  The center also has spearheaded the Conversation on Coverage, an \ninnovative public policy initiative that has brought together a wide \nrange of experts--including businesses, unions, financial institutions, \nand national retiree, women's, and consumer organizations--to find \ncommon ground approaches to increasing pension coverage. The \nConversation on Coverage's three working groups are in the process of \nfinalizing recommendations to expand pensions and savings for millions \nof Americans.\n  The center's work is needed now more than ever. As baby boomers get \ncloser to retirement, it is becoming clearer and clearer that they \nlikely will not enjoy the retirement security that their parents have \nenjoyed. Younger workers are even more at risk. Many employers are \nbacking away from their longstanding commitment to providing for their \nworkers' retirement security.\n  Thousands of pension plans have been terminated or frozen and \nthousands more are considering additional pension cutbacks. The center \nhas always been at the forefront of protecting workers' pensions and in \nproposing innovative and workable solutions, and their efforts will be \nall the more critical in the days and years ahead.\n  I wish the Pension Rights Center, its founder, Karen Ferguson, and \nthe dedicated staff a very healthy 30th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/17/senate-section/article/S1461-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/17/senate-section/article/S1461-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/17/senate-section/article/S1461-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2320.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to make the \nprovision of technical services for medical imaging examinations and \nradiation therapy treatments safer, more accurate, and less costly; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Consumer Assurance \nof Radiologic Excellence Act of 2006. This bill would improve the \nquality and value of diagnostic medicine. If the RadCARE Act is \nenacted, patients and providers alike will benefit from more efficient \nand accurate diagnoses and safer, more appropriate therapies, all \nafforded at a substantially decreased cost to the taxpayer.\n  Most of us feel anxious when we see the doctor, regardless of whether \nthe evaluation reveals a problem. That is particularly true when we are \nconcerned about cancer. How reassuring it is for us to believe that our \nphysicians have available to them the full range of diagnostic tests \nand therapeutic procedures necessary to manage our care in the best way \npossible. We expect, too, that everyone who participates in our care is \nhighly qualified to perform the services they provide. It is an \nexpectation that each of us deserves to have but, all too often, is \nunrealistic.\n  Effective treatments are predicated on accurate diagnoses, and every \ntreatment has the potential to cause harm. Missed, inaccurate, or \ndelayed diagnoses can lead to unnecessary or dangerous therapies, with \navoidable medical costs the least of the consequences. Physicians and \npatients should be able to trust that the technical providers such as \nthe radiologic technologists, ultrasonography technologists, and \nmedical radiation technologists who actually perform these tests are \nwell qualified to do their jobs and have the appropriate credentials \nhelp to provide this assurance.\n  Cancer of many different types has become much more common; indeed, \ncancer is the second leading cause of death in America, behind only \nheart disease. Medical imaging tests play an increasingly important \nrole in diagnosing a wide variety of malignant diseases and in \ndetermining the results of treatment. Radiation therapy is a common \nform of cancer therapy and used in more than half of all cancer cases. \nAs our population ages, we should anticipate that such procedures and \ntherapies will be performed with greater frequency on older Americans, \nwith the cost borne more and more often by federally financed health \ncare programs. For example, in 2004, Medicare paid over $1 billion for \nradiation therapy.\n  Improvements in health care often occur through technological \ninnovations. For example, today's providers depend much more on \ndiagnostic medical imaging than they did in the past, which has led to \na rapid increase in the number of procedures performed, procedures that \nare not limited just to patients with cancer. Over 300 million \nradiologic procedures are performed annually in the United States, with \n70 percent of Americans undergoing some type of medical imaging exam or \nradiation therapy treatment annually.\n  These innovations, while of undeniable potential benefit, come with \nsubstantial costs. Radiology costs are reaching over $100 billion \nannually; diagnostic imaging is one of the fastest growing cost areas \nin American health care. These costs are not limited to charges alone. \nSedation, administered to facilitate a diagnostic imaging study, may \ncompromise breathing or heart function. Therapeutic interventions \nbased, in part, on these studies are fraught with potential \ncomplications, and the risk increases if the diagnostic information is \nincomplete or inaccurate. Similarly, a decision not to intervene \ncarries its own risks, especially if the facts on which the decision is \nmade are in error.\n  Congress has already taken some steps to assure the public that those \nwho provide these services meet sufficient standards of technical \nproficiency. The Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992 established \nstandards for technologists performing one crucial diagnostic test; \nsubstantial quality improvement has been the result. The Consumer-\nPatient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 encouraged the States \nto set standards for the technical competence of those who provide \ndiagnostic imaging or radiation therapy services to patients but left \ncompliance with those standards optional. Unfortunately, to date, nine \nStates and the District of Columbia have enacted no regulatory statutes \nat all while, in a further six States, those regulations remain \nincomplete. Some provider disciplines have no specified standards of \neducation, training, and experience at all. In fact, a provider with \nonly a few hours of course work or a couple of weeks of on-the-job \ntraining may be responsible for obtaining the image a physician uses to \ndiagnose your cancer or to deliver the radiation that is crucial to the \ntreatment of your tumor. One doesn't have to be a doctor to recognize \nthat this is not good medicine to rely solely on the good intentions of \nthose who employ these providers.\n  In its report to Congress this March, MedPAC--the Medicare Payment \nand Advisory Commission--recognized that, while the issue is complex, \ntechnical excellence in diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy plays \na central role in improving the public health and lowering costs of \ncare. The RadCARE Act seeks to implement those recommendations that \nspeak to credentialing of technical providers and brings to completion \nwork begun with the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act.\n\n[[Page S1463]]\n\n  Many will benefit if we pass the RadCARE Act. Better diagnostic \nimages will help physicians to make faster, more accurate diagnoses or, \nalternatively, to exclude problems from further consideration. Risks \nsuch as sedation-related complications and radiation exposure will \ndecrease. Patients will receive therapies that are more considered, \nprecise, and safe. Provider and consumer confidence in the health care \nprocess will rise. Qualified technologists will be recognized for their \nprofessional achievements and motivated to improve their practice. \nTaxpayers, even if they are fortunate enough not to require diagnostic \nor therapeutic radiologic services, will appreciate that their tax \ndollars are not being wasted on poor quality, repetitive diagnostic \nexaminations or unsafe therapies.\n\n  Could the RadCARE Act have unintended, adverse consequences? Some \nargue that meaningful credentialing of these technical providers will \ndecrease access to care--that it is better to have non-credentialed \nproviders than none at all. Certainly, establishing and maintaining a \nhealth care workforce that is adequate in size is an important goal for \nus to achieve. I would make the case, though, for quality--that bad \ninformation is worse than no information at all. It is reassuring to \nnote that, in those States that do regulate this type of technical \npractice, the number of practitioners has remained stable. To further \naddress this concern, the RadCARE Act gives the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services the flexibility necessary to modify regulations \npromulgated under this legislation, so that access to services is not \ncompromised but standards are preserved.\n  Some fear that credentialing technical providers will increase health \ncare expenses by inflating personnel costs. Again, in those \njurisdictions that regulate this type of technical practice, wage \ninflation has not occurred. Regardless, while I believe that workers \nshould be compensated, fairly and proportionately, for the work that \nthey do, the cost savings from delivering care correctly far outweigh \nany potential cost increase that might result from higher salaries.\n  Others are concerned that the RadCARE Act could infringe on the \nStates' right to regulate health care practice or that Congress lacks \nthe capacity to define the standards of practice that should apply. The \nAct does not codify any particular State action; rather, it provides a \nsubstantial economic incentive to the States to establish, at least, \nminimum standards, an action for which there is precedent in the \nMammography Quality Standards Act and one that is consistent with \ncurrent public and private sector initiatives, such as ``pay for \nperformance,'' that tie reimbursement to recognized best practices. \nSimilarly, the RadCARE Act does not specify what standards should be \nfollowed but gives the Secretary the opportunity to derive those \nstandards from those most qualified to provide them: the professional \ncommunity. Indeed, the Act is supported by the Alliance for Quality \nMedical Imaging and Radiation Therapy, a consortium of over 275,000 \ntechnical professionals.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me and Senator Kennedy as sponsors of \nthis bill to increase the quality and value of these important \ndiagnostic procedures and lessen the possibility of life-threatening \nmedical mistakes.\n  I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2322\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for immigration reform, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nregarding immigration: the Welcoming Immigrants to a Secure Homeland \nAct of 2006.\n  As a border State Senator and the son of immigrants, I have a unique \nperspective on immigration. I understand the need to provide a secure \nhomeland for my constituents who see the problems caused by illegal \nentries into our country every day. I also understand the need to \nwelcome immigrants to our country, so that America remains a country \nwhere hardworking, entrepreneurial, and intelligent immigrants can \nprosper. My perspective is the basis for the WISH Act.\n  I believe we can welcome immigrants to a secure homeland by \naddressing five areas.\n  First, we must improve security at our international borders. On \nNovember 17, 2005, I introduced the Border Security and Modernization \nAct of 2005, S. 2049. That bill calls for improvements to our port of \nentry infrastructure, increased Department of Homeland Security, DHS, \nand Department of Justice personnel, new technologies and assets for \nborder security, increased detention capacity, and additional Federal \nassistance for States. I believe these actions will provide the \nnecessary increased security at our borders.\n  Second, we must improve enforcement of our immigration laws. The WISH \nAct addresses this situation by increasing the number of DHS personnel \nwho investigate human smuggling laws, employment of immigrants, and \nimmigration fraud. My bill also increases penalties for violations of \nimmigration laws and provides for a system to verify a worker's \nemployment eligibility.\n  Third, we must create a new guest worker visa that is easier to \nobtain and lets individuals who want to come to the United States to \nwork know that if they are hardworking and industrious, we want them in \nAmerica. The WISH Act creates such a visa, which is valid for up to 9 \nyears if the guest worker remains employed. After the applicant has \nworked in the United States for 6 of those years, he or she may apply \nfor permanent resident status. An applicant's spouse and unmarried \nminor children may be admitted to the United States with the guest \nworker. To ensure that such visas are issued only to legitimate guest \nworkers, my bill requires applicants to provide information on his or \nher criminal history, gang membership, immigration history, and \ninvolvement with groups that have engaged in terrorist acts, genocide, \npersecution, or plans to overthrow the United States. It also provides \nfor the completion of all necessary background checks.\n\n  Fourth, we must account for the millions of undocumented aliens \nresiding in the United States. I believe that the vast majority of \nthese aliens are honest, hard-working individuals who are contributing \nto our country in positive ways, so the WISH Act allows them to obtain \nthe guest worker visa I just mentioned without leaving the United \nStates if he or she pays a fine. This will allow for these aliens, and \ntheir immediate families, to remain in the country doing the work they \nalready do. In order to provide for their timely and orderly transition \ninto legal guests, my bill requires undocumented aliens to apply for \nthis visa or leave the United States. Failure to take one of those \nactions means they will be removed from the United States and will be \nunable to return. For aliens who have been working in the United States \nfor at least 5 years before enactment of the WISH Act, my bill allows \nthem to apply for any visa, adjustment of status, or immigration \nbenefit except adjustment of status to that of a permanent resident \nafter they have worked as legal guests for 5 years. However, such \napplications may not be granted until the alien has returned to his \nhome country.\n  Lastly, we must create a more welcoming environment for students and \nvisitors to our country. Before the horrific events of September 11, \n2001, the United States was a preferred place for foreign students to \nattend school. This\n\n[[Page S1465]]\n\nwas beneficial to our country because students came to the United \nStates to study, but they stayed here to work. They did business with \ncolleagues they met at U.S. schools. Our country was obtaining some of \nthe most brilliant minds not only from within our borders but from \nacross the world. Unfortunately, restrictions and limitations put on \nvisas in recent years have forced many of the business leaders of the \nnext generation to attend school in other more welcoming countries. To \nreverse this trend, the WISH Act allows full-time foreign college and \ngraduate students to work and travel while studying in the United \nStates and provides for foreign students who graduate from a U.S. \ncollege with honors to stay in the United States to work after \ngraduation.\n  I am personally involved in this issue both because I represent a \nborder State and because I remember the day, when I was 5 or 6 years \nold, that my parents learned that the lawyer who advised them about \ncitizenship was wrong and my mother was an illegal alien. Federal \nofficials came to our house to arrest my mother while my father was at \nwork. It was a frightening situation for my entire family that occurred \nthrough no fault of my mother, who had lived in America for more than \n30 years as an exemplary citizen and who was told by an attorney that \nshe was an American.\n  I believe that we can, and must, do our best to prevent situations \nlike this from occurring in the future. I believe that the measures in \nthe WISH Act, together with the measures in my Border Security and \nModernization Act, will play an important role in that effort, and I am \npleased to introduce this bill today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2326\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TEMPORARY AGRICULTURAL \n                   WORKERS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that consideration of any \n     comprehensive immigration reform during the 109th Congress \n     should include reform for immigration laws related to \n     employment of agricultural workers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLEN (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Sununu, and Mrs. \n        Boxer):\n  S. 2327. A bill to require the FCC to issue a final order regarding \nwhite spaces; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce and present to my \ncolleagues the Wireless Innovation Act of 2006. I am pleased to be the \nlead sponsor of this legislation, and I want to thank my colleagues \nSenator Kerry and Senator Sununu for working with me on this important \nissue.\n  The goal of the Wireless Innovation Act is to unleash the power of \nadvanced technological innovation to facilitate the development of \nwireless broadband Internet services. Specifically, our legislation \nallocates certain areas within the broadcast spectrum that are \notherwise unassigned and unused, known as white spaces, for wireless \nbroadband services.\n  Unfortunately today, many people, from rural areas to big cities, \neither do not have access to broadband Internet service or simply \ncannot afford it. Our legislation will enable entrepreneurs to provide \naffordable, competitive high-speed wireless broadband services in areas \nthat otherwise have no connectivity to broadband Internet. \nAdditionally, in areas where broadband access currently is provided, \neither from a Cable modem or DSL connection, our legislation will allow \nfor a third alternative choice for consumers.\n  The Wireless Innovation Act encourages the most robust and efficient \nuse of this Nation's spectrum. After the transition to digital \ntelevision is complete in February of 2009, 64 percent of the spectrum \nallocated to broadcast television use in the Richmond, VA, area will be \nvacant. Instead of sitting dormant, this valuable spectrum can be used \nto provide greater Richmond area residents with affordable wireless \nbroadband, which some estimate to be as low as $10 per month. These \nwhite spaces exist in virtually every geographic area of the country, \nand I believe it is a valuable public resource that should be used for \nthe benefit of all American consumers.\n  I recognize and fully appreciate the value that our television \nbroadcasters serve in each and every local community. That is why our \nlegislation protects incumbent local television stations from potential \ninterference that may be caused using white spaces. In fact, my \nlegislation ensures that all unlicensed devices must comply with the \nclear rules established by the Federal Communications Commission so \nthere is no interference to licensed systems. These rules, along with \nthe power of technology, can protect the television broadcast stations \nfrom any harmful interference.\n  Using white spaces to deliver wireless broadband across the country \ncreates a new opportunity for innovators and entrepreneurs to provide a \ncompetitive broadband service at extremely low cost. This is especially \ncompelling in rural areas where distance is so frequently the enemy of \nwire-line networks and the primary reason for the high cost of rural \nbroadband deployment.\n  At a time when the United States is lagging behind much of the world \nin broadband penetration--and more than 60 percent of the country does \nnot subscribe to broadband service primarily\n\n[[Page S1472]]\n\nbecause it is either unavailable or unaffordable--our legislation would \nput this country one step closer to closing the economic digital divide \nand achieving ubiquitous broadband Internet access throughout the \ncountry.\n  Providing a way to encourage the widespread adoption of broadband \nInternet access is vital to helping us keep pace with the new global \neconomy. The benefits to Americans will include more jobs, better \naccess to information and commerce, increased productivity, improved \nhealthcare delivery, and more access to education and \nvideoconferencing.\n  While the foreseeable benefit of this legislation is facilitating the \ndevelopment of wireless broadband services, the true beauty of \nunlicensed spectrum is that it allows for continued advancement and \ninnovation, yielding benefits that are unimaginable today. A decade \nago, no one could have imagined WiFi Internet access and yet, through \nthe use of unlicensed spectrum, it was created. Four years ago, I \nworked on legislation with Senator Boxer to make more unlicensed \nspectrum available in the upper spectrum bands for further advancement \nand deployment of WiFi services. The Federal Communications Commission \nfollowed our lead and eventually made this spectrum available. Since \nthen, WiFi has flourished.\n  Today, WiFi Internet access can be found in consumers' homes, \nStarbucks Coffee shops, book stores, entire cities such as Alexandria, \nVA, and even here in the Senate Office buildings. The \nTelecommunications Industry Association estimates that sales of WiFi \nequipment reached $4.35 billion in 2004, and predicts spending on WiFi \ninfrastructure will increase to $7 billion in 2008. It is now time to \nenable the next generation of wireless innovation by allowing these \nwhite spaces to be used for next generation wireless broadband \nservices.\n  A guiding principle I have followed throughout my time in public \nservice is that the Internet should remain as accessible as possible to \nall people in all parts of the country forever. That is why I sponsored \nthe Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, signed by the President in \nDecember 2004. That guiding principle is also what leads me, together \nwith Senators Kerry and Sununu to introduce the Wireless Innovation Act \ntoday. With passage of this legislation, we can move forward to create \nan alternative that promotes broadband adoption using advances in \ntechnology and spectrum efficiency.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2327\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wireless Innovation Act of \n     2006'' or the ``Winn Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. WHITE SPACES.\n\n       (a) Completion of Order.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications \n     Commission shall complete its proceeding and issue a final \n     order regarding white space in the matter of Unlicensed \n     Operation in the TV Broadcast Bands, ET Docket No. 04-186.\n       (b) Conditions.--In completing the requirement described in \n     subsection (a), the Federal Communications Commission shall \n     in such final order--\n       (1) permit unlicensed, non-exclusive use of unassigned, \n     non-licensed television broadcast channels between 54 MHz and \n     698 MHz;\n       (2) establish technical guidelines and requirements for the \n     offering of unlicensed service in such band to protect \n     incumbent licensed services and licensees from harmful \n     interference; and\n       (3) require unlicensed devices operating in such band to \n     comply with existing certification processes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2331. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe period for which the designation of an area as an empowerment zone \nis in effect; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nhelp struggling communities, like Aroostook County in my home State of \nMaine, take full advantage of the special tax incentives for creating \neconomic growth and community revitalization in empowerment zones. The \nbill enables those economically depressed communities, already taking \nadvantage of these incentives, to secure the full 15 years of targeted \ngrowth originally granted to the areas first designated as empowerment \nzones.\n  I believe all empowerment zone communities need 15 years to reverse \nthe decades of decline that originally impacted their economies. I have \nlong supported empowerment zone incentives, and I believe that these \ntargeted tax incentives provide struggling communities the best chance \nfor sustained, long lasting economic renewal. In Maine, I have seen \nfirst hand empowerment zones' ability to revitalize faltering \ncommunities, with new jobs, and the creation of the economic activity \nneeded for vibrant and strong cities and towns.\n  Empowerment zones are vital to the health of rural Maine. The story \nof Aroostook County demonstrates how decades of decline can force \npeople to leave rural areas in order to find better, more stable, \nemployment opportunities. Since the 1960s, difficult economic \ncircumstances have caused a continuous decline in Aroostook County's \npopulation. In 1994, Loring Air Force Base closed, the major employer \nin Aroostook County at the time, further decimating the area's already \nstruggling economic base and population. The Pentagon wrote, in their \nassessment of closure at Loring that, ``closing Loring Air Force Base \nwould result in a population loss of approximately 22,000 persons, \n(the) direct and indirect employment loss of nearly 9,900 jobs, and \nregional income loss of just over 92 million dollars.'' Today, over 11 \nyears after the Air Force left Aroostook County, the population hovers \nnear a sparse 73,000 people with 14 percent of these households still \nliving in poverty.\n  In 1994, Congress designated the first empowerment zones setting \n2009, a 15-year timeframe, as the date that these tax incentives would \nexpire. The 2009 expiration date of empowerment zone status was held \nfirm for Round II communities designated in 1997, and the Round III \ncommunities designated in 2002; granting communities like Aroostook \nCounty, which was designated in 2002, as little as 7 years to use tax \nincentives to reverse decades of decline and economic neglect.\n  Unfortunately, Aroostook's economic problems will not be fixed within \nthe 7 short years this area qualifies for empowerment zone tax \nincentives. Instead a long-term and lasting commitment of at least 15 \nyears is necessary to help Aroostook communities work their way to \nstronger economic prosperity. Many communities, like Aroostook County, \nthat were unable to qualify for empowerment zone status until 2002 are \nin need of the long-term 15-year commitment in which to address their \nstubborn causes of poverty.\n  Businesses operating within empowerment zones receive a 20-percent \nwage credit for the first $15,000 they pay in wages to local residents. \nOther tax incentives encourage businesses, and industries, to further \ncommit to these communities. Companies with businesses in empowerment \nzones are eligible for an additional $35,000 worth of 179 business \nexpensing--making these long-term business obligations more attractive, \naffordable, and likely. Empowerment zones are also eligible for \nexpanded tax exempt financing for building the infrastructure \ncommunities need to attract long-term developers and business partners.\n  To qualify for empowerment zone status, communities develop \ncomprehensive strategic plans that depend on these tax incentives to \nhelp them transform their economies. Each community's plan focuses on \nestablishing long-term partnerships between private businesses, \nnonprofits, State, local, and Federal Government agencies, to help \ndevelop the local economy. Together these parties use the community's \nstrategic blueprint to implement interconnected projects that address \nthe factors creating the area's economic sickness. These types of \nprojects focus on building needed business and industrial \ninfrastructure, developing an educated workforce and diversifying local \neconomies away from a reliance on one employer or industry.\n  In 2002, Aroostook County was designated an empowerment zone based on \npopulation loss, one of only two empowerment zones designated because \nof population decline. The county formed the Aroostook Partnership for \nProgress to spearhead their empowerment zone strategy, initiatives, and \nprojects.\n\n[[Page S1473]]\n\nSince its formation, the Partnership for Progress has steadfastly \ndedicated their time and resources to create a projected 1,500 new jobs \nand negotiated over $1.2 million worth of investments into Aroostook \nCounty. These numbers indicate the ability of empowerment zone \nincentives to drive investment and strengthen local businesses in the \narea.\n  Through the Aroostook Partnership for Progress, and the businesses \nworking in the empowerment zone, are making significant progress--the \nfactors causing poverty in this rural part of Maine can not be \neradicated quickly. Aroostook County's strategic plan will take time to \nimplement as infrastructure, industry, and other projects create \ngreater economic capabilities and diversification. Though Aroostook \nCounty is working valiantly to overcome the factors causing their \neconomic decline they will need more than 9 years to overcome 40 years \nof difficulties. I know that there are many other struggling Round II \nand Round III empowerment zone communities, like Aroostook, who need \nthe maximum order to reverse the poverty and underdevelopment also \nplaguing those areas.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize the importance of making a long-\nterm commitment to communities using empowerment zone incentives to \nwork their way out of long-term poverty. I hope that each Senator will \nsupport the communities in their States, currently undertaking the \npainful process of economic transformation, by supporting passage of \nthis economic development bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/17/senate-section/article/S1473-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 382--RECOGNIZING KENNETH M.

Mr. President, today, with my friend from Kansas, Senator \nBrownback, I am submitting a resolution urging the President to help \nstop genocide in Sudan. The killing in Darfur has gone on way too long.\n\n[[Page S1474]]\n\n  In July of 2004, Congress declared the actions that were taking place \nin Darfur, Sudan genocide. Two months later, the administration issued \na report which reached the same conclusion. In the 17 months since \nthen, little has changed for the people of Darfur. Two million people \nhave been chased from their homes, 3 million rely on international aid, \nand over 200,000 are refugees in Chad.\n  The security situation in Darfur remains dire. The Secretary General \nand other United Nations officials have warned that the region is on \nthe verge of chaos. In parts of Darfur, the U.N. and other aid agencies \nhave had to pull back staff.\n  The U.N., led by the United States, has taken the first step towards \nauthorizing a peacekeeping force, but it could be a year from now--a \nyear--before such a force completely deploys.\n  What are the men, women and children of Darfur supposed to do in the \nmeantime? Hope for the best? Keep their fingers crossed that they are \nnot attacked by the janjaweed, or caught in the cross-fire between the \ngovernment and rebel forces?\n  Some believe that the crisis in Darfur is over. All the violence, \nthese folks argue, is small scale, and residual in nature. They argue \nthat the African Union successfully halted the killing of innocent \ncivilians. Maybe that is why the administration has no concrete plan to \nimprove the security situation in Darfur until the U.N. can get on the \nground.\n  What I would say to those who argue that the worst is over is this: \nover the course of the last 2 years, the government of Sudan and its \nsurrogates killed as many as 400,000 people and drove one third of the \npopulation of Darfur off their land. Two million people remain in \ninternally displaced or refugee camps. Attacks continue. It may be true \nthat they are not as systematic as they were 6 months or a year ago, \nbut I submit to you that it is not because the African Union stopped \nthe attacks. It is because systematic attacks are no longer necessary \nfor the government to continue to terrorize civilians. It is because as \nmany as 400,000 people already are dead, and hundreds if not thousands \nof villages have already been destroyed. The attacks may be less \nsystematic, but they are not over. And it does not make them less \nhorrific.\n  I traveled to the Chad-Sudan border in May of 2005. One of the sector \ncommanders from the African Union force came across the border to meet \nwith me. He told me point blank, that he had neither the manpower, the \nequipment nor the mandate to stop attacks on civilians. But we in the \nwest have the manpower and the equipment--and, if the political will is \nthere, we can secure the right mandate. And that is why we must help.\n  This resolution calls for the President to provide such help through \nNATO. It calls on the President to propose that NATO get involved by \nsending troops to Darfur to support the African Union until the United \nNations can get on the ground, and considering how NATO can enforce a \nno-fly zone in Darfur. The resolution calls on NATO to begin planning \nin anticipation of such a mission.\n  Let me be clear about what I am not proposing in this resolution. I \nam not proposing a third peacekeeping mission be sent to Darfur. I am \nsuggesting that NATO increase the support it is already lending to the \nAfrican Union with a small number of fully equipped troops to help with \ncommand and control, communications, and dissemination of intelligence, \non the ground. And I am proposing that these troops stay in Darfur only \nuntil the U.N. force has deployed all of its troops. My colleagues \nshould also note that the resolution urges the Security Council to \nauthorize a Chapter VII mission for Darfur--one with an adequate number \nof well-trained and equipped soldiers--as quickly as possible, so that \nNATO troops are not engaged in an open ended mission.\n  The world watched nearly a million people get slaughtered in Rwanda \n12 years ago this April. We did nothing. But I'd like to think that we \nlearned from that mistake. We did act in Bosnia, and then in Kosovo, to \nstop ethnic cleansing. Neither mission was popular. But President Bill \nClinton took decisive action because the consequences of inaction were \nsimply too high: We could not stand by and allow Yugoslav President \nSlobodan Milosevic and his thugs to fill up more mass graves. We cannot \nfail to take action in Darfur as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/17/senate-section/article/S1474-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2320\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 4745, which was received from the \nHouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4745) making supplemental appropriations for \n     fiscal year 2006 for the Small Business Administration's \n     disaster loans program, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, after the close of business on February \n9, 2006, the Small Business Administration, SBA, notified my office \nthat the SBA Disaster Loan Program was going to run out of money 4 days \nlater on February 13, 2006. I was outraged that my office was only made \naware of the situation because USA Today was about to do a story on it. \nThe Disaster Loan Program is one of the most important lifelines that \nthe people of my State are relying on to pull themselves out of the \ndestruction wrought by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. When SBA first knew \nabout the funding shortfall in this program, the Senators from \nLouisiana, Mississippi, Florida, Texas, and Alabama should have been \nthe first people told. No doubt some of my colleagues may only have \nlearned about this in the media. That is not how a Federal agency \nshould notify Congress of important developments.\n  The administration has requested, and the Appropriations Committee \nhas approved, a reprogramming of $100 million from SBA's salaries and \nexpenses account to the Disaster Loan Program to keep it funded for \nanother 2 weeks. The program will still need additional funding beyond \nthis. H.R. 4745, that is before the Senate today, will allow for a \nreallocation of $712 million in funds from the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency to SBA in order to keep the Disaster Loan Program \nrunning until the end of April. They hope that by then Congress will \nhave acted on an additional Katrina supplemental appropriations bill to \nkeep the Disaster Loan Program funded through the end of the fiscal \nyear. I certainly support this legislation and I am pleased that SBA \nacted to keep the Disaster Loan Program funded.\n  But even with these temporary extensions, this latest incident is \njust another example of the poor performance of SBA under the its \nAdministrator Hector Barreto. SBA told us that it has known about this \nproblem since December when they realized that their average disaster \nloan size for damage as a result of Katrina was double what they had \npreviously experienced in the program. So all of their estimates were \noff. They knew that the amount of money they had budgeted for disaster \nloans to businesses and homeowners for the program would not last. But \nthey never said anything to us about it--until they thought that the \npress would tell us first.\n  The Small Business Committee held hearings focusing on SBA's disaster \nresponse to Katrina and Rita, so the agency knew that this was a major \nconcern to the chair and ranking member of the committee, Senator Snowe \nand Senator Kerry, as well as myself and my colleague from Louisiana, \nSenator Vitter. The committee staff is in almost daily contact with \nSBA, giving SBA ample opportunity to discuss upcoming issues that would \nwarrant congressional attention. No one at SBA raised this issue, \neverything was fine.\n  When the administration released the Federal budget for 2007, SBA \nmade no mention that the Disaster Loan Program was going to need \nadditional funding. The SBA's Chief Financial Officer took part in \nbudget briefings for staff along with other SBA officials. Again no \nmention that the Disaster Loan Program was running out of money.\n  Mr. President, if this was an isolated incident or oversight, I would \nnot be nearly as disappointed. But this is far from an isolated event. \nMy constituents have been complaining about SBA and the Disaster Loan \nProgram since the earliest days after the disaster. Katrina and Rita \ncatastrophically destroyed or damaged over 18,000 businesses and over \n200,000 homes in Louisiana alone. Early on after the storm, disaster \nvictims had to wait months for their loans to be approved. The agency \ndid not have enough staff on the ground to do damage assessments. The \nsituation has improved since those early days, and the SBA has finally \nheeded our calls to contract out the loss verification process to speed \nthings up. I commend them for coming to their senses on that, but I \nstill believe that the SBA's slow start has led to business failures \nand has left many homeowners without any hope of returning home.\n  Furthermore, SBA's failure to accurately track the finances of the \nDisaster Loan Program, and more importantly, its neglect in keeping \nCongress updated on this developing problem, is evidence of a culture \nof inefficiency that goes through to the highest levels of the SBA. I \nwant to know what these officials knew and when they knew it, because \ncertainly no one in Congress was told until February 1. That is 12 \ndays--I repeat 12 days--before the program was set to run out of money.\n  Mr. President, Katrina and Rita threw the gulf coast into a state of \nuncertainty. SBA's handling of the Disaster Loan Program has only made \nthis feeling of uncertainty worse. We need more than a string of \ntemporary fixes to the financial viability of the program to ensure \nthat the dollars will be there for the people in the gulf who are \ntrying to rebuild. We need a permanent solution or else the management \nmistakes of the past will continue to plague the SBA's disaster \nresponse for future disasters.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Small Business Administration's \ndisaster loan program is facing another shutdown this month unless \nCongress passes a bill to provide the program with more funding. A \nshutdown of this program would further slow the recovery of the gulf, \nwhere hundreds of thousands of business owners and homeowners have been \nwaiting months for the administration to process and disburse loans to \nhelp them pay their bills and start rebuilding their businesses and \nhomes.\n  As of this week, according to the SBA's data, out of more than 60,000 \nloans approved for businesses and homeowners, only 23,000 have been \npartially or fully disbursed. And out of the almost 375,000 \napplications received, 190,000 are still waiting to be processed. The \nfamilies and businesses waiting should not be subjected to yet another \nroadblock to assistance through the disaster loan program.\n  The mismanagement of the SBA's disaster loan program has been well-\ndocumented on national news programs like CNN and in major papers like \nthe Washington Post and USA Today. The Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship has held two hearings on the matter. Adding to the \nproblems, the SBA was not paying attention to the books and didn't \nrealize it was making larger loans and spending more than it had \nestimated. This lack of oversight brought the program to the brink of \nshutting down.\n  When the President's budget was released on February 6, the SBA \ndiscovered it only had enough money to make it to February 13. Instead \nof being forthcoming about the problem when the SBA and its financial \nteam came up to brief the oversight Committee on SBA's budget and \nfinancial standing, they were silent. Luckily, as has been the pattern \nsince President Bush has been in office, the Congress stepped in to \npass emergency legislation to keep one of SBA's small business programs \nup and running.\n  Specifically, Congress approved a last-minute request from the \nadministration to reprogram $100 million from\n\n[[Page S1477]]\n\nSBA's disaster administrative funds into the account for disaster \nloans. Unfortunately, not only did SBA wait until the last minute to \nseek assistance, but the assistance it sought was not enough to keep \nthe program running long--just enough to keep the program running from \nFebruary 14 to maybe the end of the month. To make it through the year, \nthe SBA needs an estimated $1.3 billion.\n  Demonstrating yet another lapse in judgment, the administration did \nnot plan to seek the entire amount to avoid another shutdown but \ninstead decided to take a piecemeal approach. Their plan was to ask now \nfor enough money to make it through July and then later in the year to \nseek the rest of the needed funding. I disagreed with this approach and \nurged the President and Senator Majority Leader Frist to request the \nentire funding at one time and to move the funding measure as a \nfreestanding bill so that it could pass before the Congress breaks for \nthe Presidents Day recess. Waiting until Congress comes back on \nFebruary 28 would be too risky given that SBA only has the $100 million \nit requested to keep going.\n  Given all that is at stake for the families and businesses in the \ngulf, I am very glad that today, before we recess, the Senate is \nconsidering H.R. 4745, a bill to provide funding to the SBA's disaster \nloan program. I am glad that Congress has come to the administration's \nrescue to pass another emergency bill, one that is freestanding. I only \nwish the bill provided the full $1.3 billion instead of $712 million. \nThis will only keep the program running through April. However, the \nHouse has already recessed, so we are not in the position to add more \nfunding at this time.\n  I hope this bill gives some peace of mind to those in the gulf \nwaiting for help, and I hope that when we come back we can be just as \nswift in approving a final measure to fully fund the disaster loan \nprogram.\n  In closing, I ask unanimous consent that letters from me and my \ncolleagues to President Bush and Majority Leader Frist be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Small Business & \n           Entrepreneurship,\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2006.\n     Re Averting Shutdown of SBA's Disaster Loan Program.\n\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We have just received word that the \n     Small Business Administration's (SBA) disaster loan program \n     was on the brink of running out of money next week, on \n     February 13, 2006. Our Committee was not notified until this \n     week that the SBA needed more funding, and according to \n     documents I have just received, not even the appropriators \n     were notified until recently. Instead of waiting until the \n     last minute to try and avoid a shutdown, further exacerbating \n     the disaster loan program's failure to meet the urgent needs \n     of hurricane victims in the Gulf, the Administration should \n     have notified Congress of this problem sooner. This is \n     reminiscent of the way in which the Administration handled \n     the shutdown of its largest small business lending program \n     two years ago and the way it handled the shortage of funds to \n     pay SBA's disaster loan staff during the 2004 Florida \n     hurricanes.\n       Mr. President, your FY2007 budget was released on Monday, \n     and you deployed your staff out to the various oversight \n     Committees this week to promote your priorities for the \n     various agencies and departments and to justify the requests. \n     Among other key SBA employees, Committee staff met with the \n     SBA's Chief Financial Officer. No one should be in a better \n     position to know the Agency's fiscal standing in its \n     accounts. Yet, not once did the CFO or anyone from the SBA \n     mention a need for additional disaster loan funding.\n       For too long, you have ignored the mismanagement of the \n     SBA. The draconian cuts to the SBA by this Administration \n     have proven deleterious to the delivery of resources \n     important to small businesses across the nation. The near-\n     shutdown of the disaster loan program demonstrates the short-\n     sightedness of these budget cuts.\n       It is time to get the SBA's disaster loan program running \n     smoothly and remove the red tape that is keeping so many \n     homeowners and business owners from getting much-needed \n     disaster assistance. As of yesterday, SBA's data showed that \n     almost six months after Hurricane Katrina hit, 50 percent of \n     the loans requested by homeowners are waiting to be \n     processed, and 35 percent of the business owners are waiting \n     for their loan applications to be processed.\n       I understand that the Administration's reprogramming \n     request of $100 million approved yesterday by Congress will \n     only provide enough funding to keep the program running for \n     about 14 more days. To avoid a shutdown during Fiscal Year \n     2006, the SBA disaster loan program needs an estimated $1.3 \n     billion. Currently, your Administration is planning to \n     request $1 billion to be reallocated from the billions \n     sitting idle at FEMA. Unfortunately this will only fund the \n     disaster loan program through July, requiring an additional \n     request for the remaining $300 million in supplemental \n     appropriations to make it through the end of the fiscal year \n     in September. Rather than continue this piecemeal approach to \n     budgeting, I urge you to request the full amount to operate \n     the program properly now and make sure the needs of the Gulf \n     and future disaster victims are met.\n           Sincerely,\n     John F. Kerry.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Small Business & \n           Entrepreneurship\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2006.\n     Re Passing Legislation To Prevent Shutdown of SBA's Disaster \n         Loan Program.\n\n     Hon. William H. Frist, M.D.,\n     U.S. Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: We are writing to ask your \n     immediate attention in passing critical legislation to \n     prevent the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Disaster \n     Loan program from shutting down.\n       As you are aware, the SBA Disaster Loan program would have \n     run out of money yesterday, February 13, 2006, if the \n     Congress had not approved a last-minute request from the \n     Administration to reprogram $100 million. The SBA has told \n     the Committee that the reprogrammed funding will only keep \n     the program running for about 12 more days and estimates it \n     will need an additional $1.3 billion to avoid a shutdown in \n     FY2006.\n       Instead of seeking the full amount, SBA has informed the \n     Committee that the Administration intends to request only \n     part of the needed money now, through a reallocation of $1 \n     billion from the unspent funds in the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency's (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund. \n     Unfortunately this will only fund the disaster loan program \n     through July, requiring an additional request for the \n     remaining $300 million in supplemental appropriations to make \n     it through the end of the fiscal year in September.\n       Rather than continue this piecemeal approach to budgeting, \n     we believe the Congress should pass legislation with the \n     entire estimated amount so that there is stability in the \n     delivery of disaster relief to meet the needs of the Gulf \n     victims, as well as any future disaster victims. We also \n     believe that the request should move as a free-standing bill, \n     rather than combining it with other bills that run the risk \n     of delay because of unrelated controversies.\n       In summary, we seek your cooperation to immediately pass a \n     free-standing bill in the Senate that would authorize FEMA to \n     reallocate from its Disaster Relief Fund $1.3 billion to the \n     SBA's Disaster Loan program. And we request that any \n     reallocated funds from the Disaster Relief Fund be restored \n     as soon as possible through the next supplemental emergency \n     funding bill that Congress enacts.\n           Sincerely,\n     John F. Kerry.\n     Carl Levin.\n     Mark Pryor.\n     Mary Landrieu.\n     Maria Cantwell.\n     Tom Harkin.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I am joined by Commerce Committee Cochairman Senator \nInouye and committee members Senators Burns, McCain, Rockefeller, Lott, \nLautenberg, Sununu, Pryor, and Bill Nelson.\n  On February 11, 2006, Mr. Mead announced his retirement as the \ninspector general of the Department of\n\n[[Page S1478]]\n\nTransportation after nearly 9 years of service in that position. In \nthose 9 years of service, Mr. Mead and his staff conducted countless \ninvestigations in an independent, impartial, and professional manner \nregarding numerous issues affecting the Department.\n  Mr. Mead appeared before the committee as a witness on several \noccasions throughout his tenure, and the committee always found that he \nprovided independent, thorough, and relevant commentary and \nrecommendations concerning a wide range of Federal transportation \npolicies and programs. His contributions to transportation safety are \ngreatly appreciated by the current and former members of the committee.\n  On behalf of the Commerce Committee, I ask that the Senate recognize \nand commend Kenneth M. Mead for his more than 8 years of exemplary \nservice to the Nation as the inspector general of the Department of \nTransportation, and we express our deep appreciation and gratitude for \nhis long and outstanding service.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mead has announced his retirement as the \n     Inspector General of the Department of Transportation after \n     nearly 9 years of service in that position;\n       Whereas, Kenneth M. Mead and his staff conducted \n     investigations independently, impartially, and with rigorous \n     professionalism into myriad issues affecting transportation \n     and transportation policy;\n       Whereas, Kenneth M. Mead and his staff provided \n     independent, thorough, and relevant commentary and \n     recommendations on a wide-range of Federal transportation \n     policies and programs, including aviation operations and \n     safety, highway, auto and truck operations and safety, \n     transportation security, rail operations and safety, and \n     pipeline and hazardous materials transportation safety;\n       Whereas, during Kenneth M. Mead's tenure as Inspector \n     General, the events of September 11, 2001, had a dramatic \n     impact on the Federal government's relationship with the \n     aviation industry and posed significant challenges for \n     ensuring the safety and security of public transportation in \n     general and the United States aviation industry in \n     particular;\n       Whereas Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta \n     recognized Kenneth M.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Carol Dinkins of Houston, TX, to be the chair of the Privacy and \nCivil Liberties Oversight Board.\n  Congress recently created this important position based on the \nrecommendation of the 9/11 Commission. The Privacy and Civil Liberties \nOversight Board is designed to monitor and uphold our nation's \ncommitment to defend civil liberties. Part of the board's \nresponsibilities will be to provide honest, responsible, and fair \nreview of the development and implementation of laws, regulations, and \nexecutive branch policies--specifically with respect to our Federal \nGovernment's commitment to protect America from the ongoing threat of \nterrorism.\n  The board will play an important role in ensuring that privacy and \ncivil liberty concerns are appropriately considered. Such oversight is \nimportant because, as a Nation, we proudly revere our civil liberties. \nWe must remain committed to vigorously defend them, in order to ensure \nthat we remain a beacon of freedom to the rest of the world.\n  Congress strives to strike a careful and wise balance between \nnational security and civil liberties. While this is not always easy, I \nbelieve we do so with the best interests of our Nation in mind--and do \nso in an honest and good faith manner.\n  Ms. Dinkins is the right person for this important position, as she \nhas proven throughout her distinguished career to share these values. \nHer vast public service and private-sector experience will allow Carol \nDinkins to offer unique perspectives to the privacy board. As Deputy \nAttorney General under President Reagan--the second-highest ranking \nposition in the Department of Justice--Ms. Dinkins was responsible for \nthe day-to-day management of the Justice Department's more than 60,000 \nemployees. Moreover, she played a significant role in the development \nof the Reagan administration's criminal justice and anti-terrorism \npolicies.\n  Ms. Dinkins has also been a long-time partner in the distinguished \nTexas law firm of Vinson & Elkins. She has devoted a substantial amount \nof her time to a variety of public service initiatives, including \nservice on the American Bar Association, and has also donated \nsignificant time to activities designed to promote conservation and \nprotect the environment.\n  I am proud to support Carol Dinkins for this position and am \nconfident that she will serve the Nation with honor and distinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/17/senate-section/article/S1478-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1478-S1479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I again thank the distinguished majority \nleader. He made reference to the George Washington Farewell Address. I \nremember 25 years ago, a quarter of a century ago, I gave the address \nand I was awakened on that day to 25 inches of snow. The only people \nwho came to the Congress that day were the Presiding Officer, a clerk, \nand myself to deliver that address. I remember I walked from my then-\nresidence some 2 miles in the snow. There was a farmer's march here, \nand they were all in a tent camp, and a tractor drove me up the hill \nthe final 3 or 4 blocks. It was one of the few moments of any fame in \nmy life. I was picked by The New York Times as the ``Man of the Week'' \nfor forging through the storm to give that very important address. \nSince then, it has all been downhill for me.\n  I wish to address the Senate with regard to these nominations for the \nDepartment of Defense. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a brief biography of each of these distinguished Americans who \nhave stepped forward to take on these responsibilities.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            James I.

BS Physical \n     Science, 1980.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. In a time of great concern for those of us who, on a \ndaily basis, work the situations primarily in Iraq and Afghanistan, I \nhope to make I think my sixth or seventh trip to that region in the \nnot-too-distant future, and I am hopeful that a number of Senators will \nfind the opportunity to make similar trips because the situation in \nboth areas, in my judgment, still has a high degree of fragility and a \nhigh degree of uncertainty. We have to reinforce the resolve of our \nNation, working with our coalition partners, to achieve the goals that \nwere set down by the respective governments in the coalition and, \nindeed, the wise and strong leadership of the President of the United \nStates, in the absolute necessity that we enable both of these nations \nto establish that form of democracy that they consider best suits them.\n  Great progress has been made in Afghanistan. Elections have been held \nthere. We have seen recent elections likewise in Iraq. Progress is \nbeing made. I will have further remarks on this subject when the Senate \nreturns after the recess. But it is absolutely imperative that the \nvarious factions in Iraq--Shia, Kurds--work together to bring in a \nrepresentative group from the Sunni faction to establish this \ngovernment. It seems to be off to a start, a little slower--I will \nspeak for myself--than I had hoped. But we have to impress upon the \nleadership in those three political divisions that time is running out. \nThat government must be formed. They must pick individuals of \nunquestioned strength and integrity to run the Ministries--primarily \nthe Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of the Homeland--the Interior.\n  I think we have given an extraordinary measure, through loss of life, \nloss of limb, through economic support. It is an enormous drain. We \nwill soon be dealing with enormous sums of money in continuing \nsupplementals to allow those people in Iraq, as well as Afghanistan, to \nachieve their level of democracy.\n  As does every Member of this Chamber, I feel for those members of the \nfamily in the United States, and indeed for those of our coalition \npartners, who have lost a family member or are bringing back their \nfamily member to nurture that individual who has been wounded so they \ncan once again resume their life and their own responsibilities.\n\n\n                              Surveillance\n\n  I wish to comment on a different subject which has given me a great \ndeal of concern, and that is this question of surveillance. I will \nunhesitatingly now say, given the statements yesterday by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Intelligence Committee--I am privileged \nto serve on that committee--that in consultation with the White House, \nwe will proceed, hopefully, on a constructive and fair and objective, \nto the extent we can get politics out of it, look at the existing laws \nand determine such modifications as can be agreed upon.\n  I have continuously taken that stance, quietly, in consultation with \nmy colleagues here, with members of the gang of 14, I may say, which \nhas taken a constructive role in other areas--they have given some \nconsideration and they have a position on that after we return. But it \nis imperative that we approach this in a bipartisan way.\n  The intelligence system underpins--it is the foundation on which we \nconduct our operations of the military in harm's way. It is what we \ncall a force multiplier, meaning for every bit of factual, sound, \naccurate intelligence effort that can be given to the Armed Forces \nengaging the enemy, the likelihood is that it produces an advantage \nsuch that you possibly would have fewer military people to carry out \nthe mission if you know with great precision what has to be done. We \nrefer to it as a force multiplier in the annals of military planning \nand history, throughout our recent history. That system has undergone \nsome stresses, occasioned by the wise--I was a partner through this--\nlegislation to establish the means by which our Nation, through its \nmilitary and civilian representatives, deals with those taken as \nprisoners. That is behind us.\n\n  We are now faced with the imperative necessity to give our President \nevery possible power in which to continue to utilize the wide spectrum \nof assets this Nation has to gain that same intelligence to guide us in \nthe days and the weeks and the months to come and, indeed, I say the \nyears to come because the war on terrorism is going to go on long after \nI have departed this Earth, and it will be the responsibility of my \nchildren and my grandchildren, regrettably, for their lifetimes.\n  That is the turn of events that we now experience in this troubled \nworld. Consequently, our President, as the leader of the most powerful \nNation of the free world, must be given all the powers that we possibly \ncan under our Constitution, preserving the integrity of what we call \nour basic rights and freedoms as given by the Constitution. But at the \nsame time, without that valuable intelligence, we run a greater and \ngreater risk to preserve these freedoms if we do not have it strong and \nin place and fully functioning.\n  I hope we can arrive at some legislative package--and it should not \nbe seen as the administration giving in to the Congress or the Congress \noverriding. No, we must work as coequal branches in partnership.\n  Recently I had a chance to have a private conversation with the \nAttorney General of United States and, indeed, the senior officers who \nare engaged in intelligence gathering. I felt they should build a \nbridge between the two branches of Government and let us cross it \ntogether and decide how we can strengthen this system and leave no \ndoubt--I underscore that--no doubt in the minds of every American \ncitizen that our President is acting within the law, acting consistent \nwith the Constitution of the United States as those powers were \nenumerated 200-plus years ago but still are as vitally important today \nas ever.\n  But this world has moved so far, for example, in the 30-odd years of \nthe FISA Act, which is the core piece of legislation at the moment that \nis out in the public domain with years of study--so much new technology \nhas come on that it is time to look at the revisions which need to be \nmade under that act.\n  I do not think we should hold tenaciously on this question of the \nconstitutional authority of Government as being the sole province of \nthe administration for interpretation. Having trained in the law \nmyself, I don't express any great expertise, but I know men and women \nof clear and sound and patriotic conscience on both sides of this issue \nlooking at the words of the Constitution will determine exactly what \nthe powers of our President are. Yes, this is a political potion and \nelement to the debate, but still beyond that there are men and women of \ngood, sound character and will on both sides of that issue.\n  People say: Well, let it be resolved by the courts. It may well come \nto pass.\n\n[[Page S1481]]\n\n  But each day we let this uncertainty exist has the potential to \nfurther impair the intelligence system. Those of our citizens engaged \nin it and those partners we share intelligence with around the world \nare beginning to wonder if there is an uncertainty about the status and \nthe authority of what we are doing out on the front lines gathering \nintelligence, as well as all the way through the chain back to those in \npositions of responsibility in Washington and elsewhere. You might not \nget the degree of intelligence that you need.\n  We have to remove that uncertainty, and move this Nation forward ever \nso strongly in its collection capabilities, and remove from those \ncitizens--I am not one who follows the polls, and I am not one dictated \nto by the polls, but the reality is a lot of citizens of clear \nconscience believe the President may not be acting within the law. We \nhave to remove that. We want every person in the United States to \nbelieve our President is acting within the law as we pursue this war on \nterrorism.\n  I am very pleased to support what the distinguished Chairman Pat \nRoberts said about the meeting yesterday, and that there will be, in a \nconsultative process, an analysis made by the Congress and the \nadministration in resolving this, and possibly we can seek legislation. \nIt will be a challenge because of the question of the degree of \nknowledge that we have with regard to how collection is undertaken and \nhow we translate that into law. That will be an unusual challenge \nfacing this body, and we are going to have to reach down and search in \nour souls and put politics to one side and determine that we are acting \nin the present and long-term interests of this country--that we have to \ndo it in such a way that when it is concluded we have across the board \nsupported the American public to continue to move forward stronger.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/17/senate-section/article/S1481-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 2006, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
