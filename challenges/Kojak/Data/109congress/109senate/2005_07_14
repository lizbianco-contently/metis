Mr. President, I say this to my colleagues or their staffs \nwatching. We have spent considerable time on this bill. Yesterday was a \nlittle disjointed because of the funeral of Gaylord Nelson and the \nspace shuttle blastoff that did not occur. We had a number of Senators \nwho had gone to both of those events.\n  Under the order now before the Senate, the leader and I have the \nability to offer amendments. I have one Senator who has come to me, and \nI think the amendment he has asked that I offer is appropriate, and I \nwill do that. I will confer with Senator Judd Gregg before I offer that \namendment.\n  All good things need to come to an end, and we need to stop any \namendments we now have with the dozen pending now. I prevailed upon the \nmajority leader not to file cloture yesterday or Tuesday. I think that \nis appropriate.\n  For Members who have amendments to offer, if they have something they \nbelieve is extremely important, they can come to me, and I will make \nevery consideration I can.\n  It is time we finish this bill. I don't know if we can finish it \ntonight. I hope we can. The leader said we will stay in tonight and \nwork through as long as we need to. It is my understanding, regardless \nof what we do tonight, that we are going to try to move to another bill \ntomorrow, which is fine with me.\n  I say to my colleagues, if there are Members who have something to \nsay\n\n[[Page S8248]]\n\non this amendment or any amendments filed, do that because there is a \ntime when the sun goes down and everyone will be in a hurry to get out \nof here. The fact is, if we have a lot of amendments stacked, we will \nnot be able to do that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, people around the world know the United \nStates as a land of freedom and opportunity.\n  We have remained that way in large part because we open our doors to \nimmigrants.\n  We must continue to do so.\n  People come to America looking for a better life. We live better \nlives because of them. They contribute to our economy. They help weave \nthe rich cultural fabric that makes up our society. But we must ensure \nthat immigrants who come to America come here legally.\n  We face a crisis. Over 7,000 miles of land stretch across our \nborders. Our ports handle 16 million cargo containers. And 330 million \nnoncitizens--students, visitors and workers--cross our borders every \nyear.\n  An unprecedented flow of illegal immigrants, criminals, terrorists, \nand unsecured cargo also cross our borders. This challenges our \nstandards of compassion and threatens our national security.\n  It also offers us an opportunity to define our Nation's future.\n  First and foremost, we face a grave humanitarian challenge. Last \nyear, several hundred people died in the deserts and mountains that \nseparate the United States from Mexico. Most died of exposure to the \nelements. Some died in accidents. An alarming number were murdered.\n  Along Arizona's southern border--the only area for which we have good \ndata--over 20 people died as a result of hanging, blunt-force trauma, \ngun shot wounds and other apparently deliberate means during 2004.\n  But we have this data collected only because of the work of an \nArizona newspaper. We don't know how many more corpses are buried in \nshallow, unmarked graves. Nobody keeps a complete database of deaths \nalong our borders. And many apparent homicides go uninvestigated.\n  That's why I've asked the Government Accountability Office to produce \na report on the deaths along our border as a guide to future action.\n  We must protect our Nation from those who seek to enter it illegally. \nBut we have a higher, moral obligation to do our best to protect the \nlife of every person who sets foot on American soil.\n  Second, the insecurity of our borders threatens America's national \nsecurity. Each year, thousands of people cross our border illegally. \nThe vast majority seek little more than better lives for their \nfamilies. But some bring drugs. Some traffic in human beings. A few may \neven have links to terrorist groups.\n  We don't know exactly how many come. We don't know their backgrounds. \nNor do we know who might want to harm us.\n  But we do know one thing: if drug dealers and human traffickers can \noperate on our borders, terrorists can as well.\n  Our national security requires a safer, more secure border. And our \nstandards of compassion demand it. Anything else is morally \nunacceptable. We must act swiftly.\n\n  At the right time, Congress must reform our laws to strengthen and \nimprove our immigration system. We also need free trade agreements like \nCAFTA, which we passed just before the July 4th recess. This will give \neconomic hope to the people of Central America. It will give them \ngreater opportunities to live more prosperous lives in their \ncommunities. But, for now, we must tighten enforcement of our borders. \nAnd that's what this bill does.\n  First, it dramatically increases the corps of border protection \nprofessionals. Congress has already added 500 border patrol agents this \nyear. This bill adds 2,000 more patrol agents, investigators, and \ndetention and deportation officers. After this bill, there will be \nnearly 41,000 people protecting our border. Our long-term goal should \nbe 10,000 new border patrol agents within the next 5 years.\n  Second, this bill gives our border patrol more technology and \ntraining and aircraft. This will bolster security by, for example, \ndoubling the number of ports subject to high-risk container checks.\n  Third, this bill strengthens the infrastructure that protects our \nborders. It provides more than $300 billion for frontline defenses--\nwhich will help prevent people from entering our country illegally.\n  Fourth, this bill increases funding for detention beds by 10 \npercent--boosting the total number of beds to 23,000. It does no good \nto increase our border patrol forces and border monitoring technology \nif we don't have the space to hold illegal aliens while their cases are \nbeing processed.\n  Simply put, we should not release individuals with criminal ties. \nInstead, our nation should detain them until their cases can be heard.\n  Over 400,000 individuals--nearly as many as live in Atlanta--have \nsimply walked away from orders of deportation and removal. This is \nunacceptable.\n  By adding detention space, we can make sure that people entering the \ncountry illegally are not released back into the country while we are \nin the process of trying to send them back home. In all, this bill \nincreases total spending on border security by nearly 12 percent for a \ntotal of nearly $10 billion.\n  I congratulate Chairman Gregg and Senator Byrd for their leadership \nin bringing this bill to the floor.\n  Immigrants have enhanced our history. And they will enhance our \nfuture. But we must make sure they to America legally. It's a matter of \nsecurity in a time of war. It's also a matter of morality for a caring \nnation and a nation of laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/14/senate-section/article/S8248-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) On February 6, 2002, Director of Central Intelligence \n     George Tenet testified that ``[A]l Qaeda or other terrorist \n     groups might also try to launch conventional attacks against \n     the chemical or nuclear industrial infrastructure of the \n     United States to cause widespread toxic or radiological \n     damage.''\n       (2) On April 27, 2005, the GAO found that ``Experts'' agree \n     that the nation's chemical facilities present an attractive \n     target for terrorists intent on causing massive damage. For \n     example, the Department of Justice has concluded that the \n     risk of an attempt in the foreseeable future to cause an \n     industrial chemical release is both real and credible. \n     Terrorist attacks involving the theft or release of certain \n     chemicals could significantly impact the health and safety of \n     millions of Americans, disrupt the local or regional economy, \n     or impact other critical infrastructures that rely on \n     chemicals, such as drinking water and wastewater treatment \n     systems.''\n       (3) As of May 2005, according to data collected pursuant to \n     the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA), a worst-case release of chemicals \n     from 2237 facilities would potentially affect between 10,000 \n     and 99,999 people, a release from 493 facilities would \n     potentially affect between 100,000 and 999,000, and a release \n     from 111 facilities would potentially affect over one \n     million.\n       (4) On April 27, 2005, the GAO found that EPA RMP data was \n     based on a release from a single vessel or pipe rather than \n     the entire quantity on site and that ``[A]n attack that \n     breached multiple chemical vessels simultaneously could \n     result in a larger release with potentially more severe \n     consequences than those outlined in `worst-case' scenarios.''\n       (5) On April 27, 2005, the GAO found that ``Despite efforts \n     by DHS to assess facility vulnerabilities and suggest \n     security improvements, no one has comprehensively assessed \n     security at facilities that house chemicals nationwide.'' GAO \n     further testified that ``EPA officials estimated in 2003, \n     that voluntary initiatives led by industry associations only \n     reach a portion of the 15,000 RMP facilities. Further, EPA \n     and DHS have stated publicly that voluntary efforts alone are \n     not sufficient to assure the public of the industry's \n     preparedness.''\n       (6) On June 15, 2005, Thomas P. Dunne, Deputy Assistant \n     Administrator for the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency \n     Response of the EPA testified that ``[O]nly a fraction of \n     U.S. hazardous chemical facilities are currently subject to \n     Federal security requirements'' and that ``we cannot be sure \n     that every high-risk chemical facility has taken voluntary \n     action to secure itself against terrorism.''\n       (7) On June 15, 2005, Robert Stephan, Acting Undersecretary \n     for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection and \n     Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection at the \n     Department of Homeland Security testified that the Department \n     ``has concluded that from the regulatory perspective, the \n     existing patchwork of authorities does not permit us to \n     regulate the industry effectively.'' Stephan further \n     testified that ``[I]t has become clear that the entirely \n     voluntary efforts of [chemical facility] companies alone will \n     not sufficiently address security for the entire sector'' and \n     that ``The Department should develop enforceable performance \n     standards . . .''\n       (8) The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs, through a series of valuable and wide-\n     ranging hearings, has demonstrated bipartisan commitment to \n     effective Congressional action to protect Americans against a \n     possible terrorist attack against chemical facilities.\n       (B) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that the Congress should pass legislation establishing \n     enforceable federal standards to protect against a terrorist \n     attack on chemical facilities within the United States.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss one of the most \nglaring vulnerabilities in our Nation's homeland security--chemical \nplant security. This is an amendment which is agreed to on both sides. \nAt the conclusion of my remarks, I will ask for unanimous consent that \nthe amendment be agreed to.\n  It is a very simple amendment. It is a sense of the Senate that \nFederal standards should be established to protect chemical facilities \nfrom terrorist attacks.\n  I understand it is an indication of a consensus that is building \nacross this Senate and across this country and in the Department of \nHomeland Security that we have a serious issue with regard to the \ninfrastructure surrounding our chemical plants and the danger they \npresent to the population that surrounds them--the neighborhoods, the \npeople who live in these densely populated communities that surround \nthese chemical plants.\n  The State of New Jersey, which is the most densely populated State in \nthe Nation, has seven plants where more than a million people could be \nimpacted by an explosion and the release of toxic chemicals. It is a \nreal danger for our broader community, but it is true across the Nation \nas well.\n  The Pentagon and the United Nations together spent over $900 million \nover a 2-year period searching for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, \nwhen in fact those weapons, chemical weapons, anyway, are right in our \nbackyard. Unsecured chemical plants, arguably, are pre-positioned \nweapons of mass destruction right in the backyards of Americans.\n  That is why I offer this amendment today, to express the sense of the \nSenate that Congress should pass legislation establishing enforceable \nFederal standards to protect against a terrorist attack. There is a lot \nof work going on. The chair and ranking member of the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee are holding a series of hearings on \nchemical plants, I believe one even today, and they have done \ntremendous work.\n  I compliment Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman and others in \npursuing full efforts with regard to trying to establish a formula, a \nformat for securing our chemical plants across this country. I will \nwork with them shoulder to shoulder as we go forward on this effort. It \nis something I have been working on since October of 2001. So I \ncompliment them. I also thank Senators Judd and Byrd for their \ncooperation in allowing for this sense of the Senate to show there is \nmomentum behind this effort as we go forward.\n  This is something that has been recognized by every expert as we have \ngone forward, particularly post 9/11. On February 6, 2002, Director of \nCentral Intelligence George Tenet testified:\n\n       [A]l Qaeda or other terrorist groups might also try to \n     launch conventional attacks against the chemical or nuclear \n     industrial infrastructure of the United States to cause \n     widespread toxic or radiological damage.\n\n  The threat continues to become more apparent almost by the day. On \nthe day before last Thursday's criminal attacks took place in London, \nthe Congressional Research Service released a study saying there were \n111 plants in 23 States, such as those 7 in my State of New Jersey, \nthat could kill more than a million people. Preventing such a terrorist \nattack, especially against plants where they are in these densely \npopulated areas, should be one of our highest priorities.\n  These chemical plants present a clear and present danger to the \nAmerican people. We have one that sits under a freeway that feeds the \nHolland Tunnel in metropolitan New York, northern New Jersey. \nLiterally, hundreds of thousands of people transverse right over the \ntop of a chlorine plant. It is open to exposure, surrounded by 12 \nmillion people, in that particular case.\n  The GAO reported on April 27, 2005:\n\n       Experts agree that the nation's chemical facilities present \n     an attractive target for terrorists intent on causing massive \n     damage.\n\n  Economic damage and loss of life. This is an important recognition. \nThe GAO went on to say:\n\n       Terrorist attacks involving the theft or release of certain \n     chemicals could significantly impact the health and safety of \n     millions of Americans. . . .\n\n  In January of this year, Richard Falkenrath, the former Deputy \nHomeland Security Adviser to President Bush, called the threat of \nindustrial chemicals ``acutely vulnerable and almost uniquely \ndangerous.'' He said:\n\n       These poorly secured chemicals, which in some cases are \n     identical to the chemical\n\n[[Page S8250]]\n\n     weapons used in World War I, are routinely present in vast, \n     multi-ton quantities adjacent to or in the midst of many \n     dense population centers.\n\n  Falkenrath went on to testify:\n\n       Toxic-by-inhalation industrial chemicals present a mass-\n     casualty terrorist potential. . . .\n\n  I could go on and on. Expert after expert after expert has testified \nto this. On June 15 of this year, Thomas P. Dunne, the Deputy Assistant \nAdministrator for the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response of \nthe EPA, testified that:\n\n       [O]nly a fraction of U.S. hazardous chemical facilities are \n     currently subject to Federal security requirements. . . .\n\n  This is a real problem. We are not doing enough. As a matter of fact, \nthere are investigative reporters who have been able to walk on to many \nof these plants with unchallenged efforts. We need Federal standards to \naddress a real problem. It needs to be done now. So I hope this sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment moves us forward. It is right in line with what \nis being asked for by the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security testified that the Department:\n\n     has concluded that from the regulatory perspective, the \n     existing patchwork of authorities does not permit us to \n     regulate the industry effectively.\n\n  He further testified:\n\n       The Department should develop enforceable performance \n     standards. . . .\n\n  There is widespread agreement on this. I think we need to move \nforward. I encourage and support the efforts of Senators Collins and \nLieberman. It is time we move forward so we are not looking back after \nthe fact on something we have been warned, and warned time and again, \nis a danger to the American people. I hope this amendment will help us \nproceed on that.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment at the \nappropriate time. I do believe the amendment has been agreed to on both \nsides, but I do not see either of the managers on the floor, so I \nsuppose----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate on the \namendment? If not, without objection, the amendment is agreed to and \nthe motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.\n  The amendment (No. 1208) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are about to begin a series of votes. \nThere will be five votes. Many of these votes are on proposals to spend \nmoney above the allocations which we have in this budget. That is \nunfortunate and I think probably not good fiscal discipline or \nappropriate action.\n  I do think, however, it is important to look at the underlying bill \nas to its substance and its implications because I believe, through a \nbipartisan effort on the Appropriations Committee, working closely with \nthe Senator from West Virginia and other members of the committee, we \nhave been able to put together a bill which responds to many of the \nconcerns that our Senate colleagues and the American people have.\n  I think if you ask the American people what they most fear relative \nto terrorist acts in the United States, it is terrorists who get their \nhands on a weapon of mass destruction. We know if biological or \nchemical weapons were used or, God forbid, a nuclear device was used in \nany of our major cities, the damage would be overwhelming. We know from \nhis own testimony that it is Osama bin Laden's intention and the \nintention of his organizations to obtain those types of weapons and to \ntry to use them against western cultures. Why? Because they are willing \nto kill people indiscriminately to make their political points. They \nare people without regard for human life, and they are people who act \noutside the boundaries of any norm of civilization.\n  I think if you talk to most Americans, they will tell you they are \nconcerned about our borders. The fact is they read every day in the \npapers and they see on the streets situations which reflect the fact \nthat people are coming into our country unaccounted for, that we have \napproximately 3 million people every year who are entering this country \nillegally, that we have somewhere between 8 million and 16 million \npeople who are in this country illegally, that of the 300 to 500 \nmillion people who come across our borders legally, we do not have any \nidea who most of these people are and what their purposes are.\n  The vast majority of those people coming into this country legally \nare coming here to take advantage of America's good lifestyle or our \nbusiness climate or to visit us and see our Nation, which we \nappreciate. But a very small percentage, unfortunately, come here with \nill intent. And the American people rightly ask, Why is the Federal \nGovernment unable to control our borders?\n  Of course, there is a history to this. We are a nation that has \nalways honored the openness of our borders. I remember growing up in \nNew Hampshire, as does the Presiding Officer. We took great pride as a \nnation in the fact that people in the northern tier could travel into \nCanada and people from Canada could travel into the United States at \nwill. They did, and they still try to. They still do, to a large \ndegree.\n  People along our northern border in the New England region shop in \nCanada for their groceries. They get their haircuts in Canada. They \ntake their boats up across the Canadian border and go fishing. And the \nsame goes the other way. It used to be historically, until the Canadian \ndollar got a little weak, that the No. 1 tourist in New England was a \nCanadian coming down to take advantage of our coastlines or our \nmountains and enjoy the summer weather.\n  So this relationship has built up over literally hundreds of years. \nBut now we have to be more vigilant. We know that, and especially along \nour southern border, where not only are there people coming across the \nborder who are coming here to seek jobs, but there are people coming \nacross the border who wish us ill will.\n  This bill has attempted to address this issue. We have done it in an \naggressive way. As I said, there are 3 million people coming across our \nborder illegally, as this chart shows. Of that group, unfortunately, a \nlarge number are not Mexicans. This is the biggest change we are \nseeing. For the most part, we know most people coming across our border \nwho are of Mexican lineage are seeking jobs. They are seeking a better \nlifestyle. They are trying to improve their quality of life.\n  We now also see a large number of people coming across the Mexican \nborder illegally who are not Mexicans, almost 100,000 a year. This is a \nserious problem for us because we do not know what countries they come \nfrom, and we know some of the countries they come from have a history \nof producing individuals who wish us ill will.\n  So what we did in this bill is we radically increased the number of \nBorder Patrol agents. We are trying to expand our capacity as quickly \nas we can in putting feet on the ground on the border. That is what we \nhave done here. We have added 1,000 new agents in this bill. We added \n500 in the supplemental. That is 1,500 new agents. That is actually \nmore than the Border Patrol has the capability to train--about 200 or \n300 more--but we are putting pressure on them to accomplish that.\n  We also have increased training facilities so next year we will \nhopefully be able to add 2,000 or 2,500, and the following year 2,500, \nand the following year 2,500. Our goal is to increase the number of \nBorder Patrol agents by 10,000 people over the next 4 or 5 years. But \nwe have to ramp up to it. This year we are making an aggressive step in \nthat direction with 1,500.\n  In addition, we have added over 4,100 detention beds because we know \nwhen a Border Patrol agent catches someone who is in this country \nillegally that, unfortunately, they are having to let a lot of people \ngo or send them out on their personal recognizance. That is not \nacceptable. So we added 2,200 beds in this bill. We added 1,900 beds in \nthe supplemental. We are ramping up our capacity to hold people here \nwho may be a danger to us.\n\n[[Page S8251]]\n\n  This bill is focused on threat. That is the purpose of this bill. It \nrealigns our efforts as a Senate to focus the Homeland Security effort \non what are the priority threats, the No. 1 threat being weapons of \nmass destruction. The No. 2 threat is the fact that our borders are so \nporous.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the courtesy of the Presiding Officer and the \nSenate.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1219 To Amendment No. 1124\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 10 a.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to a series of votes.\n  Under the previous order, there are now 2 minutes equally divided \nprior to a vote on amendment No. 1219 to amendment No. 1124. Who yields \ntime?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nEnsign-McCain amendment. Last year during the debate on the national \nintelligence reform bill, we adopted several of the recommendations of \nthe 9/11 Commission, including hiring 2,000 agents per year for border \ncontrol. This bill, while it is an increase over what the President \nrequested, only funds 1,000 new agents. What our amendment will do is \nfund the full 2,000. It will fund an additional 1,000 on top of what \nthe original bill does. The offset to pay for this does not increase \nthe deficit. It is all paid for under the bill. Some may question \nwhether this offset makes any sense. I believe it does because we have \nlimited resources at the Federal level, and we must spend those wisely.\n  As recently as this past Sunday, a CBS News report did a segment on \nhow some local governments were spending their dollars. These funds \nhave been used to purchase defibrillators used at high school \nbasketball games, not for national security, trailers to haul \nlawnmowers to annual lawnmower races. The program has been used to \npurchase Segway scooters at a computerized towing service.\n  I urge our colleagues to support strengthening our borders and not \nusing the money in wasteful ways.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, this amendment seeks to strengthen the \nborders, which is a good goal, but at an awful price. It could take 24 \npercent of our money away from our first responders--police, \nfirefighters, emergency technicians. In every one of the States we had \nan argument the other day that we don't get enough money for these \npeople, that whether you are from Wyoming or Kansas or Maine or New \nYork, there is not enough money for our first responders. There is \nnothing that says we have to rob Peter to pay Paul. That is the problem \nhere. It is not in strengthening the borders. It is in taking money \naway from the people every day who defend us and, since 9/11, have new \nduties. That is why both Senator Gregg and Senator Byrd, the chairman \nand ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland \nSecurity, are against this amendment. There is bipartisan opposition to \nit because our police, our firefighters, our medical technicians are \nthe ones who need the help. Don't take money away from localities to \nput into this Federal pot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1219.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, today's vote pitted two of \nAmerica's top priorities against each other in a face off over Federal \nfunding. Our national security interests are inherent is both securing \nour borders to keep terrorists out and providing first responders the \nresources they need to detect, prevent and respond to emergencies and \nterrorism.\n  The underlying bill supports 1,000 new border patrol agents. That is \na significant investment in securing our borders. The amendment we \nvoted on would have added funding for an additional 1,000 agents, but \nredirected funds away from scarce first responder resources.\n  We need to make border control and first responders copriorities. \nConsidering the existing funding in the underlying bill for 1,000 new \nborder patrol agents, I simply could not support an amendment that \nwould strip funds from our police officers, firefighters, and emergency \nresponse personnel. For most people, homeland security is really \nhometown security. Our States rely heavily on these first responder \nfunds to keep our communities safe.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1124\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the first-\ndegree amendment No. 1124.\n  The amendment (No. 1124) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1189\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to the vote on the motion to waive the \nBudget Act point of order on the Schumer amendment No. 1189.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \nbe 10 minutes on this amendment and the next one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That has previously been ordered.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment deals with air cargo. We \nhave done a very fine job in making our air travel safer when it comes \nto passengers. They are checked very well to prevent them from \nsmuggling not only metal but now explosives onto planes.\n  However, most passenger planes--more than half--carry cargo in the \nbelly of the plane. That cargo is not inspected. So somebody who, God \nforbid, would want to do damage could smuggle explosives into the cargo \nand detonate it and do just as much damage as a passenger.\n  This amendment very simply provides $302 million to provide for air \ncargo security, $200 million for existing air cargo security \ncountermeasures, $2 million for a pilot program on hardened containers, \nand $100 million for research.\n  We have learned since 9/11 that terrorists look for our weakest \npressure point. Cargo is our weakest pressure point on air travel, and \nI urge support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, this amendment would add to the deficit \nby $302 million. It exceeds the committee's allocation. More \nimportantly than that--or equally important--the Department cannot \nspend this money. The Department does not have in place yet the plans \nnecessary to pursue this type of technology.\n  The administration asked for $40 million in this account. The \ncommittee\n\n[[Page S8252]]\n\nput $50 million into this account. We believe the first focus should be \non pilot security relative to cargo, which is what we are working on \nright now, and then moving forward with technology which we are also \nworking on, but we should do it in an orderly way, and this amendment \nwould create a disorderly process and, as I said, add $302 million to \nthe deficit.\n  I hope people will vote not to waive the budget point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act point of order. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.

The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, what I have been attempting to do in \nsome of these amendments is look for our weakest pressure points \nbecause the terrorists also know where we have done things, and they \nknow where we have not done enough. A place where we are completely \nweak is truck security. We have seen that terrorists have used trucks \nto hurt us--in New York City at the World Trade Center in 1993, of \ncourse in Oklahoma City a few years later, and in Europe and around the \nworld as well. A truck loaded with explosives can do terrible damage at \na football stadium, at a skyscraper or another place that is heavily \npopulated.\n  The interesting thing is that technology does exist to track trucks \nthe way we track airplanes. It is GPS. It is not very expensive. But \nsince the truck market is so fragmented, no one company does it alone, \neven though many companies have GPS systems in their trucks, mainly for \ntheft.\n  We provide just $70 million, not very much, to develop and implement \na system for identification and tracking only of hazardous material \ntrucks--those that carry gasoline, explosives, chlorine--that could be \nused for terrible purposes. If we can't afford $70 million to do this--\nand I disagree with my friend from New Hampshire, we are not doing \nenough now--then we ought to look into the mirror. I hope this \namendment will be supported.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I point out initially that this amendment \nexceeds the budget allocation of the committee and is a deficit \nspending item. More important than that, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity does not yet have the technology nor the pilot programs \ncapable of doing this. They will be pursuing this course of action when \nthey are ready to do this in an effective and comprehensive way, and we \nwill fund it.\n  Again, there dollars are being put in a problem that there is no \nsolution for at this time. The Department has not asked for money for \nthis because they know they are not capable of handling it yet. We will \ncertainly pursue this activity, if it is appropriate, as the Department \ngets their pilot programs in place and shows that they can handle this \ntype of program. Right now it is premature. In addition, of course, it \nis deficit spending.\n  I hope Senators support the budget point of order and vote against \nwaiving it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have already been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

This bill provides for about a\n\n[[Page S8253]]\n\nquarter of that. The Border Patrol now releases 90 percent of the \npeople they catch through voluntary repatriation--90 percent. My \nfriends, anybody who comes into the United States of America across our \nsouthern border today and is from a country other than Mexico, there is \na 95-percent chance they will continue their journey to wherever they \nwant to go. We don't have enough detention facilities. We don't have \nenough beds.\n  Mr. President, here is a story:\n\n       Twenty Brazilians glided across the Rio Grande in rubber \n     rafts propelled by Mexican smugglers who leaned forward and \n     breast-stroked through the gentle current.\n       Once on the U.S. side, the Brazilians scrambled ashore and \n     started looking for the Border Patrol. Their quick and well-\n     rehearsed surrender was part of a growing trend that is \n     demoralizing the Border Patrol and beckoning a rising number \n     of illegal immigrants from countries beyond Mexico.\n       ``We used to chase them; now they're chasing us,'' Border \n     Patrol Agent Gus Balderas said as he frisked the Brazilians.\n\n  Mr. President, we have to provide sufficient facilities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1217\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nequally divided prior to a vote on a point of order to waive the Budget \nAct on the Stabenow amendment numbered 1217.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nDurbin as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Our primary goal as the Senate must be to make sure our \nfamilies are prepared and protected. That means preparing our first \nresponders. This amendment is an amendment to provide the first \ninstallment on fully investing in interoperability communications, $5 \nbillion in emergency spending, which is the equivalent of 1 month \nspending in Iraq, in order to make sure we can talk to each other--\nState, Federal, local, police, fire, and emergency responders.\n  When our cities were attacked, they were not attacking individual \ncities; they were attacking our country. No longer is interoperable \ncommunications just a State and local function. It must be committed to \nnationally to keep America safe.\n  Finally, my distinguished friend from New Hampshire I am sure will \nsay the Department still has funds that have not been allocated. My \nquestion is, Why not? Let's get about the business of keeping prepared \nand protected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit Federal employees who disclose classified \ninformation to persons not authorized to receive such information from \n                     holding a security clearance)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. No Federal employee who discloses, or has \n     disclosed, classified information, including the identity of \n     a covert agent of the Central Intelligence Agency, to a \n     person not authorized to receive such information shall be \n     permitted to hold a security clearance for access to such \n     information.\n\n[[Page S8254]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 1217\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand I have a minute now in \nopposition to the amendment by the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this will be a $5 billion budget buster. It \nis $5 billion above the allocation. Just as significant, it is declared \nan emergency. Now, under the budget rules, an emergency is something \nthat is sudden, urgent, or unforeseen. Clearly, this is not a sudden, \nurgent, or unforeseen event. In fact, we have spent over $1.8 billion \nalready on interoperability. There are significant dollars in the bill \nfor interoperability.\n  The problem with interoperability is, quite simply, no one can agree \non what the interoperability should be yet. In fact, we spent 10 years \ntrying to reach a regime on this. It is called standard P25. It has not \nbeen reached yet. We will continue to put money into interoperability, \nbut this money will be misallocated and misspent if it is put in at \nthis level. And it would clearly add to the deficit by $5 billion.\n  So I hope people will support the budget point of order to make the \npoint this is not an emergency. Should this point of order be \nsustained, there may be another vote. We will have to wait and see what \nthe Senator from Michigan wants to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to waive. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

In light of concerns regarding inconsistent \n     policy memoranda and guidelines issued to counties and \n     communities affected by the 2004 hurricane season, the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Under \n     Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response, shall \n     provide clear, concise, and uniform guidelines for the \n     reimbursement to any county or government entity affected by \n     a hurricane of the costs of hurricane debris removal.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1118\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a report describing changes made to Federal \nemergency preparedness and response policies and practices in light of \n            the May 20, 2005 DHS Inspector General's Report)\n\n       On page 100, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 5___. Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security, \n     acting through the Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness \n     and Response, shall submit to the Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House \n     of Representatives a report describing any changes to Federal \n     emergency preparedness and response policies and practices \n     made as a result of the report of the Inspector General of \n     the Department of Homeland Security, dated May 20, 2005, \n     relating to the individual and household program of the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency in Miami-Dade County, \n     Florida, in response to Hurricane Frances.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1137\n\n  (Purpose: To allow additional uses for funds provided under the law \n                enforcement terrorism prevention grants)\n\n       On page 78, line 12, strike the period at the end and \n     insert the following: ``: Provided further, That funds made \n     available under this paragraph may be used for overtime costs \n     associated with providing enhanced law enforcement operations \n     in support of Federal agencies for increased border security \n     and border crossing enforcement.''.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Collins amendment, No. 1137, would \nallow the use of law enforcement terrorism prevention funds to be used \nfor overtime costs associated with providing law enforcement operations \nin support of Federal agencies for increased border security and border \ncrossing enforcement.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this amendment by Senator Dorgan.\n  There has been considerable discussion in recent months on the need \nto improve border security. One way to do this is to increase the \nnumber of Border Patrol Agents. But it takes significant time to \nrecruit and train new Federal law enforcement agents. A more immediate \nway to improve border security is to activate our existing State, \nlocal, and tribal law enforcement partners as a back-up force in \nsupport of Federal border agents.\n  This is not a new idea. The Department of Homeland Security has \nauthorized this use with different funds\n\n[[Page S8255]]\n\nin the past. Beginning with the last Federal election period up until \nthe Presidential inauguration last January, Operation Stonegarden \npermitted reimbursement for State and local law enforcement activities \nthat assisted Federal officials in securing the border.\n  My own State of Maine participated in that operation with a great \ndegree of success. Arthur Cleaves, the Director of the Maine Emergency \nManagement Agency, told me that Maine realized the Nation's second \nhighest level of agency participation in Operation Stonegarden with 22 \nState, county, local, and tribal agencies involved. These dedicated law \nenforcement professionals assisted the Border Patrol Sector in Houlton, \nME, with increased patrols, reporting of incidents, and arrests of \nsignificant persons attempting to enter the United States from Canada. \nIn fact, according to the final report on the program's activities in \nMaine, more than 12 arrests of persons on Government watch lists were \nmade by State and local law enforcement in Maine.\n  Now, however, the Department proposes to pull the rug out from under \nborder States by allowing urban area grant funds to be used for such \nborder security efforts, but not State grant funds.\n  This approach makes no sense whatsoever. And when my staff asked, \neven the Department could not explain the rationale behind the policy \nof allowing interior cities--but not more rural border areas--to use \nFederal funds to partner with State, local, and tribal law enforcement \nto protect our borders.\n  Partnering with State and local law enforcement is a proven and cost \neffective way to buttress our Nation's Federal border security efforts. \nI urge its adoption.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1108\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding a study of the \n  potential use of FM radio signals for an emergency messaging system)\n\n       On page 100, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 519. It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security should conduct a study of the \n     feasibility of leveraging existing FM broadcast radio \n     infrastructure to provide a first alert, encrypted, multi-\n     point emergency messaging system for emergency response using \n     proven technology.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1197\n\n      (Purpose: To clarify authorization for port security grants)\n\n       On page 78, line 19 after ``based on'', insert ``risk \n     and''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1194\n\n(Purpose: To require the Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and \n   Response to proposed new inspection guidelines within 90 days of \n enactment that prohibit inspectors from entering into a contract with \nany individual or entity for whom the inspector performs an inspection \nfor purposes of determining eligibility for assistance from the Federal \n                      Emergency Management Agency)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through Under \n     Secretary for Emergency Preparedness shall propose new \n     inspection guidelines that prohibit inspectors from entering \n     into a contract with any individual or entity for whom the \n     inspector performs an inspection for purposes of determining \n     eligibility for assistance from the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1111, as Modified\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk of \namendment No. 1111, on behalf of Senator Dorgan, and ask unanimous \nconsent that it be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified and agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1111), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds appropriated under this Act may \n     be used to promulgate regulations to implement the plan \n     developed pursuant to section 7209(b) of the 9/11 Commission \n     Implementation Act of 2004 (8 U.S.C. 1185 note) to limit \n     United States citizens to a passport as the exclusive \n     document to be presented upon entry into the United States \n     from Canada by land.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1113, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \namendment No. 1113 of the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am happy that my colleagues have brought \nthese important amendments to the floor today to provide the necessary \nfunds to secure our inner-city rail, our freight rail, and our transit \nsystems. As someone representing a State, Delaware, that relishes and \nrelies heavily on rail travel, this is certainly a major concern to me \nand those I am privileged to represent.\n  In the weeks and months after September 11, we took unprecedented \nsteps to secure our Nation's airlines, and for good reason. We all know \nabout the added security--baggage checks, passenger screening--because \nwe have all seen it every time we go to an airport and try to get \nthrough an airport onto our planes. But we have not been as diligent \nwhen it comes to protecting our Nation's railways and transit systems, \nwhich is alarming given the number of people who travel by rail, and it \nis alarming when we see what has happened in Madrid and London in the \nlast months and, in fact, last days.\n  Today, nearly 25 million passengers ride Amtrak. During the course of \nthe year, that equates to about 3.5 billion rail trips taken annually \nby people looking to take a vacation, go home for the holidays, or \ntraveling for business. In fact, our railroad network is so busy that \nevery day more people use Amtrak's Penn Station in New York than use \nall of New York's major three airports combined.\n  In 2003, public transportation moved over 8.8 billion--almost 9 \nbillion--passengers, according to the national transit database. Since \n1995, public transportation ridership in the United States has grown by \nover 20 percent--faster than highway, faster than air travel. The \nAmerican Public Transit Association estimates that more than 14 million \npeople use public transportation every weekday. Yet we have done \ncomparatively little to protect rail travelers and transit travelers \nfrom terrorist attacks.\n  Nowhere is that shortfall more evident than in the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill we are debating today. Under this bill, we would \nprovide a scant 12 cents in security funds for each time a person \nboards a bus or a subway car or an Amtrak train to get to work--12 \ncents. Yet what we propose spending every time a person gets on board \nan airplane is $7.58.\n  Let me repeat that. Every time one of us gets on a Metro bus in \nWashington or boards a SEPTA train in Wilmington, DE, or southeastern \nPennsylvania, the Federal Government is providing 12 cents to protect \nour safety on that railcar or in that transit station. Yet every time \none of us flies out of National Airport, the Federal Government is \nspending $7.58--12 cents on the one hand, $7.58 on the other hand. That \nis a whopping disparity. It is one we need to correct.\n  During Senate consideration of legislation to create the Department \nof Homeland Security, I, along with several of my colleagues, tried to \nprovide funds to Amtrak to secure its trains, station facilities, and \nits infrastructure, but that language was stripped out of the bill \nduring the wee hours of the night. Some lawmakers were reluctant to \ngive Amtrak any additional funds, while others were too focused on \nresponding to the last disaster to start preparing for the next one.\n  Since then, supplying even modest amounts of rail security funding \nhas been a battle. The danger to our rail and transit system has been \nrepeatedly cited by officials at the Department of Homeland Security. \nDuring his confirmation hearing as Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security, Tom Ridge stated:\n\n       Amtrak and freight rail are at considerable risk to \n     terrorist attack.\n\n  Secretary Chertoff has also acknowledged the risk facing our Nation's \nrail and transit systems. Likewise, the 9/11 Commission concluded that \nthe risk of attacks on surface transportation is as great or greater \nthan that of any aircraft hijacking. Further, the Government \nAccountability Office has stated:\n\n       Insufficient funding is the most significant challenge in \n     making transit systems as safe and secure as possible.\n\n\n[[Page S8256]]\n\n\n  Despite these warnings, progress has been slow, results have been \nfew. The Department of Homeland Security has established no \ncomprehensive approach to rail and transit security. None. None like we \ndeveloped for airports in the wake of 9/11, that is for sure.\n  The Transportation Security Agency, meanwhile, has been working on a \nnational transportation security plan since 2003, some 2 years. Yet \nthat plan is still not complete. In the wake of the Madrid bombings in \nSpain last year that killed nearly 200 people, several of my colleagues \nand I sponsored legislation to establish rail and transit security \nprograms, just as we created an airport security program after 9/11. \nThis bill, called the Rail Security Act of 2004, was passed unanimously \nby the Senate on October 4 last year. Although the House did not act on \nthis bill, we did succeed in securing $150 million in funding for rail \nand transit security in the fiscal year 2005 Homeland Security \nappropriations bill, which is in effect today. However, only a year \nlater, the fiscal year 2006 Homeland Security bill reported out of \ncommittee cut that figure by a third, down to $100 million for the next \nfiscal year.\n  Last week, more than 50 people were killed, some 700 people were \ninjured when terrorists bombed the London underground. It is time that \nwe learn from these tragedies and develop a long-term, comprehensive \napproach to strengthening security of our Nation's rail and transit \ninfrastructure. We cannot continue to ignore our transit systems or \nAmtrak or their passengers or the need to secure the hazardous material \nthat travels across our freight lines throughout this country.\n  There has been a bipartisan effort to increase funding for rail and \ntransit security. We hear people talking about increases in the \nmagnitude of hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars. \nThis may sound like a lot of money, but keep in mind, this bill \nincludes nearly $4.5 billion for airline security. In fact, while \nCongress has spent almost $20 billion on aviation security since 9/11, \nonly $400 million has been spent on rail security.\n  In other words, we have spent 50 times more money on airline security \nsince 9/11 than we spent on rail and transit security combined.\n  No one is arguing that airline security is not necessary--it is \nnecessary--but is the risk 50 times greater to our airlines and to \npeople who fly on our airlines than to public transportation systems, \nto the millions of people who ride transit every day and who take \ninner-city passenger rail across America? I would argue that it is not.\n  We have made some progress securing air travel in the wake of 9/11, \nalthough I would argue, and I think most of us would agree, that there \nis more that we can and should do. The amendments we are considering \ntoday, though, call for a similar level of focus and attention to be \nbrought to the security needs of our Nation's rail and our transit \nsystems and to the literally, in the course of a year, billions of \npeople who ride transit and who ride Amtrak.\n  We should be taking a serious look at ways to help railroads, States, \ncities, and transit agencies do what they can to improve security \nefforts, such as hiring more police, putting out more bomb-sniffing \ndogs with those police, improving ventilation, improving lighting, and \nestablishing escape routes in tunnels.\n  Amtrak, freight railroads, and local transit agencies are doing all \nthey can, but the Federal Government, we in Congress, have not done our \nshare. It is time we stand up and take some responsibility in this as \nwell. We need to, and can do so, before the disasters that struck \nMadrid and London strike us at home.\n  I yield back my time and ask unanimous consent that the time during \nthe quorum call be divided equally between either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am told that the time has been running \nagainst the 15 minutes, and I may have less than that. But if I run out \nof time, I have been authorized to maybe take as much as 5 minutes off \nof Leader Reid's time. Hopefully, I will not get to that point.\n  I rise today to support the Byrd rail security amendment. I know even \nthough the Presiding Officer is new to this body he is aware I have \nbeen like a broken record for the past 4 years about rail security. \nWhen I look at the clerk, she probably thinks: Here he goes again \nbecause I have been talking about this so much since 9/11.\n  Quite frankly, we have an abysmal record, an irresponsible record, \ndealing with rail security. For the longest time, we had trouble in \n2002, 2003, 2004, up until 2005, getting any traction. We have passed \nserious rail security bills, including Amtrak, in the past under the \nleadership of Senator McCain, and Senator Hollings, who was my seatmate \nfor years, who is now gone. The McCain-Hollings-Biden amendment that \nwas passed called for $1.2 billion. We even passed a $1.7 billion \namendment. The House and the President seem--I do not know what it is. \nI just do not get it. I thought that maybe this time around my \ncolleagues in this body would understand that, as my dad, God love him, \nused to say before he died, if everything is equally important nothing \nis important.\n  There are priorities. How there could be anything from a tax cut to \neven an education program that could take priority over dealing with \nour homeland security is beyond my comprehension. I do not get it. But \nobviously we are not prepared to do what I was prepared to introduce, \nand did introduce the beginning of the week, to add $1.1 billion for \nrail security, which would have brought the total number for rail \nsecurity up to $1.2 billion, which was in the bill we passed last time \naround which would have provided $670 million to deal with security in \ntunnels and the places where cataclysmic events could take place--$65 \nmillion, $4 million immediately to Amtrak to go out and buy canine \npatrols, put more cops on, put in cameras and detectors, secure the \nswitching stations, and all the things that lend themselves to \nproviding for a catastrophe. The bottom line is I do not have the votes \nto get that done.\n  So I joined with Senator Byrd, who has been a leader in this area, in \nmy sincere hope that $265 million for rail security in this amendment, \nwhich is one-fourth of the amount passed in the Rail Security Act of \n2004 last October, will actually pass.\n  The positive piece is that although it does not give us a straight \nline to deal with the long-term security interests of rail, it would \ngive them enough money and all the money they could reasonably spend in \n1 year to be able to begin to upgrade our system.\n  The tragedy in London has focused the Congress and the Nation on rail \nsecurity again this week, but quite frankly I learned from Madrid. I \nthought Madrid would be a wake-up call. I thought after Madrid people \nwould say: Hey, Biden, you are right, man. We have a real problem with \nrail. We should really do something about this.\n\n  Nothing, nothing, nothing happened. Now, our closest ally and friend \nmaybe gives us a different perspective on the floor. The Madrid attacks \nshould have done it, but they did not. Our negligence to this point has \nbeen inexcusable.\n  Many of us have been talking about this for years. The bottom line is \nthat nearly 4 years after September 11, over 1 year after Madrid, our \nrail system is as vulnerable as it was 4 years ago.\n  I met earlier this week in my office with the head of Amtrak security \nand all of his attendant folks. I cannot reveal publicly everything I \nlearned, but it is quite alarming. Let me talk about a few things I can \nreveal. Critics argue that we cannot protect, for example--there are \n22,000 miles of rail in this country, and critics say: Joe, you cannot \nprotect all 22,000 miles.\n  That is a little bit like saying we cannot protect the airlines. We \nshould not have air traffic controllers because we get baggage put in \nthe holds that are not inspected? Now, is there anybody on the floor \nsaying that?\n  Right now one gets on a plane and the baggage that is put in the hold \nis not inspected thoroughly like the baggage that is carried on. But is \nanyone\n\n[[Page S8257]]\n\nsaying we should not spend the money on TSA to inspect the people going \nthrough the gates? Of course not. Let us not make the perfect the enemy \nof the good.\n  The fact that we cannot do everything does not mean we do not do \nanything. That has been the mantra with regard to rail.\n  As I said, the argument is 22,000 miles cannot be protected, but \nguess what. We can prevent a Madrid or a London-style attack in the \nUnited States. We can make our rail system much safer and reduce the \nchance of attack because we understand that the terrorists want \nspectacular, cataclysmic attacks with large body counts in this Nation. \nBecause we know that, we can narrow our focus to critical areas such as \nstations and tunnels, areas that security experts and common sense, as \nwell as the CIA, tells us are the most vulnerable.\n  When I first did this 4 years ago, people said, oh, my God; do not \npoint out that the Baltimore Tunnel was built in 1869, has no \nventilation, no lighting, no escape, no way out. You are going to alert \nthe terrorists. The terrorists know this. They know all the \nvulnerabilities. The problem is the American public does not know. So \nthere is not enough pressure put on all of us here to make the right \ndecision.\n  For example, every day over one-half million people pass through New \nYork's Penn Station. This morning there were more people sitting in an \naluminum tube below New York City--aluminum tube meaning a train car--\nthan in a half dozen full 747 aircraft. Tell me what happens when sarin \ngas is released there. Tell me what happens when there are a series of \nexplosions that far underground. Tell me what happens if anything \nremotely approaching a chemical weapon is used. There is no \nventilation.\n  Riding in New York City today in the tunnels one will see \nconstruction going on, as it should, with these great big things that \nlook like jet engines being put up in the ceiling. That is ventilation, \nexhaust. So, if something goes off in the tunnel, 2 people or 20 people \ndie, not 200 or 2,000.\n\n  Do you know what the single most visited facility in all of \nWashington, DC, is? It is 2 blocks down the street. I walk to it every \nnight: Union Station. More people visit Union Station than any other \nfacility in Washington, DC.\n  Go down there with me, Mr. President, and get on a train with me, as \nI do every night, and stand on the last car as you ride out of the \nstation. Look; tell me if you identify a single camera. Tell me if you \nidentify any barbed wire fencing around the switching devices. Tell me \nwhether you see any security. Tell me whether you see any guards.\n  There are a half-million people going through the station at Penn \nStation, and do you know how many police officers are on duty at any \none time there? Twelve. There are 12 in New York, 5 in Union Station.\n  As I said, if you walk over there with me right now, you will find no \nreal police presence, no fencing, inadequate security cameras, all of \nwhich anybody with common sense would say made no sense.\n  For some reason, there is an animus toward Amtrak in Washington. I \nkind of figured it out, actually. I think a lot of folks here think \nthat it is a back-door way of funding Amtrak. Otherwise, I can't \nunderstand why you wouldn't do this, after the billions we spend on \nairlines, as we should. I am not talking about Amtrak subsidies here; I \nam talking about protecting American lives.\n  In addition to the 64,000 daily riders on Amtrak, there are 23 \nlocations where Amtrak facilities, stations and rails, overlap with \ntransit facilities. In the Northeast corridor, Maryland Area Regional \nCommuter, has 400,000 daily commuters that utilize Amtrak--400,000 \ndaily commuters on MARC that utilize Amtrak facilities. They walk in \nthe station, get in a car, and it gets on an Amtrak track.\n  My friend from Rhode Island can tell me more about the transit \nsystems in Rhode Island, and New York Transit, and Long Island Transit, \nand Connecticut Transit--et cetera. They all use Amtrak facilities.\n  Amtrak can only pay a starting salary of $31,000 to its police \nofficers, and I cannot pay them more than $38,000, no matter how long \nthey have been there, and they have a 10-percent vacancy rate on the \nforce right now. Most of these positions are in New York and Washington \nwhere they need them most, but very little anyplace else. As I stated, \nin an amendment I proposed to add $1.1 billion for rail security, but \nthe Byrd amendment only comes up with some $240 million right off the \nbat. We can use it. We can use it desperately. It is my understanding \nthe Committee on Commerce and Transportation is going to mark up a \ncomprehensive rail bill again next week, but we cannot wait for that. \nWe need this $200-plus million right now. The $265 million in the Byrd \namendment will provide urgent funding for Amtrak, including 200 \nadditional police officers, 40 additional canine patrols, and improved \nfencing, lighting, and basic cameras--just basic block-and-tackle \nequipment that, if we have them, we can save thousands of lives.\n  The London bombers were identified by an expansive system of closed-\ncircuit television in the London Metro. They have roughly 6,000 high-\nquality cameras there. We don't have anywhere near that capacity. We \nneed that capacity.\n  Another area that needs attention is the transportation of hazardous \nchemicals. We have already voted this down before but, God, we should \nrethink this. The Naval Research Laboratory was asked what would happen \nin an attack on a traditional 90-ton chemical tanker. If you look at a \ntrain at a railroad crossing, you see the freight rail go by and you \nsee these tankers--not containers, tankers; the whole car is one unit. \nYou see them go. They are about 90 tons.\n  A 90-ton chlorine gas tanker, having an IED like those that explode \nin the streets of Baghdad placed under it on a track or under the \ntanker, exploding in a metropolitan area, according to the U.S. Naval \nResearch Laboratory, will kill up to 100,000 Americans. Do you hear me \nnow? One chlorine tanker exploding in a metropolitan area will kill \n100,000 Americans. And we have trouble getting Homeland Security to \ncome up with a plan to force these kinds of tankers to circumvent the \npopulation areas? Because it costs more money? It costs business more \nto do that. It costs more in the products we will buy. My Lord, what \nare we doing?\n  I might add to my friends in the Congress, when you leave Union \nStation and you head south to Richmond, you go under tunnels. Do you \nknow what the tunnel goes under? Straight under the Supreme Court and \nunder the House Office Building. If you explode a chlorine tanker \nunderground, under that, you implode the Congress, you implode the \noffice building called the Supreme Court.\n  If you want to make a statement--again, these are the IEDs, the \nroadside bombs that are killing our brave soldiers every day in up-\narmored humvees. There is no camera to detect anybody walking through \nthose tunnels. There is no security. And we sit here like darned fools \nand say, No, that costs money. That is going to cost us money.\n  I understand the procedural restrictions will prevent us from \nconsidering that bill today, but I think this is a critical issue, one \nwe simply have to address. I am going to be pushing this legislation \nuntil the cows come home.\n  After Madrid and London, we simply have run out of excuses not to \nact. This Byrd amendment does not solve every problem, but it goes a \nlong way toward dealing with the beginning attempt to prevent \ncatastrophic damage to American infrastructure and American lives. We \nwill never be able to stop someone placing a bomb on a track somewhere \nalong the 22,000 miles of track we have. We will only be lucky, one in \nthree or one in ten times, with a dog getting someone who walks on a \ntrain with dynamite or K-2 strapped to their body or carried in their \nknapsack.\n  But to use that as an excuse to do virtually nothing, or to use it as \nan excuse that this breaks the budget--give me a break. We are breaking \nthe budget on the inheritance tax. We are breaking the budget on an \nadditional tax break for the superwealthy. We are breaking the budget \non so many less worthy expenditures than homeland security.\n  There is much more to say, but I know my colleagues, over the last 5 \nyears, are tired of hearing me say it.\n  I have a prayer, a literal prayer, that I never have the occasion to \nwalk on\n\n[[Page S8258]]\n\nthis Senate floor and say: We should have done this and we failed.\n  For God's sake, you guys and women who are going to vote on this, \nthink about it in terms of how will you explain to the American people \nif something tragic and preventable happens after having voted against \nmeasures that, if put in place 4 years ago or put in place now, had a \nreasonable prospect of preventing it? That is a question I think you \nhave to ask yourself.\n  I will end where I began, with my dad. My dad used to say:\n\n       Champ, if everything is equally important to you, nothing \n     is important to you.\n\n  Every hard decision we make is about priorities. I ask the rhetorical \nquestion: What priority is higher than the public safety of the \nAmerican people in the face of a demonstrable threat that isn't going \naway?\n  I yield the floor. I see my friend from Maryland is on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Before my distinguished colleague from Delaware leaves \nthe floor, I want to commend him for his perseverance in pressing this \nissue. This is clearly not the first time he has brought this matter to \nour attention. I want to underscore what he said in closing. Obviously, \nthere is a threat, and we need to address this threat. This is the \nopportunity to do it.\n  Rail, transit--we know they are high on the target list. The GAO \nactually did a study. One-third of all terrorist events that occurred \nhave involved transit systems around the world. Last year, in fact, we \npassed legislation, an authorization for transit to do $3.5 billion \nover 3 years--$1.1 billion this year. An amendment to come later, \nSenator Shelby's amendment, addresses that and tries to provide \nappropriations at the authorized level.\n  The rail also cries out for an appropriate appropriation, which is \ncontained in the Byrd amendment that is part of this package we are \ngoing to be considering here. But the Senator from Delaware is \nabsolutely correct. This is our chance to provide the resources so we \ncan begin to do the obvious things that need to be done. There is a \nwhole list of them. Every one of them is common sense. None of them is \nsort of a potential waste of money. All the transit people, the rail \npeople tell us we need to do these things, and if we can do these \nthings, it would substantially enhance security.\n  It wouldn't guarantee security. We live in a world where we can't \nguarantee security. But it would enhance it, surely.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield for a comment, the Senator, who \nlives in Baltimore and has commuted to Baltimore every day for the last \n20-some years--more than that, from when he was in the House--he will \nremember that there was a fire in an automobile tunnel going into \nBaltimore Inner Harbor a couple of years ago. It shut down all of \nBaltimore in the harbor region.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Right.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Just that fire. Even if there were not a terrorist threat, \nthe idea that we are continuing to have, in and out and under the \nBaltimore harbor, this antiquated, 150-year-old tunnel, without any \nreasonable upgrade, is mind-boggling.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely correct. The infrastructure \nwe are trying to work with is an infrastructure from a previous \ncentury. That alone needs to be significantly improved.\n  Actually, the British are confronting that problem now. One of their \ndifficulties is that this deep tunnel, from many years ago, access to \nit is extremely limited.\n  We have to get started. That is what it comes down to. We have to get \nsmart. These amendments, the Byrd amendment and the Shelby amendment, \noffer us a chance to take a significant step in order to enhance our \ncapabilities.\n  I thank the Senator for his very strong statement.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, I compliment the Senator from \nMaryland. This is not a mutual admiration society, but he has \njurisdiction in the Banking Committee over surface rail, intracity \nrail, and he has taken care of this amendment. I realize he wanted to \nreach out further and take Amtrak into this, but he does not have that \njurisdiction.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is not in our committee.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I know.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Amtrak is not in our committee.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is my point.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. But the Senator wanted to do it, and he could not \njurisdictionally do it. That is why I appreciate his support for the \nByrd amendment as well. That is the only place we could pick up a piece \nof Amtrak.\n  I see my friend from New York. There are a million people in Penn \nStation today--more people, as I said--sitting at rush hour in an \naluminum tube underneath New York City than a half dozen full 747s, and \nwe are doing nothing about it.\n  I thank the Senator from Maryland. He has done a great job. And I \nthank Senator Shelby. I hope we can move it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nafter Senator Sarbanes speaks for his 7 minutes that I speak for the 10 \nthat I have been allotted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will be brief. I want to rise again in very strong \nsupport of the amendment that Senator Shelby the chairman of the \nBanking Committee has proposed, and also to underscore, as I just did \nin my discussion with the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, that I \nsupport the Byrd amendment which is also before us, which encompasses \ninner-city rail as well as transit. The amendment offered by Chairman \nShelby deals only with those items under the jurisdiction of the \nBanking Committee.\n  The point I want to underscore is, this body unanimously passed, last \nyear on October 1, the Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention Act \nof 2004. That bill authorized $3.5 billion in 3 years for the security \nof our Nation's mass transportation system, and of that amount $1.16 \nbillion was scheduled for fiscal year 2006, which would begin to \naddress the critical security needs that exist in the thousands of \npublic transportation systems in our country.\n  The amendment offered by Chairman Shelby seeks to bring the \nappropriation in line with the Senate-approved authorized level--\napproved by the Senate unanimously, brought out of the Banking \nCommittee unanimously. Clearly, after the tragic attack in London last \nThursday, which has now claimed 52 lives and over 700 injured, we need \nto fully fund transit security at the Senate-authorized level.\n  This body understood the problem last year. We established these \nauthorization levels. We now need to provide the appropriations to \ncarry through on the programs that are proposed to enhance transit \nsecurity.\n  In 2002, GAO found that over one-third of terrorist attacks worldwide \nwere against transit systems. Yet the funding for transit and rail \nsecurity has been grossly inadequate. Those systems have not been able \nto implement necessary security improvements, including those that have \nbeen identified by the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The Baltimore Sun wrote in an editorial on Friday:\n\n       Since September 11, 2001, the Federal Government has spent \n     $18 billion on aviation security. Transit systems, which \n     carry 16 times more passengers daily, have received about \n     $250 million. That's a ridiculous imbalance.\n\n  I could not agree more. There are obvious necessities that are \nneeded--security cameras, radios, training, extra security personnel. \nThose are not extravagant requests.\n  Let me give you one example right here in the Washington metropolitan \narea. Washington Metro's greatest security need is a backup control \noperations center. This need was identified by the Federal Transit \nAdministration in its initial security assessment then identified again \nby the Department of Homeland Security in its subsequent security \nassessment. This critical need remains unaddressed because it has not \nbeen funded. We need to pass these amendments in order to provide the \nfunding.\n\n[[Page S8259]]\n\n  The same situation exists in transit systems across the country. We \nmust not make this mistake. We need to put the resources out there so \nthe transit and rail systems across the Nation can begin to address the \nserious potential targets which exist for terrorist attack.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment offered by the chairman \nof the Banking Committee which deals with transit security, and I join \nwith others in supporting the amendment that has been offered by \nSenator Byrd which encompasses not only that security but rail security \nas well.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent, that my colleague from Rhode \nIsland immediately precede me with his allotted time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, might I inquire--I do wish to seek \nrecognition on behalf of the manager, but I would like to know how long \nthe Senator is expected to speak.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have already gotten unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REED. I am informed we have to go back and forth. I ask to modify \nthe request that when Senator Cornyn concludes, I would be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am here to address the various amendments we have on \nrail security, but I also must speak about something that occurred in \nthe last few hours related to mass security.\n  Mr. President, I know Secretary Chertoff. I was proud to support his \nnomination. I was proud to support his nomination to the Federal bench. \nHe is a smart man, he is a thoughtful man, he is a capable man. But \nwhen I read the statements that he made this morning, I was aghast. \nThese are some of the most appalling comments that I have heard coming \nfrom any Government official in a long time.\n  First, Secretary Chertoff said that the responsibility for transit \nsecurity must rest with the localities. And then he said the following:\n\n       ``The truth of the matter is that a fully loaded plane with \n     jet fuel, a commercial airliner has the capacity to kill \n     3,000 people,'' Chertoff told Associated Press reporters and \n     editors.\n\n  And then he continues:\n\n       A bomb in a subway car may kill 30 people. When you start \n     thinking about your priorities, you are going to think about \n     making sure you don't have the catastrophic thing first.\n\n  I would like Mr. Chertoff to ask the people in London if what \nhappened last week was minor in passing or the people in Madrid--the \nchaos, the loss of life. To say what happens on the subways because it \nmight only kill 30 people is less of a priority for this Federal \nGovernment than what might happen in the air is an appalling statement \nthat leaves me aghast. I am asking Mr. Chertoff immediately to withdraw \nhis statement and apologize, apologize to those who have lost loved \nones and apologize to every transit user in New York and around the \ncountry.\n  Our responsibility, I would tell the Secretary, the responsibility of \nthe Federal Government is to prevent terrorism in the homeland wherever \nit occurs--in the air, on the rails, in the water. To simply wash the \nFederal Government's hands of responsibility at a time when this \nGovernment is cutting back on mass transit funding and the localities \nhave very little money is an abdication of responsibility.\n  I know I am speaking in strong terms, but if Mr. Chertoff professes \nthese views, then I am not sure he should continue as the Secretary of \nHomeland Security. And as I said, I respect him. He is a smart man, he \nis a bright man. But I could hardly believe it when I read this and \nwhen a reporter asked me about it that it came out of his mouth. When I \nsat down with Mr. Chertoff when he was the nominee, he didn't voice any \nof these views. In fact, Senator Clinton and I took a tour with him of \nGrand Central Station, and he seemed fully to understand the needs of \nmass transit in terms of homeland security. And now we have a 180-\ndegree about turn?\n  I hope and pray that Secretary Chertoff misspoke, because every one \nof our citizens on transit--whether in the air, on the water, on rail, \nor on the road--is our responsibility to keep safe and prevent \nterrorism from afflicting them.\n  If this administration has embarked on a new policy which says that \nwe will protect people in the air but not on the rails and washes its \nhands of that responsibility, then they ought to let America know, and \nthey will be facing the fight of their life on this floor and in this \ncountry.\n  Here we are, debating amendments to try to get some more money for \nhomeland security on the rails because we know we are so short of \ndollars, and at the same time we are hearing from the Secretary of \nHomeland Security that our rails, our commuters don't need that money. \nI would like Mr. Chertoff to go to Grand Central Station or Penn \nStation or to the Atlantic Avenue Station in Brooklyn or the Woodlawn \nStation in the Bronx and tell the commuters there that Washington \ndoesn't have the responsibility to protect them from terrorism. Let him \nface them directly and say that to them. Let him go to them and tell \nthem that it is all up to the local governments even though we know we \nhave declared since 9/11 that the war on terror is largely a Federal \nresponsibility.\n  So it is really that I rise to speak about this subject with some \nsadness because, as I said, I like Mr. Chertoff, I have respect for Mr. \nChertoff. And, again, I would repeat my plea. Secretary Chertoff, \nplease retract your remarks. Apologize to those who use mass transit \nand the rails and let us agree that the Federal Government has a real \nresponsibility to protect the rail riders of this country from \nterrorism.\n  Now, in my remaining time I would simply like to address the \namendments. I salute my colleagues from Alabama and Maryland and Rhode \nIsland for their amendments. We have learned since London and Madrid \nthat transit seems to be the terrorists' target of choice. Madrid may \nhave been our first wakeup call and London was our second. We ignore it \nat our peril.\n\n  Mass transit systems are open. They bring in lots of commuters all at \nonce. And they prove to be, unfortunately, a tempting target for \nterrorists.\n  What is our responsibility? It is not what Mr. Chertoff says. It is, \nrather, to step up to the plate and provide funding as we do in the \nair. For every air passenger, we spend $7 on homeland security. For \nevery rail passenger, we spend a penny. That is out of whack. The \namendment by Senators Shelby and Sarbanes, Reed, myself, and many \nothers moves to address that.\n  We need to do so many things in mass transit. I have called my folks \nin New York. We hope in the longer run we can develop detection devices \nthat, like smoke detectors, can tell when explosives are brought on a \ntrain or in railroad stations, whether on someone's person or in a \nknapsack. But until we do, their No. 1 need is for explosive-sniffing \ndogs. They are desperately short. Yet the President's proposal does not \nallow that to happen. There will be a colloquy that urges that to \nhappen.\n  We are short of transit patrolmen. I have been told, for instance, on \na heavily populated commuter line there is only one police officer who \npatrols about 10 stations that handle tens of thousands of commuters \nevery day over a 30- or 40-mile expansion of commuter rail on Long \nIsland.\n  Structure changes are needed to strengthen subways and tunnels so \nthat, God forbid, if a terrorist attack occurs maybe the structures \nwill withstand it. We need signage and help for the tunnels to have \nescape routes and ventilation to minimize loss of life if terrorism, \nGod forbid, occurs.\n  I rise in support of this badly needed amendment. We have neglected \nmass transit when it comes to homeland security. We are trying to \nredress that in a bipartisan amendment.\n  I also mention, of course, Senator Byrd's amendment which deals with \ntransit and rail, which I will support. Senator Gregg's amendment, \nwhich takes $200 million out of port security and adds it to transit \nand rail, is robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  The terrorists look for our weakest pressure point and strike there. \nRail at this point is our weakest pressure point. We should strengthen \nit. To take money from ports, where we have not\n\n[[Page S8260]]\n\ndone the job, and put it in rail does not make much sense because if we \nstrengthen air security, they will look to the rails. If we strengthen \nrail security, they will look to the ports. If we strengthen port \nsecurity, they will look to the trucks.\n  As the war on terror overseas must be fought on many fronts, so must \nthe war on terror at home. To pick, as Mr. Chertoff does, one place \nwhere the Federal Government is going to put its efforts and ignore the \nothers, is not doing a service to our citizens. Therefore, we must do \nmore to strengthen security on the rails.\n  The best thing we can do to show the Nation that Mr. Chertoff's \nstatement was not what America needs is to vote for the Shelby-\nSarbanes-Reed amendment and the Byrd amendment, as well.\n  How much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will take my 20 seconds to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1205\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment proposed \nby Senator Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, myself, and Senator Schumer to \nincrease the allocation for transit security to $1.1 billion. Let me \nput that in perspective.\n  That is roughly 1 week's operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. I \nbelieve the American people would look at us and say: If we cannot \ninvest that fraction of money to protect Americans here, how can we so \nconsistently invest that money overseas? I think it is essential, \nobviously, to protect our forces and our troops and to make those \ncommitments in Iraq and Afghanistan. But I think it is also essential \nthat we protect Americans here at home. That is the essence of our \namendment.\n  We have 6,000 transit systems in the United States. They have 14 \nmillion riders every workday. All these transit systems need assistance \nfrom the Federal Government to provide increased security, to protect \nAmericans here at home. That is the purpose of our amendment and the \npurpose of our debate today. The purpose of this bill before the Senate \nis to provide resources to protect Americans here at home.\n  Like my colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, I was dismayed to \nhear of the comments by Secretary Chertoff today essentially saying \nthere is no Federal support for transit, that it has to be done by the \nStates. Not only do I object to the conclusion, I question the logic. \nAccording to the press report I heard, Secretary Chertoff said the U.S. \nGovernment, the Federal Government, has to support airlines because \nthey are almost exclusively a Federal responsibility, but, by contrast, \nU.S. mass transit systems are largely owned and operated by State and \nlocal governments.\n  Well, I do not know where the Secretary flies in and out of, but in \nRhode Island, TF Green Airport, the major airport in the State, is \nowned by a State corporation. The airlines that fly in and out are \nprivate airlines, not Federal airlines. Yet we have provided \nsignificant resources--and properly so--to enhance the security of the \nairline sector in the United States because of several obvious and \ncompelling reasons. The threat is there. After 9/11, we would have been \nderelict if we did not recognize that. These are key parts of our \neconomy.\n  Oh, by the way, for most of the airline systems, the terminals are \nowned by State and local governments, and the operators are private \nentities, much like transit facilities. Similarly, with transit \nfacilities, the threat is there. After London, we would be derelict if \nwe did not recognize the potential for an attack on our transit systems \nin the United States and to respond before an attack, not after an \nattack. That is why we are here today--to respond before any attack \ncould evolve here in the United States, to respond effectively at home.\n  Indeed, Federal support of transit has been historically a fact of \nlife over the last several decades. Since 1992, we have invested in the \norder of $68 billion in Federal money to construct and improve our \ntransit systems. There has been Federal money going to local transit \nsystems for construction and improvements. And then to argue--either \nMr. Chertoff or others on the floor--it is inconsistent for us to \nsupport these systems with security money is illogical and \nunsustainable.\n  The threat is there. The need is there. I believe the responsibility \nshould be here to provide some assistance. Again, we could not possibly \ndo all that we must do. There must be cooperation by State and local \ngovernments. There has to be. They have responsibilities to their \ncitizens and the passengers on these systems also. But there is a real \nFederal responsibility, one we will recognize today, I hope, by \nsupporting the Shelby-Sarbanes-Reed amendment.\n  This is not just a regional issue of one part of the country. Most \ncities in the United States today have some transit system. Our largest \ncities have rather elaborate transit systems. Miami has light-rail and \nbus. Las Vegas is constructing a monorail with private funds to \nsupplement their transit system. All of these are very attractive \ntargets to terrorists.\n  There is one other disconcerting factor that is emerging after \nLondon. We have to be terribly concerned about those al-Qaida \noperatives, who have been training for years, who have been plotting \nfor years to enter this country, or they may already be here, to \nconduct some type of terrorist attack. But, unfortunately, after \nLondon, we have to be concerned about another category, and that would \nbe the homicidal and suicidal amateur, young men who are influenced by \nsomeone else to go ahead and sacrifice themselves. For these relative \namateurs, what is a more attractive target today? An airport with a \npronounced police presence?\n  As I drive off to TF Green Airport in Rhode Island, there are always \ntwo or three police cars parked outside. It is a modest, medium-sized \nairport with police officers on patrol. When you go into a lobby, it is \nfull of TSA personnel with screening devices, and you have to take your \nshoes off, your coat off, to get through the screening to get on an \nairplane. Also, by the way, since we monitor passenger lists, every \nairline has an algorithm to determine whether you are subject to \nspecial searching. It happens occasionally to me. Is that their target \nof choice? Or just simply getting on the local bus or going into the \nlocal subway today, which is virtually without protection?\n\n  So we really have significant responsibilities in this regard. To \nsuggest otherwise is inappropriate. It is wrong. I believe we have to \nsupport this amendment. We recognize that over the last several years \ntransit has become one of the most significant targets for these \nterrorist groups.\n  After 9/11, in the Banking Committee, as the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Housing and Transportation, I convened a hearing and we \nhad witnesses. They came forth. They indicated, first, the lack of \npreparedness of our transit system for potential attacks by terrorists. \nIndustry experts estimate we would need roughly $6 billion to bring our \ntransit systems up to a level of security that we would be comfortable \nwith. That is one factor.\n  The other factor is the fact that those resources are not easily \nobtained by local communities. We understand the pressures for local \ntransit agencies. It is difficult to raise fares. It is difficult to \nget increased subsidies in State legislatures or local communities. All \nof that really compromises the ability to move dramatically and \naggressively with transit security.\n  We also asked the General Accounting Office to do an evaluation. \nTheir conclusions were interesting. First, they estimated that a third \nof the terrorist attacks in the last several years have been directed \nat mass transit. Again, it is a target of opportunity for these \nterrorists. And their conclusion speaks volumes. In their words:\n\n       [I]nsufficient funding is the most significant obstacle \n     agencies face in trying to make their systems more safe and \n     secure.\n\n  Now, in light of that, Senator Sarbanes and myself have repeatedly \nurged this body to adopt more robust funding for transportation \nsecurity. We have proposed amendments with respect to supplemental \nappropriations bills. We have proposed amendments on other bills \nappropriating funds for the Department of Homeland Security. And we \nhave offered amendments with respect to the National Intelligence \nReform Act.\n\n[[Page S8261]]\n\n  Indeed, the Senate recognized this need quite dramatically just last \nCongress, where, working with the chairman of the committee, Chairman \nShelby, who is, again, leading this great effort, we were able to pass \nauthorizing legislation that would authorize approximately $3.5 billion \nover several years to begin to deal with this issue of transit \nsecurity. The authorization recognized our Federal responsibilities. \nAnd as my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, pointed out previously, this \nappropriations bill would be consistent with that authorization, which \npassed this body unanimously on a bipartisan basis.\n  So today we are here simply to do what should be obvious to all of \nus, particularly after the dreadful, horrific events in London. People \nwho think it cannot happen here should think again. People who think \nthis is not our responsibility should think again. We have an \nobligation, a responsibility. We have already spoken as a Senate last \nCongress with respect to the authorization. Now it is our obligation to \nput the resources there to the task. The task is improving the security \nand the safety of passengers on our transit systems throughout this \ncountry.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support the Shelby amendment.\n  Also, Mr. President, I am supporting Senator Byrd's amendment because \nhe, too, recognizes the need for additional security, not only for \ntransit systems but also for intercity train systems. I also recognize \nthat significant need. So I would hope we could come together and vote \nenthusiastically and appropriately.\n  The irony here, of course, is we all recognize--and we all pray this \nwill never happen--but if there was a terrorist transit incident, we \nwould be on this floor within hours voting for much more than $1.1 \nbillion. If we act today, promptly and appropriately, we may be able to \navert that situation. I hope we can.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains on \nthis side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has been divided between nine \ndifferent Senators.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield the 30 seconds to \nthe Senator, if that is appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Shelby amendment \nof $1.1 billion. I come even more to express complete frustration with \nthe statements today of Secretary Chertoff on mass transit. This is a \nnational issue. It is one that is connected with interstate commerce. \nMost importantly, protecting the American people is a primary \nresponsibility of Government. The idea that we would turn our backs on \nthe 228 million riders a year on mass transit in the State of New \nJersey and put it at some second-class level of consideration makes no \nsense at all. Tens of thousands of riders every day ride the trains in \nand out of New York City from New Jersey, in and out of Philadelphia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The time of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland has expired.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I support the $1.1 billion Shelby amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Reid has 8 minutes, Senator Byrd has \n12 minutes; Senator Sarbanes has 1 minute; Senator Shelby, 15; and \nSenator Gregg, 34 minutes.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for up to 8 \nminutes from the time of Senator Reid of Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Let me go back to the start of my comments. I support \nthe Shelby amendment of $1.1 billion for mass transit and rail. It is \nabsolutely essential that we think of our Nation as one, where all \naspects that pull us together and provide for the services of the \npeople of this country are protected. We are not dividing up those who \nfly on airlines versus those who drive on highways. When Americans are \nat risk, Americans are at risk. The concentration of risk can be \ndifferent in different places at different times. I suggest anybody who \nwants to see large concentrations of people at any moment in time come \nwith me to Hoboken train station. Every workday you will see literally \ntens of thousands of people transferring from one train track to subway \nsystem or bus system.\n  It is hard for me to conceive, frankly, that we can get ourselves to \nbelieve that the only exposure of the American citizenry is to air \ntravel. Two hundred twenty-eight million riders per year in New Jersey \nuse mass transit. Many of these congregate in large areas. It is \nabsolutely essential that we enhance our security, and this is what the \nShelby amendment is about.\n  I hope my good friend, Secretary Chertoff--and I do consider him a \ngood friend and someone for whom I have great respect--will reconsider \nthe thought that was expressed today that somehow or another this is a \nlower priority. It certainly is not a lower priority on the terrorists' \nminds. It wasn't in Madrid or Moscow and, unfortunately, it was not in \nLondon most recently.\n  Not only is this a mistake with regard to our homeland security \npolicy, but it is like putting a bull's-eye on a certain sector of our \ninfrastructure where people and the economy come together. It is to say \nthat we are going to lay all this responsibility on already budget-\nstrained State and local governments who have not been able to provide \nthe security and say: Come get us. We don't want to give the emphasis \nto an area where there are many people and where our economy moves back \nand forth and through which it functions.\n  The principle that we are not going to focus on rail and mass transit \nprotection makes no sense whatsoever. The way to stand up to that is to \nvote for the Shelby amendment, put $1.1 billion into mass transit, rail \nsecurity. I hope my colleagues will follow that path.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the status of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire controls 34 \nminutes; the Senator from Alabama, 15 minutes; the Senator from Nevada, \n4 minutes; the Senator from West Virginia, 12 minutes. That is the \nbalance of the time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to review this issue because it is \nimportant in the context of London to understand our purpose and how we \nare proceeding from a policy standpoint to try to address terrorism. To \nbegin with, we all know and understand and are all concerned about the \nthreat to public transportation, specifically mass transportation, in \nour Nation and in any western culture because of what has happened in \nMadrid and in London and because the people who have decided to pursue \nthis heinous approach of killing innocent individuals see this \nopportunity as a soft target, an easy way to kill indiscriminately. It \nis hard for western cultures to understand that people would do that. \nUnfortunately, that is what our enemies do.\n  We as a nation must decide how we can best address protecting \nourselves. It is important not to take the attitude that if we just \nthrow money at this, we will solve the problem. That doesn't work. What \nwe need to do is address the risk, the threat, and determine what is \nthe best way to respond to that risk and that threat.\n  When we were attacked on 9/11, we recognized as a nation that the \nindividuals who seek to harm us are willing to take what we would \nconsider everyday modes of transportation and use those modes of \ntransportation as a weapon against us. Those airplanes were used as \nmissiles. So as a nation, we decided we were not going to allow that to \nhappen. We have committed vast resources--no question about it--to \nmaking sure that our aircraft are secure from being used as missiles. \nHave we secured them from being able to be blown up or destroyed in the \nair? No, we have not, quite honestly. We have had test after test that \nhas shown that regrettably, even though we have this massive structure \nof the TSA and even though we have committed literally billions of \ndollars, we are still unable\n\n[[Page S8262]]\n\nto essentially protect aircraft, a high percentage of the time, from \nsomeone who wishes to bring on that aircraft a destructive weapon such \nas a bomb. In fact, we are having trouble keeping out individual types \nof weapons such as knives and guns. The percentage of those going \nthrough the security systems has been shown to be, in some instances, \nunreasonably high.\n  The reason is because a committed professional terrorist--and that is \nwhat we are dealing with--has the capacity to use weapons systems which \ncan go undetected, going through this massive system that we have set \nup known as the TSA. That is something we are trying to address. We are \ntrying to develop new technologies. There are new technologies emerging \nwhich will hopefully allow us to detect explosives that might go on an \naircraft. But as of now, our capacity is not overwhelmingly good, even \nthough we have spent billions of dollars.\n  What we have been able to accomplish is that it will be very \ndifficult for a terrorist to actually take control of an aircraft again \nand use it as a weapon. That was our priority.\n  Now we have seen what has happened in London. The simple fact is, \neven though we spent billions of dollars at very confined ports of \nentry--in other words, an airport is a pretty confined place, pretty \neasily managed compared to other places when it comes to the movement \nof people in and out, everything has a fairly focused place--we have \nnot yet been able to adequately or fully secure aircraft from a variety \nof potential attacks. It has to be obvious to anyone who is honest \nabout it that our capacity to fully secure transit in New York City, \nwhere you have literally factors of a hundred more people using \naircraft as entering and exiting--the number is something like 10 \nmillion people a day use that system. We have tracks that go on \ncontinually through populated areas that could be where IEDs could be \nput under the tracks, where you have innumerable places where people \ncan jump on and jump off, thousands of different entry points--anybody \nwho has any intellectual honesty about how we pursue terrorism must be \nready to say: There isn't enough money in the Federal Treasury to \neffectively address securing the entire transit system in the manner \nwhich is being proposed in these amendments, which is that you put more \npolice officers on trains, more bomb dogs on trains, more detection \nfacilities in the entryways, more electronic surveillance.\n  We wish it could be done, but we haven't been able to do it in the \naircraft area where we have spent billions, and the ability to do it in \nthe transit area is a factor of complication 1,000 times more difficult \nwith which to deal.\n  Thus these dollars which are being proposed today are not going to \ndramatically increase safety. They well may have some visual impact, \nand they will give people personal confidence. But as the mayor of New \nYork said a couple days ago, a committed professional terrorist who is \nwilling to give their life in order to kill other people is going to be \nable to attack that train, to attack that bus system.\n  How do you address this? The key to addressing it is as Secretary \nChertoff has made very clear. It is unfortunate that his words have \nbeen hyperbolized so much on the floor of the Senate and have been used \nin a political manner. This is a sincere man who is trying to do a good \njob. He is just getting started as Secretary. For him to be subjected \nto politicization in the Senate is not constructive to the process of \nthe defense of our country from terrorists, but he has been, as so \noften happens around here. What he has pointed out in his review is the \nway we protect our transit systems is to get better intelligence. It is \nintelligence that is the key. You have to find these people before they \nfind us. You have to catch them before they get to our systems, and \nthen you deal with them.\n  How do you increase intelligence? First, you go to where the breeding \nground is for the people who are most likely to attack you--Iraq, \nAfghanistan. Most of the good intelligence we are generating today \ncomes from the fact that we are in Iraq fighting these terrorists over \nthere rather than fighting them over here. We are in Afghanistan \nfinding these terrorists before they can find us. And then we either \nget intelligence from them there or, if they are really bad people who \nare fundamentally evil, we take them to Guantanamo Bay and we lock them \nup. Then, under very strict regimes which meet all the responsibilities \nof a civilized society, we interrogate them and find out information, \nintelligence.\n  A large percentage of our intelligence comes out of Guantanamo Bay. \nSo you aggressively pursue the intelligence efforts, and that means you \naggressively pursue the war in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and you use places \nsuch as Guantanamo Bay.\n  In addition, you use our laws effectively. The PATRIOT Act, which has \nbeen so aggressively maligned from some of the Members actually \noffering this amendment, is a key element in developing the \nintelligence necessary to find out through electronic means what is up \nwith the people who might want to attack us before they do so.\n  Some of the same people who want to put a billion dollars into \ninitiatives which we know cannot significantly impact our capacity to \nsecure the transit systems are so resistant to allowing the PATRIOT Act \nto be reauthorized, which provides the tools that will give our people \nat the FBI and other intelligence sources the capacity to find out what \nthese people are doing by electronic means.\n  And then, of course, there are issues like profiling. The simple fact \nis there are certain people coming from the Middle East whom we know \nare going to be the type of folks who are going to potentially attack \nus. Profiling is a necessary element of finding them and getting them \nbefore they can attack us. Most of that activity--intelligence \ngathering--does not fall under this bill.\n  What does fall under this bill is border security. That is a big part \nof this whole question of how you protect the transit systems and \neverything else in America. It is not just transit systems; this \ndoesn't stop with transit systems. If you are a terrorist--if you \nfollow the logic of the Senator from Rhode Island--you are going to \njust move on to the next site of soft opportunity, which may be a \nsporting event or a utility system where they are transmitting power or \nmaybe some other facility where people gather.\n  We are an open society and a massive democracy. We simply cannot lock \nourselves down completely. So that is why the intel exercise is so \nimportant. Part of that is securing our borders, which is critical. \nPutting more money into securing our borders is what the bill does. \nPutting more money to making sure we are able to detect a weapon of \nmass destruction before it is used against us is what this bill does. \nThose are threats we can handle with more dollars. Those are the \nthreats we can have an immediate impact on with more dollars--with a \nlot more dollars. This bill moves a lot more dollars into these \naccounts--over $600 million in the Border Patrol, and hundreds of \nmillions in weapons of mass destruction issues. But to simply throw \nanother billion dollars on the table because there is a political \nelement behind the implications of doing that is not going to resolve \nthe problem.\n  In fact, in the end, that will probably aggravate the issue because \nwe will be taking scarce resources--which we have to allocate because \nwe live under a philosophy that we only have so many funds--and putting \nthem into an account where we cannot, A, use it; or, B, if we use it, \nit might be wasted, and if we use it ineffectively, its impact might be \nat the margin versus if you move the funds into areas where we get a \nresponse that produces results, such as in the intelligence area, \nBorder Patrol area, weapons of mass destruction area. That is why this \nbill has been set up the way it has been set up.\n  So, yes, I don't deny that we can spend another billion dollars on \nmass transit. I am sure every mass transit authority in the country \nwill be happy to replace their local spending with new Federal dollars, \nor even add it onto their spending. But will it dramatically impact the \nsecurity of those transit systems, other than a visual impact? No. \nLet's be honest, it will not.\n  The only way we are going to secure transit systems or sports events \nor other major gathering sites is to find these people before they find \nus. That is why the war in Iraq is so important and the war in \nAfghanistan is so important, and that is why maintaining a vibrant \nfacility in Guantanamo where we\n\n[[Page S8263]]\n\ncan incarcerate and interrogate these people in an appropriate way, \naggressively, is important. It is why the PATRIOT Act and profiling and \nborder security are important.\n  Those are the priorities on which we should be focused. So I have to \noppose both amendments by Mr. Shelby and Mr. Byrd. I respect them both, \nand I understand where they are coming from. I respect their \ninitiatives to try to do something here. Within the context of the \nbudget, we have put the money where we think we can most effectively \nuse it, which, as I have outlined, has been weapons of mass \ndestruction, border security, and airlines.\n  So I will be opposing both of these and making a point of order that \nthey will exceed the budget allocation and exceed our allocation within \nthe Appropriations Committee, and that both amendments would add a \nbillion dollars to the deficit.\n  I have, however, listened to my colleagues saying we need more money \nin mass transit. We have offered an amendment which would move $100 \nmillion out of first responders into mass transit. It would mean we \nwould be $50 million above last year's spending in those accounts. If \nMembers wish to pursue that course, I hope they will vote for that \namendment because it is a responsible amendment and an affordable one, \ndone within the context of the bill, which has a structure built around \naddressing threat first.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how are the quorum calls being charged?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The quorum calls are charged to the Senator \nwho controls time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am fairly confident that earlier, at the \nbeginning of this section, I asked that all quorum calls be charged \nequally in relationship to the time allocated. In fact, I am absolutely \nconfident that I made that unanimous consent request. However, I will \nrenew that unanimous consent request at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nrestored in the context of that request, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1205\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on amendment No. \n1205 on which we will soon be voting. This is an amendment I offered \nyesterday to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. I \nam joined by several cosponsors, including the ranking member on the \nBanking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, and also Senator Reed and many \nothers.\n  As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction \nover transit security, I can tell you that the committee has a long \nhistory of interest in this issue, and many of my colleagues on the \nBanking Committee join me in supporting this amendment.\n  This issue has been on our radar screen for some time. In fact, last \nyear, the Banking Committee reported the Public Transportation \nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The Senate passed it unanimously. \nThis was a thoughtfully considered bill, written with significant input \nfrom the industry and terrorism experts alike. The amendment I am here \nto speak on today is consistent with that Senate-passed authorization \nbill.\n  The amendment before us provides $1.166 billion for public \ntransportation security. This provides $790 million for capital \nimprovement grants, $333 million for operating grants, and $43 million \nin research. I am the first to admit this is a large sum and that we \nmust balance our spending on public transportation with other \npriorities to defend our homeland. I am more than willing to work with \nChairman Gregg to identify appropriate ways to do that.\n  It is difficult for us to predict where terrorists will strike next, \nbut in order to help prevent or mitigate the severity of attacks, I \nbelieve we need to focus on transit security and make some wise and \ncareful investments in this area. To the extent it is possible, I think \nwe must guard against what the world witnessed last week in London and \nwhat we have seen in Spain, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Russia, and \nother countries.\n  When the GAO surveyed the transportation security needs of eight \ntransportation agencies in 2002, the GAO estimated these eight alone \nwill need $700 million in order to make basic security enhancements.\n  In this Nation, there are 6,000 transportation agencies. The needs \nare significant. Americans are proud of being an open society with many \nfreedoms, but, unfortunately, it makes us potentially vulnerable. We \nbuilt many of our subway stations and rail and bus stations in ways \nwhich we now realize in a post-9/11 world need some extra \nreinforcement. The funding in this amendment provides that first step. \nIt is a good first start, and that it is a necessity I do not believe \nis in question.\n  The funding made available by this amendment is broken down into \nthree components: No. 1, capital; No. 2, operating; and No. 3, \nresearch. The money will provide transportation providers with the \nability to provide basic security enhancements. With this amendment, we \ncan build fences so that intruders cannot enter tunnels or plant bombs \nby walking up to the tracks. We can purchase surveillance equipment in \nand around transportation centers, which is how the British have been \nable to find who carried out last week's attacks. The British, I have \nbeen told, have over 5,000 surveillance cameras, and they are working. \nWe have very few.\n  We can provide communications equipment to help passengers, \ntransportation officials, and first responders in the event of an \nemergency. We can fund fire suppression and decontamination equipment \nand redundant critical operations control systems, such as a backup \ncomputer system so that one well-placed bomb cannot shut down an entire \nsystem. As well, this would fund emergency response equipment--which \ncould save hundreds of lives in a terrorist incident--and evacuation \nimprovements, such as emergency routes or escape route signs. \nAdditionally, the amendment would provide money to train and help \ndeploy canine units which can contribute immensely to improved \nsecurity.\n  The amendment before us also would provide funding for transportation \nagencies to carry out drills so they will be better prepared in case of \na terrorist attack. It is one thing to know how the plan works on \npaper, but quite another to see how the plan works in practice.\n  Finally, the amendment also provides funding for critically important \nresearch in determining ways of detecting chemical, biological, or \nradiological weapons in ways that do not interfere with the ease of \npassengers using transportation systems. This is one of the greatest \nobstacles toward providing better security in typical commuter \ntransportation environments.\n  I seriously believe we must provide resources toward mitigating these \nsecurity threats, and we must do so as soon as possible.\n  As I mentioned yesterday on the floor, as an appropriations \nsubcommittee chairman myself, I can certainly appreciate the challenge \nSenator Gregg, the chairman of the subcommittee, faces as he attempts \nto address the multitude of security challenges in this appropriations \nbill. Attempting to find the balance is important and, in the end, we \ncould have infinite resources to spend and still not be totally \nprotected. We know this.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Gregg and other Members of \nthe Senate. I commend this amendment to my colleagues and ask for their \nsupport a little later this afternoon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8264]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to offer some thoughts on the \nappropriations bill regarding homeland security. Being the shepherd of \none Interior bill a couple of weeks ago, I can understand the problems \nthat arise whenever we start into this business of making the \nappropriations to make our Government work. I congratulate Chairman \nGregg and Senator Byrd and other members of the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee because they have changed direction on this \na little bit with regard to our borders.\n  Every time I go to my home State of Montana the borders are talked \nabout. I know it is probably one of the most difficult areas over which \nwe are given the command to protect. I have said it before, and I will \nsay it again, we have to secure our borders. Particularly, we know \nabout the situation on our southern border, but we have always been \nunderstaffed and underfunded and overlooked on the northern border, \neven after September 11, 2001.\n  We are faced with the task of patrolling the longest stretch of \nunprotected international border in the United States, nearly 550 miles \nof border in Montana. We have the same pressures there from terrorists, \ndrug runners, and criminals. They can cross that border, enter our \ncountry, and do harm to our citizens.\n  Make no mistake, we have made some progress. Again, I congratulate \nthe chairman of the subcommittee on this bill. We were able to gain \nabout 500 new Border Patrol agents along the northern border to relieve \nsome facility overcrowding earlier this year in a new appropriation. \nMeanwhile, however, we have to look at the numbers. Over 500 million \npeople cross our borders each year, 330 million of whom are not U.S. \ncitizens. Where do these people go?\n  The committee has recognized we can no longer allow for the gaps in \nour national security. It has taken the proper steps to ensure that we \nhave a plan in place to secure our borders.\n  I congratulate the chairman because these bills are difficult at \nbest. But when we start talking about our borders, the security of our \ncountry, it takes on a whole new look. So I want to thank the managers \nof this bill for their work and their recommendations. It is too \nimportant to ignore any longer. It is my hope we can get this bill \npassed with a proper plan in place to secure our borders and get it to \nthe President's desk.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1218\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd be \nadded as a cosponsor to my amendment No. 1218.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, nearly 4 years have passed since the \nevents of \n9/11, yet rail and transit security remain major vulnerabilities.\n  The warning signs cannot be clearer. Public transportation and rail \nsystems are a primary target for terrorist attacks. Last week's transit \nbombings in London follow similar attacks in Madrid, Moscow, Tel Aviv, \nand Seoul, and each attack has produced massive casualties, caused \nbroad economic disruption, and generated widespread fear.\n  We have already been warned twice publicly by the FBI that al-Qaida \nmay be directly targeting U.S. passenger trains and that their \noperatives may try to destroy key rail bridges and sections of track to \ncause derailments.\n  We know that more than one-third of all worldwide terrorist attacks \ntarget transportation systems, with public transit the most frequently \ntargeted transportation mode.\n  Despite the significant threat to transit and rail systems and the \nSenate's unanimous approval of the Rail Security Act last year, \nsecurity funding has remained grossly inadequate. As a result, our \nNation's transit and rail systems have been unable to implement \nnecessary security improvements.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues this afternoon in supporting an \namendment that increases rail security by $265 million in fiscal year \n2006.\n  This funding level is not fictional. It is absolutely justifiable and \nnecessary. Of the total amount proposed in our amendment, $65 million \nwould be for Amtrak security, and Amtrak officials have verified they \ncan obligate that funding amount in fiscal year 2006.\n  An additional $40 million would be for Amtrak tunnel safety, and \nAmtrak could obligate this funding in fiscal year 2006 for tunnels in \nNew York, Baltimore, and the District of Columbia.\n  Of the total amount provided for by the amendment, $120 million would \nbe for passenger and freight rail security grants, similar to the \nfunding level authorized in S. 2273, the Rail Security Act of 2004, \nwhich the Senate passed unanimously last year.\n  Additionally, $35 million would be provided for rail security \nresearch and development. Again, the level is similar to the funding \nthat the Senate has previously approved.\n  Finally, $5 million would be for a Transportation Security \nAdministration, TSA, rail security risk assessment.\n  Just yesterday, Secretary Chertoff announced his plan to reorganize \nthe Department of Homeland Security. He mentioned two points I would \nlike to close with. First, he noted that increased preparedness should \nfocus on not only risk and threat, but also consequences. We are all \naware of the devastation that could result from a London-style attack \non our transit and rail systems.\n  Second, he noted in his prepared materials that the TSA will continue \nto be the lead agency for intermodal transportation.\n  I couldn't agree with him more, and this amendment gives him the \nnecessary funding to support his renewed focus on rail and transit \nsecurity.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my amendment provides an additional $1.3 \nbillion above the underlying bill for needed security funding for our \ntransit systems, intercity rail, freight rail, and intracity buses for \na total of $1.4 billion. The funding levels I am proposing in this \namendment are based on two bipartisan rail security authorization \nbills, S. 2273 and S. 2884, which passed the Senate last October.\n  Public transportation is used nearly 32 million times every day, 365 \ndays a year. Thirty-two million times a day is 16 times more than \ntravel on domestic airlines. How about that. According to the \nGovernment Accounting Office, nearly 6,000 agencies provide transit \nservices through buses, subways, ferries, and light rail service to \nabout 14 million Americans every weekday. Amtrak, while serving nearly \n500 train stations in 46 States, carried an all-time record of \nridership of 25 million passengers in fiscal year 2004.\n  Freight rail consists of more than 140,000 miles of track over which \nnearly 28 million carloads move annually, including over 9 million \ntrailers and containers and $1.7 million carloads of hazardous \nmaterials and hazardous waste. Yes, only 2 cents--get this now, 2 \ncents. My colleagues have heard the expression, ``I want to get my 2 \ncents' worth.'' Well, only 2 cents on every transportation security \ndollar in this bill--can you believe it? Only 2 cents on every \ntransportation security dollar in this bill goes to transit or rail \nsecurity. Can you believe that? Two cents.\n\n  I remember the days of the 2-cent snack--my, that was a long time \nago--and the penny postcard. Two cents. Let me say that again. Someone \nmay not have heard that. Only 2 cents on every transportation security \ndollar in this bill goes to transit or rail security. The rest, where \ndoes it go? To aviation security.\n  When the terrorists blew up trains last year in Madrid, Spain, the \nadministration had no plan, none, for securing transit and rail \nsystems. The horrific bombings a few days ago in London have raised the \nsame question. Are we prepared? What do my colleagues think? Are we \nprepared? Are we prepared? According to the RAND Corporation, between \n1998 and 2003 there were approximately 181 terrorist attacks on rail \ntargets worldwide. Since 2001, I have offered seven different \namendments--think of it, seven different amendments--to fund rail and\n\n[[Page S8265]]\n\ntransit security. What do my colleagues think of that? What do they \nthink happened? I will give one guess. I offered seven amendments to \nfund rail and transit security. All seven were opposed by this \nadministration, and all seven were defeated.\n  Well, Robert Bruce, that great Scotsman, was lying in the loft of the \nbarn, and he saw this spider try to throw its web across the roof on \nthe inside of the barn. He saw that spider try six times, and the \nspider failed. But the spider then threw once more, seven times, and \nsucceeded. Robert Bruce thought he would try once more. He did, and he \nsucceeded. I offered an amendment seven times that was opposed by the \nadministration.\n  While we cannot secure every train, every station, and every \npassenger who uses mass transit or rides on trains from city to city, \nwe can, with the additional funding I am proposing, implement prudent, \ncommonsense actions to reduce the risks and consequences of a terrorist \nattack.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may have an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. We must harden infrastructure, install \nintrusion and detection systems, and procure cameras, locks, gates, \ncanine teams, and other tools.\n  The Gregg amendment provides an increase of only $100 million for \nrail and transit security. That level simply will not be enough. It \nwill help some, but it would not be enough to help transit and rail \nagencies in their efforts to deter a potential attack. For transit \nalone the estimate of need is $6 billion.\n  I am also concerned that the amendment reduces first responder funds \nby $100 million. This is a $100 million cut on top of the $467 million \ncut already in the bill. We should not be cutting funds to equip and \ntrain our police and our fire and emergency medical personnel by 24 \npercent.\n  With regard to the Shelby amendment, I am concerned that it includes \nonly $100 million for securing rail systems. With 25 million passengers \nriding Amtrak and 1.7 million carloads of hazardous materials being \ncarried on the rails, we must do more. We must do more to secure our \nrail system. My amendment includes $265 million for rail security.\n  Our thoughts, our prayers are with the victims of the London bombing. \nThe horrific events the world witnessed a few days ago ought to serve \nas a call to action, a call to action by this Government, our \nGovernment, to protect our citizens from future attacks.\n  It is time to act. I urge all Senators to support my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Salazar be added \nas a cosponsor to my amendment numbered 1218.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1220, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have a modification of my amendment No. \n1220 which I send to the desk and ask be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to further modification?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask the \nquestion respectfully, would the distinguished Senator wait \nmomentarily, until we can hear from Senator Inouye? If he could wait a \ncouple of minutes, may I ask?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes. I reserve my request and make a point of order a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask again the modification I sent to the desk be \naccepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                amendment no. 1220, as further modified\n\n       On page 77, line 15, strike ``For grants,'' down through \n     and including ``tection plan grants.'' and on page 79, line 6 \n     insert the following:\n\n     For grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, and other \n     activities, including grants to State and local governments \n     for terrorism prevention activities, notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, $2,694,300,000, which shall be \n     allocated as follows:\n       (1) $1,418,000,000 for State and local grants, of which \n     $425,000,000 shall be allocated such that each State and \n     territory shall receive the same dollar amount for the State \n     minimum as was distributed in fiscal year 2005 for formula-\n     based grants: Provided, That the balance shall be allocated \n     by the Secretary of Homeland Security to States, urban areas, \n     or regions based on risks; threats; vulnerabilities; and \n     unmet essential capabilities pursuant to Homeland Security \n     Presidential Directive 8 (HSPD-8).\n       (2) $400,000,000 for law enforcement terrorism prevention \n     grants, of which $155,000,000 shall be allocated such that \n     each State and territory shall receive the same dollar amount \n     for the State minimum as was distributed in fiscal year 2005 \n     for law enforcement terrorism prevention grants: Provided, \n     That the balance shall be allocated by the Secretary to \n     States based on risks; threats; vulnerabilities; and unmet \n     essential capabilities pursuant to HSPD-8.\n       (3) $465,000,000 for discretionary transportation and \n     infrastructure grants, as determined by the Secretary, which \n     shall be based on risks, threats, and vulnerabilities, of \n     which--\n       (A) $200,000,000 shall be for port security grants pursuant \n     to the purposes of 46 United States Code 70107(a) through \n     (h), which shall be awarded based on threat notwithstanding \n     subsection (a), for eligible costs as defined in subsections \n     (b)(2)-(4);\n       (B) $5,000,000 shall be for trucking industry security \n     grants;\n       (C) $15,000,000 shall be for intercity bus security grants;\n       (D) $195,000,000 shall be for intercity passenger rail \n     transportation (as defined in section 24102 of title 49, \n     United States Code), freight rail, and transit security \n     grants, including grants for electronic surveillance system, \n     explosive canine teams, and overtime during high alert \n     levels; and (E) $50,000,000 shall be for buffer zone \n     protection plan grants.''\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I now make a point of order under section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that the amendment provided by \nSenator Byrd provides spending in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is an amendment to increase funding in \nthe mass transit area by $100 million which is done by taking that \nmoney out of a different account, specifically the State and local \nfirst responder account. The reason that account was chosen was, as we \ndiscussed before, there is over $7 billion of unspent money in those \naccounts.\n  To the extent the States have the capacity to handle that money, we \nwill make sure they get additional moneys, but right now they have more \nmoney than they can handle in those accounts.\n  This will be within the budget.

Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the purposes of the pending amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time for debate yielded back?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like my minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I realize this is a good bit of money. I \nam a member of the Appropriations Committee. I serve on the committee \nwith Senator Gregg. I believe, though, we have been spending pennies as \nfar as transit security is concerned--that is subways, buses, and \neverything else--as opposed to airline security, which both are \nimportant.\n  We know what happened last week in London. They have over 5,000 \ncameras for surveillance. It helped them a lot. I think we have to ask \nourselves, Are we going to make that big downpayment toward security \nfor our people, the millions who ride buses, subways, and trains every \nday? This is the first step in that direction.\n  I ask for your support of this amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to speak about the \npending amendments on rail and transit security. One is offered by my \ncolleague and friend from Alabama.\n  I know firsthand his breadth of knowledge and leadership on \ntransportation issues, as we worked together for many years as leaders \non the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  I am confident that his amendment will help address the transit \nsecurity problem in our country in a necessary and effective way.\n  One amendment is offered by my colleague from West Virginia, Senator \nByrd. His amendment goes beyond the Shelby amendment and includes \nfunding for our national freight and passenger rail transportation \nsystems as well. This funding is crucial for the security needs of \nAmtrak.\n  Each year, the Bush administration and Amtrak opponents in the \nCongress fight to cut funding for Amtrak to provide rail services to \n500 stations in 46 States.\n  So as Congress and the administration bicker, 68,000 daily passengers \nrely on Amtrak using some of its Federal transportation operating grant \nfor security purposes.\n  My point is that if we don't fund Amtrak's security needs in this \nbill, it must come out of the transportation budget, where resources \nare limited.\n  Last week's attacks in London--like previous attacks on subway \nsystems in Madrid and Moscow--highlighted the importance of securing \nour entire transportation system--and especially public transit.\n  Since 9/11 we have made huge strides in the aviation sector. But the \nwords of the 9/11 Commission still haunt us:\n\n                Rail and Port Security--the Next Threat\n\n       Over 90 percent of the Nation's $5.3 billion annual \n     investment in the TSA goes to aviation--to fight the last war \n     . . .\n\n[[Page S8267]]\n\n       Opportunities to do harm are as great, or greater, in \n     maritime or surface transportation.--9/11 Commission Report, \n     p. 391.\n\n  When are we going to start seriously taking the notion that we must \nsecure our homeland from terrorist attack?\n  Every day, more than a half a million riders in New Jersey get on a \nbus. Another 340,000 board an Amtrak or commuter train, and another \n30,000 a light rail car. That is a total of 870,000 people--as many as \nthe total populations of States served by some of our colleagues.\n  These citizens depend on public transit to get to their jobs, to \nschool, and to visit family and friends. And they are depending on us \nto protect our rail and transit systems from terrorists.\n  Rail and transit systems move people efficiently because they are \nopen systems, but unfortunately that also makes them vulnerable to an \nattack.\n  The State Department reports that from 1991 to 1998 violent attacks \nworldwide against transportation targets went from 20 percent of all \nthose attacks to 40 percent. And a growing number of these are directed \nat bus and rail systems.\n  Securing our country will take resources. For every week that we are \non orange alert, one New Jersey public transit operator is forced to \nspend an extra $100,000. That is on top of a security budget that has \ndoubled since 9/11.\n  As I said earlier, Amtrak spends tens of millions of dollars of its \nDepartment of Transportation operating grant on security. This funding \nwill upgrade stations and other critical facilities and will improve \nsecurity operations of transit systems. It will also help train our \nfrontline employees.\n  A report by the Mineta Transportation Institute found after studying \nthe events of 9/11 that prompt action by frontline employees can save \nlives. It goes on to say that ``Transportation employees are also first \nresponders, so they require training and empowerment.''\n  Transit operators must take effective steps to reduce the risk of \nterrorist attack. And they need the resources to do it.\n  In addition to the commuters who rely on transit systems daily, \nsenior citizens, students an disabled persons are especially reliant on \ntransit. For many, it is their only way to get to medical appointments, \nschool and other important destinations.\n  We can't afford to wait until there is a major terrorist attack on a \nU.S. transit system. We must act now. Let's do what our \nresponsibilities demand of us and protect our citizens when they travel \nas well as when they are at home, at work or at school.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Shelby-\nSarbanes transit amendment. This amendment increases transit security \nfunding by $1.1 billion. It is endorsed by both the Chicago Transit \nAuthority and Metra, the commuter rail agency serving Chicago and all \nof northeastern Illinois.\n  The amendment would provide $790 million for public transportation \nagencies for capital security improvements, $333 million for \noperational security improvements, and $43 million for grants to public \nor private entities to conduct research on terrorist prevention \ntechnologies. This money would be doled out to agencies based on risk.\n  The amendment seeks the funding needed to fund a bill passed by the \nSenate in 2004 known as the Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention \nAct.\n  After the London bombing last week, we became acutely aware of how \nvulnerable our transit systems are in this country, although some of us \nhave been concerned about these problems for years.\n  Since the London bombing, transit systems across the Nation have been \nupgraded to an Orange Alert level, meaning more canine patrols, \ndeployment of explosive detection devices, increased security guard \npatrols, and increased customer assistance. A significant amount of \nthis has been borne by State and local governments.\n  I was disappointed today to hear about Homeland Security Secretary \nMichael Chertoffs remarks that State and local governments should bear \nmuch of the burden of protecting transit systems. A bomb in a subway, \nhe says, may kill 30 people, while a fully loaded airplane may kill \n3,000 people.\n  This argument is misleading. A well-orchestrated, multipronged attack \non one of Metra's largest trains, which carry up to 1,600 passengers or \nthe equivalent of three fully loaded Boeing 747 aircraft, could produce \na similar body count.\n  I am sure the families of the 50 victims of the London attacks don't \nthink the lives of their loved ones were any less important than those \nof people who have been killed on airplanes.\n  Transit systems are an accident waiting to happen. They are a \nvulnerability we have ignored for far too long, and the terrorists know \nit.\n  The Federal Government has a responsibility to protect trains as well \nas airplanes, for the public good, and it needs to take responsibility.\n  For CTA, this increased security is costing an estimated extra \n$60,000 a day, on top of an already massive increase in security \nspending borne since September 11.\n  Metra has diverted millions of dollars in funds for police overtime \npay, extra outside security police, and bomb-sniffing dogs.\n  Our rail system covers approximately 16,000 acres, carrying 500 \nfreight and 700 commuter trains each day. More than 2 million \npassengers travel to or from Chicago on Amtrak, and Chicago's transit \nsystems take 73 million local passenger trips a year. These people and \nthis cargo needs to be secure.\n  Despite these facts, and other impressive statistics from New York, \nNew Jersey, California, and elsewhere where rail and transit systems \nare relied on heavily, in the President's budget proposal, nearly 90 \npercent of Federal transportation security funds have been directed to \naviation security. While I don't want to take away from the importance \nof aviation security improvements, this amendment attempts to diminish \nthat inequity.\n  In this bill before us, the committee proposes only $100 million for \nintercity passenger rail transportation, freight rail, and transit \nsecurity grants. This is one-third less than we appropriated last year \nand hundreds of millions less than the Senate has authorized for these \nprograms over the years.\n  While the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, chairman of the \nHomeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, will offer an amendment \nto boost this funding by an additional $100 million, there are two \nthings wrong with this approach. One, he takes it away from State and \nlocal grants. And two, $100 million is not enough, given the risks.\n  He will talk about the need for fiscal discipline; he will talk about \nthis amendment and other important rail security amendments as busting \nthe budget, but it is a question of priorities. We are busting the \nbudget every day for the priorities of tax cuts and funding the war in \nIraq.\n  Transit operators must take effective steps to reduce the risk of \nterrorist attack. And they need help to do it. State and local \ngovernments are investing their own time and money, and the Federal \nGovernment should respond.\n  We should not wait for terrorists to attack a U.S. transit system to \nreact. We need to take action now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we have had substantial debate on the \nsubstance of this amendment, the fact that the $1 billion probably will \nnot impact dramatically the security situation. It might actually \nmisallocate funds that could otherwise be used for intelligence and for \nBorder Patrol agents and for other activities that are so critical and \nthat are threat-oriented.\n  But the practical bottom line is this amendment is $1 billion over \nthe budget and will add to the deficit by $1 billion, if it is adopted. \nI urge that the motion to waive be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

We are talking about a matter of \nnational security. At least one--there could be more--at least one \nsenior White House official disclosed the identity of a CIA \nintelligence officer to a reporter or reporters, and then this \nadministration proceeded to deny and deflect the truth after it was \ndiscovered it had been leaked. It put this agent's life in jeopardy. I \nrepeat, it put this agent's life in jeopardy, plus people she had dealt \nwith from other countries and here in America. It put our intelligence \ncommunity at risk and, of course, jeopardized our national security.\n  Even the President's father, my friend, President George Bush, a \nformer Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, recognizes the \nseriousness of this offense. He said:\n\n       I have nothing but contempt and anger for those who betray \n     the trust by exposing the name of our sources. They are, in \n     my view, the most insidious of traitors.\n\n  Whoever did this, according to George Bush, the first Bush President, \nwould be an insidious traitor.\n  But instead of dealing with the problem, this administration, this \nWhite House, and the majority in the Senate want to divert attention \nfrom this breach of national security. Unfortunately, it is a pattern \nwe are all too familiar with from this White House. When they are on \nthe ropes, they attack. If you do not believe me, you need look no \nfurther than yesterday's Washington Post, July 13, 2005, which detailed \nthe Republican strategy for this affair:\n\n       The emerging GOP strategy--devised by--\n\n  RNC chair\n\n       [Ken Mehlman] and other Rove loyalists outside the White \n     House--is to try to undermine those Democrats calling for \n     Rove's ouster, play down Rove's role and wait for President \n     Bush's forthcoming Supreme Court selections to drown out the \n     controversy, according to several high-level Republicans.\n\n  This is what is known as a coverup. This is an abuse of power. This \nis a diversion from what we should be dealing with in the Senate.\n  No interest in coming clean and being honest with the American \npeople. This afternoon, the majority is bringing this strategy to the \nSenate floor. Mehlman's strategy is being brought right here, but the \nAmerican people can see right through this.\n  This morning, the Wall Street Journal, not a bastion of liberality, \nhad a poll which said only 41 percent of Americans believe the \nPresident is being honest and straightforward. That is from the Wall \nStreet Journal this\n\n[[Page S8269]]\n\nmorning, which confirms and underlines what I have said that this is a \ncoverup. It is an abuse of power. It is diversionary.\n  It is time to quit playing partisan politics with our national \nsecurity. It is time for the White House to come clean. It is time to \naddress the pressing issues facing this country. This second-degree \namendment--and I have been in the Congress more than two decades--is \nabout as juvenile and as mudslinging as I have seen. We are here to \nprotect the country. We are here with a bill that deals with homeland \nsecurity. We are here to talk about issues such as leaking information \nabout our CIA agents. Is that not part of our national security? I \ncertainly hope so.\n  We have pressing issues facing this country. The reason the American \npeople have lost faith in this administration is because we are not \ndealing with the problems they care about: 45 million Americans with no \nhealth insurance, millions of others underinsured; our educational \nsystem is wanting; K-12 have big problems; our public educational \nsystem is under attack. With college education today it is how much \nmoney one has as to where they can go to school and when they can go to \nschool. It is how much money their parents have. Only half of American \nworkers today have pensions, and more than half of those pensions are \nin distress.\n  People are worrying--just like those people who worked all of those \nvaliant years at United Airlines--are they going to lose their \npensions? Are they going to be cut? Are they going to be whacked?\n  This administration is obstructing progress. The American people \ndeserve more. The Republicans should stop playing games, come clean, \nand work on issues to help this country.\n  What we have today, with this little second-degree amendment, is a \ndiversion. It is an abuse of power, and it is a coverup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may, I noticed the Democratic \nleader had his amendment read. I would like to ask that the Frist \namendment be read, and then Senator Coleman will be ready to address \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: Section. \n     Any Federal officeholder who makes reference to a classified \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation report on the floor of the \n     United States Senate, or any federal officeholder that makes \n     a statement based on a FBI agent's comments which is used as \n     propaganda by terrorist organizations thereby putting our \n     servicemen and women at risk, shall not be permitted access \n     to such information or to hold security clearance for access \n     to such information.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, we have had a very productive day dealing \nwith homeland security, which is a $32 billion bill. In the past couple \nof weeks we passed an energy bill, a highway bill, and a trade \nagreement. We have a consultation process going on now for a Supreme \nCourt appointment that I think is going fairly well. There has been a \npretty good atmosphere in this body. My concern is that the oxygen is \nbeing sucked out of that good atmosphere as we get involved in partisan \npolitical attacks.\n  The circumstances that have motivated this statute are ones that are \nbeing reviewed right now by special counsel. That is the way it should \nbe. We have somebody, the President, who says he has confidence in that \nspecial counsel, and it seems that rather than play partisan political \ngames that we should let the special counsel do his work; that we \nshould cool the rhetoric and we should focus on the business of the \npeople, which I think we have been doing, which is a good thing.\n  I would really love to ask my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle some questions about the statute. There is a reason we do things \nthrough committee and we review them. Perhaps one of my colleagues on \nthe other side would yield to a question. There is an existing Federal \nlaw that makes it a crime to reveal the identity of agents. There are \nsome very specific intent provisions in that statute. The law states \nthat for a violation to occur, a Government official must have \ndeliberately identified a covert agent.\n  As I read this statute, I am not sure whether there is an intent \nrequirement. The criminal statute requires that they must have known \nthe agent was undercover and that the Government was trying to keep \nthat agent's identity a secret. That is the criminal law.\n  As I read this statute, I do not see any indication of intent. So \nwhen the amendment says ``no Federal employee who discloses, or has \ndisclosed information,'' does that mean intentionally disclose? Does \nthat mean unintentionally disclosed? Are we mirroring the criminal \nprovisions to then apply them to a security clearance? I am not sure, \nand I would hope that on the time of my colleagues on the other side \nthey will respond to those questions. If we went through the normal \ncommittee process, I think those are the kinds of questions we would \nsort out.\n\n  As I look at the amendment, it talks about ``no Federal employee.'' \nDoes that mean public official? I would hope my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle would agree that this amendment should cover public \nofficials. It should cover us. Is the intent of my colleagues to \nspecifically preclude Senators from losing their access to classified \ninformation? I think that is the intent.\n  If one goes back and looks at definitions of Federal employees, that \nis the conclusion one would come to. If one comes to that conclusion, I \nthink that is a pretty poor conclusion. If we are going to talk about \nbeing outraged by the fact that classified information has been \nrevealed--and, again, I think we have to answer this question of intent \nor not, but I would hope that my colleagues would look at this and say, \nyes, we mean to include public officials. And if we do include public \nofficials, there is some other construction language we would have to \ndeal with because public officials do not necessarily have clearances, \nbut we have access to classified information. So we would have to work \non it.\n  I know my colleague from Kansas would like to speak.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield for a question?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Did I understand the Senator from Minnesota correctly \nthat he was posing two questions to the proponents of the Reid \namendment, No. 1, whether intent was left out of the amendment on \npurpose, and No. 2, whether it covered Members of Congress?\n  I was wondering if anyone on the other side was prepared to answer \nthe questions of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Those questions that my colleague from Kentucky has \nraised are what we would like some answers to. Are we intending to \ncover public officials, U.S. Senators, by the provisions of this \namendment, and do we include----\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely, yes.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. If that is the case, I suggest then we perhaps take a \nfew minutes to work out the language because there may be some \ntechnical problems with definitions of Federal employees. The language \nin the statute talks about receiving security clearances for access to \ninformation. We do not necessarily have security clearances, but we do \nhave access, so there may be some technical provisions.\n  I am very pleased if in fact my colleagues on the other side intend \nto include public officials. We might want to clean this up before we \nfinalize it.\n  The other question I have is, is there an intent element in this \nstatute? Is it intentionally disclosing or unintentionally disclosing? \nIs it negligently, is it mistakingly, or is there the specific kind of \nintent one usually needs to have in statutes of this kind?\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 39\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Newsweek magazine reported that on July 11, \n2003, a correspondent for Time magazine, Matt Cooper, sent an e-mail to \nhis bureau chief, Michael Duffy: Subject, Rove P, and that means for \npersonal and confidential. The e-mail said: Spoke to Rove on double \nsupersecret background for about 2 minutes before he went on vacation.\n\n[[Page S8270]]\n\n  According to Newsweek, Cooper wrote that Karl Rove offered him a big \nwarning not to get too far out on Joe Wilson. Cooper's e-mail said the \nfollowing: that it was, Karl Rove said, Wilson's wife who apparently \nworks at the Agency--and that is referring clearly, by the other part \nof the e-mail, to CIA--on WMD, weapons of mass destruction, issues, who \nauthorized the trip, referring to Joe Wilson's trip.\n  According to the Newsweek report, Ambassador Wilson's wife is Valerie \nPlame. Then Cooper finished his e-mail by writing: Please do not source \nthis to Rove or even White House--and suggested that another reporter \ncheck with the CIA.\n  Then in October of 2003, White House spokesman Scott McClellan was \nasked whether Karl Rove was involved in the leak. These were the \nquestions and answers:\n  Question: Scott, earlier this week you told us that neither Karl Rove \nnor two other named persons disclosed any classified information with \nregard to the leak. I am wondering if you could tell us more \nspecifically whether any of them told any reporter that Valerie Plame \nworked for the CIA?\n  Mr. McClellan: Those individuals, now referring to including Rove, I \nspoke with those individuals, as I pointed out, and those individuals \nassured me they were not involved in this.\n  Question of McClellan: So none of them told any reporter that Valerie \nPlame worked for the CIA?\n  Mr. McClellan: They assured me they were not involved in this.\n  Then comes the bombshell, the contemporaneous e-mail which indicated \nthat as a matter of fact Mr. Rove indicated to Mr. Cooper that Joe \nWilson's wife apparently worked at the CIA on weapons of mass \ndestruction issues.\n  It is not good enough to parse words on a matter that is this \nserious. It is not good enough to say, as both Mr. Rove and his lawyer \nhave said, well, there was no reference to a specific name.\n  On July 3, Mr. Rove's lawyer said his client did not disclose the \nidentity of the CIA person. A little over a week later, after the \nrelease of the Cooper e-mail, Mr. Rove's lawyer parsed the words and \nsaid Mr. Rove did not disclose the name.\n  Well, whether it is the name of a CIA employee or the identity of a \nCIA employee, that is wrong. It has to be stopped, and the only way to \nstop it is to adopt a statute which says either it is a criminal \noffense in case of specific intent, which we already have on the books, \nbut even if one cannot prove a specific intent, even if one identifies \na CIA employee, period, without the higher level of proof that is \nrequired for a criminal law, the identification of a CIA employee is \nenough to lose their security clearance. That is what the amendment \nbefore us provides: Identify a CIA agent, put that agent in this Nation \nat risk, and they are going to lose their security clearance.\n  Now, if someone does it intentionally, and if that can be proven \nbeyond a reasonable doubt, beyond that, then they have committed a \ncrime. So that is the answer to the question of my friend from \nMinnesota or the question of the Senator from Kentucky as to whether \nspecific intent is required. It is not.\n  In the criminal statute, it is, but we say the disclosure of the \nidentity of a covert CIA employee is sufficient to lose one's security \nclearance.\n  Let us be clear as to what this e-mail said. There was no doubt that \nMr. Rove, at least according to the e-mail, knew that the wife of Joe \nWilson was a CIA employee because she was so identified as a CIA \nemployee. So there is no question in the fact situation which has \nbrought this matter to such dramatic light that the facts are there to \nprovide this basis that there was, indeed, knowledge. But, to answer \nthe question, there is no specific intent which is required.\n\n  I wonder if the leader will yield 2 additional minutes?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to do that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the President has his responsibility. The \nPresident has said he knows Karl Rove was not involved. Now there is \nclear information that Karl Rove identified a CIA employee to a \nreporter who had no right to that information. Now what? Now that the \nPresident does know Mr. Rove is involved, now what?\n  That is up to the President. That is the President's responsibility; \nhow he exercises it is his judgment. He will exercise it as he sees \nfit, now that he knows Mr. Rove was involved.\n  We can all give him suggestions, and we have, that he ought to \nexercise that responsibility by addressing the issue. Now that you know \nthere was this involvement, now what?\n  But we have a responsibility. We have a responsibility in Congress to \nmake sure there is no ambiguity in the law, there is no hair splitting, \nno legal loopholes, no question about--well, wait a minute, I didn't \nname a name, I only named an identity. No higher standard of proof is \nrequired by criminal law beyond a reasonable doubt. You identify a \ncovert agent of the CIA, you lose your security clearance. It is as \nclear as that and as important as that to the security of this Nation.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I wonder if my colleague from Michigan will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. He yields on your time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to. I do not control the time.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Is the Democratic leader aware of the executive order \nissued by President Clinton in 1995 on this issue, on security \nclearances?\n  Mr. REID. My friend from Michigan is answering the question.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Because in that order--again, I am looking at the \nstandard, and I appreciate my colleague's words about going beyond the \nintent. In the executive order the standard is knowingly, willfully, or \nnegligently. Is that the standard that is intended by this statute? Or \nis this amendment changing that standard?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment speaks for itself. If you identify a covert \nCIA agent, and you have a security clearance, and the person to whom \nyou identify that covert CIA agent does not have the right to receive \nthat information, you lose your clearance. Period. I think it is pretty \nclear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. How much time do we have left, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 38\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Is that on both amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On both amendments.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. To be split between both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 38 minutes for the majority on two \namendments.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield to the Senator from \nAlabama such time as he needs.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am very disappointed that we would \nhave such an amendment offered at this time in our American process of \npassing a Homeland Security bill.\n  Karl Rove has served this country exceedingly well. One reason people \ndo not want to involve themselves in public service is they go out and \ntry to do something and somebody accuses them of a crime. He had no \nintent whatsoever to do anything wrong, to violate any law or out any \nundercover agent. And if the reports in the paper are so, and I assume \nthey are, those are the facts.\n  Victoria Toensing, the former Assistant Attorney General of the \nUnited States, was quoted this morning on television. I happened to \ncatch it. She is a skilled lawyer and articulate person. Asked: Was \nthis statement that allegedly had been made that Wilson's wife worked \nat the CIA, did that violate the law--a law she wrote; she was involved \nin writing the bill to deal with the deliberate outing of undercover \noperatives of the United States--she answered in one word, ``No.''\n  So what we have on the floor of this Senate is an attempt to pass an \nex post facto law to remove the security clearance of one of America's \nfinest public servants.\n  Look here. ``No Federal employee who discloses or has disclosed.'' We \nare going to change the law now? After somebody has done something that \nwas not a violation of the law? What kind of principle of justice is \nthat? This is a political charade. It is a game to embarrass the \nPresident of the United States, who is attempting to conduct a\n\n[[Page S8271]]\n\nwar on behalf of the American people, a war this Congress has voted to \nsupport, overwhelmingly, by three-fourths vote. And I do not appreciate \nit. I think it is beneath this Senate's dignity. It is contrary to the \nquality of debate and effort to amend the laws we ought to have in this \ncountry.\n\n  I am shocked by it. I prosecuted for over 15 years in Federal court. \nYou don't pass a law to go back and grab somebody who did something \nthat was not a violation of the law in order to embarrass the President \nof the United States over nothing. He intended no harm here. He had no \nintention to out an undercover agent of the CIA--if these allegations \nare true, and I haven't talked to him about it.\n  I say this: Mr. Rove has served in the center of this Government \nsince the President took office. He has conducted himself, I believe, \nwith high standards. Yes, the colleagues on the other side probably \nhave not been happy with the success he has had in helping President \nBush in his campaign and other efforts. But he has not been accused of \ncorruption or deceit or dishonesty, or certainly not anybody would \nsuggest he would ever do anything to intentionally harm an agent of the \nUnited States who is out serving our country.\n  I say, this language is unacceptable. We ought to vote it down \nflatly. It is not proper and we ought not to be doing that at this \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Rockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as vice chairman of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, I strongly support the Reid amendment. \nSenator Reid is addressing a problem that has become endemic in recent \nyears. It is something of which I have become acutely aware since I was \nappointed to that position 4\\1/2\\ years ago, the leaking of classified \ninformation.\n  Barely a day goes by, frankly, when you don't read or watch press \nreports that contain classified information. The country is the lesser \nfor it. I tell my colleagues, these leaks do real damage to our \nnational security. When individuals with access to our Nation's secrets \ndisclose those secrets to the public, they are telling our enemies \nabout our intelligence capabilities and potentially how to defeat them. \nWhen intelligence sources and methods are exposed, we lose the ability \nto collect the information that will keep America safe. Good \nintelligence is the foundation of national security. We know that. It \nguides our foreign policy, it helps us determine what weapons systems \nto build, and how to shape and deploy our military forces. It is \ncritical to our efforts to stop terrorists before they attack.\n  Intelligence that is compromised, therefore, makes America less \nsecure. There is no excuse when individuals entrusted with these \nsecrets leak them. It is not just careless or unfortunate, it is \ndangerous. Among the secrets we guard the most closely are the identity \nof our spies. Revealing the identity of a covert agent not only ends \nthe effectiveness of that individual, it puts that person in grave \npersonal danger, and such disclosure also puts at risk all of the \nagent's colleagues and the people the agent has recruited around the \nworld over the years. In other words, when you expose the name of a \ncovert agent, people can die.\n\n  The consequences of such exposure are so severe that in 1982 the \nCongress passed the Identities Protection Act, to criminalize this \nbehavior. But apparently that is not enough. Last year, someone with \naccess to classified information told members of the press the identity \nof a covert CIA operative. They did this not to expose some wrongdoing, \nbut because they wanted to embarrass her husband. Someone calculated \nthat our national security was less important than scoring points in \nthe press for the administration's policy regarding Iraq. The act was \ndeplorable.\n  Over the past 2 years the special prosecutor appointed to investigate \nthis crime has pursued it aggressively. He may now be making headway, \nwe don't know, but it is unclear whether he will ever accumulate enough \nevidence to bring the guilty party or parties to justice. If he is \nunsuccessful, we should not let that be the end of this sorry episode. \nWe can and should make it clear that people entrusted with classified \ninformation cannot carelessly disclose that information without \nconsequence.\n  Federal employees are bound to protect classified information. If \nthey do not, the very least sanction they should face is to lose the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance. We have to make clear to \nthose in the Federal workforce entrusted with protecting highly \nsensitive information that there are consequences for these \ndisclosures.\n  The amendment by Senator Reid does exactly that. It is \nstraightforward and is common sense. If you disclose classified \ninformation to somebody not authorized to receive it, you are no longer \nallowed to hold a security clearance. The FBI and the Justice \nDepartment may not be able to gather sufficient evidence to prosecute \nleakers, but the Director of National Intelligence should be able to \nuse this administrative tool to help stem the tide of unauthorized \ndisclosures. We need to get serious about this problem and this is a \ngood place to start.\n  The Frist amendment attempts to equate the unauthorized disclosure of \nclassified information with unclassified remarks regarding an FBI \nreport that some object to on political grounds. There is nothing \ninherently improper or illegal about making ``reference'' to an FBI \nreport, or making a ``statement'' based on some unidentified FBI \nagent's comments. The law is clear about the importance of protecting \nhighly sensitive national security secrets, including the identity of a \ncovert agent. The Frist amendment makes a mockery of the gravity \nassociated with leaking classified information by suggesting that any \nunclassified reference to any FBI report anyone believes is being used \nas propaganda is somehow as serious an offense.\n  Under the twisted logic contained in the Frist amendment, the remarks \nof FBI Director Mueller himself, if used by a purported terrorist group \nto discredit the United States, would cause the Director to lose access \nto classified information. It is absurd. This is absurd. The Frist \namendment seeks to rewrite the freedom of speech clause of the \nConstitution and should be dismissed by this body out of hand.\n  The Reid amendment, on the other hand, is clear and measured. If you \ndisclose classified information without authorization, your security \nclearance should be revoked.\n  I end by asking my colleagues, what is wrong with this?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am still a little unclear in regard to \nthe Reid amendment. I understand from three Senators--Senator Levin, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Reid--that this also applies to public \nemployees, i.e., Senators. If that is the case, if Members are \nincluded, one of the things we have to determine is that `` . . . to a \nperson not authorized to receive such information shall be permitted to \nhold a security clearance for access to such information''--well, we \ndon't have security clearances.\n  By our election, we are deemed to be cleared for all security, and so \nwe are not losing anything. If in fact somebody unintentionally came to \nthe floor and in a public statement basically said or disclosed or has \ndisclosed classified information including the identity of a covert \nagent of the Central Intelligence Agency, the answer to this is \nmeaningless because we don't have a security clearance. They don't \nexist for Members. We are deemed to have a total clearance. And so I \ndon't know what the remedy is.\n  Again, if you do it unintentionally, I can tell you that is a \nslippery slope. There have been Members basically inadvertently saying \nthings in the Chamber and in the public that could match this \namendment. I am not going to get into names, but I think that has \nhappened in the past without question. I know it happened in the \nIntelligence Committee, probably the Armed Services Committee, probably \nmany other committees.\n\n[[Page S8272]]\n\n  This is just not very clear, and what we have here is a Special \nProsecutor with a lot of leaks; we have a reporter in jail for a story \nshe did not write; we have a steady stream of leaks about every aspect \nof this case; we have the Washington press corps in full attack mode; \nand, finally, before we have all the facts known, we have my colleagues \nacross the aisle calling for Karl Rove's resignation, if not \nincarceration. So much for the presumption of innocence.\n  Don't get me wrong; we must protect the identities without any \nquestion, as my distinguished vice chairman of the committee, Senator \nRockefeller, has said, but that obligation also extends to the Agency \nfor which they work. I just think here we have a tempest, to \ncharacterize the newest revelations in the Valerie Plame case as a \nstunning turn of events demanding immediate action by the President, \nthe special prosecutor, and now the Congress of the United States. I am \nnot a big advocate of the ``shoot now, ask questions later'' approach. \nI certainly prefer to know the facts and then make a judgment.\n  My preference notwithstanding, the judgment of the current deluge of \nmedia coverage seems to be based on the premise that the White House--\ni.e., Karl Rove--was trying to discredit Ambassador Wilson for his \nmuch-publicized opposition to the war. It is important to remember that \nthere is already a record on this point, and I urge Members to really \npay attention to the record.\n  More than a year ago, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued its \nunanimous report on prewar intelligence assessments on Iraq. We have a \n511-page report explaining in detail how our intelligence agencies got \nit wrong.\n  Now to the subject at hand, this so-called tempest. Included in that \nreport was a recitation of the facts that surround the now infamous \ntravels of the former Ambassador Joe Wilson, who can best be described \nas a bit player in the Iraq story, notwithstanding his substantial \nefforts to embellish the significance of his role.\n  Mr. Wilson became quite a celebrity and questioned the President's \nveracity as he carefully crafted his public persona as a \n``truthteller.'' He went on a media blitz, Mr. President. He appeared \non more than 30 television shows including, ironically, ``The Daily \nShow,'' a fake news show. Time and time again, he told anybody who \nwould listen that the President had lied to the American people, the \nVice President had lied, and that he had debunked the claim that Iraq \nwas seeking uranium from Africa.\n  However, the committee found not only did he not debunk the claim, he \nactually gave some intelligence analysts even more reason to believe it \nmay be true. In an interview with committee staff, the same committee \nstaff that interviewed over 250 analysts to prove that we had systemic \nproblems in the intelligence community, he was asked how he knew some \nof the things he was stating publicly with such confidence. On at least \ntwo occasions, he admitted that he had no direct knowledge to support \nsome of his claims and he was drawing on either unrelated past \nexperiences or no information at all. For example, when asked how he \nknew that the intelligence community had rejected the possibility of a \nNiger-Iraq uranium deal as he wrote in his book, he told committee \nstaff that his assertion may have involved ``a little literary flair.''\n  I urge my colleagues to read the 511-page report that was voted out \n17 to nothing.\n  The former Ambassador, either by design or through ignorance, gave \nthe American people or, for that matter, the world, a version of events \nthat was inaccurate, unsubstantiated, and misleading. What is more \ndisturbing, he continues to do so today.\n  Now that the Washington press corps is in a full-attack mode over the \nrecent revelations in the Valerie Plame case, Ambassador Wilson is back \non the circuit. He is continuing his self-proclaimed quest to have Karl \nRove, in his words, ``frog marched in handcuffs'' out of the White \nHouse. And basically that is what we are trying to do with this \namendment, if you follow the partisan line of thinking as put forth by \nAmbassador Joe Wilson. And before all the facts are known, he has been \njoined by a chorus of colleagues and liberal action groups calling for \nKarl Rove's resignation and in some cases even incarceration. So much \nfor the presumption of innocence.\n\n  Now, don't get me wrong. If someone willfully or knowingly outs an \nundercover intelligence officer, they should be punished. Senator \nRockefeller is exactly right about that. Punishment should be reserved, \nhowever, for those who have actually committed a crime. The law \nrequires knowledge. And if Mr. Rove didn't know and no one told him \nthat Valerie Plame was undercover, then, pardon me, he did not break \nany laws. The mere fact that one works for the CIA is not in and of \nitself classified.\n  As important, the law presumes the Government is taking ``affirmative \nmeasures to conceal'' the officer's intelligence relationship to the \nUnited States. I am just not convinced that a serious effort to conceal \nan undercover officer's intelligence relationship includes driving to \nCIA headquarters every day for work.\n  The Intelligence Committee has examined with staff the issue of cover \nbefore and identified a number of serious problems, and we are \ncurrently examining the issue of cover once again because some of these \nproblems do persist. While we should leave the criminal investigation \nto the Special Prosecutor, we will continue our work to ensure that \nthose who are actually undercover get the protection they need and \ndeserve.\n  Again, as for the former Ambassador, no one needed to discredit him. \nHe took care of that himself.\n  Now, before I close, I would like to say something in response to the \ngray picture painted by the distinguished minority leader. Much has \nbeen said about the grave damage that was done to our Nation's security \nwhen Valerie Plame's name was revealed to the press. There has also \nbeen speculation that Ms. Plame, although nominally undercover, really \nwasn't undercover at all. So as part of the Intelligence Committee's \nongoing oversight of the issue of cover, we will examine this case and \nsee where the truth lies.\n  Basically, I think we are on the wrong track here, and again I urge \nmy colleagues, if you put in law that if anybody reveals classified \ninformation unintentionally, including the Members of this Senate, that \nis a slippery road we will go down where current Members who I see \nsitting in the Chamber would fit into that category, and it is \nunwarranted, unneeded. It is not the way to do it according to the act \nthat was cited by my distinguished colleague from Minnesota.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and leader, Senator \nReid. Let me respond to a couple of points. I had not intended to get \ninvolved deeply in this debate, but a couple things strike me, Mr. \nPresident, as this debate evolves.\n  First of all, this is an appropriate discussion on this bill. On what \nmore appropriate piece of legislation could you have discussion than \nthis one regarding intelligence matters that deal with the very issue \nof homeland security. So I don't understand the objection. You may \nobject to the amendment, but the idea that on the Homeland Security \nbill where security plays a critical role, it seems to me discussing \nthis matter has relevancy.\n  Secondly, it is our responsibility as Members of Congress to draft \nlegislation to try to deal with these matters. Certainly what the \nSenator from Nevada has raised is responding to what is a national \nstory, one that has been around now for the last several years, a \nmatter, I might add, that could have been resolved probably a couple of \nyears ago had Mr. Rove at the time said, Look, I am the person who \nspoke to Matt Cooper. I am the one who used Mr. Wilson's wife, \ndescribing her in those terms, and maybe explained at the time he \ndidn't intend to do it. We might not be talking about this matter as \nextensively as we are today. But the fact is they covered it up for the \nlast 2 years rather than coming clean and saying, I had \nthat conversation.\n\n  I am perplexed at what the response of this is. Are my colleagues on \nthe\n\n[[Page S8273]]\n\nother side suggesting as the alternative to what Senator Reid proposes \na better suggestion that people who do reveal highly classified \ninformation, the names of covert agents, should be allowed to continue \nto keep their secret classification? I don't think so.\n  That is really what the point of this is, to make the case that when \nanyone reveals, including Members of this body, highly classified \ninformation, the names of covert agents, you lose the privilege of \nhaving a security clearance. It is not a criminal indictment. It just \nsays if you do that, you don't have the privilege of having that kind \nof a classification. I don't know why there is such a protest. This \nought to be adopted unanimously.\n  Where is the objection? This does not mention Karl Rove, although \ncertainly his actions have provoked this discussion. If in fact it \nturns out that he is indicted, then he will have to face those \nallegations. But to suggest that somehow we should do nothing about \nthis, despite the fact that everyone is talking about it across the \ncountry--it has been a serious problem, it needs to be addressed, an \ninvestigation is ongoing--that should not deprive this body of \nresponding to a situation where classified information, the name of a \nCIA agent, has been revealed and we ought to say something about it.\n  So, Mr. President, I think what Senator Reid has proposed is \neminently reasonable. It is applying to everyone here. And Senator \nRockefeller, our friend from West Virginia, is absolutely correct. It \nis an ongoing problem, almost on a daily basis, and we need to speak \nloudly and clearly, it has got to stop. If we are going to be more \nsecure as a people, then we need to stop revealing important \ninformation and the identities of people who we depend upon to make us \nmore secure. That is what the Reid amendment does.\n  My hope is we would have 100 Members supporting this amendment \ninstead of a divisive debate over whether this is about an employee at \nthe White House who, in my opinion, probably ought to voluntarily step \naside pending the investigation and voluntarily give up his security \nclearance.\n  If he were a police officer in any department in the United States \nwho had been accused of such a transgression, the chief of police would \nask him to step aside temporarily, not to resign, not to retire but to \nstep aside pending the investigation to determine whether the \nallegations were true.\n  That is what ought to happen here. But Mr. Rove is not directly the \nsubject of this amendment. It is simply a response to a problem that \nexists in our country and one that needs to be addressed. Senator Reid \nis right, and if our colleagues were smart, they would endorse this \namendment and support it unanimously at the appropriate time when the \nvote occurs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, once again, let's be very clear. It is \nabout politics. That is all this is about--politics. We have an \nExecutive order that has been in place for 10 years that talks about \ndealing with classified information, talks about what happens when \nclassified information is revealed. An Executive order, by the way, has \na standard, deals with a situation: knowingly, willfully or \nnegligently. We have a standard.\n  My colleagues on the other side talk about a coverup. We have a \nmatter that is being investigated by special counsel. The President of \nthe United States says: I have confidence in the special counsel. Let's \nsee what he does. We have Karl Rove, who is cooperating with the \nspecial counsel, who openly said: Whoever I talked to, talk to them.\n  There is no cover. This is about politics. I just came from a press \nconference a little while ago with the head of the campaign committee \nof the Democratic Party about this issue with Joe Wilson.\n  It is about politics. We have an amendment in which on the first \nblush it talks about Federal employees, and then after questioning they \nsay: Well, yes, it means public officials. It is not in there.\n  But what happened to the greatest deliberative body in the world?\n  This is about politics. We have an amendment crafted as an ex post \nfacto. Will that pass muster? I don't know. I have questions about it.\n  Again, I go back to the Executive order. It is very clear. It talks \nabout knowingly, willfully, negligently. That makes sense. If you are \nan individual with your wallet stolen with a piece of information in \nthere that led to the agent being uncovered, you are impacted by this. \nWhat about if your office is in a secure facility, somehow it was \nburglarized; are you covered? There is a reason you have an Executive \norder that has been in place 10 years that provides a knowing standard, \na logical standard, an effective standard.\n  This is a poorly crafted piece of political propaganda. That is all \nit is.\n  Listen to the facts. They are based on what I read in Newsweek.\n  Instead of doing what you would think we do in this deliberative \nbody, we wait to see what the special counsel has to say. We wait to \nget the facts before the Senate. If, in fact, we find this Executive \norder is lacking in scope, is lacking in effect, is somehow not doing \nthe job it needs to do, we can provide some legislation to deal with \nit.\n  We have none of that. What we have is ``gotcha politics'' in \nWashington in 2005. So we are dealing with something that is hastily \ncrafted, poorly crafted, that does not explicitly say who it covers, \nthat does not have a clear standard of intent, that is simply \nunnecessary--unnecessary when the conduct that was supposed to be \nconcerned about, or should be concerned about is already covered by \nExecutive order.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator from Minnesota is an experienced prosecutor \nand understands these things.\n  It also, as I read it, says, if you reveal the identity of a covert \nagent without an intent--you might not even know that person was a \ncovert agent, isn't that right?--you would be in violation of the \nstatute.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. The Senator from Alabama, based on my reading of this, \nis correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is another example of the poor drafting of this \nstatute, to hold somebody accountable for a perfectly innocent \nmistake--a strict liability statute that requires only the revealing of \ninformation that somebody happened to be a covert agent when the person \ndid not even know it.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I suggest to my friend from Alabama that is the reason, \nin the Executive order, we have a standard of knowing. In fact, if you \ndo something negligently, there is a standard and you can be held \naccountable. But there is no such standard, whatever, in this hastily \ncrafted political amendment and, as such, my colleagues should reject \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. This amendment is an amendment that deals with the \nfollowing:\n\n       No Federal employee who discloses, or has disclosed, \n     classified information, including the identity of a covert \n     agent of the Central Intelligence Agency, to a person not \n     authorized to receive such information shall be permitted to \n     hold a security clearance for access to such information.\n\n  How in the world can anyone in this Senate vote against this? The \nonly reason I can figure out is that there is an attempt to divert \nattention, an attempt to cover up. It is an abuse of power. This is \nabsolutely something that everyone should vote for.\n  There have been wails of concern from the other side but very little \ndiscussion of this amendment. I simply say, when they talk about the \nExecutive order, I learned in law school that a Federal law would \nsupersede any Executive order.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, there are some who may disagree with \nthe proposition at the heart of Senator Reid's amendment; that is, that \nU.S. Government officials who violate the laws governing safeguarding \nsources should not be permitted to have continued access to that \ninformation. I happen to agree with that. I happen to think it is a \nfair point to discuss. As the Senator from Connecticut said, it is \nappropriate for this discussion.\n  In fact, there is a document that every employee signs. It is \nentitled ``Department of Defense Secrecy Agreement.'' The second part \nof it reads:\n\n       I agree that I will never divulge, publish or reveal, \n     either by word, conduct, or by any\n\n[[Page S8274]]\n\n     other means, any classified information, intelligence, or \n     knowledge, except in the performance of my official duties \n     and in accordance with the laws of the United States, unless \n     specifically authorized in writing in each case by the \n     Secretary of Defense.\n  It is my understanding Senators do not sign it, Members of Congress \ndo not sign it, but members of the administration and staff do sign \nthis document.\n  All the Reid amendment does, essentially, is codify what has been \ncarried out informally by regulation.\n  The second-degree amendment is not fair or honorable. It is clearly \ndesigned to threaten a Member's unquestionably lawful conduct. It is \nvenal. I believe it is unprecedented.\n  We have asked the historian of the Senate if this has ever been done \nbefore. He said, no, never in the Senate. Once, in the House of \nRepresentatives, from 1836 to 1844, the House had a gag rule on all \nmotions pertaining to abolition of slavery. They were immediately \ntabled. Otherwise, there never has been an effort like this.\n  The problem with the substitute amendment, and let me read it, is \nthis.\n  It says strike all that follows and add the following:\n\n       Any federal office holder who makes reference to a \n     classified Federal Bureau of Investigation report on the \n     floor of the Senate, or any federal officeholder that makes a \n     statement based on an FBI agent's comments which is used as \n     propaganda by terrorist organizations thereby putting our \n     servicemen and women at risk, shall not be permitted access \n     to such information or to hold a security clearance for \n     access to this information.\n\n  Yesterday, I had a meeting with the Director of the FBI. We discussed \nmany aspects of the PATRIOT Act. Supposing I had come to the Senate and \ndiscussed those aspects and Al-Jazeera picked it up and used it as \npropaganda. I am within my rights to discuss that. It is unclassified. \nI know of no Senator that has come to the Senate and used any \ninformation that was classified.\n  Now, there have been accusations. I got that FBI report. I have it \nright here. It has a big X through secret and has written on it:\n\n       All information contained herein is unclassified except \n     where shown otherwise.\n\n  What this amendment aims to get at is clearly a venal retribution. \nCandidly, I object to it. It has never happened in the Senate before. \nAnd it should not happen today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the statement of the Senator from \nCalifornia. No one works harder in the Senate than this Senator. She \nserves on the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, Judiciary, Rules and Administration, and \nIntelligence. She has served honorably on the Intelligence Committee \nand spent days of her life in the Intelligence Committee. I very much \nappreciate her statement.\n  How much time remains with the majority and the minority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 20\\1/2\\ minutes and the \nminority has 20\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from California, Mrs. \nBoxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Reid-Levin Rockefeller-Biden amendment \nis very clear. I will read it again so that, hopefully, the American \npeople know what we are debating. This is what we are debating:\n\n       No Federal employee who discloses, or has disclosed, \n     classified information, including the identity of a covert \n     agent of the Central Intelligence Agency, to a person not \n     authorized to receive such information shall be permitted to \n     hold a security clearance for access to such information.\n\n  Why is this important? It is important because when this story broke, \nCIA agents and folks at the CIA were absolutely horrified that the name \nof a covert agent had been leaked, putting that covert agent in grave \ndanger.\n  Now who could vote against this? I don't know. We are going to find \nout. But let me state what I think it is about. Either you stand on the \nside of these brave undercover operatives who risk their lives every \nday, without people with a political agenda going after them to reveal \nthem, or you stand on the side of those who would play politics and \nhave played politics with their identity.\n  Why did it happen in this particular case? Because this particular \nadministration did not like what they heard from a particular \ngentleman, and to punish him, they went after his wife. And they didn't \ncare. You cannot tell me because you didn't use her everyday name that \nit was hard to find out who she was.\n  If somebody says Senator Boxer's husband did thus and so, even if he \nhad a different last name, it would not be too hard to find out who my \nhusband is.\n  So here we had a political agenda and Senator Coleman talks about how \nhorrible it is to play politics on the floor of the Senate. Publishing \nan ``enemy's list'' is the worst form, and the lowest form, of politics \nyou can have. This took it to a whole other level when it involved \nsomeone who was an undercover agent.\n  I want to say a word about the second-degree amendment, which is \nunbelievable. Under the second-degree amendment, if this passes, every \nsingle Member in the Senate will lose their security clearance. Anyone \nin this Senate who ever came down to the floor and said anything about \nthe pictures at Abu Ghraib will lose their clearance. Anyone who ever \ncame to the floor and said, I think it is important, when the President \nmakes a nomination, we get all the information, including reading an \nFBI report. Let me say, and I guess I will lose my clearance, but I \nwill say it right now, up against this amendment, this ridiculous \nsecond-degree amendment--I say right now, whenever the President \nnominates someone for a high position and there is an FBI file, I say \nto my friends, you are not doing your job if you do not read it.\n  Under this, I guess I lose my security clearance.\n  So be it. But I think everyone in this Senate has lost their security \nclearance because every one of us has spoken about the Iraqi war.\n  Now my colleague says we don't have a security clearance. You have \nread this. You have written this. So there you go.\n  Your side wrote, can't have a security clearance. So all I can say \nis, one side can say you are playing politics, the other side can. Put \nthat aside. Read this amendment. It is the right thing to do. Either \nyou stand on the side of the brave men and women who risk their lives \nundercover every day or you stand on the side of politics. You make up \nyour mind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, for the record, my good friend, my \ncolleague from California, does not have a security clearance. None of \nus do. We are deemed by the electorate to be cleared from the lowest to \nthe highest. We do not have a security clearance to lose.\n  So that is not accurate. And I don't court the venal part of this.\n  In terms of the second-degree amendment, unless I was hearing \nsomething different and somebody raised the issue, as Congress included \nin this--the Senate--along with Federal employees who either \nintentionally or unintentionally reveal classified information, Senator \nLevin, Senator Durbin, Senator Reid said ``yes.'' So that is reflective \nof the second-degree amendment.\n  If that is not the case, we have a double standard for Members of \nCongress or other public officials as opposed to Federal employees. We \nought to get that straight, which is why I think the suggestion from \nthe Senator from----\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. No. I only have 2 minutes. But perhaps on down the road.\n  That is why I think the suggestion of the Senator from Minnesota is a \ngood one, that we ought to go into a quorum call to try to figure out \nwhat this means.\n  Read the language in detail. Intentionally or unintentionally reveal \nclassified information--I have news for you, we have people in the \nintelligence community who make mistakes, inadvertently make mistakes. \nThis is going to end the career of many young people who will make \nmistakes down the road and lose their security clearance.\n  Security clearances are an administrative process, not a statutory \nprocess. The Reid amendment strips all distinction from employees in \nregard to their home agency and in regard to any discretion.\n  Mr. President, could I have one more minute?\n\n[[Page S8275]]\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I yield another minute to the Senator \nfrom Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for one \nadditional minute.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. So in your zeal to hang Karl Rove--and that is what this \nis about--you are going to put a stake in the careers of national \nsecurity professionals from here on in.\n  During the administrative procedure by that home agency or that \nperson's superior officer, they can be counseled, they can be \nadmonished, but they do not lose their security clearances. They do \nmake mistakes. I don't know how many that is going to be, but that is \ngoing to be a bunch.\n  That is going to send a chilling effect throughout our entire \nintelligence community. This is poorly written. We ought to go into a \nquorum call and work it together so we at least know what the outcome \nis going to be.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Could you yield now on your time?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I don't have any time. It is his time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New York, Mr. Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to compliment my \nfriend from Kansas for his remarks. While I am not sure he is right, he \nis doing what we should be doing on this floor. We presented an \namendment on a serious issue, and he is debating that amendment. He is \nsaying: Here is a place in the amendment that I think is wrong, and \nmaybe you ought to change it.\n  That is how a debate ought to go. But the response of my colleagues \nwho have cosponsored the other amendment is not that at all. It is not \nto debate a serious issue that involves national security. It is, \nrather, to create a smokescreen--``You stick it to us, we will stick it \nto you''--when we all know that the issue of who leaked this \ninformation is a serious issue. We did not say it is a serious issue. \nPresident Bush did. George Tenet did. The original investigation I was \ninvolved in creating because I called George Tenet and said: This is an \naffront to all CIA agents. He agreed, and called the Justice Department \nand said: Do an investigation. It is serious stuff.\n  What do we get in response? A smokescreen. It is almost sort of the \nchildish sticking out your tongue back at somebody. Debate the issue. I \ncan understand why you do not want to debate the issue. Somebody in the \nWhite House did something seriously wrong. Does anyone have any doubt \nthat if this occurred under a Democratic President that you would want \nto debate it, as you should? The opposition party is intended in this \nRepublic to be a check.\n  As I said, I originally called for this investigation. I worked with \nDeputy Attorney General Comey to get an independent counsel who was \nabove reproach. I never mentioned a word about any individual. Because \nthere was none. There was all this swirl about Karl Rove. You did not \nhear the senior Senator from New York talking about it. You, rather, \nheard me say: Let's get to the bottom of this.\n  But in the last 2 or 3 weeks, we have seen some serious and \nindisputable evidence. We do not know if it meets the criminal \nstandard. That is why I have not called for Karl Rove to step down. But \nwe do know, without any doubt, that security was compromised. You \ncannot hide behind the argument: Well, I mentioned the husband and not \nthe wife and, therefore, I didn't breach some kind of security.\n  While the criminal law standard says you had to know whether that \nwife was classified, whether Ms. Plame, Agent Plame was classified, \nthat is not the standard in terms of entitling someone with the \nprivilege of hearing national security secrets.\n  If you cannot keep those secrets, if you disclose those secrets, for \nwhatever motivation, and particularly a venal one, if that was the \ncase, political retribution, you do not deserve to continue to hear \nthose secrets. That is what the amendment offered by my colleagues from \nNevada and Michigan and West Virginia simply says. It is the right \nthing to do.\n  The President should have done it without any amendment. If someone \nleaks a name--and it looks more and more as though it was Karl Rove; \nand we know for an undisputed fact--his lawyer admitted it--he stepped \nright up to the line--we don't know if criminally he stepped over it or \nnot; that will be for Mr. Fitzgerald to determine, not for us--then he \nshould not have that security clearance.\n  You are right, my colleagues, we should not have to be here today. \nThe President should have done this on his own. And if you think the \namendment is poorly drafted, as my good friend from Kansas does, that \nis what this place is all about. Come and tell us why and how we can \nchange it and make it better.\n  But if the response is simply to say, ``Oh, we're going to try to \ncreate a smokescreen or maybe intimidate you on the other side,'' that \nis not worthy of what this body is about, at least in its better and \nfiner moments.\n  So, my colleagues, I would hope we could have a 100-to-nothing vote \non the amendment by the Senator from Nevada. Yes, it is embarrassing \nthat it happened in the White House, and they are Members of your \nparty. But it happened. No one disputes it happened. I do not think a \nsingle American thinks that nothing should be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I urge support of the Reid amendment and rejection of \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. REID. What time remains on both sides, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 17\\1/2\\ minutes. The minority \nhas 10 minutes 49 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would ask, under the usual status here, \nunder the usual procedure, that I would have the close here. But we \nhave more time than you have, as I understand it--17\\1/2\\ minutes--and \nyou have 10; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 17\\1/2\\ minutes. The minority \nhas 10 minutes 49 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. I was just thinking we were in the majority, but I guess we \nare not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I yield such time to the majority whip as \nhe needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Frist amendment, \nwhich is one of the two votes we will have shortly.\n  First, let me say, I regret we are spending an hour and a half of the \nSenate's time, when we should be debating and completing the Homeland \nSecurity bill, engaged in extensive political sparring.\n  The Karl Rove amendment--and that is exactly what it is--richly \ndeserves to be defeated. I certainly would encourage all of our \ncolleagues to vote against that amendment when it is before us shortly.\n  But with regard to the Frist amendment, Senators ought to be \nespecially careful when they repeat unproven allegations about the \nconduct of our troops, particularly during a time of war. Our enemies \ncan make use of such statements. And their propaganda puts at risk our \nservice men and women who are, of course, out there protecting us every \nday.\n  Unfortunately, this very thing happened last month when one of our \ncolleagues repeated unproven allegations about our service men and \nwomen who were interrogating suspected terrorists. It was reported in \nthe Middle East. It would be hard to believe that it did not do damage \nto our troops while we continue to fight in the war on terror in that \nregion.\n  It seems to me if we are going to impose strict liability on Federal \nemployees who act indiscreetly, then we should not have a different \nstandard for ourselves. I know our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have indicated that the Reid amendment intends to include \nSenators, but it seems not to be drafted that way. If Senators disclose \nclassified information or repeat unproven allegations that endanger our \ntroops, then it seems to me we ought to lose our access to classified \ninformation as well.\n  The Reid amendment does not do that because it talks about Federal \nemployees, which seems to mean only\n\n[[Page S8276]]\n\ncivil servants. Again, I acknowledge and recognize that those on the \nother side of the aisle have said it means to include us. However, it \ndoes not seem to in the plain meaning of the amendment.\n  The Frist amendment makes it clear that we, as Federal officeholders, \nalso lose our access to confidential information if we act rashly, \nintemperately, and thereby put our troops at risk. What the Frist \namendment is about is the security of our servicemen and our \nservicewomen.\n  Statements on the Senate floor--out here on the Senate floor--\ncomparing our service men and women to tyrannical regimes that result \nin risking their safety must not and should not stand. I hope when the \nSenate has an opportunity to address both of these amendments shortly, \nthe Reid amendment will be defeated and the Frist amendment will be \nadopted.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support the Reid amendment. \nIt is something we have to do, given the White House inaction on Mr. \nRove's behavior. We hear nitpicking about words. What was the \nintention? Is it ex post facto law? No, it is not ex post facto law. We \nare not just writing a law here. What we are doing is trying to curtail \na situation that enables someone at the White House level to make a \nstatement that, frankly, sounds as if it is traitorous, as defined in \nApril of 1999, when former President George H. W. Bush said, speaking \nabout the outing of a CIA agent and sources: ``I have nothing but \ncontempt and anger for those who betray the trust by exposing the name \nof our sources. They are in my view the most insidious of traitors.'' \nThat is right: traitors.\n  So now we know who leaked the information, revealed publicly, Mr. \nRove. Where is the appropriate action? Well, here is a quote from a \nWhite House press briefing with Scott McClellan on September 29, 2003.\n\n       Q: You said this morning, quote, ``The President knows that \n     Karl Rove wasn't involved.'' How does he know that?\n       A: Well, I've made it very clear that it was a ridiculous \n     suggestion in the first place. . . . I've said that it's not \n     true. . . . And I have spoken with Karl Rove. . . .\n       Q: When you talked to Mr. Rove, did you discuss, ``Did you \n     ever have this information?''\n       A: I've made it very clear, he was not involved, that \n     there's no truth to the suggestion that he was.\n\n  We go to the next episode. This is Scott McClellan on September 29, \n2003:\n\n       If anyone in this administration was involved in it, they \n     would no longer be in this administration.\n\n  I guess it takes a long time to terminate somebody. That was over a \nyear and a half ago.\n  President George W. Bush said on September 30, 2003:\n\n       If somebody did leak classified information, I'd like to \n     know it, and will take appropriate action.\n\n  It is pretty clear what is intended here. He violated the rules of \nthe White House here. Why shouldn't the public be aware of the fact \nthat, as they try to distribute guilt all over the place, it comes from \nthe President's very senior assistant? That is what we are talking \nabout. The rest of this is trivial. It is getting even. It is \nrecrimination: I will get you if you get me.\n  So we ought to move on positively on the Reid vote. Let's see how \neverybody stands on this, whether they want the public to know the \ntruth; and that is: Karl Rove, did he violate the rules? Did he violate \nthe regulations when he went ahead and revealed something that never \nshould have been made public, the identification of a CIA employee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, last week we saw the terrorist attack on \nan ally. Our country faces very important homeland security challenges. \nWe have been in the midst of debating important public policy issues--\nhow best to secure mass transit or to prepare our first responders. I \ncannot believe the Senate has diverted from that important debate--a \ndebate important to Americans all across this country--and instead of \nfinishing up the Homeland Security bill, we have diverted to debate \nthese issues.\n  We should not be doing this. This is exactly why the American public \nholds Congress in such low esteem right now.\n  We should be focusing on the national security and homeland security \nchallenges facing this Nation. We should not be engaging in this \ndebate. I, for one, am going to vote no on both of the amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I understand the frustration of my \ncolleague from Maine. I urge that we lower the rhetoric here and go \nabout doing our business. There is a special counsel looking at this. \nContrary to what my colleague from New Jersey said--he said we are not \nwriting the law here--that is what we are doing. We are writing a law \nhere. I have worked with my colleagues across the aisle. I have worked \nwith them on the permanent subcommittee, on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I know how studious they are. I know how focused they are in \ndoing the right thing. I know how when they want to do something, they \nwant to make sure it is complete. They want to make sure they have \nexamined it.\n  They can all see what we are doing here. It is about politics. We are \nwriting a law here. We are writing it on the run. We are writing it \nwithout clarifying the definition of who is covered. We are writing it \nwithout clarifying what the standard of intent is, whether it is beyond \nnegligent conduct. We are writing it without reflection on an existing \nExecutive order that covers the conduct we all want to deal with.\n  My colleague from California was right. Whose side are you on? Are \nyou on the side of the agents who risk their lives to protect the \nAmerican dream and the American ideal, things this body is supposed to \nstand for, or are you for politics? Today we are about politics. Today \nwe are diverting from a $31 billion bill to protect America's security, \nand we are debating politics.\n  We don't know the facts. We have a special counsel whose job it is to \nget the facts. The President is committed to act on that. Instead we \nare playing politics. This is not a shining moment for the Senate. I \nhave to believe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that. \nI urge my colleagues to defeat the Reid amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I have two quick points. First, the \ncurrent law which has been referred to by my good friend from Minnesota \nis a discretionary law. Whether someone does this intentionally or \nnegligently, the violation may or may not lead to the loss of one's \nclearance. That is simply too loose. It is too discretionary. It has \nresulted in leak after leak after leak. It is long overdue that we \ntighten this law, and that is the effort of the amendment before us. It \nrelates directly to the national security of the United States.\n  I agree with my dear friend from Maine when she says we have to \naddress national security issues. Protection of the classified identity \nof CIA agents is essential to the national security of the United \nStates. If one identifies an agent, a CIA agent, it seems to me that \nperson should lose their clearance, no ifs, no ands, no buts. That is \nnot something which should be left to a ``may'' lose one's clearance. \nIt should be a ``shall'' lose one's clearance.\n  On the second-degree amendment, the amendment of the majority leader, \nwhen it states that . . . ``Any Federal officerholder that makes a \nstatement based on an FBI agent's comments which is used as \npropaganda'' shall lead to the loss of clearance, we had a whole \nhearing yesterday about FBI agents' statements. Those statements were \nhighly critical of the Department of Defense employees at Guantanamo. \nThese included a number of FBI agents' e-mails that were critical. \nThose were the subject of a hearing of the Armed Services Committee \nyesterday. Many\n\n[[Page S8277]]\n\nmembers of the Armed Services Committee were highly critical of the \nconduct of some of the people at Guantanamo as reflected in those FBI \ne-mails.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the minority leader.\n  Madam President, I want to raise this point: If you can't discuss the \nissue of intelligence and security on a bill about homeland security, \nwhere would you raise the issue? What we are talking about here are men \nand women who are the first line of defense against terrorism. These \nare intelligence agents who literally, many of them, risk their lives \nevery day to protect Americans.\n  What happened here? There was a decision made by some people in the \nWhite House--that is what Mr. Novak said--to disclose the identity of a \ncovert CIA agent, the wife of former Ambassador Joe Wilson, for the \npurpose of political retribution. That is what it was all about. They \nwere angry with Ambassador Wilson, and so they were going to disclose \nhis wife's identity, a woman who had put her life on the line for the \nUnited States. That disclosure endangered her life and the lives of \neveryone she worked with. It was political.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is right. At the heart of this is \npolitics: a decision by someone in the White House at the highest level \nfor political revenge to go after the identity of this woman.\n  Let me tell you what other CIA officers had to say about it. They all \nhappen to be Republicans. After this happened, this is what they said, \nthose who were contemporaries of hers:\n\n       My classmates and I have been betrayed. Together, we have \n     kept the secret of each other's identities for over 18 years. \n     . . . This issue is not just about a blown cover. It is about \n     the destruction of the very essence, the core, of human \n     intelligence collection activities--plausible deniability--\n     apparently for partisan domestic reasons.\n\n  We have heard people come to the floor on the Republican side who \nhave said this is all political and it is not that important and why \ndon't we get back to the bill. It is important. What Senator Reid has \noffered--an amendment which I am proud to cosponsor--basically says, if \nyou disclose the identity of a covert CIA agent, you lose your security \nclearance. Why? Because why should we continue to give information to \npeople about those who are risking their lives for America if they are \ngoing to misuse it, in this case, for political purposes? That is what \nthis is all about. It is fundamental and basic.\n  For those who say: I am going to vote against that, think about what \nyou are saying. You are saying a person can disclose the identity of a \nCIA agent and still keep their security clearance, gathering more \ninformation and the identity of more agents. How can that give the men \nand women in our intelligence community any confidence that we stand \nbehind them? I don't believe it can.\n  There is a second-degree amendment that has been offered and referred \nto by the Senator from Kentucky. In the time I have been on Capitol \nHill, it may be the worst drawn amendment I have ever seen. I don't \nthink those who put it together sat down and read it very carefully. \nBecause if they did, they would understand that the language they put \nin it is so broad and so expansive that it draws together many innocent \npeople and many people they didn't intend.\n  Listen to this: Any Federal officerholder who makes reference to a \nclassified Federal Bureau of Investigation report on the floor of the \nSenate shall lose their security clearance.\n  We did a quick check. I am sorry to say to the Senator from Kentucky, \nyou are going to be stunned to know that many chairmen and former \nchairmen of the Senate Judiciary Committee have done just that. They \nhave disclosed a classified reference to a classified Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation report on the floor of the Senate. I won't read all the \nnames of my colleagues into the Record--I guess I could--who have come \nto the floor and have already violated this provision in the second-\ndegree amendment.\n  One of my colleagues was on the floor. I went to him and said: I am \nnot going to read your name into the Record. You did it. You may not \nhave known you did it, but you did.\n  This amendment was so poorly drafted that it has brought all of them \nunder this prohibition where they can't have a security clearance.\n  Let me tell you the second part on which the Senator from Kentucky \ncontinues to make reference. If the standard is, whatever we say on the \nfloor may be used by an organization such as Al-Jazeera against the \nUnited States, we are in trouble. These are the clippings from Al-\nJazeera's Internet site where they have cited Senator after Senator for \nthings they have said on the floor. Be careful on the second-degree \namendment. It goes far beyond what they intended.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 1 more minute to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senate Armed Services Committee had a meeting \nyesterday. They discussed FBI reports about Abu Ghraib, about \nGuantanamo. They have no control--the members of that committee--about \nhow those reports will be used by others. Here is the Al-Jazeera Web \nsite which referred to Senators on that committee who were using those \nreports. Under the language of the amendment being offered by the \nSenator from Kentucky and the majority leader, these Senators, who \nbelieved they were doing their job, would lose their security \nclearance. I know they are trying to come back and attack us and say, \nif you are going to say something negative about Karl Rove, we are \ngoing to say something negative about you. But this amendment was so \npoorly drawn that they have drawn into their net of suspicion and \naccusation many of their own colleagues.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, there might be a contest between which \nof these amendments is most poorly drafted. The Reid amendment that \nkicked off this event, that surprised me when it came up in this last \nminute, says that ``No Federal employee who discloses, or has disclosed \nclassified information . . . '' And goodness, that has already been \ndisclosed. It is something that has already happened. Apparently, it is \nnot a violation of the law. Now we are going to reach back and make it \na violation of law. That is ex post facto law. It would come back from \nthe Supreme Court, if anybody were ever charged and convicted under it, \nlike a rubber ball off the wall.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will my friend yield for a question on that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. No, 2 minutes is all I have.\n  It also says ``no Federal employee,'' and the Senator says that \nincludes Senators. He can say it includes turnips, but it doesn't \ninclude Senators. It says Federal employees, and that does not cover \nSenators. It also says a covert agent, and there is no intent or \nknowledge required. So a person could mention a name not knowing they \nwere a covert agent and be subject to this punishment. Frankly, I don't \nthink the other amendment is much better. Both should be voted down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. How much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9 minutes 31 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I yield 2 minutes to the majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I thank my friend from Minnesota.\n  While we are talking about poorly drafted amendments, listen to this. \nUnder the Reid amendment, it imposes a standard of strict liability so \nthat a civil servant who loses his wallet would lose his security \nclearance. A civil servant who loses his wallet under the Reid \namendment would lose his security clearance. What is the point of all \nthis? We ought not to be, as Senator Collins pointed out, having these \npolitical debates on this bill. But if our colleagues on the other side \ninsist on trying to offer these kinds of amendments, I think the point \nneeds to be made clearly that there will be amendments offered on this \nside. In other words, this kind of political gamesmanship on the Senate \nfloor will not\n\n[[Page S8278]]\n\nstand, will not be yielded to, will not succeed. In the end, the public \nwill only get the impression that we are playing games here when we \nshould be dealing with their business. Their business, the underlying \nbill, is the Homeland Security bill, of extraordinary importance to our \ncountry. Hopefully, shortly the time will run out, and we will get back \nto doing the people's business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, before we close, I do want to get back \nto perhaps some of the underlying facts that motivated this amendment. \nBy the way, we don't know the facts. We just know what we have read. \nThe Democratic leader cited a poll that appeared in the Wall Street \nJournal. I have an editorial that appeared in the Wall Street Journal \nyesterday, July 13. I ask unanimous consent to print it in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 13, 2005]\n\n                        Karl Rove, Whistleblower\n\n       Democrats and most of the Beltway press corps are baying \n     for Karl Rove's head over his role in exposing a case of CIA \n     nepotism involving Joe Wilson and his wife, Valerie Plame. On \n     the contrary, we'd say the White House political guru \n     deserves a prize--perhaps the next iteration of the ``Truth-\n     Telling'' award that The Nation magazine bestowed upon Mr. \n     Wilson before the Senate Intelligence Committee exposed him \n     as a fraud.\n       For Mr. Rove is turning out to be the real \n     ``whistleblower'' in this whole sorry pseudo-scandal. He's \n     the one who warned Time's Matthew Cooper and other reporters \n     to be wary of Mr. Wilson's credibility. He's the one who told \n     the press the truth that Mr. Wilson had been recommended for \n     the CIA consulting gig by his wife, not by Vice President \n     Dick Cheney as Mr. Wilson was asserting on the airwaves. In \n     short, Mr. Rove provided important background so Americans \n     could understand that Mr. Wilson wasn't a whistleblower but \n     was a partisan trying to discredit the Iraq War in an \n     election campaign. Thank you, Mr. Rove.\n       Media chants aside, there's no evidence that Mr. Rove broke \n     any laws in telling reporters that Ms. Plame may have played \n     a role in her husband's selection for a 2002 mission to \n     investigate reports that Iraq was seeking uranium ore in \n     Niger. To be prosecuted under the 1982 Intelligence \n     Identities Protection Act, Mr. Rove would had to have \n     deliberately and maliciously exposed Ms. Plame knowing that \n     she was an undercover agent and using information he'd \n     obtained in an official capacity. But it appears Mr. Rove \n     didn't even know Ms. Plame's name and had only heard bout her \n     work at Langley from other Journalists.\n       On the ``no underlying crime'' point, moreover, no less \n     than the New York Times and Washington Post now agree. So do \n     the 136 major news organizations that filed a legal brief in \n     March aimed at keeping Mr. Cooper and the New York Times's \n     Judith Miller out of jail.\n       ``While an investigation of the leak was justified, it is \n     far from clear--at least on the public record--that a crime \n     took place,'' the Post noted the other day. Granted the media \n     have come a bit late to this understanding, and then only to \n     protect their own, but the logic of their argument is that \n     Mr. Rove did nothing wrong either.\n       The same can't be said for Mr. Wilson, who first ``outed'' \n     himself as a CIA consultant in a melodramatic New York Times \n     op-ed in July 2003. At the time he claimed to have thoroughly \n     debunked the Iraq-Niger yellowcake uranium connection that \n     President Bush had mentioned in his now famous ``16 words'' \n     on the subject in that year's State of the Union address.\n       Mr. Wilson also vehemently denied it when columnist Robert \n     Novak first reported that his wife had played a role in \n     selecting him for the Niger mission. He promptly signed up as \n     adviser to the Kerry campaign and was feted almost everywhere \n     in the media, including repeat appearances on NBC's ``Meet \n     the Press'' and a photo spread (with Valerie) in Vanity Fair.\n       But his day in the political sun was short-lived. The \n     bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report last July \n     cited the note that Ms. Plame had sent recommending her\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. It talks about Karl Rove the ``whistleblower.'' I don't \nwant to read all of it, but in part it reads:\n\n       For Mr. Rove is turning out to be the real \n     ``whistleblower'' in this whole sorry pseudoscandal. He's the \n     one who warned Time's Matthew Cooper and other reporters to \n     be wary of Mr. Wilson's credibility. He's the one who told \n     the press the truth that Mr. Wilson had been recommended for \n     the CIA consulting gig by his wife, not by Vice President \n     Dick Cheney as Mr. Wilson was asserting on the airwaves. In \n     short, Mr. Rove provided important background so Americans \n     could understand that Mr. Wilson wasn't a whistleblower but \n     was a partisan trying to discredit the Iraq War in an \n     election campaign.\n\n  I believe what I have read, that Mr. Rove may have said it was \nWilson's wife who worked at the CIA. We don't know that. Did he know \nshe was a covert agent. We don't know.\n  It goes on and on to talk about the 1982 law:\n\n        . . . Mr. Rove would had to have deliberately and \n     maliciously exposed Ms. Plame knowing that she was an \n     undercover agent and using information he'd obtained in an \n     official capacity. But it appears Mr. Rove didn't even know \n     Ms. Plame's name and had only heard about her work at Langley \n     from other journalists.\n\n  We don't know what he knows, Madam President. That is why there is a \nspecial counsel, and we should wait to find out what he finds. Nobody \nis arguing about debating these issues, but we are arguing about \npassing legislation. Contrary to what my friend from New Jersey says, \nwe are writing a law. I want to remind my colleagues that we are \nwriting a law that doesn't, on its face, in the language of it, cover \nus. As my friend from Alabama said, they say it covers us, but it \ndoesn't. We don't come under the definition of Federal employees. So we \nare not covered by this hastily crafted, politically motivated \namendment. This covers inadvertent, accidental, an act of God, \nanything, and your career is going to be impacted.\n  There is a reason we have an Executive order that has been in effect \nfor 10 years, which has a standard of knowingly, willfully, and \nnegligently. It covers the kind of conduct that you want to have \ncovered.\n  The bottom line is this is about politics, that we have wasted a lot \nof the time of this body--the greatest deliberative body in the world--\nand this is not a shining moment. Let's get about doing our business \nand passing appropriations, shoring up homeland defense. Let's put the \npolitics aside and let the special counsel do his work. Let's lower the \nlevel of the rhetoric and move on and keep doing the business of the \npeople.\n  With that, I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I will use my leader time. I believe this \nis a shining moment. It is shining the spotlight on what is going on in \nthis country--abuse of power, diversion, and, of course, a coverup.\n  The analogy my dear friend from Kentucky used about the wallet is, \nfor lack of a better description, without foundation. Anybody who \nthinks what we are doing is unimportant, I invite them to travel with \nme--as I did a number of years ago--to the CIA. When you walk into that \nfacility at Langley, the first thing you see are the stars up on the \nwall for each CIA agent who has been slain, killed in the line of duty. \nI have never forgotten that. That is what this is all about.\n  We have someone who has obviously disclosed a name. We read it in the \npaper. Whether it is Karl Rove, I don't know. Someone did. This \namendment says if someone does that, they should not have a security \nclearance. My friend, who I care a great deal about, the chairman of \nthe homeland security authorizing committee, came to the floor and said \nthe American people are fed up with what happened. She is right about \nthat, too, because not much happens on issues they care about--issues \nlike this staggering deficit. There was a celebration at the White \nHouse yesterday because the deficit was only the third largest in the \nhistory of the country. Education is failing. We know we have all kinds \nof problems in health care. Those are the issues we should be dealing \nwith. Gas prices--maybe people care about that. We know they do.\n  So this is important. But when my friends on the other side are on \nthe ropes, they attack. Just like in the Washington Post yesterday, I \nquote again:\n\n       The emerging GOP strategy, devised by RNC Chairman Ken \n     Mehlman, is to try to undermine those Democrats calling for \n     Rove's ouster, play down Rove's role, and wait for President \n     Bush's forthcoming Supreme Court selection to drown out the \n     controversy.\n\n  This is a coverup, an abuse of power, and it is a diversion. They \nhave no interest in coming clean and being honest with the American \npeople. The American people are seeing through\n\n[[Page S8279]]\n\nthis. When I mentioned the Wall Street Journal, I say to my friend from \nMinnesota, I wasn't vouching for the editorial policy. I don't read \nthem. I was vouching for a news story that had a poll they conducted \nwith NBC. The poll showed that only 41 percent of Americans believe the \nPresident is being honest and straightforward. That is what this is \nabout. It is a coverup, an abuse of power, and a diversion.\n  It is time to quit playing partisan politics and do some legislating \nfor the American people. It is time for the White House to come clean. \nEveryone should support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I will speak in leader time. For nearly 2 \nweeks, we have been working in a bipartisan manner for the goal of \npassing the Homeland Security bill, which spends almost $32 billion for \nhomeland security, all of which is one of our most basic \nresponsibilities, and that is to keep the American people safe and \nsecure.\n  That is what the Senate, this body, was hard at work doing--up until \nabout 2 hours ago, when the Democratic leadership chose raw, partisan \nparty politics over protecting American lives. They filed their \npolitical amendments.\n  You know, the American people want better from their leaders than \npetty politics. Through their votes, they have put their trust in us, \nand they have elected us to serve their interests and, thus, this is a \nsad and a disappointing afternoon in the Senate.\n  Madam President, there is a special counsel who has been appointed to \nlook at the whole issue of the CIA leak case. He is doing his job and \nhe is investigating this whole matter. Do my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle think that without any of the facts, the hundreds of \nhours of manpower, and interviews, and the investigation that the \nspecial counsel has done, they are better equipped to judge the facts \nof this case?\n  We should let the special counsel do his job, and we should focus on \nour jobs as Senators, which is, first and foremost, protecting the \nAmerican people.\n  Lastly, I want to say that I think the first speech I gave in this \nCongress was an olive branch to reach out and say let's focus on \ncivility. I thought the bitterly contested elections that we saw--once \nthey were behind us, I thought we could focus on doing the Nation's \nbusiness, moving America forward, governing.\n  Unfortunately, even on an issue that we should all agree on--homeland \nsecurity--my colleagues prefer to score political points rather than \nfocusing on the Nation's business. It is this kind of political stunt \nthat causes many Americans watching to lose faith in this body, in \nelected officials. Let's get back to serving our constituents and get \nback to the issues that really matter to the American people, such as \nhomeland security, protecting our country from terrorist attacks, \nstrengthening our highways and transportation infrastructure, and \npursuing a national energy policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to let civility and duty to the American people \nprevail. Oppose the Reid amendment; support the Frist amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Frist \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

\n     and\n       (6) the recommendations of the Comptroller General of the \n     United States, if any, for improving the Homeland Security \n     Advisory System, including recommendations regarding--\n       (A) measures that could be carried out to build greater \n     public awareness and confidence in the work of the Council;\n       (B) whether the Council and the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security could benefit from greater transparency and the \n     development of more clearly articulated public standards in \n     the threat level decision-making process;\n       (C) whether the current composition of the Council should \n     be modified to include representatives from the States; and\n       (D) the measures that could be carried out to minimize the \n     costs to States and municipalities during periods when the \n     Homeland Security Advisory System is raised to level to Code \n     Orange.\n       (d) The report required by subsection (b) shall be \n     submitted in an unclassified form.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1206\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I offered an amendment that would ensure \nthe continued funding and operation of the United States Fire \nAdministration. I offered this amendment on behalf of myself and the \nthree other Cochairmen of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, \nSenators DeWine, Biden, and McCain, as well as Senators Mikulski, \nMurray, Feingold, Corzine, and Stabenow.\n  This amendment simply designates $52.6 million in funds for the \nUnited States Fire Administration, USFA. This amount is equal to the \nAdministration's fiscal year 2006 budget request, and represents a \nslight increase\n\n[[Page S8281]]\n\nof $1.3 million over last year's funding level.\n  The amendment calls for no additional funding in the underlying bill, \nand thus requires no offset. USFA has traditionally been funded through \nthe Department's preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery \naccount. However, without a congressional allocation or line item for \nUSFA in the Department's annual appropriations bill, Congress has \nfailed to adequately acknowledge its continued support for the use of \nthese funds. As a result, there is annual confusion and uncertainty \nregarding the level of funding USFA will ultimately receive. This \namendment is therefore simply an exercise in good government, providing \ntransparency and accountability in how we allocate our limited homeland \nsecurity funds.\n  This amendment is also quite modest. In 2003, the Senate unanimously \napproved legislation to reauthorize USFA through fiscal year 2008. This \nlegislation, which was signed into law by the President on December 6, \n2003, calls for $64.85 million in the coming fiscal year for USFA's \noperations. While I believe USFA should ideally receive funding at this \nfully authorized level, this amendment is a bipartisan compromise that \nwill ensure that, at a minimum, the agency will be able to maintain its \nessential functions.\n  At a time when there are sharp disagreements over our homeland \nsecurity priorities, the U.S. Fire Administration remains a proven \ninvestment, providing critical training and resources to our Nation's \nfirst responders. In this regard, I was pleased that Homeland Security \nSecretary Michael Chertoff, in his remarks yesterday unveiling the \nDepartment's Second Stage Review Results, affirmed USFA's important \nrole in the transformed Department. In designating USFA as a \nconstituent element of the Department's new Preparedness Directorate, \nSecretary Chertoff noted the Fire Administration's expertise, declaring \nthat this move would ``strengthen our linkages and our preparation \nwithin the fire services.''\n  In 1973, a landmark report entitled America Burning was produced by \nthe National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control. Among many \nother findings and recommendations, America Burning called for the \ncreation of a national agency dedicated to serving and improving the \nfire services. In response to that report, Congress created such an \nagency in 1974, which would later become what we now know as the United \nStates Fire Administration. USFA provides training, guidance, and \nsupport to firehouses around the country from those who understand them \nbest--fire service professionals themselves. USFA's current \nAdministrator, R. David Paulison, is a terrific example of the agency's \nexpertise. Chief Paulison, who has ably led the agency for the past 4 \nyears, is a 30-year veteran of the fire services and former chief of \nthe Miami-Dade County Fire Department.\n\n  Among USFA's most vital functions is its role as the Nation's premier \ntraining center for our fire service leaders. The National Fire Academy \nis the centerpiece of USFA's training programs and has educated an \nestimated 1.4 million fire leaders since its first class was held in \n1975. Although headquartered in Emmitsburg, Maryland, the Academy \nconducts courses all over the Nation in order to maximize the number of \nfire leaders who can benefit from its instructors' expertise. \nSignificantly, the Academy now offers training and coursework in the \nNational Incident Management System, NIMS, and the National Response \nPlan, NRP, two critical elements of our overall homeland security \nstrategy. USFA also houses the Emergency Management Institute, EMI, \nwhich offers a full complement of courses and programs for state, \nlocal, and tribal emergency management officials from across the \ncountry.\n  Since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security 3 years \nago, there have been grave concerns in the first responder community \nthat efforts were underway in the Department to reduce the role of \nUSFA, as well as its support, perhaps culminating in the agency's \neventual demise. This past February, the International Association of \nFire Chiefs held a summit meeting of 17 major fire service \norganizations to address concerns about USFA's funding, and its future \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security.\n  On April 8, 2005, the findings of that summit were unanimously \nendorsed by the 45 national fire groups that comprise the National \nAdvisory Committee of the Congressional Fire Services Institute. Among \nthe goals in this agreement was the following:\n\n       [T]he fire service recommends that both the President's \n     budget and the DHS's appropriations bills have a separate \n     line item for the USFA. Currently, the USFA funding is \n     included in the ``Preparedness, Mitigation, Response, and \n     Recovery'' account, and it is hard to determine exactly how \n     much money has been appropriated for the USFA. Since Congress \n     specifically authorizes funding for the USFA in a separate \n     bill, there also should be a line item in the president's \n     budget and appropriations bills to hold the President and \n     Congress accountable to the authorization levels that they \n     approved.\n\n  This amendment would achieve this reasonable and modest goal, which \nwas unanimously and vigorously supported by our Nation's major fire \nservice groups.\n  This amendment is endorsed by the International Association of Fire \nChiefs and the Congressional Fire Services Institute. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a letter from IAFC President Bob DiPoli be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      International Association of\n\n\n                                                  Fire Chiefs,\n\n                                       Fairfax, VA, July 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: Thank you for offering an amendment \n     to the fiscal year (FY) 2006 homeland security appropriations \n     bill to ensure that the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) is \n     funded at $52.6 million. The International Association of \n     Fire Chiefs (IAFC) endorses this amendment. We believe that \n     specific, dedicated funding for the USFA will shine a light \n     on the agency's critical role in preparing firefighters to \n     respond to all hazards, from the everyday house fire to a \n     terrorist attack. An appropriation of $52.6 million will \n     allow the USFA to fulfill this important mission.\n       Established in 1873, the IAFC is a network of more than \n     12,000 chief fire and emergency officers. Our members are the \n     nation's experts in responding to structural and wildland \n     fires, hazardous materials incidents (including chemical, \n     biological, radiological, and nuclear events), technical \n     rescues (including swiftwater rescues, confined-space \n     rescues, and auto extrication), and emergency medical \n     situations.\n       In late 2004, many fire service leaders began to express \n     concern that the USFA and its training arm, the National Fire \n     Academy (NFA), were suffering a diminished role within the \n     U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), as well as \n     diminished funding. On February 24, 2005, representatives of \n     17 major fire service organizations met in Washington, DC to \n     examine USFA's funding and decide upon a course of action. \n     U.S. Fire Administrator R. David Paulison and Acting FEMA \n     Director of Operations Kenneth O. Burris briefed the \n     attendees on the status of funding at USFA and NFA and \n     addressed the future of those agencies.\n       With regard to USFA funding, the results of the summit can \n     be boiled down to this: America's fire and emergency services \n     are the first to respond to--and the last to leave--any \n     incident, large or small. The U.S. Fire Administration serves \n     as the lead federal agency in addressing the federal \n     government's role vis-a-vis our nation's fire and emergency \n     services, and training America's fire service leaders on \n     everyday fire fighting as well as new national preparedness \n     requirements such as the National Response Plan (NRP) and the \n     National Incident Management System (NIMS). The USFA also \n     plays a key role in coordinating critical infrastructure \n     protection awareness and information-sharing activities for \n     the emergency management and response sector. Because of its \n     unique role, USFA must have adequate resources to fulfill its \n     mandated mission.\n       The fire service organizations believe that USFA is under-\n     funded. In 2003, Congress passed the United States Fire \n     Administration Reauthorization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-169), \n     which authorized funding for USFA from FY 2004 through FY \n     2009. Congress authorized $63 million for USFA in FY 2005 and \n     $64.9 million in FY 2006. By contrast, the estimated USFA \n     funding for FY 2005 is $51.3 million, of which $9.6 \n     million will fund the NFA. At the February 24th summit, \n     the U.S. Fire Administrator informed the fire service \n     representatives that the president intends to fund the \n     USFA at $52.6 million in FY 2006.\n       If funded at $52.6 million, USFA will be able to expand its \n     training capabilities and enhance its course development, \n     ensuring that the NRP and the NIMS were included in every \n     course. It would allow the USFA to add more courses and hire \n     staff to replace retirees. USFA could streamline two-week \n     courses into one-week courses by adding a more robust and \n     interactive online component, thereby allowing more students \n     to\n\n[[Page S8282]]\n\n     take classes at the NFA. The USFA could use the increased \n     funding to improve and expand other online courses. Finally, \n     the USFA could expand national prevention, public education, \n     research, and data collection programs to more effectively \n     address fire and life safety challenges that threaten lives \n     and the national infrastructure.\n       According to a December 30, 2004 editorial in Fire Chief \n     magazine, current USFA funding levels are putting on hold new \n     course development, course revisions and contract reviewers \n     for applied research projects. The budget for the Executive \n     Fire Officer Program, which trains senior officers and others \n     in key leadership positions with graduate-level courses in \n     transforming the fire service, has been cut from $233,000 to \n     $65,000. According to a high-ranking USFA official who \n     recently retired, the NFA's role in the prevention of fires, \n     injuries, and now terrorism is rapidly diminishing. Finally, \n     at current funding levels, it will be difficult for USFA to \n     train as many firefighters, and to incorporate the NIMS and \n     NRP into all of its courses, as it could do with higher \n     funding levels. As of FY 2006, the DHS Office of State and \n     Local Government Coordination and Preparedness will begin to \n     tie compliance with the NRP and NIMS to the receipt of \n     federal homeland security funding. Clearly, funding USFA at \n     $52.6 million will benefit America's fire service and public \n     safety generally.\n       The need for a line item for the USFA budget in the \n     homeland security appropriations bill stems from the fact \n     that the USFA has suffered an unjustly diminished role within \n     DHS. Before the department was established in 2003, only the \n     director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) \n     stood between the U.S. Fire Administrator and the president. \n     Because FEMA was the lead federal emergency response agency, \n     the fire service could influence the development of response \n     policies and conduct training for national emergencies. Those \n     policies and that training had the benefit of real-world, on-\n     the-ground experience. However, when the DHS was created, the \n     Emergency Preparedness and Response (EP) Directorate \n     absorbed both FEMA and the USFA. Now, the USFA reports \n     through FEMA, which reports through the EP Directorate, \n     which reports through the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     the president.\n       A line item would increase the accountability that the \n     USFA, the EP Directorate, and the DHS have to Congress. \n     Good government principles dictate that an agency having its \n     own authorization bill should have an individual \n     appropriation. A line item would allow Congress--which deemed \n     the USFA important enough to have its own authorization--the \n     ability to judge for itself whether the USFA is using \n     appropriated funds to the maximum public benefit.\n       For these reasons, the IAFC is pleased to endorse your \n     amendment. I applaud you for taking a leadership role on this \n     very important national safety issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     Chief Robert A. DiPoli, Ret.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that we turn to \nthe Boxer amendment and she be recognized for 2 minutes on that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \na period of 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair so much. I call up amendment No. 1216, \non behalf of myself and Senator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, since 9/11, those of us on the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, in a very bipartisan way, have attempted to \nbring legislation to the Senate to begin the process whereby we can \nprotect our nuclear power plants, first by making sure that there is an \nassessment made on each power plant, what are their vulnerability \nneeds, and then making sure that these plants are protected from \nterrorists.\n  We know that on September 10, 2002, in a taped interview on Al-\nJazeera, it included a statement that al-Qaida initially wanted to \ninclude a powerplant in its attacks on the United States. And we on the \ncommittee passed out a bill and passed another one last month. This \namendment says it is the sense of the Senate it should pass bipartisan \nlegislation to address nuclear powerplant security prior to the August \nrecess.\n  Colleagues, we have a limited time. We need to move forward.\n   I would accept a voice vote, if that is OK with Senator Gregg, and I \nthink he would prefer that. But we would like to have a clear voice \nvote if we could at this time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe we are ready to vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I send up a modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification of the \namendment? Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1216), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.     .

No action was taken by the \n     full Senate.\n       (3) Last month, the Senate Environment and Public Works \n     Committee again approved bipartisan legislation to improve \n     nuclear plant security.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Congress should pass bipartisan legislation to \n     address nuclear power plant security prior to the August \n     recess.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Without objection, the amendments are \nwithdrawn.\n\n\n                   reigning in government contractors\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with \nmy good friend and colleague Senator Bond, the Chairman of the \nTransportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, \nand Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  I had intended to offer an amendment to the Homeland Security \nAppropriations bill today. However, I understand that Senator Bond has \nagreed to work with me on the issues contained in my amendment in order \nto address tax cheats in the Transportation, Treasury Appropriations \nbill instead. I appreciate Senator Bond's interest in this important \nissue and I also appreciate his willingness to work with me to ensure \nthat this common sense, bipartisan amendment is included in his \nappropriations bill.\n  This is a commonsense, bipartisan amendment that will address two \nproblems the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations identified in \nseparate hearings. First is the issue of Federal contractors who \ncontinue to get new contracts even though they owe millions of dollars \nin unpaid taxes. And second is the Government's inability to monitor \nthe unnecessary expenditure of millions of dollars by DOD personnel on \nfirst and business class airline tickets.\n  I am pleased to be joined by my good friends and colleagues, Senator \nLevin, the ranking Democrat on the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, Senator Wyden, Senator Akaka and Senator Coburn.\n  If my colleagues are concerned about the deficit, concerned about \nsaving the taxpayer money, then our amendment should be an easy one to \nsupport. Who doesn't support making certain that those who do business, \nwith the Government pay the taxes they admittedly owe? And who doesn't \nthink that Government employees like those at DOD should fly coach \nrather than first or business class? This is common sense.\n  Let me get into the specifics.\n  On June 16, 2005, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which \nI chair, learned there are problems that prevent the Government from \ncollecting unpaid taxes from Federal contractors. Even more troubling \nis the fact that these contractors who have not paid their taxes \ncontinue to receive new contracts from the Government.\n  When the Government pays a Federal contractor, it has the option of \npaying directly from the Treasury or by using a credit card. Last year, \nthe Government paid $10 billion to Federal contractors using credit \ncards. One of the problems we identified is that the Financial \nManagement Service, which is responsible for collecting unpaid taxes \nfrom Federal contractors, cannot collect these owed taxes unless the \ncontractor is paid directly from the Treasury. When the Government \nmakes purchases with a credit card, the bank that issued the card acts \nas a middle man between the Treasury and the contractor. Thus, the \ncontractor is only known to the bank. For the Government to collect \nunpaid taxes, we need to know which contractors are being paid.\n\n  For example, a NASA contractor who owes nearly $200,000 in unpaid \ntaxes was paid $570,000 last year. Because they were paid directly from \nthe Treasury, this contractor had $6,600 withheld from their contract \npayments to reduce their tax debt. This same contractor also received \nan additional $30,000 but the Government was unable to withhold money \nfrom this payment for tax debt because the contractor was paid with a \ncredit card.\n  To fix this problem, the first section of my amendment would require \nthe Government to develop procedures for collecting unpaid taxes when \ncredit cards are used to pay Federal contractors. Again, this is not \nrocket science. This is commonsense, smart government that I think our \nconstituents just expect from us.\n  At a second hearing on November 6, 2003, the subcommittee heard \ntestimony that the Department of Defense had spent $123.8 million on \nfirst and business class travel in 2001 and 2002 and that 73 percent of \nthis travel was not properly authorized or justified. This resulted in \na loss of millions of dollars. The Office of Management and Budget \nrequires all Federal agencies to annually report their first class \ntravel to the General Services Administration in order to monitor \ntravel for potential abuse. However, $120.9 million of the $123.8 \nmillion that DOD spent was for business class travel. For example, one \nDOD traveler spent $9,500 on a business class ticket which could have \nbeen purchased for $2,500 in coach class. Because this traveler used \nbusiness class it would not have been reported. Given that the \npreponderance of DOD's abusive travel was business class, the abuse at \nDOD could not have been identified from DOD's annual travel report. The \nsecond section of my amendment corrects this for all Federal agencies \nby requiring the annual travel report to include both first and \nbusiness class airline travel and further requires that the report be \nfurnished to the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nand the House Government Reform Committee so we can more closely \nmonitor Federal travel for potential abuse.\n  So, we have an opportunity to do some smart savings to reduce the \ndeficit and that is simply to make sure that contractors doing business \nwith Uncle Sam pay the taxes they owe, and that DOD personnel travel \ncoach when it is on the Government's dime rather than high on the hog \nas has been the case.\n  I appreciate the strong bipartisan support we have for this \namendment, and particularly for the good work of Senators Levin, Wyden, \nAkaka, and Coburn.\n  I hope this commonsense, good Government amendment that will help \nreduce our deficit can be adopted by the Senate as part of the \nTransportation, Treasury Appropriations Bill.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from Minnesota is correct. This is an important \nissue and I am committed on addressing with Senator Coleman on the \nTransportation-Treasury appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006, and I \nlook forwarding to working with Senator Coleman in ensuring that this \nis done.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I am happy to work with Senator Bond on these issues \nwith, a goal of including these reforms on the Transportation, Treasury \nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 2006, I will not offer the \namendment I filed and intended to offer to the Homeland Security \nAppropriations bill. I thank Senator Bond for his strong leadership on \nthe Appropriations Committee and his support of this important \namendment.\n\n[[Page S8284]]\n\n                     explosive detection equipment\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee, the Senators from New Hampshire and West \nVirginia, respectively.\n  It is my understanding the Senate Homeland Security; Appropriations \nReport includes language designating $50 million for ``Next \nGeneration'' Explosive Detection Equipment, EDS, that ``have been \ntested, certified and are being piloted.''\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I wholeheartedly support the need to encourage new \ntechnologies. However, I think it is important we further clarify the \npurpose of this funding stream.\n  I ask the Chairman ``Is it true the Transportation Security \nAdministration, TSA, the agency responsible for issuing Letters of \nIntent, LOIs, that provides the funding to airports for the \ninstallation of EDS equipment, has only made less than a dozen LOIs \navailable to the major airports? And is it not also correct smaller and \nmedium hub airports have not received any of the LOIs issued to date?''\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Connecticut is right. All the LOIs issued \nto date have gone to the larger hub airports.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as I understand it, the Senator from \nConnecticut is concerned the Committee report language could be \ninterpreted to limit the $50 million, which is almost a full third of \nthe funding for EDS procurement, to only technologies currently being \npiloted.\n  Mr. GREGG. The committee has set aside the funding to encourage new \ntechnologies in the area of explosives detection systems and is not \nnecessarily limited to one or two companies. TSA has assured the \ncommittee this language does not restrict them only to technologies \nalready being piloted, and that additional technologies which may \nbecome certified and piloted in Fiscal Year 2006 would also be eligible \nfor this funding for next-generation technologies.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Therefore, is my understanding correct that the \nobjective of this set aside was to aid in the development and \ndeployment of next generation explosive detection equipment?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Connecticut is correct.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I further hope the procurement and deployment of EDS \nmachines will be based on acquiring the best technology for the \nparticular airport in question.\n  Mr. BYRD. One of the lessons we learned from 9/11 was the aviation \ntransportation system is only as strong as its weakest link. We know \nterrorists boarded planes at smaller, mid-sized airports, as well as \nlarger airports. It is important the Department encourage development \nof technologies that can be used at different airports, and that are \nbeing made more effective and efficient.\n  Mr GREGG. I think this is everyone's objective.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I applaud the leadership of both the Senator from New \nHampshire and the Senator from West Virginia in helping to ensure TSA \nhas the necessary funding to meet the critical missions of the agency \nand I appreciate their hard work on this issue.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his interest in \nthis matter.\n  Mr. GREGG. I also thank the Senator from Connecticut for his remarks \nand I look forward to working with him in the future on these issues.\n\n\n                          illegal immigration\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the gentleman from New Hampshire yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Utah for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. HATCH. As the chairman knows, one of the greatest roles entrusted \nto the hardworking employees of the Department of Homeland Security is \nto protect our Nation's borders and curb the growing tide of illegal \nimmigration in this country. I thank my friend and colleague from New \nHampshire for doing his best to address this great need with increased \nfunding for, and greater attention to, this problem. As I travel around \nthe State of Utah, there is not a single place I go where I do not have \ncitizens come up to me and ask me to do something about the illegal \nimmigration problems in their area. They are upset that our country \ncontinues to be unable to enforce our immigration laws and I do not \nblame them. I feel the same frustration.\n  For example, Mayor Toni Turk of Blanding recently informed me that \nhis police department has made several arrests of illegal aliens and \nseized nearly 7 kilos of cocaine in the process. It would seem drug \nsmugglers--most of whom are in the country illegally--are taking \nadvantage of the de minimis level of immigration enforcement in remote \nareas of southeastern Utah. Incidents such as this one formed the basis \nof my request for the creation of an ICE/CBP office in Blanding, UT and \nI am grateful to the chairman for addressing my request in his \ncommittee report.\n  I have heard it said many times that the objective of illegal \nimmigrants coming through the southern border of the country is to get \nas far north as possible as fast as he or she can. This comes from the \neither perceived or real concern that immigration enforcement is much \ntougher in the southern portion of the U.S. than it is in the northern \nportion. For a State located directly above some of the most porous \nborders in the country, this is a real concern. U.S. Interstate 70 and \nU.S. Interstate 15 in Utah have become large conduits for the smuggling \nof illegal immigrants and illegal substances as these foreigners flee \nfrom the southern states as fast as possible in order to get north \nwhere they believe enforcement is less stringent.\n  With two major arteries for illegal immigration running through the \nsouthern portion of Utah, citizens in that beautiful area have grown \ntired of the strain and difficulties presented by the flood of illegal \nimmigrants.\n  Is the distinguished Senator aware of the significant immigration-\nrelated problems facing Utah, especially in the southern portion of the \nstate including St. George and Blanding, UT.\n  Mr. GREGG. I assure you, I understand problems such as those being \nfaced by the citizens of southern Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chairman for recognizing what so many people \ndo not; namely, that immigration problems are not limited to the border \nStates.\n  One of the greatest concerns we Utahns have with the immigration \nenforcement in our State is the fact that the field office director \noverseeing Utah is located in San Francisco, CA. I hope my colleague \nwill agree with me that having the oversight for a major illegal \nimmigration artery located over 650 miles away from the area is \ndisconcerting.\n  The immigration problems facing San Francisco are very different from \nthe problems facing St. George, Blanding, Richfield, Cedar City, Provo, \nand Salt Lake and that is precisely why I would like to see a new field \nofficer director located in Utah. It is my hope that the chairman will \nwork with me to remedy these issues.\n  GREGG. I thank the Senator for his comments. I am pleased to say that \nwe have included significant increases in immigration funding in this \nbill. It is my desire to see those funds spent in the most crucial \nareas of concern to this Nation and I believe they will help us make \nsignificant progress in the fight against illegal immigration.\n  While the issue of establishing new field office directors is \nproperly that of the Secretary of Homeland Security, I will work with \nmy colleague from Utah to address the issues troubling his State as I \nhave done with all of my colleagues. I recognize that Utah faces \ncertain unique challenges and I am confident they can be addressed.\n  I thank my colleague from Utah for his support in our efforts to \nsecure the homeland, and I appreciate his bringing the problems facing \nsouthern Utah to the attention of the Senate.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern over \ncomments made by the Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff. \nAs several of my colleagues have already noted, Secretary Chertoff \ntoday made some very unfortunate comments about who is responsible for \nthe safety of the tens of millions of people who use our mass transit \nsystems every day. Secretary Chertoff said, and I quote, ``The truth of \nthe matter is, a fully loaded airplane with jet fuel, a\n\n[[Page S8285]]\n\ncommercial airliner, has the capacity to kill 3,000 people. A bomb in a \nsubway car may kill 30 people. When you start to think about your \npriorities, you're going to think about making sure you don't have a \ncatastrophic thing first.'' He further added that he believes that \nStates and localities should bear primary responsibility in ensuring \nthe safety of their mass transit systems.\n  The millions of New Yorkers who use the subways, buses, and ferries \neach day would be shocked and angered to hear that their Secretary of \nHomeland Security, Secretary Michael Chertoff, has declared that local \ngovernments are left to fend for themselves when it comes to paying for \nimproved subway, train, and bus security.\n  The reality is that Americans should not be forced to choose between \na safe airplane trip or a safe subway ride. They should both be \npriorities. Unfortunately, this administration has presented us with a \nfalse choice they would like us to believe that resources are so scarce \nthat we can't afford to fully protect all of our transportation \nsystems. For the last few days, my colleagues and I have been on the \nSenate floor, forced to debate whether we should fund rail safety or \nbus safety, secure our borders or fund more airline screeners. This \ndebate is necessary because this administration has made the judgment \nthat cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans is more important than \nfully meeting our Nation's security needs. This administration's \npriorities are clear: $1.5 trillion in tax cuts and only $30 billion \nfor homeland security.\n  So while I am outraged by Secretary Chertoff's comments belittling \nthe threats posed to our subways and buses, I am not surprised. He is \nsimply giving voice to this administration's misguided and indefensible \npriorities. If the London bombings didn't serve as a wakeup call to \nthis administration that they need to reevaluate their priorities, I am \nhard pressed to understand what will make them understand the gravity \nof the threat millions and millions of Americans face every single day \nwhen they step onto a bus or a subway or a ferry to go about their \ndaily lives.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before discussing the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill, I would like to take a moment to express my \ndeepest condolences to our British friends as they deal with the \naftermath of the terrorist bombings in London. Once again the world has \nseen the stark contrast between brutal terrorism, with its lust for \nviolence, and liberal democracy, with its love for freedom. The British \npeople knew, after September 11, 2001, that there could be no \naccommodation with this brand of fanaticism, and under the visionary \nleadership of Prime Minister Tony Blair, Britain stood with America in \nour time of need. Now, in Britain's time of need, we stand with our \nbrothers and sisters across the Atlantic. Our bond, always strong, is \neven firmer.\n  I believe I can speak for many Americans when I say that I felt the \nattack in London as if it were an attack on the United States; the hurt \nof our British friends is like that of our own countrymen. The \nrelationship between American and the United Kingdom is unlike any \nother, and the world is better off for it. At this tragic time, all \npeople in that great country must know that America is with them, as \nallies, as friends, as brothers and sisters. They are not alone, for \nthey must know that they remain in our hearts, in our minds, and in our \nprayers, as we have experienced a similar sense of loss and pain on \nSeptember 11, 2001. Together we will not allow terrorists to destroy \nthe way of life that our two great nations have endeavored over \ncenturies to build.\n  The four bombings in London have now lead many of us to take a second \nlook at the Homeland Security appropriations bill to ensure that we are \nadequately securing our Nation's rail and transit systems. In addition \nto appropriating funds, however, we must also act on authorizing \nmeasures to promote the security of our nation's transportation system. \nEarlier this week, I introduced the Rail Security Act of 2005, which is \nnearly identical to legislation passed unanimously by the Senate last \nyear. I hope that the bombings in Madrid and London will spur this \nCongress to take needed action and pass this important authorizing \nlegislation.\n  I commend the chairman and subcommittee chairman, and the ranking \nmembers, on their efforts to produce a funding measure that best meets \nour Nation's security objectives. For the third consecutive year, the \ncommittee has reported out a Homeland Security bill with minimal \nearmarks. As evidenced by the recent bombings in London, this bill is \ntoo important to the security of the American people to be bogged down \nwith unreasonable earmarks and no essential policy changes and \ndirectives.\n  The Department of Homeland Security plays a crucial role in our \nNation's defense, particularly during these uncertain times as our \ncountry continues to be engaged in fighting a war against terror. We \nmust be vigilant in ensuring that the Department has the right tools to \nprotect our Nation's air space, borders, ports of entry, and travel \ninfrastructure. We also must ensure that our first responders are \nadequately funded to protect citizens in the event of a national \nemergency. At the same time, resources are limited and this bill \nrecognizes that and seeks to ensure that the Department optimizes all \nreceived funds.\n  The Department of Homeland Security's most vital function is \nprotecting our Nation's borders. The committee's bill does provide for \nan increased focus on border security efforts and I commend them for \ntheir attention to these critical funding needs. However, more remains \nto be done. While I strongly believe this bill needs to provide for the \nlevel of border patrol agents and detention beds as we authorized in \nthe Intelligence Reform Act just 7 months ago, our amendments on these \ncritical needs were unsuccessful.\n  Another area of concern is the committee's decision to not fund the \nPresident's request for accelerated deployment of the United States \nVisitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology, US VISIT, Program, \nwhich was a key recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. Although US \nVISIT has much room for improvement, funding to expedite the full \nimplementation of the program will be essential to our ability to \nadequately monitor the flow of individuals into and out of our country. \nI hope that this issue will be carefully reconsidered as this measure \ncontinues through the legislative process.\n  As encouraged as I am to see additional resources directed to the \nborder, enforcement alone will never fully secure our border. Over the \nlast 12 years, the Federal Government has tripled spending on \ntechnology and infrastructure to secure the border and tripled the \nnumber of border patrol personnel. Yet during that same time, illegal \nimmigration is estimated to have doubled. The lesson here is important: \nas long as there is a need for workers in this country that goes unmet \nby the domestic workforce, and as long as there are workers in other \ncountries willing to risk their lives for the opportunity to take those \njobs, they will find a way in.\n  The simple fact is this: our Nation's borders are extremely porous. \nFor the last several years the volatile conditions at our Nation's \nsouthwestern border have grown unsustainable. The cost of our broken \nimmigration system is increasingly borne by local communities and State \ngovernments through uncompensated health care, unreimbursed law \nenforcement costs, environmental degradation, and an increased sense of \nlawlessness. As these conditions have worsened, several Members of this \nbody, including myself, have put forth proposals to reform our Nation's \nimmigration laws and improve security along the border and in the \ninterior. Immigration reform is one of the most critical issues facing \nour Nation today, and I hope the Senate will soon turn to this issue. \nFunding for additional manpower and technology improvements must \ncontinue, but our borders will never be fully secure without \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  I support provisions in the bill and accompanying report which \nencourage the Department, specifically the Transportation Security \nAdministration, TSA, and ICE, to invest in improved technology. The \nreport finds that the Department, ``should not be operating on \nstovepipped, disconnected, inherited information technology systems,'' \nbut rather the Department should be equipped with the best technology \nsystems available in order to reduce reliance on personnel and improve \nsecurity. In particular, I am encouraged to\n\n[[Page S8286]]\n\nsee funding for the deployment of new equipment and technology to the \nborder, including to Arizona, which in recent years has become a \nleading gateway for illegal immigration.\n  Additionally, I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee has \nencouraged the TSA to consistently implement a risk management approach \nto decisionmaking to prioritize security improvements as recommended by \nthe General Accountability Office earlier this year. The GAO report \nstated that ``TSA has not consistently implemented a risk management \napproach or conducted the systematic analysis needed to inform its \ndecision-making processes and to prioritize security improvements . . . \na risk management approach can help inform decision makers in \nallocating finite resources to the areas of greatest need.''\n  Although I find a great deal to support in this bill, I would be \nremiss if I did not point out the serious unrequested spending and the \nfew earmarks contained in this bill and the report. There is over $2 \nbillion in unauthorized and unrequested spending in the bill and the \nreport. Examples include: $47 million above the President's request for \nthe acquisition and maintenance of facilities for the Federal law \nenforcement and training centers; $68 million for two maritime patrol \naircraft under the Coast Guard's integrated deepwater system; $65 \nmillion to fund the Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Act; and $59 \nmillion for critical infrastructure outreach and partnerships. Since \nsuch spending was not requested or isn't authorized, I have no way of \nknowing if such expenditures are needed. Needless expenditures are \nunacceptable, particularly while our country is running a deficit of \n$368 billion this year and a 10-year projected deficit of $1.35 \ntrillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. When are we \ngoing to tighten the belt? While I concede that it is very difficult to \nreduce spending while attempting to protect the Nation's homeland, I \ncan only hope that Congress's belt tightens elsewhere.\n  Examples of earmarks and directive language include: language \nlimiting overtime pay to $35,000 for Customs and Border Patrol and \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement employees, $55 million for the \ncompletion of the Tucson tactical infrastructure around the border and \n$15 million for the Coast Guard's bridge alteration program. Although \nmany of these are important programs and worthy of funding, they were \nnot specifically authorized by Congress and not requested by the \nPresident, and they should be.\n  Lastly, I am also disappointed that the bill once again this year \ncontains a Departmentwide ``Buy America'' requirement, and specific \nlanguage directing the Secret Service to purchase American-made \nmotorcycles. I firmly object to all ``Buy America'' restrictions, as \nthey represent gross examples of protectionist trade policy. From a \nphilosophical point of view, I oppose such policies because free trade \nis an important element in improving relations among all nations, which \nthen improves the security of our Nation. Furthermore, as a fiscal \nconservative, I want to ensure our Government gets the best deal for \ntaxpayers and with a ``Buy American'' restriction that cannot be \nguaranteed. Such provisions cost the Department of Defense over $5.5 \nbillion each year and I am fearful that we will see the same \nunnecessary expense arise at the Department of Homeland Security, a new \nagency.\n  Once again, I thank the appropriators for their diligence in passing \na relatively clean Homeland Security appropriations bill devoid of \nnumerous earmarks. While much work remains to be done to secure our \nhomeland, including comprehensive immigration reform and further action \non 9/11 Commission recommendations, specifically more spectrum for \nfirst responders, we can take another important step by passing this \nlegislation and providing the Department with adequate resources to \nprotect our Nation's air space, borders, ports of entry, and travel \ninfrastructure.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1161\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last evening, an amendment proposed by \nSenator Reid, which calls on the Secretary of Defense to stop delaying \nthe report required to be submitted to Congress on the progress being \nmade to train the Iraqi security forces, was approved unanimously by \nthe Senate. I was pleased to cosponsor the amendment, along with \nSenators Durbin and Biden.\n  The report was required in the recent Iraq Supplemental \nAppropriations Act, Public Law 109-13, which became law on May 11. The \nfirst report was to have been provided by July 11. Additional reports \nare due every 90 days after that until the end of fiscal year 2006.\n  This is not a bureaucratic dispute. The information requested in the \nreport goes to the heart of our ability to succeed in Iraq. It is vital \nto identifying when the Iraqi forces will be able to assume \nresponsibility for security. It is essential to estimating of the level \nof U.S.troops that will be necessary in Iraq in the future.\n  Twice in the last month, President Bush has assured us that training \nIraqi security forces is central to our strategy for success.\n  On June 28, President Bush said:\n\n       Our strategy can be summed up this way: As the Iraqis stand \n     up, we will stand down.\n\n  On July 11, President Bush again said:\n\n       Our plan can be summed up this way: As the Iraqis stand up, \n     we will stand down.\n\n  Unfortunately, the administration has not been willing to give the \nAmerican people a straight answer about the number of Iraqi security \nforces, who are adequately trained and equipped. We are obviously \nmaking some progress, but it is far from clear how much. The American \npeople deserve an honest assessment that provides the basic facts.\n  But that is not what we are being given. According to a GAO report in \nMarch, ``U.S. government agencies do not report reliable data on the \nextent to which Iraqi security forces are trained and equipped.''\n  The report goes on to say:\n\n       The Departments of State and Defense no longer report on \n     the extent to which Iraqi security forces are equipped with \n     their required weapons, vehicles, communications, equipment, \n     and body armor.\n\n  It is clear from the administration's own statements that they are \nusing the notorious ``fuzzy math'' tactic to avoid an honest appraisal.\n  In February 2004, Secretary Rumsfeld said:\n\n       We have accelerated the training of Iraqi security forces, \n     now more than 200,000 strong.\n\n  In January 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said:\n\n       We think the number right now is somewhere over 120,000.\n\n  Yet, on February 3, 2005, in response to questions from Senator Levin \nat a Senate Armed Services Committee GEJJ Hearing, GEN Richard Myers, \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, conceded that only 40,000 Iraqi \nsecurity forces are actually capable. He said:\n\n       Forty-eight deployable (battalions) around the country, \n     equals about 40,000, which is the number that can go anywhere \n     and do anything.\n\n  Obviously, we need a better accounting of how much progress is being \nmade to train and equip effective and capable Iraqi security forces.\n  The American people want to know. Our men and women in uniform want \nto know.\n  Congress has been seeking information on this issue for a long time.\n  Section 1204 of last year's Defense Authorization Act, Public Law \n108-375, required the President to submit an unclassified report on a \nstabilization strategy for Iraq and an effective plan to train the \nIraqi security forces. The report was due 120 days after enactment. The \nlaw was enacted on October 28, 2004, and the report should have been \nprovided by the end of February.\n  We have still not received it from the White House. The \nadministration has been AWOL on the report.\n  Given the high priority the President has placed on the training of \nIraqi security forces, it is unconscionable that the administration has \nfailed to give the American people a straight answer about how many \nIraqi security forces are adequately trained and equipped and able to \ndefend Iraq's security on their own. It is time to put facts behind our \npolicy.\n  President Bush has not leveled with our troops and the American \npeople and offered an effective strategy for success.\n  He has spoken about the importance of training Iraqi security forces, \nbut he has failed to outline a clear strategy to\n\n[[Page S8287]]\n\nachieve their training and improve their capability.\n  The American people and our soldiers deserve to know what progress is \nbeing made in training Iraqis to protect their own security.\n  We all hope for the best in Iraq. We all want democracy to take root \nfirmly and irrevocably. We need to train the Iraqis for the stability \nof Iraq. But we also need to train them because our current level of \ndeployment is not sustainable. Our military has been stretched to the \nbreaking point. Threats in other parts of the world are ever present. \nOur men and women in uniform and the American people deserve this \nreport, because they deserve to know when the President has a strategy \nfor success.\n  The President says our troops in Iraq will stand down as Iraqi \nsecurity forces stand up, but the administration has failed to provide \na realistic assessment of the progress being made in training the Iraqi \nforces.\n  The American people deserve to know when the Iraqis will be able to \ntake over responsibility for their own security, and what impact it \nwill have on our military presence in Iraq.\n  It is time for the stonewalling to end and for accountability to \nbegin.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the pending \nappropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security and my \ngrave concern that it does not provide the tools we need to meet the \nthreat of terrorism. This is not to criticize the appropriators who, as \nalways, have done a thoughtful job in sorting through the many \ncompeting needs of the Department. But I feel strongly that neither the \nPresident nor the congressional leadership was willing to allocate \nsufficient funds for homeland security at the outset of this process \nand that, as a consequence, this bill comes up short on too many \ncritical homeland programs.\n  I speak with a sense of caution in the wake of last week's terrorist \nattacks on London. I agree with Secretary Chertoff's statement that we \ncan't base our national homeland defense policies on a single attack \nespecially since the specifics of the London attack are not known.\n  Yet experts in and out of government keep warning us that nearly 4 \nyears after 9/11 we are still vulnerable and will remain vulnerable \nunless we begin to seriously and strategically start investing in our \nown security.\n  CIA Director Porter Goss this year told the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee that ``it may only be a matter of time'' before terrorists \ntry to attack the United States with weapons of mass destruction.\n  At the same hearing, FBI Director Robert Mueller also warned of \npossible terrorist operations within the United States, and called \nfinding such terrorists ``one of the most difficult challenges'' his \norganization faces.\n  Experts have identified billions of dollars in urgent homeland \nsecurity needs, ranging from communications equipment for first \nresponders, to transportation security, to securing our borders.\n  Yet this year, the President proposed only modest increases for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. And even those proposed increases were \nillusory based on a controversial proposed airline ticket fee that \ncongressional budget leaders and appropriators have rejected.\n  In letters to the Appropriations and Budget Committees earlier this \nyear, I identified about $8.4 billion in critical homeland security \nneeds above and beyond the President's proposed budget, with more than \n$6 billion of that for programs within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Yet the House and Senate Appropriations Committees have both \napproved bills that actually provide even less for DHS programs than \nthe President proposed.\n  It may be tempting to think we do not need to make these investments \nbecause we have already increased spending on homeland security since\n9/11, and because we face difficult budget constraints. But when we \nfocus on the new threat confronting us, it becomes clear that these \ninvestments are an urgent necessity.\n  Let me highlight some of the most serious shortfalls, starting with \ntransportation and mass transit.\n  We know from last week's attack on London and last year's attacks in \nMoscow and Madrid that transit and rail systems are appealing targets \nfor terrorists. And we also know we have far to go in making this \ncountry's transit and rail systems as secure as they should be. Experts \nhave identified billions in unmet security needs for this array of \ncritical assets.\n  For mass transit alone, the American Public Transportation \nAssociation has identified more than $6 billion in security needs, and \na committee-approved Senate bill last Congress would have authorized \n$5.2 billion for transit security over 3 years.\n  These funds are needed to conduct security assessments, install \nsensors and other surveillance equipment, and train transit employees \nto cope with a terror attack.\n  In the area of rail security, the Senate last session passed \nlegislation authorizing $1.2 billion in Federal spending over 4 years, \nnearly half of it in the first year, for measures such as upgrading \naging rail tunnels and other security measures, and increased R to \nreduce the vulnerability of passenger and freight trains.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has shown little interest in \nfunding rail or transit security measures and our systems remain \ndangerously exposed.\n  Last year, Congress provided $150 million for rail and transit \ngrants--and only because lawmakers pushed for this dedicated funding. \nThis year, the President proposed no dedicated funding for rail and \ntransit--just an unspecified share of an overall infrastructure \nprotection grant fund--and the Senate Appropriations bill proposes only \n$100 million. We simply cannot make the progress we need at this rate. \nRather, a dramatic new infusion is needed to harden these potential \ntargets for terrorist mayhem.\n  But mass transit and transportation security is just one example of \nthe critical security needs that not receiving the investments they \nneed to make the American homeland more secure.\n  Under this legislation, terrorism preparedness funding for first \nresponders would drop for the second straight year.\n  In June 2003, a nonpartisan, independent task force sponsored by the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations and chaired by our former colleague \nSenator Warren Rudman, issued a report entitled ``Emergency Responders: \nDrastically Underfunded, Dangerously Unprepared.''\n  The report listed a number of urgent needs left unmet due to a lack \nof funding--including obtaining interoperable communications equipment, \nenhancing urban search and rescue capabilities, and providing \nprotective gear and weapons of mass destruction remediation.\n  The task force concluded that, at then-current funding levels, our \nNation, over the course of 5 years, would fall nearly $100 billion \nshort of meeting the needs of our first responders.\n  Incredibly, though, the administration's response to this sobering \nanalysis has been to cut funding for first responders--2 years running.\n  Even taking into account proposed increases in two grant programs, \nthe administration's proposed budget would slash overall DHS grants to \nfirst responders by $565 million.\n  To my dismay, the Senate's DHS funding bill goes even further and \ncuts $587 million below last year's appropriation. This marks the \nsecond year these programs have been decreased, following a massive 32-\npercent reduction in the core homeland security grant programs in \nfiscal year 2005.\n  None of these proposed cuts make sense given our pressing homeland \nsecurity needs and the Senate voted 63 to 37 on a bipartisan basis for \na Collins-Lieberman amendment to the budget resolution to restore the \nadministration's proposed cuts to first responder programs at DHS.\n  Unfortunately, that consensus was not reflected in the final budget \nresolution, nor in the pending appropriations bill does not reflect \nthat consensus.\n  To hold these programs at current levels is the very least we can and \nshould do.\n  In truth, we need significantly more funds to dramatically improve \nour abilities to prevent and respond to possible terror attacks. We \nespecially need an infusion of new funds to help State and local \ncommunities develop interoperable communications systems that will \nallow officials and first responders to speak to one another during a \ncrisis.\n\n[[Page S8288]]\n\nSenator Collins and I have introduced legislation that would provide \ndedicated funding for interoperability, strengthen Federal leadership \non this issue, fortify outreach and technical assistance to state and \nlocal first responders, promote greater regional cooperation and ensure \nresearch and development to achieve interoperability for first \nresponders. The legislation would authorize $3.3 billion over 5 years \nfor short and long-term interoperability initiatives.\n\n  Another key concern is critical infrastructure protection.\n  Damage to one or more key ports could wreak economic havoc, while the \ntens of thousands of containers streaming through those ports could \nalso serve as conduits for a weapon of mass destruction.\n  We have made important first steps toward securing our ports--\nincluding through the Marine Transportation Security Act--but we know \nthat much more remains to be done.\n  We must also devote more resources and attention to safeguarding \ncritical infrastructure sites such as chemical plants. As security \nexpert Stephen Flynn testified before the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee earlier this year, ``the \n[A]dministration must acknowledge that its assumption that the private \nsector would invest in meaningful security for the 85 percent of the \nnation's critical infrastructure that it owns--and upon which our way \nof life and quality of life depends--has not been borne out.''\n  Even in the area of aviation security, where the government has \ninvested significant resources since 9/11, pressing needs remain.\n  Many have pointed out the glaring weakness regarding air cargo. \nPassengers may be subject to exhaustive searches of their luggage and \npersons, yet air cargo loaded into the belly of the very same plane may \nundergo little or no scrutiny.\n  Following a 9/11 Commission recommendation that steps be taken to \nimprove air cargo security, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act included several provisions to enhance and augment \nexisting programs. It authorized $2 million for the development of a \npilot program to develop blast resistant cargo containers, which could \nbe used on passenger planes to provide an additional layer of security. \nThe bill also authorized an additional $300 million for fiscal year \n2006 for ongoing air cargo security programs and additional air cargo \nresearch and development programs.\n  Yet the President's budget request only included $40 million for air \ncargo security, and the Senate bill raises this amount just $10 \nmillion. Where is the sense of urgency this problem deserves?\n  We also must move more quickly to install efficient and effective \nsystems to screen passenger bags. I am concerned that the Senate bill \nholds funding for the installation of in-line explosives detection \nequipment at this year's level of about $400 million when it is \nestimated that more than $5 billion is needed to install the explosives \ndetection equipment at approximately 60 major airports. The \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act authorized an \nadditional money for this program, and according to investing in the \nup-front costs associated with installing this equipment could not only \nboost security but also provide significant savings to DHS in labor \ncosts.\n  We are also shortchanging the U.S. Coast Guard and its leadership \nrole in homeland defense. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has been asked to \ndramatically increase these security functions even as it continues to \nperform critical nonsecurity roles in areas such as search and rescue \nand fisheries enforcement.\n  Unfortunately, resources have not kept pace with the extraordinary \ndemands being placed upon this service. I am particularly concerned \nabout the deepwater program to modernize the Coast Guard's aged and \nfast deteriorating fleet--which includes cutters commissioned during \nWorld War II and aircraft as much as 30 years old.\n  Although the Senate bill does provide a modest increase for the \ndeepwater program, it is less than the President's budget and will not \nspeed up the modernization program. Indeed, the Coast Guard has \nestimated that $240 million--virtually the entire proposed increase for \nthe program--will be needed in fiscal year 2006 just to maintain its \nlegacy assets. At the current rate, it will take more than 20 years to \nfinish the fleet and systems overhaul--hardly the pace associated with \ntrue ``modernization.''\n  Accelerating the deepwater project is not only good for our security, \nit makes good financial sense. Last year, a RAND report concluded that \naccelerating the deepwater program to 10 years would provide the Coast \nGuard with almost one million additional mission hours which could be \nused for homeland security, saving the Federal Government approximately \n$4 billion in the long term.\n  This is hardly an exhaustive list of the unmet homeland security \nneeds, but it should serve to illustrate that we are not doing all that \nwe could or should to meet the homeland threat.\n  At a January 26, 2005 hearing before the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, homeland security expert Flynn stated: \n``Any honest appraisal of the department as it approaches its 2nd \nanniversary would acknowledge that while there have been significant \naccomplishments in some areas, we are a very long ways from where we \nneed to be.'' Flynn describes our predicament well in his recent book, \nAmerica the Vulnerable:\n  ``Homeland security has entered our post-9/11 lexicon, but homeland \ninsecurity remains the abiding reality. With the exception of airports, \nmuch of what is critical to our way of life remains unprotected . . . \nFrom water and food supplies, refineries, energy grids and pipelines; \nbridges, tunnels, trains, trucks and cargo containers; to the cyber \nbackbone that underpins the information age in which we live, the \nmeasures we have been cobbling together are hardly fit to deter amateur \nthieves, vandals and hackers, never mind determined terrorists. Worse \nstill, small improvements are often oversold as giant steps forward, \nlowering the guard of average citizens as they carry on their daily \nroutine with an unwarranted sense of confidence.''\n  Flynn also rightly points out that homeland security spending is \nstill minuscule in comparison to the overall Pentagon budget, revealing \nthe extent to which our government continues to perceive that the \ncountry's primary threats will be found only outside our borders. We \nmust remember how exposed we rightly felt on September 11, 2001, and \nlisten to the security experts who tell us that this threat is one we \nmust live with--and prepare for--for the indefinite future.\n  I hope we can step back and take stock of what we are doing with \nrespect to homeland security. Experts have warned that, in the absence \nof new attacks, there is a danger of complacency.\n  I fear we are losing the urgency and determination we shared \nimmediately after the 9/11 attacks, to do whatever we could to thwart \nanother such assault. The threat is still there--and so must be our \ncommitment to meet it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will support final passage of the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill today not only because it \nprovides funding for many programs that I support, but also because it \ncontains many provisions that I worked to have included.\n  I am pleased that the Senate overwhelmingly supported, by a vote of \n71 to 26, an amendment that I cosponsored with Senators Collins and \nLieberman that provides a fairer approach to allocating homeland \nsecurity grants than was provided in the current law and which the \nunderlying bill would have continued. For the past 3 years, the State \nhomeland security grant program has distributed funds using a funding \nformula that arbitrarily sets aside a large portion of the funds to be \ndivided equally among the States, regardless of size or need. This \n``small state formula'' severely disadvantages states with high \npopulations. Many Federal grant programs provide a minimum State \nfunding level. But the state minimum formula used to allocate state \nhomeland security funds is unusually high as was the base funding level \nin the underlying homeland security appropriations bill prior to the \nadoption of our amendment--.75 percent.\n  This amendment would reduce that guarantee to .55 percent of the \ntotal amount appropriated for the threat-based homeland security grant \nprogram and added an option for the larger States of selecting a \nminimum\n\n[[Page S8289]]\n\namount based on a State's relative population and population density. \nThis option for the States will provide additional guaranteed funds to \nthe largest and most densely populated States, which also are probably \nthe most at risk of an attack. For instance, Michigan would receive \n$17.55 million in guaranteed funding under the Collins/Lieberman \namendment, but only $10.86 million in guaranteed funding in the \nunderlying appropriations bill.\n  I was pleased to be the author of this option, which was added in the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The remainder of \nthe total funds, approximately 60 percent, would go to the States and \nregions based purely on risk and threat assessment by the Department of \nHomeland Security using factors set forth in the amendment, with up to \nhalf of the remaining funds to be allocated by the Department to \nmetropolitan areas through the Urban Area Security Initiative. The \namendment also provides guidance on the factors to be considered in \nallocating risk-based funding. For example, in prioritizing among State \napplications for risk-based funds, the Secretary of Homeland Security \nwill now consider whether the State is on an international border. The \nunderlying appropriations bill, on the other hand, would have left all \nfunds above the state base to be allocated without guidance, at the \ndiscretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  This legislation also includes language that I offered that will \nassist our first responders by creating demonstration projects at our \nnorthern and southern borders. The amendment provides that the \nSecretary of Homeland Security shall establish at least six \ninternational border community interoperable communications \ndemonstration Projects--no fewer than three of these demonstration \nprojects shall be on the northern border, and no fewer than three of \nthese demonstration projects shall be on the southern border. These \ninteroperable communications demonstrations will address the \ninteroperable communications needs of police officers, firefighters, \nemergency medical technicians, National Guard, and other emergency \nresponse providers at our borders because of the location at those \nborders where there is such a great threat of terrorists entering.\n  Finally, the bill contains language I proposed that requires the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to deny entry of any commercial motor \nvehicle carrying municipal solid waste from Canada until the Secretary \ncertifies that the methods and technology used to inspect the vehicles \nfor potential weapons of mass destruction as well as biological, \nchemical and nuclear materials are as efficient as the methods and \ntechnology used to inspect other commercial vehicles.\n  I do not think that the funding levels provided in this bill go far \nenough to strengthen the programs that fund our domestic preparedness \nand response capabilities, protect our borders and ports and improve \nour transportation security. We cannot expect our first responders to \nbe well-trained, properly equipped, and fully staffed to protect us if \nwe cut their funding sources. I am hopeful that funding levels will be \nincreased in conference.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as chairman of the Budget Committee, I \nregularly comment on appropriations bills that are brought to this \nSenate for consideration and present the financial comparisons and \nbudgetary data. In this instance, I am in the unique position of \ncommenting on my own bill, as I also serve as chairman of the Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Subcommittee. So it will not surprise my \ncolleagues that I note this is a very good bill and that it is in \ncompliance with the 2006 Budget Resolution.\n  The pending Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2006, H.R. 2360, as reported by the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations, provides $31.777 billion in budget authority and \n$33.899 billion in outlays in fiscal year 2006 for the Department of \nHomeland Security and related agencies. Of these totals, $931 million \nin budget authority and $924 million in outlays are for mandatory \nprograms in fiscal year 2006.\n  The bill provides total discretionary budget authority in fiscal year \n2006 of $30.846 billion. This amount is $1.285 billion more than the \nPresident's request, and is equal to the 302(b) allocation adopted by \nthe Senate, and identical to the level in the House-passed bill. The \n2006 budget authority provided in this bill is $1.09 billion less than \nthe fiscal year 2005 enacted level because the 2005 level included a \none-time $2.528 billion appropriation for bioshield. After adjusting \nfor bioshield this bill is $1.438 billion above the 2005 enacted level.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nH.R. 2360, 2006 HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS: SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                          SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                     [Fiscal year 2006, $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          General\n                                          Purpose   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n    Budget authority...................     30,846        931     31,777\n    Outlays............................     32,975        924     33,899\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority...................     30,846        931     31,777\n    Outlays............................     33,233        924     34,157\n2005 Enacted:\n    Budget authority...................  \\1\\ 31,93      1,085     33,021\n                                                 6\n    Outlays............................     29,821        892     30,713\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority...................     29,561        931     30,492\n    Outlays............................     29,404        924     30,328\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority...................     30,846        931     31,777\n    Outlays............................     33,158        924     34,082\n \n   SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority...................          0          0          0\n    Outlays............................       -258          0       -258\n2005 Enacted:\n    Budget authority...................     -1,090       -154     -1,244\n    Outlays............................      3,154         32      3,186\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority...................      1,285          0      1,285\n    Outlays............................      3,571          0      3,571\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority...................          0          0          0\n    Outlays............................       -183          0       -183\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Includes $2.528 billion advance appropriation for Bioshield.\n \nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes out of the \nmajority time, the manager's time, to address a different subject, but \none that is timely given some developments earlier today.\n  On July 3, the Washington Post reported that Democrats signaled that \nwhoever the nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court is, their three likely \nlines of attack will be to assert that the White House did not consult \nsufficiently, to paint the nominee as ideologically extreme, and to \nfinally assert that the Senate has not received sufficient documents \nabout the candidate.\n  I will address the second prong of this three-prong attack. That has \nto do with ideology and the personal views of the nominee, or perhaps \nasking the nominee to predict how they would likely rule on an issue \nwere it to come before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Over the past few days, some Members on the other side of the aisle \nhave stated their intention to ask whomever the President nominates to \nthe Supreme Court a series of questions on where that nominee stands on \ncontroversial political issues. For example, yesterday the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts said he wants to know whether the nominee \nsupports laws related to the environment, civil rights, and abortion. \nThe senior Senator from New York today said he wants to know what the \nnominee thinks about any one of a number of things, including the \nappropriate role of religion in government and how to balance \nenvironmental interests against energy interests. Indeed, the senior \nSenator from New York has said that ``every question is a legitimate \nquestion, period.'' These questions must be answered, they say, because \nthey have a right to know what the nominee's so-called ``judicial \nphilosophy'' is.\n  Let me be clear. Any one of the 100 Senators who has been elected and \nwho serves in this Senate has a right under the First Amendment, if \nnowhere else, to ask any question they want. However, these statements \nof the last few days indicating the scope of questions that some \nSenators intend to ask represents something of a change of heart.\n  During Justice O'Connor's confirmation hearing, for example, the \nSenator from Massachusetts declared:\n\n        . . . [i]t is offensive to suggest that a potential \n     Justice of the Supreme Court must pass some presumed test of \n     judicial philosophy. It is even more offensive to suggest \n     that a potential Justice must pass the litmus test of any \n     single-interest group.\n\n  The Senator's colleagues have always agreed with him on that. And I \nagree with the position he took at that time, but not with the position \nhe is taking more recently.\n  Also during Justice O'Connor's confirmation hearing, the senior \nSenator from Delaware noted:\n\n       [w]e are not attempting to determine whether or not the \n     nominee agrees with all of us on each and every pressing \n     social or legal issue of the day. Indeed, if that were the \n     test, no one would ever pass by this committee, much less the \n     full Senate.\n\n  Similarly, the senior Senator from Vermont declared during the same \nhearing that:\n\n       Republican or Democrat, a conservative or a liberal. That's \n     not the issue. The issue is one of competence and whether she \n     has a sense of fairness.\n\n  The question is, Why the change of heart? I submit that one potential \nanswer is because it has been a long time since the Senate has \nconsidered a Supreme Court nominee and perhaps some need to be reminded \nwhat the role of a judge in a democracy is.\n  As a former judge myself, let me share a few observations with my \ncolleagues. Put simply, judges are not politicians. Judges do not vote \non cases like politicians vote on legislation. Judges do not vote for \nor against environmental laws because their constituents demand it or \nbecause their consciences tell them to. They are supposed to rule on \ncases only in accordance with the law as written by the people's \nrepresentatives. If a judge disagrees with the law as written, then he \nor she is not supposed to substitute his or her views for the people's \nviews. Any other approach is simply inconsistent with democratic \ntheory, with government by the people, and with respect for the rule of \nlaw.\n  It is worth noting that this has not always been the case. The \njudicial system in England during and before the American Revolution \nwas one where judges made the law. This is called our common law system \nor common law heritage. Judges made up the law as they went along, \ntrying to divine the best rules to govern the interaction between \ncitizens. This was a heady power, the common law-making power, to \ndecide what policies best serve mankind.\n  This is not, however, the judicial system created by our Founding \nFathers\n\n[[Page S8291]]\n\nor by the Federal Constitution to govern the Federal courts, including \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The Founding Fathers did not believe it was consistent with democracy \nto allow unelected judges to make laws that govern the people. We know \nthis for three reasons. First, we know this because the Constitution \nsays so. The Constitution quite clearly at the very outset says ``all \nlegislative powers''--the power to make the law--``shall be vested in \n[the] Congress.'' This means no power to make law is vested in our \ncourts, even in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Second, we know this because the Framers told us explicitly this is \nwhat they had envisioned. In Federalist Paper No. 47, for example, \nJames Madison noted:\n\n       [W]ere the power of judging joined with the legislative, \n     the life and liberty of the [people] would be exposed to \n     arbitrary control, for the judge would then be the \n     legislator.\n\n  Finally, we know this because the Supreme Court has also told us so. \nIn 1938, in the famous case of Erie v. Tompkins, the Supreme Court \ndeclared in no uncertain terms that ``[t]here is no federal general \ncommon law.''\n\n  Judges in our Federal system do not make law, or I should say are not \nsupposed to make law. The laws are made for them and indeed for the \nentire Nation by the people's representatives in the form of statutes \nenacted by the Congress and in the form of the Constitution that we the \npeople have ratified to govern our affairs. These are legal texts and \nthey are supposed to tie the hands of judges in our system. Judges in \nour system are not supposed to make up the law as they go along. They \nare simply supposed to apply the laws made by the people to the facts \nat hand.\n  If the law is to change, it is because the people are the ones who \nare supposed to change it, not because judges do. Federal judges, \nagain, have no general common law-making power.\n  Once we remember the role of judges, unelected judges, in our \ndemocracy, it is clear why the questions some members of the body \nintend to propound to the President's nominees are so wrongheaded. So \nlong as we satisfy ourselves that the President's nominee will do what \nthe President has said he wants his nominee to do--which is to not make \nup the law but to simply implement the law as it has already been \nenacted by the people's representatives--there is simply no reason to \ndemand answers from the nominee on particular cases. Indeed, the only \npossible reason a Member would ask these kinds of questions is to try \nto make political hay out of the nominee's personal views.\n  Special interest groups, in order to raise money from donors, are \npressing members of this Senate to do just that. But I sincerely hope \nwe can resist the temptation to turn the impending confirmation \nhearings into a political fundraising opportunity. After all, a \nprecedent for the right way to do things exists in the confirmation of \nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993.\n  Prior to her service on the Federal bench, Justice Ginsburg, a \ndistinguished jurist and liberal favorite, served as the general \ncounsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, an organization that \nhas championed the abolition of traditional marriage laws and \nchallenged the validity of the Pledge of Allegiance for invoking the \nphrase ``One nation under God.''\n  Before becoming a judge, Justice Ginsburg expressed her belief that \ntraditional marriage laws are unconstitutional and that prostitution \nshould be a constitutional right. She had also written that the Boy \nScouts and Girl Scouts are discriminatory institutions and the courts \nmust allow the use of taxpayer funds to pay for abortions--hardly views \nthe American people would consider mainstream.\n  Yet Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats alike did not try to \nexploit her personal views; rather, they overwhelmingly approved her \nnomination.\n  There are other reasons why it is inappropriate to demand answers to \nquestions about particular political issues. The Founding Fathers \nwanted our judges to be independent from the political branches. It \nthreatens the independence of the judiciary to parade nominees in front \nof this body and then to ask them to state their views on whether, for \nexample, this body has the constitutional power to enact certain \nenvironmental and civil rights laws.\n  How a nominee can remain independent if his or her confirmation is \nconditional on whether he or she pledges to uphold legislation from \nthis body is beyond me. A nominee could not remain independent having \nmade such a pledge, so they should not make that pledge nor, I submit, \nshould they be asked to make that pledge.\n  In addition, judges in our system are supposed to be impartial. That \nis why Lady Justice has always been blindfolded. It undermines a \nnominee's ability to remain impartial once he or she becomes a judge if \nhe or she has already taken positions on issues that might come before \nhim or her on the bench. For example, if we force nominees to pledge to \nuphold certain environmental or civil rights laws enacted by this body \nin order to win confirmation, how is a litigant, challenging one of \nthose laws in court, supposed to feel when the nominee sits to hear \nthat case? The litigant would certainly not feel as though he or she is \nreceiving equal and open-minded justice, I can promise you that.\n  It is for this reason the American Bar Association has promulgated a \ncanon of judicial ethics that prohibits a nominee from making \n``pledges, promises or commitments that are inconsistent with the \nimpartial performance of the adjudicative duties of the office.'' It is \nalso why, as Justice Ginsburg has recently noted in an opinion she \nwrote, that, although ``how a prospective nominee for the bench would \nresolve particular contentious issues would certainly be of interest to \nthe . . . Senate in the exercise of [its] confirmation power[,] . . . \nin accord with a longstanding norm, every member of [the Supreme] Court \ndeclined to furnish such information to the Senate.'' In other words, \njust because some Members may ask these questions does not mean the \nPresident's nominee should answer them. In accordance with long \ntradition and norms of the Senate in the confirmation process, they \nshould not answer them.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, let me say that I hope Members \nreconsider their intention to condition the confirmation of the \nPresident's nominees on their adherence to a particular political \nplatform. Judges are not politicians, and we do a disservice to the \njudicial branch and its role in our democracy by trying to treat them \nas such.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time and yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/14/senate-section/article/S8291-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8291-S8292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Navy SEAL Shane Patton\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Boulder City, NV, lies 25 miles east of Las \nVegas, near Lake Mead. The city was constructed in 1931 to serve as a \nhome for the workers who built Hoover Dam. It has seen limited growth \nover the last 70 years and has never lost its smalltown feel.\n  Every summer, Boulder City holds a Fourth of July celebration. Like \nmost communities, it has fireworks, parades, and barbeques. But what \nseparates Boulder City is its people. Folks who left long ago return to \nBoulder City on the Fourth of July to reunite with family and friends, \nand to remember the freedoms that make this country great.\n  This year, one of Boulder City's sons did not come back. Shane \nPatton, a lifelong resident and 2000 graduate of Boulder City High, was \nkilled in action last month defending our freedoms in Afghanistan. He \nwas a Navy SEAL and a hero to us all.\n  I did not know Shane, but I am very familiar with his grandfather Jim \nand his great-uncle Charlie. We were high school rivals some 50 years \nago. They played sports for Boulder City. I played for Basic High. Jim \nand Charlie were athletes, and we competed against each other in \nbaseball and football.\n  At that time, anyone who went to Boulder City was an arch enemy of \nanyone who went to Basic. But eventually we mixed and had friends in \ncommon. Jim even took a roadtrip from Nevada to the Panama Canal and \nanother to Mexico with my friend Don Wilson in the 1970s.\n  Shane's grandfather has a sense of adventure and a commitment to \ncountry. It rubbed off on Shane's dad J.J., who was a SEAL, and \neventually on Shane, who followed in his father's footsteps by joining \nthe Navy and becoming one of our country's elite SEALs.\n\n[[Page S8292]]\n\n  Being a Navy SEAL is one of the most physically and mentally \ndifficult jobs in the world. The SEALs' training is legendary for its \ntoughness. Their missions are dangerous and secret. They work in small \nteams, on the frontlines of war. Only the best of the best can serve as \nSeals, and Shane Patton did it with honor and distinction.\n  In Afghanistan, Shane died during a combat mission. He was buried \nlast Saturday at the Southern Nevada Veterans Cemetery in Boulder City. \nHe now rests among other Nevada heroes--brave men and women who \ndedicated part of their lives to protecting and preserving the freedoms \nwe hold dear. I attended Shane's funeral and extended the appreciation \nof a grateful Nation.\n  A year from now Boulder City will again celebrate the Fourth of July. \nAs is tradition, people from all over will journey back to the city \nthey used to call home. Shane Patton will not be there. But he will \nlive on in the hearts and minds of everyone in Boulder City and in \neveryone who pauses to remember the freedoms we enjoy.\n  Shane's life's work was keeping us safe. His service was his gift to \nus all. And his sacrifice will never be forgotten.\n\n\n                 Lance Corporal Thomas William Fritsch\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to LCpl \nThomas William Fritsch, U.S. Marines, of Cromwell, CT. Lance Corporal \nFritsch lived as a true patriot and defender of our great Nation's \nprinciples of freedom and justice.\n  While serving during the Vietnam War, a group of marines from Battery \nD, including Lance Corporal Fritsch, was assigned to search for \nSergeant Miller and medic Thomas Perry. The search had become necessary \nwhen it was apparent that the medic was missing during the evacuation \nof the base at Ngok Tavak which had come under enemy attack early on \nthe morning of the 10th of May, 1968. It was during the course of this \nsearch when the small group was attacked by enemy fire.\n  Although it has been 37 years since his loss, his repatriation serves \nas a testament to our Nation's commitment to our Prisoners of War, \nthose Missing in Action, and their families. I commend the Department \nof Defense Prisoner of War and Missing Personnel Office for their \nremarkable and tireless efforts during their numerous investigations \nwhich have once again been successful in identifying one of our \nNation's heroes. I can only imagine the range of emotions caused by the \nloss and years of uncertainty experienced by Lance Corporal Fritsch's \nfamily, as well as other families of our servicemen missing in action.\n  In addition to his family, there are many in Connecticut who still \nremember him fondly. As a 1966 graduate of the EC Goodwin Technical-\nVocational School in New Britain, CT, he is remembered as a good \nfriend, a good neighbor, and an active member of the community who \nenjoyed volunteering for the Portland Fire Department and participating \nin the Boy Scouts. Perhaps, Lance Corporal Fritsch will most be \nremembered as an aspiring chef as his former guidance counselor, Jane \nRich, vividly recalls.\n  Lance Corporal Fritsch will soon be laid to rest at Rose Hill \nCemetery in Rocky Hill. Lance Corporal Fritsch lives on through his \nparents, William and Mary, and his siblings, Patricia, Gloria, Bill and \nSteve whom I thank for his patriotic service.\n  Our Nation extends its heartfelt condolences to his family. We extend \nour appreciation for sharing this outstanding marine with us, and hope \nthat they may find peace and closure. They may be justifiably proud of \nhis contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/14/senate-section/article/S8292-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8292-S8293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES IMPORT AND EXPORT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak of the Controlled \nSubstances Export Reform Act of 2005. This bill would make a minor, but \nlong overdue, change to the Controlled Substances Act to reflect the \nreality of commerce in the 21st Century and to protect high-paying \nAmerican jobs, while maintaining strong safeguards on exports.\n  Before I discuss this bill, I want to thank Senator Biden for working \nwith me on this important legislation. Senator Biden has long been \nrecognized as a national leader on drug-related measures, and we have a \nhistory of working together on a bipartisan basis to enact sensible \nreforms in this area, as evidenced by the recent enactment of our \nsteroid precursor bill. I respect his thoughtful collaboration, and I \nthank him for his work on this proposal.\n  I would also like to thank Chairman Specter for his critical work on \nthis legislation. We would not be able to move this important bill \nwithout his efforts. Furthermore, I would like to thank the majority \nleader for moving this legislation during the last Congress. We were \nable to pass the measure last fall, and I hope that we may do so again \nin the near future.\n  This Hatch-Biden bill has been my priority for a number of years. The \nneed for this legislation was first brought to my attention by a number \nof Utah companies, who had experienced significant difficulties in \nexporting their pharmaceutical products.\n  Under current law, there are two differing regulatory schemes \ngoverning export of U.S.-manufactured pharmaceutical products. One \nsystem, adopted by the Congress 10 years ago, governs products \nregulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The other, \nwhich we are today proposing to harmonize with the food and drug law, \ngoverns pharmaceuticals with abuse potential regulated under the \nControlled Substances Act. In sum, our proposed legislation amends the \nControlled Substances Act to allow greater opportunities for U.S. \nmanufacturers to send their products abroad, still retaining full Drug \nEnforcement Administration authority over those exports.\n  At present, U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers are permitted to export \nmost controlled substances only to the immediate country where the \nproducts will be consumed. Shipments to centralized sites for further \ndistribution across national boundaries are prohibited, even though \nthis same system is allowed under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic \nAct for products which are not controlled substances. The current \nsystem for export of controlled substances should be contrasted with \nthe freedom of pharmaceutical manufacturers throughout the rest of the \nworld to readily move approved medical products among and between \ninternational drug control treaty countries without limitation or \nrestriction.\n  The unique prohibitions imposed on domestic manufacturers \ndisadvantage U.S. businesses by requiring smaller, more frequent and \ncostly shipments to each country of use without any demonstrable \nbenefit to public health or safety. By imposing significant logistical \nchallenges and financial burdens on U.S. companies, the law creates a \nstrong incentive for domestic pharmaceutical manufacturers to move \nproduction operations overseas, threatening high-wage American jobs.\n  The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 permits U.S. manufacturers of \nSchedule I and II substances and Schedule III and IV narcotics to \nexport their products from U.S. manufacturing sites only to the \nreceiving country where the drug will be used. The law prohibits export \nof these products if the drugs are to be distributed outside the \ncountry to which they are initially sent. The effect of this \nrestriction is to prevent American businesses from using cost-\neffective, centralized foreign distribution facilities. In addition, \nunder the current regime, unexpected cross-border demands or surges in \npatient needs cannot be met. Likewise, complex and time-sensitive \nexport licensing procedures prevent the shipment of pharmaceuticals on \na real time basis.\n  European drug manufacturers face no such constraints. They are able \nto freely move their exported products from one nation to another while \ncomplying with host country laws. This is entirely consistent with the \nscheme of regulation imposed by international drug control treaties. \nOnly the United States imposes the additional limitation of prohibiting \nthe further transfer of controlled substances. Thus, while a French or \nBritish company can ship its products to a central warehouse in Germany \nfor subsequent distribution across the European Union, an American \ncompany must incur the added costs of shipping its products separately \nto each individual country.\n  S. 1395, the Controlled Substances Export Reform Act, would correct \nthis imbalance and permit the highly-regulated transshipment of \nexported pharmaceuticals placing American businesses on an equal \nfooting with the\n\n[[Page S8293]]\n\nrest of the world. Importantly, however, DEA's authority to control \nU.S. exports would not be diminished.\n  The legislation authorizes the Attorney General, or his designee, the \nDEA, to permit the re-export of Schedule I and II substances and \nSchedule III and IV narcotics to countries that are parties to the \nSingle Convention on Narcotic Drugs and the Convention on Psychotropic \nSubstances under tightly controlled circumstances: First, each country \nis required to have an established system of controls deemed adequate \nby the DEA. Next, only permit or license holders in those countries may \nreceive regulated products. Third, re-exports are limited to one single \ncross-border transfer. Then the DEA must be satisfied by substantial \nevidence that the exported substance will be used to meet an actual \nmedical, scientific or other legitimate need, and that the second \ncountry of receipt will hold or issue appropriate import licenses or \npermits. Fifth, in addition, the exporter must notify the DEA in \nwriting within 30 days of a re-export. And finally, an export permit \nmust have been issued by the DEA.\n  These safeguards are rigorous but fair, and represent a much-needed \nmodernization of the law. The current restrictions on U.S. exports of \ncontrolled substances have remained essentially unchanged for more than \n30 years. In that time, the global economy has changed dramatically. \nFor those among us who express concerns about the outsourcing of \nAmerican jobs and the competitiveness of U.S. companies, this modest \nchange represents an opportunity to address such problems head-on.\n  The Controlled Substance Act's limitation on U.S. pharmaceutical \nexports imposes unique, unnecessary, and significant logistical and \nfinancial burdens on American businesses. The effect of this outdated \npolicy is to create a strong incentive for domestic pharmaceutical \ncompanies to move production overseas, threatening American jobs and \neliminating DEA jurisdiction over the manufacture and shipment of their \nproducts. The Controlled Substances Export Reform Act removes this \nunwarranted barrier to U.S. manufacturers' use of cost-effective \ndistribution techniques while retaining full DEA control of U.S. \nexports and re-exports. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join \nSenator Biden and myself in support of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/14/senate-section/article/S8293-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RULES OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, for the past 6 years, I have worked with my \ncolleagues in Hawaii's congressional delegation to enact legislation to \nextend the Federal policy of self-governance and self-determination to \nNative\n\n[[Page S8294]]\n\nHawaiians. On July 12, 2005, The New York Times published an editorial \npiece that captures the essence of what we have been trying to do for \nthe people of Hawaii.\n  Our bill, S. 147, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act \nof 2005, provides a process for Native Hawaiians to reorganize their \ngoverning entity for the purposes of a federally recognized government-\nto-government relationship with the United States. Following \nrecognition, the bill provides for a negotiations process between the \ngoverning entity and the State and Federal governments to determine how \nthe Native Hawaiian governing entity will exercise its governmental \nauthority. The negotiations process is intended to represent all \ninterested parties through the State, Federal and native governments; \nand provides the structure that has been missing since 1893 for \nHawaii's people to address the longstanding issue resulting from the \noverthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. This bill provides the people of \nHawaii with an opportunity for reconciliation and healing so that we \ncan move forward as a State.\n  Opponents of the legislation have characterized its effect as \ndivisive. The purpose of my bill, however, is to bring unity in the \nState by providing an inclusive process for all of us, Native Hawaiian \nand non-Native Hawaiian, to finally address the consequences of our \npainful history. Lawrence Downes, The New York Times editorial writer \nwho authored the article, captured this in his piece. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the article entitled, ``In Hawaii, A Chance to Heal, Long \nDelayed,'' be printed in today's Record in its entirety.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 12, 2005]\n\n               In Hawaii, a Chance To Heal, Long Delayed\n\n                          (By Lawrence Downes)\n\n       Less than a month after 9/11, with terrorism fears \n     threatening to put jet travel and thus the Hawaiian economy \n     into a death spiral, tourism officials there announced an \n     emergency marketing campaign to promote the State as a place \n     of rest, solace and healing. Anyone who has ever stepped off \n     a plane in Honolulu, trading the brittle staleness of the \n     aircraft cabin for the liquid Hawaiian breeze, warm and heavy \n     with the scent of flowers, knows exactly what they meant.\n       The selling of Hawaii as a land of gracious welcome works \n     so well because it happens to be true. But for the members of \n     one group, that has always evoked a bitter taste: native \n     Hawaiians, the descendants of Polynesian voyagers who settled \n     the islands in antiquity and lived there in isolation until \n     the late 1700's. Ever since Captain Cook, the native Hawaiian \n     story has been a litany of loss: loss of land and of a way of \n     life, of population through sickness and disease, and of \n     self-determination when United States marines toppled the \n     monarchy in 1893.\n       Over decades, the islands emerged as a vibrant multiracial \n     society and the proud 50th State. Hawaiian culture--language \n     and art, religion and music--has undergone a profound rebirth \n     since the 1970's. But underneath this modern history remains \n     a deep sense of dispossession among native Hawaiians, who \n     make up about 20 percent of the population.\n       Into the void has stepped Senator Daniel Akaka, the first \n     native Hawaiian in Congress, who is the lead sponsor of a \n     bill to extend federal recognition to native Hawaiians, \n     giving them the rights of self-government as indigenous \n     people that only American Indians and native Alaskans now \n     enjoy. The Akaka bill has the support of Hawaii's \n     Congressional delegation, the State Legislature and even its \n     Republican governor, Linda Lingle. It will go before the \n     Senate for a vote as soon as next week.\n       The bill would allow native Hawaiians--defined, in part, as \n     anyone with indigenous ancestors living in the islands before \n     the kingdom fell--to elect a governing body that would \n     negotiate with the Federal Government over land and other \n     natural resources and assets. There is a lot of money and \n     property at stake, including nearly two million acres of \n     ``ceded lands,'' once owned by the monarchy; hundreds of \n     thousands of acres set aside long ago for Hawaiian \n     homesteaders; and hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     entitlement programs.\n       Much of what is now the responsibility of two State \n     agencies, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and the Department \n     of Hawaiian Home Lands, would become the purview of the new \n     government.\n       There are many jurisdictional and procedural details to \n     work out, but Mr. Akaka and others insist that the bill \n     precludes radical outcomes.\n       There would be no cash reparations, no new entitlements, no \n     land grabs and especially no Indian-style casinos, which are \n     a hot topic in Hawaii, one of only two states that outlaw all \n     gambling.\n       The bill's critics include those who see it as a race-based \n     scheme to balkanize a racial paradise. On the other flank, \n     radical Hawaiian groups say the bill undercuts their real \n     dream: to take the 50th star off the flag and to create a \n     government that does its negotiating with the State \n     Department, not Interior.\n       Mr. Akaka argues, convincingly, that beyond the bill's \n     practical benefits in streamlining the management of assets \n     and the flow of money, it is a crucial step in a long, slow \n     process of reconciliation. As he sees it, Hawaii's cultural \n     renaissance has exposed the unhealed wound in the native \n     psyche. He has witnessed it in young people, more radical \n     than their elders, as they adopt a tone of uncharacteristic \n     hostility and resentment in sovereignty marches. He has noted \n     a wariness that is at odds with the conciliatory mood struck \n     in 1993, when President Bill Clinton signed a resolution \n     apologizing for the kingdom's overthrow.\n       Mr. Akaka says his bill offers vital encouragement to a \n     group that makes up a disproportionate share of the islands' \n     poor, sick, homeless and imprisoned, while steering a \n     moderate course between extremes of agitation and apathy.\n       The spirit of aloha, of gentle welcome, is the direct \n     legacy of native culture and an incalculable gift the \n     Hawaiian people have made to everyone who has ever traveled \n     there--wobbly-legged sailors and missionaries, dogged \n     immigrants and sun-scorched tourists. The Akaka bill, with \n     its first steps at long-deferred Hawaiian self-determination, \n     seems like an obvious thing to give in return, an overdue \n     measure of simple gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/14/senate-section/article/S8294-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MASSACRE AT SREBRENICA\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the recently \npassed S. Res. 134, a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate \nregarding the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, the largest single \nmass execution in Europe since World War II.\n  In has been 10 years since the war in the Balkans has dominated \ninternational headlines. The September 11, 2001 attacks in the United \nStates and the resulting war on terror have taken center stage and \nrightly dominated our foreign policy. But the 40,000 Bosnians living in \nthe St. Louis area saw the ugly face of terrorism in Srebrenica in July \n1995, when approximately 8,000 Muslim men and boys were massacred, and \nhundreds of women and children were tortured and raped in an area that \nwas supposedly under the protection of the United States. Tens of \nthousands were evicted from their homes and forced to flee their \nhomeland.\n  As a direct result of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, more than 40,000 \nBosnian immigrants now live in the St. Louis area. In fact, it is a \nprivilege for the City of St. Louis to be the home of more Bosnians \nthan anywhere in the world outside Bosnia. Our Bosnian immigrants are \nproductive, peaceful citizens who are making vital contributions to the \nrevitalization of the city and adding ethnic diversity that enriches \nour community.

Mr. President, today I want to address this body in \norder to help raise awareness about an important health problem in our \nsociety. Hearing loss impacts the lives of 28 million men, women, and \nchildren in the United States. As baby boomers reach retirement age, \nthat number will rapidly climb and nearly double by 2030.\n  The combined effects of noise, aging, disease, and heredity have made \nhearing impairments a reality for many Americans. Children with hearing \nloss may lack speech and language development skills. Seniors may find \nit difficult to talk with friends, listen to the\n\n[[Page S8295]]\n\ntelevision, or hear an alarm. For all Americans, recognizing and \ntreating hearing loss can be the difference between dependence and \nindependence.\n  Across the country, awareness campaigns have identified hearing loss \nas a major public-health issue. Last month, Newsweek had a cover story \ndiscussing the impact of hearing loss on young Americans. Experts \nestimate that 21 million people could benefit from a hearing aid, but \ndo not use them or have access to them. I will ask unanimous consent to \ninsert this important news article in the Record, so that all of our \ncolleagues can read and learn more about this issue. In addition to \neducating themselves, I also ask that Members educate their loved ones \nand constituents about this important issue.\n  To ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive direct access to \nservices, I have introduced the Hearing Health Accessibility Act of \n2005, S.277 in February of this year. I would like to take this moment \nto thank all of my colleagues that have cosponsored and supported this \nlegislation. I urge other Senators to consider cosponsoring my \nbipartisan bill which will become increasingly important as baby \nboomers enter retirement.\n  I ask unanimous consent the editorial to which I referred be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, June 6, 2005]\n\n                      A Little Bit Louder, Please\n\n                           (By David Noonan)\n\n       Kathy Peck has some great memories of her days playing bass \n     and singing with The Contractions, an all-female punk band. \n     The San Francisco group developed a loyal following as it \n     played hundreds of shows, and released two singles and an \n     album between 1979 and 1985. Their music was fun, fast and \n     loud. Too loud, as it turned out. After The Contractions \n     opened for Duran Duran in front of thousands of screaming \n     teeny-boppers at the Oakland Coliseum in 1984, Peck's ears \n     were ringing for days. Then her hearing gradually \n     deteriorated. ``It got to the point where I couldn't hear \n     conversations,'' says Peck, now in her 50s. ``People's lips \n     would move and there was no sound. I was totally freaked \n     out.''\n       Peck the punk rocker lived out one of her generation's \n     musical fantasies two decades ago; Peck the hearing-impaired \n     has been living out one of its fears ever since.\n       Over the years she has battled her problem, a combination \n     of noise-induced hearing loss and a congenital condition \n     (diagnosed after the traumatic concert), with a variety of \n     strategies and interventions, including sign language, lip \n     reading, double hearing aids and, eventually, surgery on the \n     tiny bones in her middle ears. Today Peck, who used to cry \n     with frustration at movies because she couldn't hear the \n     dialogue, still has ringing in her ears (tinnitus) and mild \n     hearing loss, but gets by , without help.\n       Aging rockers aren't the only ones struggling with \n     diminished hearing these days. More than 28 million Americans \n     currently have some degree of hearing loss, from mild to \n     severe, and the number is expected to soar in the coming \n     years--reaching an astounding 78 million by 2030. While that \n     looming surge is mostly a baby-boomer phenomenon, the threat \n     of hearing loss--and the need for prevention--isn't limited \n     to a single age group. We are all caught in the constant roar \n     of the 21st century. It's the rare kid today who doesn't have \n     wires snaking out of her ears as she rocks through the day to \n     her own personal soundtrack. Televisions are bigger and \n     louder than ever, and so are movie theaters. One study \n     estimates that as many as 5.2 million children in the United \n     States between 6 and 19 have some hearing damage from \n     amplified music and other sources. If they don't take steps \n     to protect their hearing, the iPod Generation faces the same \n     fate as the Woodstock Generation. Or worse.\n       Thanks to their years of living loudly, many boomers are \n     ahead of schedule when it comes to hearing loss, showing \n     symptoms in their late 40s and 50s. (In the past, patients \n     usually weren't diagnosed until their 60s or later.) ``We're \n     seeing hearing loss from noise develop at an earlier age than \n     we used to,'' says Dr. Jennifer Derebery, immediate past \n     president of the American Academy of Otolaryngology--Head and \n     Neck Surgery. ``It's a huge problem.'' The good news: though \n     hearing loss can't be reversed, reducing exposure to \n     excessive noise, like quitting cigarettes, can improve your \n     health and quality of life, no matter your age.\n       Of course, noise isn't the only culprit. ``Even if you \n     spent your life in the library, you wouldn't hear as well \n     when you're 70 as you do when you're 20,'' says Dr. Robert \n     Dobie, professor of otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat) at \n     the University of California, Davis. But who spent their \n     lives in the library? Not Kathy Peck and her fans; not the \n     folks riding jackhammers on road crews, and not the \n     firefighters and cops dashing to the rescue with their sirens \n     screaming. Even pediatricians have been known to develop \n     hearing problems after years spent around crying babies. When \n     you combine the excessive noise they have experienced at \n     work, home and play with the natural effects of aging, \n     boomers end up on the receiving end of what Dr. Peter \n     Rabinowitz at the Yale School of Medicine calls a ``double \n     whammy that makes people much more symptomatic.''\n       But progress is being made on many fronts. Awareness and \n     prevention efforts--community-based, state and nationwide \n     programs--are gaining support around the country as hearing \n     loss is increasingly recognized as a public-health issue. \n     Advances in digital technology have dramatically improved \n     hearing aids; they are smaller than ever, with far better \n     sound quality. And clinical trials are now underway on \n     permanent, implantable hearing aids for the middle ear which \n     will offer sound that is superior even to the best external \n     aids. On the biological front, scientists are busy trying to \n     unlock the genetics of hearing to find a way to regenerate \n     the sensitive hair cells, essential for hearing, that line \n     the cochlea, the spiral, seashell-like structure located in \n     the inner ear. And way out on the horizon of the cutting \n     edge, researchers have created an experimental brain-implant \n     system that bypasses the ear altogether and sends sound from \n     an external receiver to the part of the brainstem that \n     processes sound.\n       The product of extraordinary, even beautiful, anatomy, \n     hearing is a natural wonder and exactly the sort of gift we \n     tend to take for granted. ``Unfortunately, a lot of people do \n     not value their hearing,'' says Dr. William Slattery, \n     director of clinical studies at the House Ear Institute in \n     Los Angeles. Hearing may also be too good for its own good. \n     Human ears were originally meant to pick up the faintest \n     sounds of predators stalking our long-ago ancestors--the snap \n     of twigs in the forest, the rustle of grass on the savanna. \n     The crash and racket of modern life, both urban (motorcycles, \n     subway trains, car alarms) and rural (chain saws, \n     snowmobiles, shotguns), assault and insult these gorgeous \n     instruments.\n       Most common types of hearing loss occur at the higher \n     frequencies and are caused by damage to hair cells. Slattery \n     describes the cochlea as ``a piano, with 15,000 keys rather \n     than 88.'' Different parts of the cochlea process different \n     frequencies of sound, so when you have hearing loss at a \n     certain frequency, it's as if that part of the keyboard is \n     not functioning. Various levels of noise affect hair cells in \n     various ways. If a rocket-propelled grenade goes off right \n     next to you, you can experience ``acoustic trauma'' that \n     kills hair cells and causes the instant loss of a great deal \n     of hearing. (Hearing loss is the third most commonly \n     diagnosed service-related ailment, according to the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs.) Hanging out directly in \n     front of the speakers at a Green Day concert could result in \n     a less serious ``temporary threshold shift,'' in which the \n     hair cells are stressed but not permanently damaged. Such \n     stress is often accompanied by ringing in the ears that can \n     last for hours or even days. (Derebery notes that repeated \n     threshold shifts can lead to permanent hearing loss.) And \n     then there's what might be called noisy-world syndrome. While \n     an individual's noise exposure may not reach the official \n     danger zone, the worry is that the chronic din of daily life \n     could lead to deterioration over time. ``There's not a lot of \n     data about it,'' says Rabinowitz, ``but our concern is that \n     there is less and less time for the ears to rest, and so the \n     hair cells are going to be prematurely exhausted.''\n       Protecting your hearing starts with understanding how noise \n     works. The classic ``formula'' for assessing the risk of \n     hearing loss is the intensity of the noise, measured in \n     decibels (the danger starts at 85 decibels, roughly the sound \n     of a lawn mower), multiplied by duration, the time of \n     exposure. In other words, the louder the noise, the less time \n     you should be exposed to it. Prolonged exposure to any noise \n     above 85 decibels can cause gradual hearing loss. According \n     to what experts call the ``five-decibel rule,'' for each \n     five-decibel increase, the permissible exposure time is cut \n     in half. So one hour at 110 decibels is equivalent to eight \n     hours at 95 decibels. And sound levels above 116 decibels \n     (snowmobiles are about 120, rock concerts about 140) are \n     unsafe for any period of time.\n       For millions of Americans, excessive noise in the workplace \n     is a daily threat. Angelo Iasillo, 45, has worked in road \n     construction since 1989, operating jackhammers and a ``road \n     grinder'' to tear up Chicago's streets. He first noticed a \n     problem with his hearing when he was in his early 30s and \n     found himself asking more and more people to repeat \n     themselves. He also demonstrated another classic symptom. ``I \n     was always putting the TV up louder,'' he recalls. Worried, \n     he went to the doctor and was told, at 32, that he had the \n     hearing of an 80-year-old. Today, Iasillo wears a hearing \n     aid, uses a vibrating alarm clock that he keeps under his \n     pillow and has his doorbell rigged to a lamp--it blinks when \n     someone rings.\n       While the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n     (OSHA) has made great headway against noise-induced hearing \n     loss in the past 20 years, compliance with federal \n     regulations can be a problem in some occupations. Earplugs \n     would certainly help protect road workers like Iasillo, \n     but to be safe at busy work sites they also need to hear \n     what is happening around them. And some professions are \n     louder than we think. Truckdrivers, for example, have a \n     high incidence of hearing loss in their left ears from \n     traffic noise, says Hinrich Staecker, professor of \n     otolaryngology at the University of Maryland School of \n     Medicine.\n\n[[Page S8296]]\n\n       The National Institutes of Health runs a campaign against \n     noise-induced hearing loss, called ``Wise Ears,'' that \n     emphasizes basic steps like wearing earplugs when operating \n     power tools and moderating the volume on personal listening \n     devices. The ubiquitous music players, which send sound \n     directly down the ear canal, are a potential problem for \n     millions of Americans, young and old. In a recent informal \n     study at the House Ear Institute, researchers found that the \n     new generation of digital audio players, with their \n     exceptional clarity, allow listeners to turn up the volume \n     without the signal distortion that occurs with traditional \n     analog audio. Without distortion, which serves as kind of \n     natural volume governor, listeners may be exposed to unsafe \n     sound levels without realizing it. In preliminary \n     observations, the music at the eardrum topped 115 decibels. \n     Exposure to noise that loud for more than 28 seconds per day, \n     over time, can cause permanent damage.\n       Kathy Peck, who learned the hard way about the dangers of \n     loud music, has dedicated herself to helping other musicians \n     avoid her fate. Along with Dr. Flash Gordon, the physician \n     from the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic who helped with her \n     hearing loss 20 years ago, Peck cofounded Hearing Education \n     and Awareness for Rockers (HEAR). Since its inception in 1988 \n     (with seed money from the Who's Pete Townshend, whose hearing \n     was also trashed by loud music), the group has helped \n     thousands of young rockers, distributing free earplugs at \n     clubs, concerts and music festivals, and providing free \n     screenings by audiologists.\n       For more than 6 million Americans, hearing aids are the \n     best available solution for everything from mild to profound \n     hearing loss. Today's digital devices, like the analog \n     instruments that preceded them, amplify sound and transmit it \n     down the ear canal to the eardrum. But the similarities end \n     there. Thanks to digital technologies, modern aids offer \n     better sound quality (above). Top-of-the-line models feature \n     ``directional'' or ``high definition'' hearing. These devices \n     use two microphones and an algorithm to enhance sound coming \n     from the front (the person you are talking to), while tuning \n     down sound coming from behind (the rest of the noisy party).\n       Despite such encouraging technical advances, there are \n     about 21 million people in the United States who could \n     benefit from hearing aids, but don't use them. Many simply \n     can't afford them. Their costs range from a few hundred \n     dollars for a basic analog device to $3,500 for high-end \n     instruments, and are rarely covered by insurance. Another \n     reason some folks eschew aids is discomfort--they simply \n     don't like the feeling of walking around with a plugged ear \n     canal. And even with digital technology, people can still \n     have difficulty separating speech they want to hear from the \n     background noise, a common hearing-aid problem. Yet another \n     obstacle to wider use is stigma--many people associate \n     hearing aids with aging, Slattery says, and would just as \n     soon cup a hand behind their ear. ``They're afraid to look \n     old, but they don't mind looking dumb.''\n       A new generation of implantable and semi-implantable \n     hearing aids, currently being developed and tested, could \n     solve many of these problems. Unlike conventional aids, the \n     new devices transmit sound vibrations directly to the bones \n     in the middle ear, bypassing the eardrum and improving speech \n     perception. ``You can amplify the higher frequencies without \n     feedback problems,'' says Slattery, ``and that gives a \n     richness to the sound. It's the high frequencies that help \n     you localize sound and hear better in noisy situations.'' \n     Other pluses: no clogged ear canal and no visible sign of \n     infirmity. But until insurance companies start paying for \n     hearing aids (they are under increasing pressure to do so), \n     the $15,000-to-$20,000 devices--intended for those with \n     moderate to severe hearing loss--will remain out of reach for \n     most.\n       A more permanent solution to hearing loss--regenerating \n     damaged cochlear hair cells--is the shared goal of a \n     scattered band of researchers around the country. Unlike \n     birds and other lower vertebrates, which can regenerate hair \n     cells, humans and other mammals get one set, and that's it. \n     If scientists can discover a way to grow new hair cells in \n     humans, exciting new treatments could be devised. \n     Already, researchers at the University of Michigan have \n     used gene therapy to grow new hair cells in guinea pigs. \n     At the House Ear Institute, Andrew Groves and Neil Segil \n     are studying the embryonic development of hair cells in \n     genetically engineered mice. If they can unravel the \n     process, figure out how it starts and why it stops in \n     mammals, they may eventually be able to reactivate the \n     cells and have them make new hair cells. In a related \n     experiment, they have managed to coax some embryonic \n     cochlear cells in mice to restart and become hair cells. \n     ``This is new stuff,'' says Segil, with the calm that \n     often masks excitement in scientific circles.\n       ``If you are going to have a hearing loss, this is the best \n     time to do it,'' says Char Sivertson, who began to lose her \n     hearing without discernible cause when she was a teenager. \n     Sivertson is downright enthusiastic about things like closed \n     captioning. ``It's incredible; now I'm not left out of TV,'' \n     she says, and ticks off other high -tech advances, such as \n     digital hearing aids and phones that can be ``tuned'' to \n     improve the clarity of the caller's voice.\n       But Sivertson, an activist member of the Association of \n     Late-Deafened Adults (ALDA), a support group, wasn't always \n     so gung-ho. ``I was in denial for years and years,'' she \n     says. ``I tried to pass for hearing, which was ridiculous.'' \n     Sivertson was using hearing aids by the age of 24, but it was \n     another 20 years before she fully accepted her fate. And \n     there were some dark days in between. Every few years, her \n     hearing would suddenly get worse. After one such drop, ``I \n     was very depressed,'' says Sivertson, now 57. ``I wasn't \n     exactly suicidal, but I was thinking, `I'm not sure life is \n     going to be very meaningful for me from this point on'.''\n       Sivertson faced a myriad problems while raising her two \n     sons, Dak and Matt. When there was a school matter or some \n     other issue to discuss, her sons tended to bypass her and go \n     to their dad, Larry, who has normal hearing. ``Kids don't \n     want to repeat themselves and stuff like that,'' says Larry \n     Sivertson. ``It's up to the hearing spouse to make sure that \n     the person with hearing loss is involved.'' Char Sivertson \n     found peace of mind through her association with ALDA. \n     Joining such a group, she says, ``is the No. 1 thing you can \n     do for yourself'' if you develop hearing loss later in life.\n       And here's something you can do before you reach that \n     point--learn to appreciate what you already have. Says Yale's \n     Rabinowitz: ``If you are watching your diet, if you are \n     exercising, then protecting your hearing should be part of \n     your lifestyle.'' Sounds good to us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/14/senate-section/article/S8296-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           GRANTS UNDER THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, on Sunday afternoon, Hurricane \nDennis made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast, causing billions of \ndollars in damage, taking four lives and bringing back terrible \nmemories of last summer's four hurricanes. Some people in north Florida \nwere still recovering from Hurricane Ivan when Dennis struck.\n  I was down in Pensacola on Monday and saw the damage wrought by \nDennis. People are still without power in the summer heat. Food, clean \nwater and ice are absolutely vital right now. Many coastal areas, like \nthe small village of St. Mark's, were deluged by water from the ten \nfoot storm surge. Mitigation helps us to better prepare for future \nstorms, lessens their impact and saves lives.\n  Last summer, when the Internal Revenue Service ruled that FEMA \nmitigation grants must be reported as taxable income, I worked to \nadvance a bill ensuring they were exempt from Federal taxes. This bill \nwas signed into law by the President on April 15. Each year, hundreds \nof Floridians use mitigation grants to protect their lives and property \nfrom future natural disasters. Now they know for sure that accepting a \nmitigation grant to flood proof their home won't result in higher \ntaxes.\n  Yet even with this relief, another IRS ruling is causing problems \nwith the flood insurance program. That's because according to the IRS, \na National Flood Insurance Program, NFIP, grant must be included as \nincome. This could make some recipients ineligible for crucial Federal \nassistance programs like Food Stamps, aid to dependent children and \nMedicaid. No one should have to choose between making their home safe \nfrom flooding and food or medicine. No other kind of emergency \nassistance granted by FEMA counts toward income and neither should \nflood mitigation grants.\n  I'm pleased to sign onto legislation introduced by my colleague from \nFlorida which would prevent Federal agencies administering means-tested \nbenefits from counting NFIP grants as income. I hope the Senate will \nconsider this legislation quickly and provide peace of mind to \nFloridians and other Americans living in disaster prone areas of the \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/14/senate-section/article/S8296-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8296-S8297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   CONGRATULATING MS.

Stolar's drill \nstring radar was recently selected by R magazine as one of the 100 \nmost technologically significant products introduced into the \nmarketplace this year.\n  The drill string radar attaches to systems that drill for natural \nresources. It can identify geological formations, locate the position \nof oil and gas deposits, and determine the thickness of coal seams.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \ncentral role White Sands Missile Range, WSMR, has played in the defense \nof our Nation and our exploration of space, as we commemorate its \nestablishment 60 years ago.\n  I would also like to honor the men and women who have served and \nworked at White Sands. It is due to their hard work and dedication that \nWhite Sands has been, and remains a shining example of American \nscientific and technological innovation.\n  On July 9, 1945, White Sands Missile Range was officially \nestablished. One week later, its place in history was assured with the \ndetonation of the world's first atomic device at the Trinity site. This \nwould prove a pivotal moment in the final defeat of the Japanese Empire \nand the course of world history. The Trinity test was to be the first \nof many historical achievements that will forever be linked to White \nSands.\n  At White Sands the technology was developed and matured that would \npropel the United States into space and to the Moon. Beginning with the \nreverse engineering and testing of captured German V2 rockets at the \nend of the Second World War, a base of knowledge was created there that \nwould lead directly to the development of the Redstone rocket program \nand every rocket produced in the United States since. It was a Redstone \nRocket which launched the first U.S. astronaut, Alan Shephard, into \nspace on May 5, 1961. For these achievements, White Sands is often \nreferred to as the ``Birthplace of the Race to Space.''\n  White Sands continues its close connection to the space program today \nas a space harbor serving as the backup landing facility for the space \nshuttle. It also serves as the primary training area for NASA space \nshuttle pilots flying practice approaches and landings in the shuttle-\ntraining aircraft.\n  Over the last 60 years, White Sands Missile Range's contribution to \nthe security of the United States has been significant. Most of the \nmissile systems used by the U.S. military have been tested at WSMR. \nLike America's first guided anti-aircraft missile the Nike Ajax and the \nPatriot missile system made famous during the first gulf war, the \nmissile systems tested at White Sands have played an important role in \nensuring the technological superiority of the Armed Forces throughout \nthe last six decades.\n  Today, White Sands Missile Range continues its long tradition of \nexcellence as a testing and development center for new technologies and \nis the largest military facility in the United States. I would like to \nthank the men and women, past and present, who have made White Sands a \nsource of national pride. I have no doubt the work done at White Sands \nwill continue to contribute to the national security of the United \nStates and further the scientific achievements of our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/14/senate-section/article/S8297-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8297-S8298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GOLD STAR WIVES OF AMERICA\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \norganization that has answered the call of duty on behalf of our \nsoldiers and their families for the last 60 years, the Gold Star Wives \nof America, Inc. On July 19th, representatives of all the Gold Star \nWives chapters will gather in Orlando, FL, to commemorate their 60th \nAnniversary and I ask every American to join me in thanking these \ncitizen soldiers for their tireless work on behalf of military families \nacross this country.\n  While we as a Nation celebrate and honor the service of our soldiers, \nit is organizations such as the Gold-Star Wives that remind us that \nevery soldier is a sibling, a parent, someone's child, a spouse. They \nalso remind us that our national obligation is not only to the soldier \nin the field but to the family a fallen soldier leaves behind.\n  Prior to World War II, many military widows and their families did \nnot have a strong voice to advocate on their behalf. All of that \nchanged in New York when 23-year-old Marie Jordan, whose husband Edward \ndied in Germany, collected women's names as they appeared in military \nobituaries and invited a small group over for coffee. Once together, \nthe assembled widows realized that their concerns were many, that their \nissues were common amongst many military widows, and that there was not \nan organization charged with advocating on their behalf. They set about \naddressing these three concerns and in the process created the Gold \nStar Wives of America with a simple but profound mission: to honor \nthose who died in the service of their country and assist those left \nbehind.\n  The meetings continued and grew throughout New York. In April of \n1945, our country lost the President. From the sorrow of that loss came \na member who would have a lasting and dramatic effect on the group's \nprofile, Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt. Through Mrs. Roosevelt's weekly \ncolumns and public profile, the visibility of the Gold Star Wives \nincreased, as did their impact and membership. That early coffee \ngathering evolved into their one and only annual fundraiser, a ``Stay-\nat-Home Tea'' to which members are encouraged to donate amounts as \nsmall a $10 and $15.\n  Initially the activities were local, such as arranging camping trips \nfor the children of lost soldiers and volunteering at veterans \nhospitals. As membership grew so did the scope of the young \norganization's focus, which soon incorporated organizational support \nfor memorial projects, helping coordinate Veterans and Memorial Days \nprograms and speaking out in public forums on behalf of widowed \nmilitary wives.\n  And the work continues today. Tiffany Petty, 25, of Inkom, ID, was \nwidowed in December 2003 when her husband, Army PFC Jerrick M. Petty, \nwas killed while guarding a gas station in Iraq. Along with other \nmembers of the Gold Star Wives, Tiffany appeared before the Senate and \ncommunicated in strong, heartfelt terms the need to increase death \nbenefits for survivors and remove the bureaucratic obstacles grieving \nfamilies face in accessing benefits.\n  On July 19, the mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters that comprise \nthe membership of the Gold Star Wives will convene in Florida. A \ncentral part of this 60th anniversary celebration will be a tribute to \nthe group's founder now known as Marie Jordan Speer. Along with the \nMassachusetts delegation, I am proud to stand with all of these \ninspiring women as they pay tribute to a patriot and citizen soldier \nwho has had an immeasurable impact on how this nation treats military \nfamilies.\n\n[[Page S8298]]\n\n  As a veteran and as an American, I thank Marie Jordan Speer and every \nmember, past and present, of the Gold Star Wives of America for their \npatriotic service, for their advocacy, and for making sure that this \ncountry lives up to its obligation to soldiers long after the \nbattlefield falls quiet and troops come home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/14/senate-section/article/S8298-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/14/senate-section/article/S8298-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/14/senate-section/article/S8298-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT REQUESTED IN SECTION 2106 OF THE EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL \n APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR DEFENSE, THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR, AND TSUNAMI \n   RELIEF, 2005 (PUBLIC LAW 109-13) PROVIDING INFORMATION ON MATTERS \nRELATING TO THE PALESTINIAN SECURITY SERVICES AND PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY \n                             REFORM--PM 17\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 2106 of the Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami \nRelief, 2005 (Public Law 109-13), and in order to keep the Congress \nfully informed, I herewith submit the enclosed report prepared by my \nAdministration providing information on matters relating to the \nPalestinian Security Services and Palestinian Authority reform.\n                                                      George W.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. ALLEN (for himself and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 1396. A bill to amend the Investment Company Act of 1940 to \nprovide incentives for small business investment, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Santorum, in introducing the Increased Capital \nAccess for Growing Businesses Act. The legislation would help many \nsmall businesses address the challenge of accessing capital as they \nlook to grow, develop and create more jobs.\n  I would like to share with colleagues in the Senate why this \nlegislation is necessary and desirable to update our securities laws \nfor entrepreneurial small business owners. In 1980, Congress passed \nlegislation, the Small Business Investment Incentive Act, which \nauthorized business development companies, or BDCs, to provide \nfinancing to small, developing or financially troubled companies. \nCongress recognized the importance of small businesses to the U.S. \neconomy and that such businesses may have a more difficult time \nobtaining needed capital to grow and develop.\n  BDCs are publicly traded companies that are required to have 70 \npercent of their assets invested in eligible assets, or eligible \nportfolio companies, which are generally to be securities of small \ndeveloping or financially troubled businesses. In 1980, the definition \nof a small company for the purposes of a BDC's 70 percent of asset \ncategory was tied to the Federal Reserve's rules defining marginable \nsecurities. At the time, about two-thirds or 8,000 publicly traded \ncompanies were not marginable and were therefore eligible investments \nfor BDCs.\n  However, there was an unintended consequence of tying the definition \nof small company to those issuers that do not have marginable \nsecurities--the margin rules have been changed several times, which \nsignificantly reduced the number of public companies in which BDCs \ncould invest. This was obviously not the original intent of Congress, \nbut the practical impact was that many small, public companies became \nineligible to receive BDC financing, even if they could not receive \nmore traditional sources of financing.\n  Recently, the disqualification of any private company that had issued \nany debt security has significantly narrowed even further the number of \ncompanies that qualify as eligible portfolio companies. Thus, for the \nfirst time many companies with no access to the public equity markets \ncannot access capital through a BDC. These companies are either denied \ncapital access altogether, or are forced to turn to various unregulated \nsources to meet capital needs. This situation is unfair to the \nshareholders of BDCs, and unfair to the shareholders of businesses that \ncould grow if only offered capital access opportunities.\n  That is why this legislation is so important. It will allow more \nsmall private and public companies to receive BDC financing and restore \nthe original intent of Congress.\n  Specifically, the legislation would use a market capitalization \nstandard of $250 million or less to define what is an eligible \nportfolio company for BDCs. The $250 million market capitalization \nlevel approximates the number of public companies that Congress \noriginally intended to qualify as eligible BDC assets. I would note \nthat it is also much lower than the market capitalization levels of \nsmall cap indexes, such as the S SmallCap 600, which uses a market \ncap of $300 million to $1 billion for a definition of a small company.\n  This legislation adds no costs or risks to the government or \ntaxpayers. It will simply correct the unintended consequences of \ncurrent rules and update the securities laws to allow more small \nbusinesses to access capital. This will in turn encourage small \nbusiness growth, job creation and economic expansion.\n  That is why, earlier this year the House of Representatives \nunanimously passed similar legislation to modernize U.S. securities \nlaws and allow more small businesses to be eligible for such financing.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting this \ncommon-sense legislation for small businesses in America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Nelson of \n        Florida, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 1397. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide for \nan increase in the minimum end-strength level for active duty personnel \nfor the United States Army, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8305]]\n\n                                S. 1397\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States Army Relief \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The 2004 National Military Strategy of the United \n     States assigns the Army the task of operating with the other \n     Armed Forces to provide for homeland defense, deter \n     aggression forward from and in four different regions around \n     the world, conduct military operations in two overlapping but \n     geographically disparate major campaigns, and win decisively \n     in one of those campaigns before shifting focus to the next \n     one.\n       (2) The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \n     Richard Myers, has directed that the Army must be able to \n     ``win decisively'' in one theater, even when it is committed \n     to a number of other contingencies.\n       (3) While Congress lauds the current efforts by the \n     Administration to reduce demands upon ground forces by \n     continuing to pursue the transformation of the United States \n     military as a whole, the recent experiences of the Army in \n     Iraq serve to underscore the fact that there is, as of yet, \n     no substitute for having sufficient troops to conduct \n     personnel-intensive post-conflict missions.\n       (4) The current force requirements posed by the ongoing \n     operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere as part of the \n     Global War on Terror are unsustainable for the long term and \n     undermine the ability of the United States military to \n     successfully execute the National Military Strategy.\n       (5) Although the burden may be a heavy one, we as a nation \n     and as a people must not, will not, shy away from our \n     engagement in world affairs to defend our interests and to \n     defend those who are themselves defenseless.\n       (6) Our engagement in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the greater \n     Middle East is, as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice \n     stated, a ``generational'' one.\n       (7) Although our commitments in this region--and around the \n     world--are vital, the Army has been ``overused'' according to \n     the Chief of the United States Army Reserve.\n       (8) The Army currently has approximately 499,000 active \n     duty troops, and these are backed up by nearly 700,000 \n     members of the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve.\n       (9) This number is a third less than the force level on \n     hand when the first Persian Gulf War was fought in 1991.\n       (10) Approximately 150,000 of these troops are in Iraq. \n     Nearly 10,000 troops are in Afghanistan. 1,700 serve in \n     Kosovo. 37,000 serve on the Korean peninsula.\n       (11) As of 2005 the relationship between the total number \n     of troops and the number of operationally deployed troops has \n     resulted, as the commanding general of the 18th Corps of the \n     Army at Fort Bragg remarked in 2004, in an active-duty force \n     that is ``stretched extraordinarily thin.''\n       (12) A former Army Deputy Chief of Staff has stated that in \n     light of the growing operational demands upon it in the \n     strategic environment after September 11, 2001, that the Army \n     ``is too small to do its current missions''.\n       (13) That former Army Deputy Chief of Staff further stated \n     that the current size of the Army, coupled with the current \n     demands upon it, has resulted in a loss of ``the resiliency \n     to provide either strategic balance--what you need if some \n     other thing flares up--or to be able to give a respite as the \n     troops rotate back from overseas areas where they've been in \n     combat.''\n       (14) In its attempts to fulfill its missions with too few \n     troops, the Army has risked ``damaging'' the force \n     significantly or ``even breaking it in the next five years'', \n     according to a division commander during Operation Desert \n     Storm.\n       (15) In a December 2004 letter to the Chief of Staff, \n     United States Army, the Chief of the United States Army \n     Reserve wrote that ``the current demands'' of operations in \n     the Middle East were ``spreading the Reserve force too thin'' \n     and that his command ``was in grave danger'' of being unable \n     to meet other missions abroad or domestically, and that the \n     Army Reserve was ``rapidly degenerating into a `broken force' \n     ''.\n       (16) The letter referred to in paragraph (15) was intended, \n     the Chief of the United States Army Reserve wrote, not ``to \n     sound alarmist . . . [but] . . . to send a clear, \n     distinctive, signal of deepening concern'' to his superiors.\n       (17) In addition to hampering the ability of the Army to \n     successfully complete the missions assigned to it, this \n     ``overuse'' has significant consequences for domestic \n     homeland security operations.\n       (18) A disproportionate number of Federal, State, and local \n     first responders are also members of the National Guard or \n     Reserve.\n       (19) At a time of strain for large municipalities \n     struggling to secure their infrastructure against the threat \n     of terrorism, the drain on available personnel as well as \n     budgets is unacceptable.\n       (20) An increase of the end-strength of the Army is in the \n     best interests of the people of the United States and their \n     interests abroad, and is consistent with the duties and \n     obligations of Congress as set forth in the Constitution.\n       (21) An increase of 100,000 troops over the permanently \n     authorized level for the Army for fiscal year 2004 of 482,000 \n     troops will provide a long-term, lasting solution to the \n     current operational constraints and future mission \n     requirements of the Army.\n       (22) Progress was made toward that solution when Congress \n     authorized an increase of 20,000 troops in the end-strength \n     of the Army for fiscal year 2005 in the Ronald W. Reagan \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 \n     (Public Law 108-375).\n       (23) An increase in the permanent authorized end-strength \n     for the Army of 80,000 troops is required to meet the \n     100,000-troop increase level that will provide a lasting, \n     long-term solution to personnel problems currently being \n     experienced by the Army.\n       (24) This number will equip the Army with sufficient \n     personnel so that it may not only engage in a stabilization \n     operation like Iraq, but so that it may do so while \n     maintaining optimal troop rotation schedules.\n       (25) This conclusion is supported by the November 2003 \n     testimony of the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, \n     Douglas Holtz-Eakin, before the Committee on Armed Services \n     of the House of Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 3. INCREASE IN END-STRENGTH FOR THE ARMY.\n\n       Section 691 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(e) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(1), the authorization \n     for the number of members of the Army at the end of each \n     fiscal year as follows shall be not less than the number \n     specified for such fiscal year:\n       ``(1) Fiscal year 2006, 522,400.\n       ``(2) Fiscal year 2007, 542,400.\n       ``(3) Fiscal year 2008, 562,400.\n       ``(4) Fiscal year 2009, 582,400.\n       ``(5) Any fiscal year after fiscal year 2009, 582,400.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 1398. A bill to provide more rigorous requirements with respect to \nethics and lobbying; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernment Affairs.\n\n\n                 Title I--Enhancing Lobbying Disclosure\n\n       Section 101: Requires lobbying disclosure reports to be \n     filed quarterly rather than semiannually and adjusts monetary \n     thresholds accordingly.\n       Section 102: Requires lobbying disclosure reports to be \n     filed in electronic form.\n       Section 103: Directs the Secretary of the Senate and the \n     Clerk of the House of Representatives to create a searchable, \n     sortable, and downloadable public database that contains the \n     information disclosed in lobbying disclosure reports.\n       Section 104: Requires registered lobbyists to provide, in \n     the section of their quarterly reports in which the issues or \n     bills on which they lobbied are listed, the names of all \n     senior executive branch officials and Members of Congress who \n     they communicated with orally and the dates on which such \n     communications occurred.\n       Section 105: Mandates that registered lobbyists must \n     disclose all past executive and congressional employment, not \n     just such employment during the two years prior to making a \n     lobbying contact.\n       Section 106: Requires lobbyists to disclose in their \n     quarterly reports how much they spent on grassroots lobbying \n     efforts.\n       Section 107: Provides more transparency for lobbying \n     coalitions, by requiring such organizations to disclose those \n     individuals or entities whose total contribution to the \n     association in connection with lobbying activities exceeds \n     $10,000. Certain tax-exempt associations are not covered by \n     this new requirement.\n       Section 108: Doubles the penalty for failing to comply with \n     lobbying disclosure requirements from $50,000 to $100,000.\n\n\n                  Title II--Slowing the Revolving Door\n\n       Section 201: Amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 207, the section of the \n     criminal code that provides restrictions on lobbying by \n     former executive and legislative branch employees, to \n     establish the following restrictions:\n       1. Senior executive employees, those paid at 86.5 percent \n     of level II of the Executive Schedule are prohibited from \n     making communications or appearances with the intent to \n     influence any employee of their former agencies for two \n     years. The current ``cooling off period'' is one year.\n       2. Very senior executive employees, the Vice President and \n     those paid at level I of the Executive Schedule, such as \n     cabinet officers and heads of agencies, are prohibited from \n     engaging in ``lobbying activities,'' as defined in section 3, \n     subsection 7 of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, for a \n     two-year period; with respect to their former agency or to \n     any employee currently paid under the Executive Schedule. \n     Under the LDA, lobbying activities include not only direct \n     lobbying contacts, but activities such as providing advice, \n     strategy, or preparation in connection with such contacts.\n       3. Members of Congress are prohibited from engaging in \n     lobbying activities relating to either House of Congress for \n     two years. This will prevent a former member from directing \n     or managing a lobbying campaign while avoiding personal \n     lobbying contacts.\n       4.

Mr. President, today I will introduce the Lobbying and \nEthics Reform Act of 2005. This bill builds on similar legislation that \nwas introduced in the House by Representatives Marty Meehan and Rahm \nEmmanuel.\n  I have long believed that to truly serve our constituents well, we \nmust reduce the impact of big money on the legislative process. I have \ndevoted a great deal of time over the years to reforming our campaign \nfinance laws. With the enactment of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act \nin 2002, we took several important, and I believe successful, steps to \nreduce the influence of special interests and return some measure of \npower to the American people.\n  But campaign contributions are only part of the story. In fact, \nduring recent election cycles, the amount spent on lobbying members of \nCongress once they are elected has been more than double the amount \nspent on getting them elected in the first place. Yet lobbyists and the \nlobbying industry remain partly in the shadows, even after the \nsignificant improvements to the disclosure laws enacted in 1995. Ten \nyears later, the weaknesses of that law have become apparent, as have \nthe weaknesses in the congressional gift rules that we passed around \nthe same time. Recent scandals involving lobbyists have made very clear \nthat if this body is to be responsive to the people, not just a narrow \nset of special interests, we must strengthen the disclosure rules \ngoverning the lobbying industry and close loopholes in the gift rules.\n  The lobbying industry continues to grow at a startling rate. \nAccording to the Center for Public Integrity, over three billion \ndollars were spent on lobbying in 2004, nearly double the amount spent \njust six years earlier. This dramatic increase in lobbying expenditures \nhas led to an equally dramatic growth in the number of registered \nlobbyists. A story in the Washington Post from June of this year \nreports that there are currently more than 34,750 registered lobbyists, \nwhich represents a 100% increase from 2000. Not surprisingly, a few \npowerful industries account for much of this growth. In the last six \nyears, the pharmaceutical industry alone has spent over three quarters \nof a billion dollars on lobbying, enough to finance over 3,000 \nprofessional lobbyists. The insurance industry is not far behind. \nDuring this same period, insurance companies spent over 600 million \ndollars and employed over 2,000 lobbyists.\n  Despite the growing presence of lobbyists on Capitol Hill, and \ndespite the improvements made in the 1995 law, regulation of the \nlobbying industry remains inadequate. The Senate office in charge of \noverseeing lobbying disclosure reports employs fewer than 20 people, \nand the equivalent House office employs fewer than 35. Compare these \nnumbers to the Federal Election Commission, which many people believe \nis itself understaffed, but which has a staff of nearly 400 to oversee \nand enforce campaign finance laws.\n  Given these numbers, it should not come as a shock that oversight of \nthe booming lobbying industry is not what we would like it to be. In \nthe past six years alone, over 300 individuals and companies lobbied \nwithout registering first. One in five lobbying companies failed to \nfile required disclosure forms. And the Center for Public Integrity \nreports that over 14,000 disclosure documents that should have been \nfiled are not available, including documents relating to 49 of the top \n50 lobbying firms.\n  When the disclosure requirements are not enforced, it can only be \nexpected that they and other rules relating to lobbying will not be \nfollowed. In the last six months, we have seen a number of stories in \nthe press detailing the increasingly cozy relationship between \nlobbyists and certain members of Congress. We have seen stories of \nlobbyists funding international junkets for members, their families, \nand their staff, which include days on famous golf courses and nights \nin luxurious resorts. We have seen stories of members and their staff \naccepting lavish gifts and expensive meals from lobbyists. And we haves \nseen stories of lobbyists providing members with free access to their \ncompanies' or clients' corporate jets so that they can fly in comfort \nfrom fundraiser to fundraiser.\n  But the enticements offered by lobbyists are not all quite so exotic \nindeed, many lobbyists merely offer plum positions in their K Street \noffices. According to a 2005 report, more than 2200 former federal \ngovernment employees were registered as federal lobbyists between 1998 \nand 2004. Of those, more then 200 were former members of Congress. In \nfact, Public Citizen reports that nearly half of all members returning \nto the private sector accept positions in the lobbying industry. For \ncongressional employees, the prospect of receiving lobbying positions, \nwhich often pay several times more than their current jobs, can easily \ncreate conflicts of interest and may affect the decisions they make in \ntheir official capacity.\n  The problems with oversight of the lobbying industry are systemic and \nthey are troubling. Even the minimal disclosure requirements of the \nLobbying Disclosure Act are often ignored because lobbyists know they \nwill not be penalized. The revolving door between the Hill and K Street \nspins faster than ever. And flaws in the gift rules are allowing \nhandouts from lobbyists to rapidly increase the influence of special \ninterests at the expense of the average citizen. I am told that it is \nnot uncommon for lobbyists to perch themselves at the end of a bar and \nbuy drinks for any congressional staffer who comes by. This is \npermissible under the Senate's current gift rules, and it shouldn't be. \nLobbyists complain about pressure--if not outright blatant requests--\nfrom Members and congressional staff to pay for their food and drinks. \nClearly, there is plenty of blame to go around.\n  My bill addresses these concerns in four ways. First, my bill makes \nthe lobbying process more transparent by enhancing the specificity, \nfrequency, and accessibility of lobbying disclosure reports. The bill \nwould require these periodic reports filed by lobbyists to identify the \nmembers of Congress with whom they met, divulge all past senior-level \nlegislative or executive branch employment, and separate out and report \nthe amount of money spent on grassroots lobbying efforts. Lobbyists \nwould have to file these reports on a quarterly, rather than a \nsemiannual, basis. And the bill would require the Secretary of the \nSenate and the Clerk of the House to make these reports available in a \nsearchable database that would allow the public to gather information \non lobbyists quickly and efficiently. The bill also requires the \ndisclosure of entities that contribute large sums of money to lobbying \ncoalitions. And it doubles the civil penalty for knowingly failing to \nfile lobbying reports or filing false information.\n\n  Second, this bill should slow the revolving door between Congress and \nthe lobbying industry. It establishes a two-year waiting period for \nmembers, senior staff, and senior executive personnel to participate in \nlobbying. During this cooling-off period, members and senior executive \npersonnel would be prohibited from engaging in all lobbying activities, \nincluding developing strategy for or directing a lobbying campaign. \nStaff would be forbidden from making direct contact with any members or \nstaff who work in the\n\n[[Page S8311]]\n\nHouse of Congress that used to employ them, rather than just the former \nemploying office, as the law now requires.\n  The revolving door provisions in my bill would also require members \nof Congress to publicly disclose their intent to seek outside \nemployment if a conflict of interest exists. They prohibit members of \nCongress from taking official actions to influence the employment \ndecisions of outside entities on the basis of partisan affiliation. And \nthey affirm that no member should take official action based on the \nprospect for personal gain. The bill also prohibits registered \nlobbyists from taking advantage of special advantages such as gym \nmembership, floor privileges, or access to certain areas of the Capitol \nthat are offered to former Members of Congress.\n  Third, my bill addresses the growing problem of privately funded \ntravel and lobbyist gifts. Before sponsoring a trip for a member or \nstaff, an organization must certify that the trip was not financed or \norganized by a registered lobbyist and that lobbyists will not \nparticipate in or attend the trip. After returning from the trip, the \nMember or staff must provide a detailed itinerary and description of \nexpenses. My bill also creates a complete ban on lobbyists providing \ngifts to members and staff and on members accepting gifts from \nregistered lobbyists. Those who file false certifications or fail to \nobserve these rules will be subject to stiff penalties.\n  Finally, the bill seeks to strengthen oversight of lobbying \ndisclosure. A GAO report showing the old lobbying law passed in the \n1940s was largely ignored and rarely enforced was an important impetus \nto passing the Lobbying Disclosure Act in 1995. The bill requires the \nComptroller General to report to Congress twice annually on the state \nof the enforcement of the rules. These reports will help us determine \nif further improvements in the laws are necessary.\n  These measures are not crafted as a knee-jerk response to the recent \nspate of troubling revelations about the relationships between certain \nmembers of Congress and the lobbying industry. Instead, this bill \naddresses systemic problems with the rules governing lobbyists. It has \nbeen a decade since the Lobbying Disclosure Act and new gift rules were \npassed and we now know that some of these rules are no longer \nsufficient to regulate a growing and evolving lobbying industry. It is \nnow time for us to act again. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section by \nsection analysis be printed in the Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. \n        Jeffords):\n  S. 1400.

Mr. President, sustained military operations in \nAfghanistan and Iraq have brought to light another example of how \noutdated and burdensome government policies can punish generous \nemployers. Employers that continue to pay their employees now on active \nduty in the uniformed services are experiencing tax and pension \ndifficulties that are discouraging this pro-worker, patriotic gesture. \nApparently, when it comes to companies showing their respect for their \nemployees called to serve, there is special meaning to the old cliche \n``no good deed goes unpunished.''\n  The National Committee for Employer Support for the Guard and \nReserve, a nationwide association, reports that thousands of employers \nacross the country have signed a pledge of support and have gone above \nand beyond the requirements of the law in support of their National \nGuard and Reserve employees. This includes many of our Nation's largest \nand most reputable corporations, including 3M, McDonalds, Wal-Mart, \nHome Depot, Liberty Mutual and many others. These commendable companies \nprovide reservist employees who are on active duty with ``differential \npay'' that makes up the difference between their military stipend and \ncivilian salary.\n  In New Hampshire, some of the most remarkable stories of corporate \npatriotism can be found. BAE Systems of Nashua has 110 people serving \nin the Guard and Reserves, 11 of whom are currently deployed overseas. \nThey provide differential pay to all their called-up employees and \ncontinuing access to benefits to family members. The company even \nprovides a stipend to make up the lost pay of active duty spouses of \ncompany employees when the spouse's employer is not able to provide \ndifferential pay.\n  Consider also the account of Mr. Marian Noronha, Chairman and Founder \nof Turbocam, a manufacturer based in Dover, New Hampshire. An immigrant \nfrom India, Mr. Noronha has not only provided his employees with \ndifferential pay and continued family health benefits, but has also \nextended to each of his activated employees a $10,000 line of credit. \nHis active duty reservist and Guard employees have used this money to, \namong other things, purchase personal computers so their families can \ncommunicate with them while they are overseas. Several other New \nHampshire private-sector companies, including Hitchiner Manufacturing \nCompany in Milford, have exemplary records when it comes to dealing \nwith reservist employees.\n  Under current law, employers of reservists and guardsmen called up \nfor active duty are required to treat them as if they are on a leave of \nabsence under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights \nAct of 1994 (USERRA). The Act does not require employers to pay \nreservists who are on active duty. But as I have pointed out, many \nemployers pay the reservists the difference between their military \nstipends and their regular salaries. Some employers provide this \n``differential pay'' for up to three years. For employee convenience, \nmany of these companies also allow deductions from the differential \npayment for contributions to their 401(k) retirement plans.\n  The conflict arises, however, because a 1969 IRS Revenue Ruling \nconsiders the employment relationship terminated when active duty \nbegins. This ruling prevents employers from treating the differential \npay as wages for income tax purposes, resulting in unexpected tax bills \nat the end of the year for these military personnel. Further, the \ncontributions made to the worker's retirement account potentially \ninvalidate, disqualify, the employer's entire retirement plan which \ncould make all amounts immediately taxable to plan participants and the \nemployer.\n  The Uniformed Services Differential Pay Protection Act that I am \nintroducing today clarifies that differential wage payments are to be \ntreated as wages to current employees for income tax purposes and that \nretirement plan contributions are permissible. The bill does the \nfollowing:\n  Differential wage payments would be treated as wages for income tax \nwithholding purposes and reported on the worker's W-2 form. This means \nthat active duty personnel will not be hit with end-of-the-year tax \nbills.\n  No New Taxes: The legislation does not change present law, and \ndeferential wage payments will not be subject to Social Security and \nunemployment compensation taxes.\n  Definition: ``Differential wage payments'' are defined to mean any \npayment which: 1. is made by an employer to an individual while he or \nshe is on active duty for a period of more than 30 days, and 2. \nrepresents all or a portion of the wages the individual would have \nreceived from the employer if he or she were performing service for the \nemployer.\n  An individual receiving differential wage payments would continue to \nbe treated as an employee for purposes of the rules applicable to \nqualified retirement plans, removing the threat that contributions on \nhis or her behalf would invalidate the employer's entire plan.\n  Distributions Protected: Clarifying language is included to ensure \nthat individuals would continue to be permitted to take distributions \nfrom their accounts when they leave their jobs for active duty. Thus, \nthe right to receive distributions will be preserved even though \nindividuals are treated as current employees for contribution purposes. \nThe bill includes a prohibition on making elective deferrals or \nemployee contributions for six months after receiving a distribution.\n  Satisfying Nondiscrimination Rules: In order to avoid disruptions in \nretirement savings plans and to remove disincentives, employers could \ndisregard contributions to retirement savings accounts based on \ndifferential wage payments for nondiscrimination testing purposes, \nprovided that such payments are available to all mobilized employees on \nreasonably equivalent terms.\n  In summary, the Uniformed Services Differential Pay Protection Act \nupholds the principle that employers should not be penalized for their \ngenerosity towards our Nation's reservists and members of the National \nGuard.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 1403. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nextend reasonable cost contracts under medicare; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, when Congress passed the Medicare \nModernization Act, Medicare cost contracts\n\n[[Page S8318]]\n\nwere kept as a health plan option for seniors. However, Congress also \nlimited the ability of cost contracts to operate in areas if a Medicare \nAdvantage plan decided to offer service in that area and stayed for a \nyear.\n  Medicare cost contracts are plans that offer more benefits than basic \nMedicare and are often available in areas in which Medicare Advantage \nplans are not offered. Many of the thousands of Oregonians who have \ncost contract plans are in rural Oregon, where there are few options \nfor care. The legislation I am introducing today, ``The Medicare Cost \nContract Extension and Refinement Act of 2005'', would allow seniors to \nkeep their cost contracts longer even if a Medicare Advantage plan is \noffered. The bill also adds more consumer protection provisions that \nare similar to those already in law for Medicare Advantage plans. I \nbelieve that it is not only important to ensure seniors have choices, \nbut that they can keep the choice that works best for them as well. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1403\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to clarify that terminal development grants remain in \neffect under certain conditions; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill allow for the continued expansion of non-primary hub airports \nacross the country.\n  The simple fact of the matter is that demand for commercial air \nservice in and out of many of these smaller non-primary hub airports is \nfar exceeding the current operational capacity at these airports. \nExpanded airfield and terminal capacity at these airports are \ndesperately needed to meet the growing demand for air service in these \nhigh growth communities.\n  The Springfield/Branson Metropolitan Area in Southwest Missouri is a \nclassic example of one of these high growth communities where demand \nfor air service is exceeding the current operational capacity of area's \nprimary regional airport.\n  The city of Springfield is the economic hub for 26 Missouri Counties \nwith a population of approximately 1 million people. Over the last 10 \nyears, the population of the Springfield area has increased by more \nthan twice the annual growth rate experienced by the State of Missouri.\n  The Springfield metropolitan workforce has grown by more than 27 \npercent the past 10 years, and is projected to grow by 18 percent over \nthe next ten years. Annual regional tourism accounts for over 2.2 \nmillion visitors in Springfield and over 7 million annual visitors to \nthe booming Branson area.\n  Because of the tremendous growth in this region, demand for an air \nservice in and out of the Springfield/Branson Regional Airport is \nsoaring. The current airport is experiencing great difficulty in trying \nto keep up with the growing demand for air service in this region. The \ncapacity at the current airport is virtually at its maximum.\n  The FAA has already approved the Springfield Regional Airport Master \nPlan and completed an environmental assessment for this plan. So far, \nthe FAA has invested over $7 million in the planning and design for \nthis project. Further funding for this project will be needed to fund \nthe expansion of air-side apron, runways, taxiways and limited eligible \ncomponents of the terminal.\n  In order to ensure that this essential project goes forward and that \nprevious Federal tax dollars are not wasted, I am introducing \nlegislation that will clarify the status of the Springfield Regional \nAirport as a non-hub primary airport.\n  This legislation states that if the status of a non-hub primary \nairport changes to a small hub primary airport at a time when the \nairport has already received FAA discretionary funds for a terminal \ndevelopment project--and this project is not yet completed--then the \nproject shall remain eligible for funding from the discretionary fund \nand the small airport fund to pay costs allowable under section \n47110(d) of Title 49. Such an airport project will remain eligible for \nthese funds for three fiscal years after the start of construction of \nthe project, or, if the Secretary determines that a further extension \nof eligibility is justified, until the project is completed.\n  This legislation will ensure that the ongoing expansion projects of \nsmaller airports across the country will continue in order to \naccommodate the growing demand for additional airfield and terminal \ncapacity at these airports.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Nebraska (for himself, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. \n        Corzine):\n  S. 1405. A bill to extend the 50 percent compliance threshold used to \ndetermine whether a hospital or unit of a hospital is an inpatient \nrehabilitation facility and to establish the National Advisory Council \non Medical Rehabilitation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \n``Preserving Patient Access to Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospitals Act \nof 2005'' to make changes to a rule issued by the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services, (CMS) that would threaten the ability of \nrehabilitation hospitals to continue to provide critical care.\n\n[[Page S8319]]\n\n  In my home State of Nebraska, Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital in \nLincoln is a nationally-recognized premier rehabilitation facility that \noffers specialized programs and services for those who have suffered \nbrain injuries, strokes, spinal cord injuries, and other rehabilitating \ninjuries. If this rule is not updated, Madonna would not be able to \noffer the same critical care to its patients as it currently does.\n  When CMS first looked at whether facilities would qualify as an \ninpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF), a list of criteria was created \nto determine eligibility. The criteria, generally referred to as the \n``75 Percent Rule,'' were first established in 1984. Initially ten \ncategories were given. When the Rule was revised last year, three \ncategories were added. To qualify as an IRF under the 75 Percent Rule, \n75 percent of a facility's patients must be receiving treatment in one \nof these specified conditions.\n  On its face, it appeared that CMS expanded the Rule last year by \nincreasing the number of conditions from 10 to 13 and giving facilities \na phase-in period to adjust to the changes. Initially the threshold for \ncompliance was set at 50 percent for the first year and continues to \nrise until it reaches 75 percent in July 2007.\n  Facilities are struggling to even meet the 50 percent compliance rate \nin part because the expansion of categories is illusory. The rule will, \nby CMS' own estimate, shift thousands of patients--both Medicare and \nnon-Medicare--into alternative care settings that may be inappropriate. \nCMS projected a patient loss of 1,170 admissions in FY 2005. A recent \nMoran Company report showed that in the first year alone, hospitals \nhave been forced to deny care to between 25,000-40,000 patients to \nmaintain compliance with the new 75 Percent Rule. By the fourth year of \nthe Rule, IRFs will be forced to turn away one out of every three \npatients in order to operate as a rehabilitation hospital or unit.\n  My legislation will ensure that patients across America will continue \nto have access to the rehabilitative care they need, and that experts \nin this community are organized to advise and make recommendations to \nCongress and the appropriate Federal agencies based on the realities \nand challenges facing the rehabilitative field today and in the future. \nThe legislation provides an additional two years at the 50 percent \nthreshold to give facilities additional time to adjust to the new \ncategories and sets up a commission to advise Federal agencies on \nrehabilitative care and what categories are appropriate to be included \nin the 75 Percent Rule.\n  I am pleased that many prestigious organizations have joined me in \nsupporting the legislation. The American Hospital Association, the \nAmerican Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, the \nFederation of American Hospitals, the American Medical Rehabilitation \nProviders Association and numerous other associations and advocacy \ngroups have endorsed the legislation. Just as I have heard from \npatients and medical providers who have experienced problems with this \nRule, the members of these associations are also witnessing the \ndevastating effect the Rule is having on those who need this critical \ncare. In addition, Senator Santorum is co-sponsoring this bipartisan \neffort.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I look forward \nto its passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1405\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect American workers and responders by \nensuring the continued commercial availability of respirators and to \nestablish rules governing product liability actions against \nmanufacturers and sellers of respirators; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Respirator \nAccess Assurance Act of 2005.'' This legislation is not a complex or \nlengthy proposal, but it is critically important for our men and women \nin uniform, our first responders, and the American public as we \ncontinue to wage the war on terror. It is designed to protect the \ncompanies that manufacture respirators from abusive litigation--the \nvery respirators that we need for protection against life-threatening \nenvironmental hazards and contaminates.\n  Even as we continue today to debate important appropriations \nlegislation for the Department of Homeland Security, the many American \nmanufacturers and sellers of one of the types of equipment necessary in \nthe war on terror and for our first responders generally--respirators--\nare being forced by misdirected litigation to decide whether to abandon \nthat market.\n  Since the year 2000, American respirator manufacturers have \nexperienced an avalanche of mass lawsuits in which thousands of \nplaintiffs claim they suffered lung damage from respirators because of \ndefective designs and/or failure to provide adequate warnings. Between \n2000 and 2004, well over 300,000 individual claims have been filed \nagainst major respirator manufacturers. Many of these people show no \nsymptoms of illness.\n  Respirator manufacturers are included among dozens of defendants in \nthese lawsuits, despite some very important facts. First, respirators \ndon't cause lung disease--employers are legally responsible for \nproviding the right respirator to an employee for the environment in \nwhich the employee will be working. Respirator manufacturers have no \nrole in that decision. Second, respirators are 100 percent regulated by \nthe U.S. Government. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and \nHealth, or NIOSH, sets the design standards for respirators, tests \nevery product in its own labs, approves all warning labels, and \nmonitors the manufacturing process to be sure respirators meet the \nstandards for which they were designed.\n  Perhaps most troubling is the extent to which these claims track very \nclosely with the recent explosion of asbestos and silicosis claims. \nRecently, a number of ethical questions surrounding many of these \nclaims have come to light.\n  In my home State of Texas, a Federal court in Corpus Christi under \nthe watch of Judge Janis Graham Jack, has been trying to sort out a few \nthousand of these cases. That Multi-District Litigation has turned up \nevidence of fraud--in Judge Jack's words--``great red flags of fraud,'' \nand highlights attempts by some to recycle plaintiffs who have already \nrecovered in asbestos litigation by claiming they also have silicosis, \nwhich is a virtual medical impossibility.\n  Just today, the Wall Street Journal ran an editorial highlighting \nthis ``tort scam.'' As it points out, ``Judge Jack not only blasted \nnearly everyone of the 10,000 silicosis claims in front of her court, \nshe documented the fraudulent means by which lawyers, doctors, and \nscreening companies had manufactured the claims.'' She said, ``These \ndiagnoses were about litigation rather than health care . . . these \ndiagnoses were manufactured for money.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 14, 2005]\n\n                         The Silicosis Sheriff\n\n       If the criminal investigation of class-action titan Milberg \n     Weiss is anything to go by, prosecutors may finally be \n     starting to hold the trial bar accountable for its legal \n     abuses. Another good sign is that a separate federal grand \n     jury, this one in New York, is investigating the ringleaders \n     of the latest tort scam, silicosis.\n       Much of the credit for pointing the grand jury toward this \n     corruption goes to Texas federal Judge Janis Graham Jack, who \n     last month put the brakes on the silicosis machine with an \n     extraordinary 249-page decision. Judge Jack not only blasted \n     nearly every one of the 10,000 silicosis claims in front of \n     her court, she documented the fraudulent means by which \n     lawyers, doctors and screening companies had manufactured the \n     claims. ``These diagnoses were about litigation rather than \n     health care,'' wrote Judge Jack. ``These diagnoses were \n     manufactured for money.''\n       Perfectly said, and we only wish the fearless, judge had \n     been around to render a similar verdict back when the \n     asbestos blob got rolling. It was that juggernaut, largely \n     blessed by the courts, that first allowed trial lawyers to \n     co-opt doctors to create millions of phony claims and extort \n     billions out of corporate defendants. Encouraged by this \n     success, the trial bar revved up the same machinery for \n     silicosis, an occupational lung disease that can be fatal but \n     has been in decline for decades.\n       It was the fact of this decline that got Judge Jack's \n     attention. A former nurse, she couldn't understand how a \n     disease that causes on average fewer than 200 deaths annually \n     in the U.S. had suddenly resulted in more than 20,000 claims \n     from Mississippi and surrounding states. To get to the bottom \n     of the suits against some 250 companies, the Clinton \n     appointee held 20 months of pretrial proceedings. What she \n     found was a gigantic attempted swindle.\n       Her first discovery was that, of the more than 9,000 \n     plaintiffs who supplied more information about their \n     ``disease,'' 99% had been diagnosed with silicosis by the \n     same nine doctors. These physicians had been retained by law \n     firms or by ``screening companies'' that do mass X-rays on \n     behalf of law firms searching for plaintiffs. When these \n     physicians were deposed, they all but admitted they took \n     their orders from the lawyers and screening firms.\n       Which explains why none of them took a medical history, \n     while others never even saw their patients. One doctor signed \n     blank forms for the screening company and let his secretary \n     fill out the diagnoses. Yet another performed 1,239 \n     diagnostic evaluations in 72 hours--less than four minutes \n     apiece. Dr. George Martindale, who diagnosed 3,617 patients \n     with silicosis, admitted that he didn't even know the \n     criteria for diagnosing the disease and had simply included \n     in each of his reports a paragraph provided by the screening \n     company.\n       Another shocker was that more than 65% of the silica \n     plaintiffs had previously been plaintiffs in an asbestos \n     suit, even though it is close to clinically impossible to \n     have both asbestosis and silicosis. Digging deeper, the judge \n     found that many of the same doctors had ginned up the same \n     patients for both asbestos and silicosis cases. One doctor, \n     Ray Harron, received nearly $5 million from 1996-2004 from a \n     leading screening company, N, and has supplied thousands of \n     silicosis diagnoses, and at least 52,000 asbestos-related \n     diagnoses.\n       Representatives from N admitted in court that they had no \n     medical training and that their company has never had a \n     medical director. They confirmed that law firms often set the \n     criteria for the silicosis screening process, and that the \n     screening companies were paid by the volume of people who \n     ultimately joined a lawsuit. As N owner Heath Mason \n     testified, his business depended on doing ``large numbers.''\n       Judge Jack reserved her most severe criticism for the \n     lawyers, noting that statistics alone should have shown that \n     their case defied ``all medical knowledge and logic,'' and \n     that by bringing it regardless they had exhibited a \n     ``reckless disregard of the duty owed to the court.'' She \n     required the Houston firm of O'Quinn, Laminack & Pirtle to \n     pay the defendants' $825,000 in legal fees, and ordered \n     sanctions. She also made clear she was on to the tort bar's \n     tactics, noting that the ``clear motivation'' was ``to \n     inflate the\n\n[[Page S8321]]\n\n     number of plaintiffs and overwhelm the defendants and the \n     judicial system.''\n       Judge Jack did not shy away from the word ``fraud'' in her \n     courtroom, and clearly someone at the Justice Department has \n     been paying attention. A Manhattan grand jury is now \n     investigating at least one of the screening companies, and \n     subpoenas have gone out to at least two of the doctors \n     involved.\n       Which shows how large a public service Judge Jack has \n     performed. She could easily have followed other judges and \n     accepted these mass claims at face value. Instead, she dug \n     into the individual claims and found the corruption \n     underneath. In doing so, she has not only stalled the entire \n     silicosis scam, she's opened the door to probing millions of \n     asbestos claims that have come before. The lawyers could \n     attempt to retry their dismissed claims in state court, \n     though amid a grand jury probe they might prefer that this \n     whole issue go away.\n       Over the years, too many judges have allowed tort lawyers \n     to hijack their courtrooms to perpetrate legal fraud. Judge \n     Jack is showing what good comes when judges truly care about \n     justice.\n\n  This level of fraud must be brought to the attention of the American \npeople. The extent to which this type of behavior is the norm rather \nthan the exception is troubling, to say the least. And the breadth of \nthis abuse extends so far now that it endangers the manufacturing of \nmasks for the American people--and people through the world for that \nmatter--who need to protect themselves from airborne contaminants. \nThousands of lawsuits have been directed toward these manufacturers--\nlargely indiscriminately.\n  Many of these cases might someday be dismissed or settled for a few \nhundred dollars to avoid protracted litigation, but the costs of \ngetting to that point are enormous. Respirator companies have already \nincurred millions of dollars in litigation and settlement costs, and \neven after years of arguing in multiple State and local courts they \nstill face hundreds of thousands of individual claims. The costs of \nthis litigation burden are both unjustified and destructive.\n  Most of the net income these companies receive from respirator sales \nis being eaten up in litigation costs. Some respirator companies have \nalready decided it is not worth it and have stopped selling in the \ncommercial market, and others are contemplating the same thing. If U.S. \nmanufacturers drop out of the market, those who need respirators will \nhave to use imports, which may be of lower quality and less reliable, \nor use nothing at all. In either case we are letting this unfounded \nlitigation burden pose additional risk to millions of Americans who \nneed these devices to do their jobs and protect themselves, and all of \nus, from untold harm.\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation today. The Act provides \nrespirator manufacturers with protection from the legal costs \nassociated with defending claims for which the manufacturers should \nbear no liability. It provides that a respirator manufacturer may not \nbe subject to any claim for defective design or warning relating to a \nrespirator or any claim based on such an allegation if the respirator \nhas received NIOSH approval, and the respirator complied with the \nNIOSH-approved design and labeling in effect on the date of \nmanufacture. This protection would continue notwithstanding a \nsubsequent action by NIOSH to modify, supercede, or withdraw the \napproval. In addition, we have taken extra measures to clarify that \nthere are exceptions in the Act that would permit liability to be \nimposed if the initial approval was obtained through fraud, \nmisrepresentation, or bribery.\n  This is a simple bill that will not cost the government a penny, will \nnot deprive any deserving plaintiff of the right to sue those who may \nhave caused him or her harm, and will assure that this vital industry \ncontinues to be an American industry for a long time to come.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this proposal \nforward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nHouston Chronicle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Houston Chronicle, July 1, 2005]\n\n         Federal Judge Throws Out Thousands of Silica Diagnoses\n\n       Corpus Christi.--A federal judge has recommended throwing \n     out all but one of about 10,000 diagnoses of the lung ailment \n     silicosis that were used in lawsuits against industrial \n     companies, ruling that doctors ``manufactured'' findings of \n     the disease in hundreds of cases.\n       U.S. District Judge Janis Graham Jack's scathing 249-page \n     opinion, signed Thursday, finds that the diagnoses are \n     inadmissible in court. The bulk of the cases originate in \n     Mississippi, and Jack sent them back to the state courts \n     along with her report. She threw out the approximately 100 \n     Texas cases that she felt she had jurisdiction over.\n       Jack's ruling also orders sanctions against Houston law \n     firm O'Quinn, Laminack & Pirtle, which brought roughly 2,000 \n     of the suits. Lawyers from the firm did not immediately \n     return a call for comment today.\n       A doctor testifying before Jack in December withdrew \n     thousands of his diagnoses, saying he only briefly scanned X-\n     rays to give what he thought was a second opinion on the \n     degenerative diseases caused by inhaling quartz dust.\n       His withdrawal, made during consolidated pretrial \n     proceedings for lawsuits from several states, prompted Jack \n     to order every doctor and ``screening company'' to back up \n     the diagnoses in the lawsuits. More doctors withdrew their \n     diagnoses, and after hearings in February Jack said she \n     sensed ``red flags of fraud'' in the way plaintiffs were \n     recruited. ``These diagnoses were driven by neither health \n     nor justice,'' Jack wrote in her opinion Thursday. ``They \n     were manufactured for money.''\n       Danny Mulholland, a Mississippi-based defense attorney for \n     Ingersoll-Rand Co. and other companies, said the opinion was \n     ``historic'' in an age where law firms recruit plaintiffs \n     with billboards and television ads.\n       ``I think the way litigation has been done, and \n     particularly mass tort litigation, changed with the February \n     hearings which culminated in this order,'' he said. ``We'll \n     have to go back in state court and win there, but we expect \n     to, based on what Judge Jack has found.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1407.

This bill will provide grants for \nState and local governments to purchase the technology they need to \nenhance monitoring of sexual predators.\n  This bill and the grants it provides are named after two young girls \nfrom Florida, Jessica Lunsford and Sarah Lunde, who were both murdered \nby convicted sex offenders. As the Lunsford and Lunde families mourned \nthese two beautiful girls, the Nation grieved with them. We are all \nunited in our desire to make sure that everything can be done to \nprevent this from ever happening again. I hope this bill will serve as \na living memorial to Jessica Lunsford and Sarah Lunde, and serve as \nsome comfort to their families, as the grants in their names provided \nin this bill will allow law enforcement to help prevent other families \nfrom suffering similar tragedies.\n  Jessica Lunsford of Homosassa, FL, was a nine-year-old girl abducted \nfrom her home, raped, and then buried alive by a convicted sex offender \nwho lived 150 feet from her home. Law enforcement had lost track of her \nconfessed murderer and did not know that he worked at the nearby school \nthat Jessica attended, despite his being a registered sex offender. A \nfew weeks following the news of this tragedy, 13-year-old Sarah Lunde \nof Ruskin, FL, was murdered by her mother's ex-boyfriend. He is also a \nconvicted sex offender.\n  The Jessica Lunsford and Sarah Lunde grants provided for in this bill \nwill allow States and local government to purchase electronic \nmonitoring systems, like global positioning systems, that will provide \nlaw enforcement with real time information on the whereabouts of sex \noffenders released from prison to within 10 feet of their location. Law \nenforcement will be able to restrict the movements of sex offenders by \nprogramming these systems to alert authorities if a sex offender goes \nto a park, amusement park, elementary school or other areas determined \nto be off-limits. The ankle-bracelets used to monitor their movement \nare tamper proof and will alert law enforcement in the event that an \noffender has removed it so law enforcement can immediately act to \napprehend the offender.\n  In the United States there are an estimated 380,000 registered sex \noffenders, although thousands have disappeared, according to \nauthorities. We have over\n\n[[Page S8322]]\n\n30,000 of these sex offenders in the State of Florida. In response to \nthe recent tragedies in Florida, Idaho, and North Dakota, several \nStates have enacted stronger laws to protect our children from sex \npredators. In Florida, for example, the legislature passed a law that \nwill provide tougher sentences for child sex offenders, and aid law \nenforcement in effectively monitoring those sex offenders. This law \nwill require sex offenders, released back into our communities, to wear \na bracelet that will have a global positioning system track them.\n  I applaud the initiative by Florida, and other States seeking to pass \nsimilar laws, and I believe that it is important that there is an \nappropriate Federal response that will be supportive of the States and \nlocal governments that are addressing this problem. To be effective, \ntough laws on these sexual predators of children must be properly \nfunded, and I believe these tough laws being passed by state \nlegislatures are worth properly funding when they will protect our \nchildren.\n  The Jessica Lunsford and Sarah Lunde Act will support State and local \ngovernments that, like Florida, are attempting to protect their \nchildren by providing greater monitoring tools for law enforcement. \nThis bill will provide a total of $30 million in grants to States to \nhelp implement State laws to get tougher on sex offenders released back \ninto their communities with electronic monitoring technology. The bill \nwill provide for $10 million in grants for fiscal years 2006 through \n2008. The bill then directs the Attorney General to provide a report to \nCongress assessing the effectiveness of the program and making \nrecommendations as to future funding levels.\n  There are no silver bullets to stop sexual predators from preying on \nour children, but I believe that tough laws, such as the new Florida \nstatute, are going to go a long way in preventing sex offenders from \nre-offending.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1407\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to strengthen data protection and safeguards, require \ndata breach notification, and further prevent identity theft; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Bill Nelson, \nStevens, Inouye, McCain, and Pryor to introduce the Identity Theft \nProtection Act of 2005. The introduction of this bill has been a \nbipartisan effort and I thank my colleagues on the Senate Commerce \nCommittee for helping to negotiate a fair and balanced bill.\n  Identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes in America. It is \nestimated that over 10 million Americans are victims of some form of \nidentity theft each year. The total cost of this crime approaches $50 \nbillion per year, with the average loss from the misuse of a victim's \npersonal information being almost $5,000. In 2004 alone, consumers who \nwere victims of ID theft spent a total of 297 million hours resolving \nproblems that arose from the crime.\n  Every year, the FTC compiles a list of the top 10 categories of \nfraud-related complaints. Identity theft has topped that list of \ncomplaints each of the past 5 years. My own State of Oregon ranks ninth \nin the Nation for fraud complaints and identity theft.\n  Data breaches are becoming an increasingly common type of identity \ntheft that affects millions of consumers nationwide. Last year, there \nwere at least 43 known incidents of security breaches, potentially \naffecting over 9 million individuals. These breaches range from sloppy \nrecord keeping and security procedures by companies to extremely \nsophisticated online thefts by computer hackers.\n  Our bipartisan bill ensures that businesses and organizations have \nthe proper security procedures in place to safeguard consumers' \nsensitive and personal information. This legislation requires any \nentity that acquires, maintains or utilizes sensitive personal \ninformation to have a security program to safeguard such data. \nFurthermore, we require these entities to verify the credentials of \nthird parties seeking personal and sensitive information and require \nstrict disposal and transfer procedures for such information.\n  It is imperative that consumers be notified of any potential breach \nin the security of their personal information. The cost of an incident \nof identity theft, both in terms of out-of-pocket expense and time \nspent resolving problems, is significantly smaller if the misuse of the \nvictim's personal information is discovered quickly.\n  Our bill requires consumer notification if a data breach results in a \nsignificant risk of identity theft. Individuals will be notified \nimmediately when any significant breach has occurred. Any breach \naffecting a minimum of 1,000 individuals also requires the entity to \nreport the breach to the FTC and all the consumer reporting agencies.\n  We realize that an individual's Social Security Number deserves the \nutmost security and protection against fraud, manipulation, and theft. \nTo that end, this bill restricts the collection of and access to Social \nSecurity Numbers by limiting the solicitation of Social Security \nNumbers and prohibiting their display on employee and student \nidentification cards.\n  In addition, our bill will allow consumers to place, lift, and \ntemporarily remove a security freeze on their credit, which would \nprevent credit from being extended to third parties without \nauthorization from the consumer. We would also pre-empt state law to \ncreate uniformity and compliance by businesses and organizations.\n  Protecting sensitive information is an issue of great importance for \nall Americans so we are requiring the FTC to establish an Information \nWorking Group comprised of industry participants, consumer groups, and \nother interested parties to develop best practices to protect sensitive \npersonal information.\n  Consumers should have confidence when they share their information \nwith others that their information will be protected. At the same time, \nthe ability of legitimate companies to access personal information \nfacilitates commerce and continues to have important benefits to \nconsumers.\n  We believe our legislation strikes the appropriate balance between \nensuring\n\n[[Page S8323]]\n\nthe continued existence of these critical services and guaranteeing the \nsecurity of consumer's personal information. I urge my colleagues to \nco-sponsor this important legislation to protect consumers from future \nbreaches of identity theft.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1408\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In promulgating those regulations, the Commission \n     shall take into consideration the types of sensitive personal \n     information involved, the nature and scope of the security \n     breach, other appropriate factors, and the most effective \n     means of notifying affected individuals.\n       (d) Timing of Notification.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n     notice required by subsection (a) shall be given--\n       (A) in the most expedient manner practicable;\n       (B) without unreasonable delay, but not later than 90 days \n     after the date on which the breach of security was discovered \n     by the covered entity; and\n       (C) in a manner that is consistent with any measures \n     necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore \n     the security and integrity of the data system.\n       (2) Law enforcement and homeland security related delays.--\n     Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the giving of notice as \n     required by that paragraph may be delayed for a reasonable \n     period of time if--\n       (A) a Federal law enforcement agency determines that the \n     timely giving of notice under subsections (a) and (b), as \n     required by paragraph (1), would materially impede a civil or \n     criminal investigation; or\n       (B) a Federal national security or homeland security agency \n     determines that such timely giving of notice would threaten \n     national or homeland security.\n\n     SEC. 4. SECURITY FREEZE.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Emplacement.--A consumer may place a security freeze on \n     his or her credit report by making a request to a consumer \n     credit reporting agency in writing or by telephone.\n       (2) Consumer disclosure.--If a consumer requests a security \n     freeze, the consumer credit reporting agency shall disclose \n     to the consumer the process of placing and removing the \n     security freeze and explain to the consumer the potential \n     consequences of the security freeze.\n       (b) Effect of Security Freeze.--\n       (1) Release of information blocked.--If a security freeze \n     is in place on a consumer's credit report, a consumer \n     reporting agency may not release information from the credit \n     report to a third party without prior express authorization \n     from the consumer.\n       (2) Information provided to third parties.--Paragraph (2) \n     does not prevent a consumer credit reporting agency from \n     advising a third party that a security freeze is in effect \n     with respect to the consumer's credit report. If a third \n     party, in connection with an application for credit, requests \n     access to a consumer credit report on which a security freeze \n     is in place, the third party may treat the application as \n     incomplete.\n       (c) Removal; Temporary Suspension.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (4), a \n     security freeze shall remain in place until the consumer \n     requests that the security freeze be removed.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Inouye, \nSmith, McCain, Nelson, and Pryor in introducing a bipartisan bill to \naddress the growing perpetration of identity theft against American \nconsumers. The bipartisan bill, the ``Identity Theft Protection Act,'' \nis the product of two Commerce Committee hearings that featured \ntestimony from businesses that aggregate and sell consumer information \nas a commodity, and the full\n\n[[Page S8326]]\n\nFederal Trade Commission, FTC, which recommended much of what is \ncontained in this legislation.\n  The occurrence of identity theft in the United States has reached \nepidemic proportions. The incidence of this crime rose 15 percent in \n2002, and 80 percent in 2003. The FTC stated in February 2005 that each \nyear nearly 10 million Americans--or roughly 4.6 percent of the \ndomestic adult population--are victimized by identity thieves. The FTC \nindicates that physical and online identity theft accounted for 39 \npercent of the more than 635,000 consumer fraud complaints filed last \nyear with the agency. The costs associated with identity theft are \nenormous. In 2003, the FTC estimated that the losses to businesses and \nfinancial institutions due to identity theft totaled $48 billion, and \nthe out-of-pocket losses to consumers totaled $5 billion, which does \nnot take into account the average 300 hours spent by victims restoring \ntheir good names.\n  This year alone, there have been at least 43 reported information \nbreaches affecting potentially more than 9 million Americans. This \nstring of data theft has focused the attention of Congress, consumers, \nand privacy proponents. It has raised questions concerning the business \npractices of data brokers and whether consumers' personal information \nis adequately protected from identity thieves. The difficulty of \nfinding solutions to this and other types of identity theft is striking \na balance between ensuring adequate security of sensitive personal \ninformation while not inhibiting the legitimate free flow of \ninformation that is vital to the domestic economy and law enforcement.\n  The bill that we introduce today will not end all identity theft. No \nlegislation can accomplish that objective. But this bill would require \nbolstered information safeguards and ensure notification of consumers \nwhose sensitive personal information has been acquired without \nauthorization. More specifically, the bill, among other things, would \ndirect the FTC to develop rules that would require all covered entities \nthat handle sensitive personal information to develop, implement, and \nmaintain appropriate safeguards to protect such information, and \nprovide effective notice to consumers in the event of a breach. The \nbill would limit the solicitation of Social Security numbers by covered \nentities, and restrict employers, State agencies, or educational \ninstitutions from displaying social security numbers on identification \ntags for employees and students, and for drivers licenses. The bill \nalso would allow consumers to freeze their credit for a reasonable fee \nto protect themselves from identity theft, and preempt similar State or \nlocal law in an effort to provide a uniform Federal standard rather \nthan a patchwork of widely varying State or local laws.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on legislation that will \nmitigate to the greatest extent possible the occurrence of identity \ntheft in this country, but without inhibiting an information sharing \nsystem that yields extraordinary benefits to every American.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1409. A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of \n1996 to modify the grant program to improve sanitation in rural and \nNative villages in the State of Alaska; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nallow the Environmental Protection Agency to continue to provide grant \nfunding and technical assistance to small, rural communities in Alaska \nfor critical water and sewer projects. These rural communities are only \naccessible by either aircraft or boat.\n  This important funding was originally authorized as part of the Safe \nDrinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 and was reauthorized in 2000. The \nauthorization for this program expires at the end of fiscal year 2005. \nEvery fiscal year, the EPA transfers funding authorized by this program \nto the State of Alaska's Village Safe Water Program, which is managed \nby the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.\n  The water and sewer conditions in the villages in Alaska that still \nneed this critical funding rival the conditions in rural communities in \nthird world countries. For example, residents in some villages in \nAlaska have to go to a central source in the community to get fresh \nwater. This source is usually a well. Instead of flushing toilets, \nresidents have to use a device called a ``honeybucket.'' This device is \na large bucket with a toilet seat on top. When the honeybucket is full, \nit is usually dumped in a lagoon or on land. Sometimes, these dump \nlocations are near sources of drinking water.\n  The Village Safe Water program has been a success over the years. \nMany homes in Alaska's rural communities now have plumbing due to funds \nauthorized by this program. However, thirty-three percent of homes in \nthese communities still do not have in-house plumbing. It is \nunacceptable that the residents of these communities still do not have \naccess to conventional plumbing in their homes in 2005.\n  Earlier this year, the Office of Management and Budget published a \nProgram Assessment Rating Tool report concerning this program. This \nreport found several deficiencies concerning the administration of this \nprogram. However, I have been assured that the EPA and the Alaska \nDepartment of Environmental Conservation are working closely together \nto correct these deficiencies.\n  It is imperative that we reauthorize this critically important \nprogram before the end of this fiscal year. The health and well-being \nof rural Alaskans is at stake.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1409\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
