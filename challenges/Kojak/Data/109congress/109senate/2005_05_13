Mr. President, today we return to the consideration of the \nhighway bill. Yesterday, cloture was invoked by a vote of 92 to 7. We \nwere then able to reach an agreement for finishing the bill on Tuesday. \nUnder that agreement, Senators may offer amendments today from the \nlimited list agreed to last night. Chairman Inhofe is here and may also \nhave some cleared amendments to dispose of this morning.\n  I announced last night that no rollcall votes would occur today. The \nnext rollcall vote will be Monday at approximately 5:30. On Monday, we \nwill again resume debate on the highway bill. Senators will have the \nfinal opportunity to offer their amendments. We will vote on one or two \nof those amendments on Monday evening. That will allow the Senate to \nreturn to the measure Tuesday morning and vote on the remaining \namendments and final passage.\n  After consulting with the chairman of the committee and the Democrat \nleader, we are hopeful most of these amendments will not require votes, \nthat only a few remaining amendments will need rollcall votes prior to \npassage.\n  As I did last night, I commend the managers for their hard work. I \nlook forward to finishing the bill early next week. We have spent 2 \nweeks on this bill and given plenty of opportunity, plenty of time for \nMembers to come forward. They have done so. We are on a final glidepath \nto completion of this very important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/13/senate-section/article/S5187-8", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5187-S5188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PEACE OFFICERS' MEMORIAL SERVICE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this Sunday marks the 24th anniversary of \nPeace Officers' Memorial Day. Each year, tens of thousands of law \nenforcement officers from around the country\n\n[[Page S5188]]\n\ngather in the Nation's Capital to honor their comrades lost in the line \nof duty. They are accompanied by wives, husbands, sons, and daughters, \nalong with families of the fallen.\n  It is a solemn occasion. It is a sacred occasion. It reminds us of \nthe tremendous sacrifices our police officers make to keep us safe. \nEvery day around the clock they are on the front lines defending our \nneighborhoods and protecting our lives, our homes, protecting our \nfreedoms.\n  When we need an officer to investigate a dark alley, quell a domestic \ndispute, to chase an armed suspect, or subdue a criminal, we call these \ndedicated professionals to save us from harm. And each and every time \nthey take a risk that our distress call could be their last.\n  I share very briefly a few stories of our proud heroes from Tennessee \nwho, last year, gave the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Officer Jason Michael Scott of Loudoun County was shot and died on \nMarch 12, 2004, after responding to a family dispute. The station got a \ncall that a teenager was attacking his mother. Officer Scott was sent \nto the scene. As Officer Scott climbed out of his patrol car to walk up \nto the house, he was shot four times with a high-powered rifle. The 16-\nyear-old shooter then barricaded himself inside the home and exchanged \ngunfire with responding officers. The gunfight raged on for more than \n20 hours before the disturbed young man committed suicide. Officer \nScott was only 24 years old. His first child, Jayden Nicole, was born \n11 days after his death. Our prayers are with the Scott family.\n  Even routine calls can lead to unexpected tragedy. Officer Christy Jo \nDedman of Nashville was helping a motorist on the side of Interstate \n40, not too far from my home, when a tractor trailer hit and killed \nher. In the flash of an instant, in one random moment, her life was \ntaken.\n  At the funeral of Officer Mark Vance in Bristol, TN, an officer \nremarked:\n\n       You always know when you go out that you are taking a risk \n     but you do not think it is going to happen.\n\n  Officer Vance was only 30 years old when he was shot and killed on a \ndomestic violence call. Our prayers are with each and every member of \nhis family.\n  Tonight, the National Law Enforcement Officers' Memorial will hold a \ncandlelight vigil to honor Officer Vance along with his fellow \ncolleagues killed in the line of duty. Over 20,000 people are expected \nto attend the ceremony tonight. The names of the 153 heroes will be \nread, as will the names of 262 other fallen officers from years past.\n  On Sunday, a memorial service will be held on the West Front of the \nCapitol. The President will be on hand to honor these heroes. I look \nforward to paying my respects to each of these courageous men and \nwomen.\n  I will take a moment now to single out Tennessee's own who are \nincluded on this solemn roster: Sergeant Andy Thaddeus Bailey of \nJackson; Officer Christy Jo Dedman of Nashville; Patrolman Timothy \nHoward Dunn of Shelby County; Patrolman J. Matthew Rittenhouse of \nHarriman; Deputy Sheriff Jason Michael Scott of Lenoir City; Patrolman \nMarlon Allen Titus of Memphis; and finally, Mark Edward Vance of \nBristol.\n  Our hearts go out to their families, friends, and colleagues who were \nmade safer by their service. We all suffer their tragic loss. In their \nhonor I pledge to keep working hard to show our commitment in the \nSenate.\n  Last year, I cosponsored the Law Enforcement Safety Act, which the \nPresident signed into law. This legislation had been the No. 1 priority \nfor our Nation's law enforcement community for years. Finally, last \nyear, Congress passed it. It is now the law of the land.\n  The new law allows current and retired police officers to carry a \nconcealed weapon in any of the 50 States. America now has the added \nsecurity of tens of thousands of trained and certified law enforcement \nofficers serving and protecting us across the country and even into \nretirement.\n  There are more than 870,000 sworn law enforcement officers now \nserving communities across America, the highest number ever. I thank \neach and every one of them and their families for their selfless \ncourage, their sacrifice, and their dedication to public safety. Each \nof these officers is a hero. I honor them. Each of these officers has a \nfamily who deserves our appreciation and gratitude for their sacrifice. \nMay God bless our women and men in blue.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the bill before us today recognizes some \nof the challenges that face States and metropolitan planning agencies \nwhen developing plans for future highway projects.\n  We have included natural resource and environmental factors for \nStates and metropolitan planning agencies to consider when developing \ntheir transportation plans. They should consider protecting habitat, \nwater quality and agricultural and forest land while minimizing \ninvasive species.\n  While I am most familiar with aquatic invasive species such as the \nsea lamprey and the zebra mussel that are wreaking havoc on my beloved \nLake Champlain, nonnative species of vegetation have been degrading \npublic and private property, degrading habitat, crops, and pastures.\n  State transportation planning agencies can become active stewards in \nroadside management by phasing out the uses of nonnative vegetation and \nreestablishing native plants on our rights-of-way. In addition to \nconsidering invasive species during the planning process, this bill \nmakes funding available for the control of invasive plant species and \nestablishment of native species.\n  To help States and metropolitan planning agencies assess the. \nenvironmental impacts of proposed highway projects we suggest \nconsulting with other State and local agencies. Those responsible for \nland use management, natural resources, environmental protection, \nconservation and historic preservation should compare transportation \nplans with State conservation plans.\n  This would include inventories of natural or historic resources and \nconsideration of areas where wildlife crossing structures may be needed \nto ensure connectivity between wildlife habitat linkage areas.\n  This commonsense approach will assure that transportation planners \nwill consider the location of important habitat, wetlands and other \nnatural resources at the earliest stages of planning for new roads. \nThese provisions will make project delivery faster and more efficient.\n  Currently, transportation projects are often planned without detailed \ninformation on core conservation areas, sensitive resources or \nimportant habitat that might lie within the selected corridor. These \nconflicts do not come to light until the environmental review process, \nwhich then becomes more expensive and time- consuming as transportation \nand resource officials try to reconcile infrastructure and conservation \nactivities. These provisions will help transportation planners in \navoiding unnecessary impacts on wildlife habitat and in mitigating for \nunavoidable impacts of a project.\n  These provisions encourage States to utilize available wildlife \nhabitat data and maps to inform the long-range transportation planning \nprocess. Planners would be able to identify potential concerns at the \nearliest stage of planning, when options for minimizing impacts are \ngreatest and costs of doing so are lowest.\n  Over 200 Americans die each year in wildlife-vehicle collisions, many \nmore are injure4 and more than 1 million animals are killed on our \nroadways every day.\n  State and Federal agencies spend considerable time and money both \nprotecting natural areas and building transportation infrastructure. \nUnfortunately, conservation and growth efforts often happen \nindependently and then come into conflict during the permitting and \nconstruction phases of a\n\n[[Page S5189]]\n\ntransportation project. These investments need to be coordinated. If \nconservation efforts are taken into account at the earliest stages of \ntransportation planning, both priorities can be realized, in less time \nand at less cost.\n  While none of us have a crystal ball that can show us what the future \nwill look like, through consultation, transportation planners can get a \npicture of the broader landscape and see what the consequences of a \nproposed project might be. In some instances, potential environmental \nand habitat impacts can be avoided.\n  The most significant threat to the biodiversity of this country is \nhabitat loss. However, thoughtful, forward-looking transportation \nplanning can go a long way towards reducing negative impacts and \nmitigating for unavoidable impacts. Over the next few decades, the \ndecisions we make regarding highways and the ensuing loss of habitat \nwill determine the fate of species and America's biodiversity. These \nprovisions are aimed at helping to preserve that biodiversity through \ncoordinated planning.\n  Another provision focuses on improving environmental stewardship in \ntransportation projects by expanding the current eligibility for \nenvironmental restoration and pollution abatement from only those \nprojects undergoing reconstruction, rehabilitation, resurfacing, or \nrestoration to any project, as well as establish eligibility for \ninvasive species control efforts.\n  Contributions to measures to control exotic and invasive plant \nspecies may precede, concur, or follow project construction if such \nmeasures are consistent with Federal law and State transportation \nplanning processes. Finally, this bill recognizes that despite the best \nplanning process, mitigation for impacts on habitat and natural \nresources from transportation projects may be necessary.\n  To help provide for needed mitigation, the bill allows the States to \nestablish habitat and wetlands mitigation funds for efforts related to \nmitigation activities. The fund would allow States to undertake larger \nmitigation efforts based on the total impacts of multiple projects \nrather than the smaller scale of a single project. These changes to the \nplanning process and increased consideration of environmental impacts \nwill improve future transportation projects while protecting the \nenvironment.\n  This highway bill is about more than money. It is about balancing the \nneeds of our Nation's transportation system with concerns about our \nnatural habitats. We have done our best to strike that balance in this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I would like to spend a few \nminutes discussing an important provision in the highway bill before \nus.\n  Section 4(f) of the highway bill provides important protections for \nhistoric sites, parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and waterfowl \nrefuges throughout the country. With the increasing demand for \ntransportation projects, it is important that we not lose sight of our \nnatural treasures. We need to balance the growing need for \ntransportation with responsible stewardship of our history and natural \nresources.\n  In my State of Vermont, we have a wealth of history and natural \nbeauty. To see the wildlife that populate the Missisquoi Wildlife \nRefuge or the covered bridges used by our forefathers--is to experience \na heritage that we all want preserved for future generations. Section \n4(f) has helped preserve these treasures.\n  The Revolutionary War site at Fort Vehemence on Route 7 in Pittsford, \nVT, was avoided as a result of 4(f). An excellent collection of \nhistoric metal truss bridges across the Connecticut River were \nrehabilitated, not replaced, as a result of 4(f). A road in the \nDanville Historic District was narrowed in order to keep the historic \ncharacteristics of the historic village because of 4(f).\n  While constructing a new highway in Vermont, we have discovered a \nsignificant archeological site containing artifacts from Native \nAmericans, providing us with a piece of history that until now was not \nknown. By documenting this site, we will expand our knowledge of \nVermont's Native Americans. Also, because of 4(f) protections. 4(f) is \namended in this legislation.\n  The objective of this amendment is to allow transportation projects \nand programs to move forward more quickly, while maintaining the \nprotections of 4(f). Those protections assure that there will be public \nnotice and opportunity for public review and comment on proposed ``de \nminimis'' determinations for transportation projects. And that affected \nagencies will concur in the decision of the Secretary of Transportation \nthat there will be no adverse impact on a historic site, recreation \narea, park, or wildlife or waterfowl refuge. The provision would \nrequire the Secretary of Transportation, when making a finding that a \ntransportation project or program will have a ``de minimis'' impact, to \nconsider all avoidance, minimization, mitigation, and enhancement \nmeasures that have been incorporated into the project.\n  This provision allows project sponsors to incorporate environmentally \nprotective measures into the project from the beginning, in order to \nsupport a finding of ``de minimis'' impact.\n  These mitigation measures must be carried out and be shown to have \nthe intended impact. If they are not having the intended impact, other \nmeasures must be used to ensure no adverse impact. This is an important \nstrengthening of the 4(f) program that will protect our heritage while \nplanning for needed transportation projects.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I thank the ranking member of our \ncommittee, Senator Jeffords, for the hard work he has done, as well as \nSenator Baucus and Senator Grassley, who have worked very hard and, of \ncourse, Senator Bond, who is chairman of the transportation \nsubcommittee of the committee I chair.\n  This has been 3 years in the making. What we are looking at right now \nis very significant. We are to the point now where we are down to a \nhandful of amendments that remain--probably the most significant bill \nthat would be passed this year. It appears that under the rules of \ncloture, we probably will have our vote on this and be able to take \namendments between 2 o'clock and 4 o'clock on Monday, and vote on some \namendments starting at 4 p.m. I hope we vote on quite a few. I think we \nwill end up with about six more total votes before this is done.\n  If we get some of those out of the way Monday night, by Tuesday, when \nwe go in, we will be able to finish and have final passage on this bill \nand send it to conference. We went through this exercise a year ago and \nwe were able to get it to conference. Unfortunately, we lacked one \nsignature of getting a conference report and getting it back here.\n\n[[Page S5190]]\n\nThis time that will not happen. People are aware of the fact it is \ncritical that we have a bill. We cannot operate on any more extensions.\n  Let me remind everyone there are two choices right now. We are \noperating under six extensions. When you have an extension, all you do \nis take the previous authorization and extend it. That means you don't \nget any of the good things we have done in putting this bill together. \nWe are operating on a bill that passed 7 years ago. We have done some \nthings that are far better for America and for every State represented \nif we pass the bill as opposed to an extension. If we pass a bill, we \nare going to be able to take care of donor States' rate of return. If \nwe don't pass a bill, we will not be able to do that. Last year's bill \nwould have brought every State from the 90.5-percent participation up \nto 95 percent. Since this is not funded at as high a level as it was \nlast year, it would only guarantee an ultimate return of 92 percent.\n  One of the biggest parts of this program--and we have been calling it \nSAFETEA because we have the SAFETEA core programs included. They came \nthrough the Commerce Committee. When you look at the deaths on the \nhighways and the problems we are having out there--in my State of \nOklahoma, we have had two deaths from bridge accidents, crumbling and \nfalling on people and cars down below. Without the bill, we won't be \nable to have those SAFETEA programs. It is a matter of life and death \nto have this bill, streamlining provisions in order for us to act \nquickly and get these roads built. That will not happen under an \nextension. We will have to pass the bill.\n  In this bill, we actually put together a national commission to \nexplore new ways of financing roads. When you look at our National \nHighway System, as Senator Jeffords and I have mentioned several times, \nit started in the 1960s, during the Eisenhower administration. It came \nto his attention that we had a problem when he was Major Eisenhower \nduring World War II and trying to move services and troops and \npersonnel and equipment across America. He realized the problems. When \nhe became President, he started the National Highway System. It is \nbuilt now--not maintained but built. We have been financing roads, \nbridges, and maintenance in the same way for almost 50 years now. We \nhave this national commission that will explore new ways to get private \nparticipation in funding and transfer most of this to the States, where \nit belongs. That is not going to happen if we are on an extension.\n  There is Routes to School Program. We have had young people die and \nthis addresses that. Again, if we don't pass the bill, we will not have \nthe Safe Routes to School provisions, and we are going to have to \noperate on an extension. That is not acceptable.\n  There are border programs. We have several border States and we need \nto address their special needs with the transportation as a result of \nNAFTA and other programs, coming from other countries through the \nUnited States. We have a border program to accommodate that. We are not \ngoing to have it if we don't have the bill passed, because there will \nbe an extension of a 7-year-old bill.\n  Lastly, is the firewall protection of the trust fund. I think \neveryone knows there is an irresistible propensity around Washington to \nspend other people's money, and when they see an opportunity to get a \npet project by taking something out of the trust fund, they do it. \nConsequently, we have a lot of policies that are passed here, whether \nit is using ethanol or fuel-efficient cars, these programs to encourage \nthem to do it, they get benefits and that comes out of the trust \nfund. That is a raid on the trust fund. This builds firewalls so that \ncannot happen. Without that, the raids will continue. That is why it is \nimportant we pass this bill. I know we are going to pass it. We have no \ndoubt about that. Last year, we passed it to conference 76 to 21. I \nanticipate we will have that same margin of victory when we send this \nbill to conference.\n\n  We have been appealing for people to bring amendments to the floor. \nWe are to the point now where people are working on the amendments, so \nthat is going to have to wait until Monday afternoon. Again, that will \nbe between 2 and 4 o'clock. I hope staff will be sure to advise their \nMembers that is the time we will want to consider these amendments. If \nthey want a vote on Monday, they better have their amendment down here, \ndiscussed, and debated between 2 and 4 o'clock.\n  The last point I want to mention is that somebody has received very \nunjust criticism. We have done a very good job--keep in mind we have \nbeen working on this 3 years now--we have done a very good job on the \nformula approach. What we want to do in our Senate bill is equitably \ndistribute money to States based on certain criteria to be considered.\n  For example, if you are a donor State, then there is a factor that \nadjusts the distribution that comes to the State. If you are a donee \nState, it is the same thing. If you are an owed State, it is the same \nthing. If you are a small State or a State with low population, such as \nMontana and Wyoming, that is a factor in this formula.\n  We have factors on the death rate. My State of Oklahoma has a higher-\nthan-average death rate on the highways on a per capita basis. It tells \nyou something. What it tells you is there is a problem. We are going to \nhave to correct the problem because people are dying.\n  The bottom line is, this is a life-or-death bill. So it is very \nimportant that we get this done. I appreciate the dedication of what we \nrefer to as the big four, the leaders of this legislation--the chairman \nof the committee, which is myself, Senator Bond, Senator Jeffords, and \nSenator Baucus. It has been a great team effort. It has been a \nbipartisan effort. There has not been one vote that has not been \nbipartisan. That is a change around here--people are working together. \nMaybe we will learn a lesson and this will expand to some of the other \nareas.\n  It is my understanding, unless someone else has something to say \nabout the bill--we have covered it pretty well now for the last 10, 12 \ndays--we are down to the short rows, and we are ready to move on to the \n2 hours on Monday and then, of course, final passage on Tuesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/13/senate-section/article/S5190-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, during World War II, Native Americans \nheard the call of their country and enlisted in the Armed Services in \nunprecedented numbers. Many of these brave men performed the role of \ncode talkers, using a code language derived from a variety of American \nIndian languages to ensure secure and rapid communication of \ninformation on the battlefield. Through three wars and five decades, \nenemy forces were never able to break the U.S. code language thanks to \nthe service and ingenuity of Native American code talkers. These \npatriots provided an invaluable service to the United States and our \nallies and deserve recognition for their bravery.\n  Until 1968, information related to the code talker's activities \nduring both World Wars remained classified by the Department of \nDefense. The postponement in learning about the essential role of \nNative American Code Talkers has resulted in delayed recognition of \nthese war heroes. The first step in recognizing these men came in 2000 \nwhen President Bush signed into law legislation authorizing Congress to \naward gold medals to the 29 Navajo code talkers as well as a silver \nmedal to each man who later qualified as a Navajo code talker. While \nthis legislation was a step in the right direction, it failed to \nrecognize a number of Native Americans who also served as code talkers \nbut were not members of the Navajo Nation.\n  During the first World War, Choctaw code talkers served with \ndistinction in France. By transmitting in their native tongue a variety \nof open voice messages relating to unit movements, U.S. forces \ncompletely surprised the enemy during battle. Following the success of \nthe Choctaw code talkers,\n\n[[Page S5191]]\n\nsoldiers from the Navajo, Sioux, Comanche and Meskwaki tribes, along \nwith members of 14 other tribes, served as code talkers in some of the \nmost dangerous operations in both theaters of World War II.\n  Today I introduce the Code Talkers Recognition Act to honor those who \nwere overlooked when medals were awarded to the Navajo code talkers in \n2001. This bill authorizes the presentation of commemorative medals on \nbehalf of Congress to Native Americans who served as code talkers \nduring any foreign conflict in which the United States was involved \nduring the 20th century. I ask my colleagues to help honor the heroic \ncontributions of these gentlemen by cosponsoring and passing this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/13/senate-section/article/S5191-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PASSING OF CONGRESSMAN PETER RODINO JR.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to acknowledge \nthe passing of Congressman Peter Rodino.\n  We have lost a great man, a great New Jerseyan, and a great American.\n  I had the most profound respect for Congressman Rodino's wisdom, \nfairness, honesty and sense of justice. He emerged a leader during one \nof the most difficult times in our Nation's history and he was more \nthan equal to the task.\n  Congressman Rodino was born in Newark, NJ. The son of Italian \nimmigrants, he rose to prominence from humble origins, working his way \nthrough law school and attending classes at night to earn his degree.\n  During World War II, he served his country with distinction, earning \na Bronze Star. He returned a captain after having been promoted in the \nfield.\n  Upon his return, he sought public office. He was elected to the House \nof Representatives in 1948 and would serve in the House for 40 years. \nAnd during those years, Congressman Rodino earned the respect of his \ncolleagues and the loyalty of his constituents. He sponsored the Civil \nRights Act of 1966 and authored its fair employment practices \namendment; he played an integral part in the drafting of numerous \npieces of civil rights legislation. We can also thank him for \nsponsoring the bill making Columbus Day a holiday.\n  Many, however, remember Congressman Rodino most for his role in \nWatergate as chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  During Watergate, a tumultuous period for our country, we needed a \ntouchstone for honesty, fairness, and bipartisanship. Congressman \nRodino was that touchtone. Tip O'Neill said of his fellow \nrepresentative: ``He's enhanced the stature of Congress when we were at \na low ebb.'' He earned the trust and respect of his fellow Democrats \nand Republicans.\n  He was a public servant in the truest sense of the phrase. We all can \nonly hope to serve as he would and to represent our constituents with \nequal honor and grace.\n  My heartfelt sympathies go out to his family and friends. We all \nmourn his passing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/13/senate-section/article/S5191-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/13/senate-section/article/S5191-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/13/senate-section/article/S5191-4", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-2133.

A bill to provide for local control for the siting of \nwindmills; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce, along \nwith the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, the Environmentally \nResponsible Wind Power Act of 2005.\n\n[[Page S5192]]\n\n  The legislation that Senator Warner and I offer provides for local \nauthorities to be notified and have a role in the approval of the \nsigning of tens of thousand of massive wind turbines that will be built \nin America under current policies. It also ensures that the Federal \nGovernment does not subsidize the building of these windmills, which \nare usually taller than a football field is long, within 20 miles of a \nmilitary base or a highly scenic location, such as a national park or \noffshore.\n  Senator Warner and I introduce our legislation today because next \nweek the Senate Energy Committee is scheduled to begin markup on one of \nthe most important pieces of legislation in this session, an energy \nbill. The Energy Committee's work, combined with the work of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, which the distinguished \noccupant of the chair chairs, and the Finance Committee should this \nyear produce a Clean Energy bill that will, over time, lower prices of \nnatural gas and oil and reduce our dependence on overseas oil. This \nwill be legislation for American blue-collar workers, for farmers, and \nfor homeowners. It is urgently needed.\n  Natural gas prices are the highest in the industrialized world. \nGasoline prices are at record levels. We cannot keep our jobs and our \nstandard of living if we do not put in place policies that will provide \nour country with new steps toward conservation and an adequate supply \nof low-cost, reliable, clean American produced energy. Senator Warner \nand I both intend to be in the middle of this discussion. He is a \nsenior member of the Environment and Public Works committee. I am \nchairman of the Energy Subcommittee.\n  I am grateful for, and I am greatly encouraged by, the leadership of \nthe Energy Committee chairman Senator Domenici, and the ranking \nDemocrat, Senator Bingaman, and the committee staff who have worked \nespecially hard to create a framework for a more aggressive bipartisan \npiece of legislation than we were able to produce last year.\n  One part of our energy debate will be about wind power, which is the \nsubject of the legislation that Senator Warner and I offer today. We \nare introducing this because several of our colleagues have proposed \nsomething called a renewable portfolio standard, or RPS, which would \nrequire power companies to produce 10 percent of all their electricity \nfrom renewable sources by 2025. These renewable sources are wind, \nhydro, solar, geothermal, and biomass. Today, these renewable sources \nproduce about 9 percent of U.S. electricity needs.\n  This RPS is not to be confused with the renewable fuel standard which \nis a different sort of requirement, one that gasoline contain a certain \npercentage of ethanol. That matter is the subject for the jurisdiction \nof another committee. A renewable fuel standard is entirely different \nfrom a renewable portfolio standard and may well be part of the final \nlegislation.\n  It is important for our colleagues to know that a renewable portfolio \nstandard, or RPS, is all about wind. There are limited opportunities to \nbuild new dams today in order to expand hydropower, and hydro produces \n7 of the 9 percent of renewable power that we have in America today. Of \nthe remaining 2 percent of our electricity that is produced by other \nrenewable sources, current subsidies are not enough to increase solar \npower by very much.\n  More research and development is needed to make biomass more \nefficient, and there is a limited amount of geothermal power that is \ndrawing power from water that is heated underground, which leaves wind \npower. Experts agree that the bottom line is that a requirement that \nelectric companies produce 10 percent of their electricity from \nrenewable energy, if it could be achieved at all, would mean about 70 \npercent of the increase would come from wind. In other words, we would \ngo from producing about 1 percent of America's electricity from wind to \nabout 7 or 8 percent.\n  Testimony before our Energy Committee and most other sources suggest \nthat to produce this much wind energy in the United States could \nrequire building more than 100,000 new massive wind turbines. We have \nless than 7,000 such windmills in the United States today, with the \nlargest number in Texas and California. Testimony before our committee \nalso indicated that even without the RPS, if Congress continues its \ngenerous subsidy for wind production for the next 10 years-- it will \nguarantee that we have these 100,000 windmills or more by the year \n2025. According to the Treasury Department, this wind subsidy, if \nrenewed each year for the next 5 years, would reimburse wind investors \nfor 25 percent of the cost of wind production and cost taxpayers $3.7 \nbillion over those 5 years.\n  I'm told that General Electric Wind, one of the largest manufacturers \nof wind turbines, has experienced a 500-percent growth in its wind \nbusiness this year due to the renewal of the wind production tax credit \nlast year.\n  I want to make sure my colleagues know that there are serious \nquestions about how much relying on wind power will raise the cost of \nelectricity, questions about whether there are better ways to spend \n$3.7 billion in support of clean energy, and questions about whether \nwind even produces the amount of energy that it is claimed to produce.\n  My studies suggest that at a time when America needs large amounts of \nlow-cost reliable power, wind produces puny amounts of high-cost \nunreliable power. We need lower prices. Wind power production raises \nprices. We will have an opportunity in our debates and further hearings \nto examine these questions.\n  The legislation Senator Warner and I offer today is about a different \nquestion: the siting or location of 100,000 of these massive machines. \nNow, the idea of windmills conjures up pleasant images in Tennessee \nand, I am sure, in Oklahoma, of Holland and tulips, images of rural \nAmerica with windmill blades turning slowly, pumping water at the farm \nwell.\n  My grandparents had such a windmill at their well pump. That was back \nbefore rural electrification. The windmills we are talking about today \nare not our grandmother's windmills. Each one of these windmills is \ntypically 100 yards tall, two stories taller than the Statue of \nLiberty, taller than a football field is long. These windmills are \nwider than a 747 jumbo jet. Their rotor blades turn at 100 miles per \nhour. These towers and their flashing red lights can be seen from more \nthan 25 miles away. Their noise can be heard for up to a half a mile \naway. It is a thumping and swishing sound. It has been described by \nresidents who are unhappy with the noise as sounding like a brick \nwrapped in a towel tumbling in a clothes dryer on a perpetual basis.\n  These windmills produce very little power since, of course, they only \noperate when the wind blows enough or when it does not blow too much. \nSo they are usually placed in large wind farms covering huge amounts of \nland.\n  This is an example of what they look like. In comparison, we often \nworry about offshore drilling for oil and gas. In fact, Senator Johnson \nand I have introduced legislation that would permit States to expand \nthe use of offshore oil and gas. Offshore oil and gas rigs can be \nplaced far out to sea, where nobody on shore can see them. Compare that \nwith the power produced by today's massive wind turbines. It would take \n46 square miles of these windmills spread across the landscape to equal \none oil or gas rig that one could not see.\n  As an example, the Congress ordered electric companies to build 10 \npercent of their power from renewable energy which, as we have said, \nhas to be mostly wind. If we renew the current subsidy each year, by \nthe year 2025 my State of Tennessee would have about 1,700 of these \nwindmills, which would cover land almost two times the size of the city \nof Knoxville, TN. If Virginia, Senator Warner's State, were to produce \n10 percent of its power from wind by 2025 and the subsidies continue, \nit would probably need more than 1,700 windmills. These windmills would \ntake up enough land to equal the land mass of three cities the size of \nRichmond, VA. In North Carolina, to supply 10 percent of the \nelectricity from wind, it would take almost the land mass of the \nResearch Triangle, the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area. According to \ntestimony before our committee, in Tennessee and Virginia these \nwindmills would work best and perhaps work only at all along the ridge \ntops.\n  So this is what things might be looking like. This is a picture of \nthe Grand Canyon in the West, but we can imagine what it might look \nlike in the East. If our present policies on wind are continued, we \ncould expect to see hundreds\n\n[[Page S5193]]\n\nof football-field sized towers as wide as jumbo jets with flashing red \nlights atop the Blue Ridges of Virginia, above the Shenandoah Valley, \nalong the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains, on top of Signal \nMountain, on top of Lookout Mountain and Roan Mountain in Tennessee, \nand down the Tennessee River gorge which the city of Chattanooga has \njust spent 25 years protecting, and now it calls itself the scenic \ncity.\n  I hope we decide there are better ways to provide clean energy than \nto spend $3.7 billion of taxpayer dollars over the next 5 years on \nwindmills. I hope we decide we need a real national energy policy \ninstead of a national windmill policy. I hope we decide there \nare better and cheaper ways to discuss carbon. At least there are some \nimportant questions we need to answer.\n\n  What will this number of windmills do to our tourism industry? Will \n10 million visitors who come a year to enjoy the Great Smoky Mountains \nreally want to come to see ridge tops with flashing red lights and 100-\nyard tall windmills? What happens to electric rates when the Federal \nsubsidy disappears in a few years? Who will take down these massive \nstructures if we decide we do not like them or if they do not work? Who \nis making the money on all of this, and why are some European countries \nwho pioneered wind farms now slowing down or even stopping their \nconstruction in some places?\n  Clearly, there are likely to be more sensible ways to provide clean \nenergy than spending $3.7 billion of taxpayer money over the next 5 \nyears to destroy the American landscape. For example, $3.7 billion \nwould provide enough money to give 185,000 Americans a $2,000 subsidy \nto buy a hybrid or a clean diesel vehicle, which would be about double \nthe number of hybrid cars expected to be sold in the United States \nduring this year. Hybrid cars burn about 60 percent of the amount of \ngasoline that conventional cars burn. Or $3.7 billion would provide \nenough money for loan guarantees to help launch a dozen new clean coal \ngasification plants and help transform the marketplace with new \ntechnology for clean American-produced energy that would lower natural \ngas prices and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. For $3.7 billion, \nwe could provide loan guarantees for at least half a dozen new \ntechnology nuclear powerplants and have a billion dollars left over for \nresearch and development on the recapture of carbon that might be \nproduced by coal plants or to encourage conservation prices.\n  Just by way of comparison, a nuclear powerplant such as the Tennessee \nValley Authority's Sequoayah nuclear plant would produce about the same \namount of energy as the windmills, which a renewable portfolio standard \nand the tax subsidy would build in Tennessee. The electricity would be \navailable even when the wind was not blowing. So while we are debating \nthe wisdom of wind policies over the next several weeks, these massive \nturbines are being built across America, 6,700 of them so far, 29 of \nthem in Tennessee.\n  The Tennessee Valley Authority recently announced it had signed a 20-\nyear contract with a group of investors from Chicago to build 18 huge \nwindmills atop a 3,300-foot ridge on Buffalo Mountain in east \nTennessee. So the purpose of our legislation being offered today is to \ngive citizens the opportunity to have some say in where these massive \nstructures are located in their communities and to make sure that the \nCongress does not subsidize the destruction of the American landscape \nnear our national parks or other highly scenic areas or build such tall \nstructures dangerously close to our military bases.\n  First, the bill ensures that local authorities are notified and have \na role in the approval of new windmills to be built in their areas of \njurisdiction. This means that at the same time a proposed windmill is \nfiled with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC would notify \nthe local authority with zoning jurisdiction. Under this bill, within \n120 days, local authorities may support or oppose the project. If they \nsupport it, the windmill may qualify for FERC marketbased rates--that \nmeans allowed to charge wholesale prices--and may be exempt from a \nseries of regulations that restrict the operations of public utilities. \nIf local authorities oppose the windmill, it may still go forward but \nsubject to regulations--we call them PUCHA--and unable to charge \nwholesale rates or issue a qualified rate schedule. If no action is \ntaken by the local authority, the FERC process would proceed as though \nthe authority were in support.\n  I believe it is crucial that local authorities have a chance to \nconsider the impact of such massive new structures before dozens or \nhundreds of them begin to be built in their communities. In many other \ninstances involving the location of facilities generating power, State \nand local governments have developed laws giving citizens an \nopportunity to comment or even stop the location of facilities they do \nnot want. Our legislation gives communities that do not have such laws \nthe chance to do just that, and then this legislation sunsets or \nexpires in 7 years.\n  The second thing our legislation would do is provide protection to \nhighly scenic areas and at military bases. I do not think we want to \nsee hundreds of windmills in the Grand Canyon or just outside the Grand \nCanyon or in the foothills of the Great Smokies or when we go to see \nthe Grand Tetons. There are plenty of places we do not want to see \nthat. This makes sure it does not happen. It does so by eliminating tax \nsubsidies for any windmills within 20 miles of a world heritage area, \nwhich includes many national parks, and within 20 miles of military \nbases or offshore.\n  Under the bill, placement of a windmill within 20 miles of such a \nsite shall also require the completion of an environmental impact \nstatement. Further, any windmill that is to be constructed within 20 \nmiles of a neighboring State's border may be vetoed by that neighboring \nState. In other words, if the neighboring State can see it and does not \nwant it, they can veto it.\n  I used the same kind of analogy when I introduced legislation to \nallow offshore drilling since offshore drilling can be put so far off \nsight that one does not need to see it. If Virginia wants to do it and \nNorth Carolina can see it and they do not like it, they can veto it. I \nbelieve the same thing should apply to these massive windmills.\n  I believe that during our debates, we will find that there are better \nways to produce a low-cost reliable supply of American energy than by \nspending $3.7 billion over the next 5 years, requiring power companies \nto produce energy from giant windmills that raise electric rates, only \nwork when the wind blows, and destroy the American landscape.\n  The legislation that Senator Johnson and I have introduced, the \nNatural Gas Price Reduction Act of 2005, includes support for \naggressive conservation, new clean coal gas plants, new supplies of \ndomestic natural gas, and, for the time being, easier import of \nliquefied natural gas. We did this because natural gas is at $7 a unit \naround the world, and that needs to change. In the USA, it is the \nhighest priced gas anywhere in the industrial world. The chemical \nplants in Oklahoma, Colorado and Tennessee will find it likely that \nthey will be moving their jobs to other parts of the world where the \nprice of natural gas is not so high.\n  (Mr. ALLARD assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I believe there is an important place in our energy \nbill for renewable fuels such as ethanol, and I believe there is an \nimportant place for renewable energy sources. For example, the \nlegislation Senator Johnson and I introduced a few weeks ago would \nincrease from 10 percent to 30 percent the tax credit for commercial \ninvestments in solar technology that generates electricity, heats or \ncools a structure, uses fiber optics, and illuminates a building or \nprovides solar process heat. It provides a similar 30-percent tax \ncredit for a solar system that heats a home. But it is important to \nkeep in mind that, aside from wind, renewable energy can only provide \nabout 3 percent of America's total energy needs over the next 20 years. \nI am excluding from that, also, hydro.\n  In the United States of America, the wholesale destruction of the \nAmerican landscape is not an incidental concern. The great American \noutdoors is an essential part of the American character. Italy has its \nart, Egypt has its pyramids, England has its history, and we have the \ngreat American outdoors. In fact, the song ``America the Beautiful'' \nwas written in Colorado, the State of the Presiding Officer. We care \nabout that.\n\n[[Page S5194]]\n\n  In my home County of Blount County, TN, my father and lots of other \npeople worked at the Alcoa plant for many years to save money and buy a \nhome. Where did they want to buy a home? They wanted to buy a home on \nstreets that were named Mountain View, or Scenic Drive, because they \nloved to look at the Great Smoky Mountains.\n  While we debate the merits of so much subsidy and reliance on wind \npower, we should at the same time protect our national parks, our \nshorelines, and our other highly scenic areas. And we should give \nAmerican citizens the opportunity to protect their communities and \nlandscapes before it is too late.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1034\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the presentation of commemorative medals \non behalf of Congress to Native Americans who served as Code Talkers \nduring foreign conflicts in which the United States was involved during \nthe 20th century in recognition of the service of those Native \nAmericans to the United States; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, during World War I and II, Native \nAmericans heard the call of their Country and enlisted in the United \nStates Armed Services in unprecedented numbers. Many of these brave men \nperformed the role of code talkers, using a code language derived from \na variety of American Indian languages to ensure secure and rapid \ncommunication of information on the battlefield. Through three wars and \nfive decades, enemy forces were never able to break the United States \ncode language thanks to the service and ingenuity of Native American \nCode Talkers. These patriots provided an invaluable service to the \nUnited States and our allies and deserve recognition for their bravery.\n  Until 1968, information related to the code talker's activities \nduring both World Wars remained classified by the Department of \nDefense. The postponement in learning about the essential role of \nNative American Code Talkers has resulted in delayed recognition of \nthese war heroes. The first step in recognizing these men came in 2000 \nwhen President Bush signed into law legislation authorizing Congress to \naward gold medals to the twenty-nine Navajo Code Talkers as well as a \nsilver medal to each man who later qualified as a Navajo Code Talker. \nWhile this legislation was a step in the right direction, it failed to \nrecognize a number of Native Americans who also served as code talkers \nbut were not members of the Navajo Nation.\n  During the first World War, Choctaw code talkers served with \ndistinction in France. By transmitting in their native tongue a variety \nof open voice messages relating to unit movements, United States forces \ncompletely surprised the enemy during battle. Following the success of \nthe Choctaw code talkers, soldiers from the Navajo, Sioux, Comanche and \nMeskwaki tribes, along with members of 14 other tribes, served as code \ntalkers in some of the most dangerous operations in both theaters of \nWorld War II.\n  Today I introduce the Code Talkers Recognition Act to honor those who \nwere overlooked when medals were awarded to the Navajo Code Talkers in \n2001. This bill authorizes the presentation of commemorative medals on \nbehalf of Congress to Native Americans who served as Code Talkers \nduring any foreign conflict in which the United States was involved \nduring the 20th Century. I ask my colleagues to help honor the heroic \ncontributions of these gentlemen by cosponsoring this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/13/senate-section/article/S5194-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5194-S5195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.
