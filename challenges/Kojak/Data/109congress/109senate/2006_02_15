Mr. President, my home State of Nevada is a State that is \nfriendly to business. We pride ourselves on the opportunities that \nbusinesses have to thrive and grow in our State, while providing an \nexcellent quality of life for employees and their families. As chairman \nof the Republican High Tech Task Force, I come into contact with many \ncompanies, all who hear my pitch for why they should expand into \nNevada. But as good as businesses have it in Nevada, or if they move to \nNevada, what we do here in Washington, DC will ultimately help make or \nbreak their success. And when businesses fail to thrive, so does our \neconomy.\n\n[[Page S1322]]\n\n  Investors in a business in California may be sitting down today to \ndetermine whether their 2-year plan includes expanding to Nevada with, \nfor instance, a manufacturing plant that will employ 200 people. They \nare excited about the possibilities, but there are too many blank \nspaces when it comes time to crunch the numbers. Weighing heavily in \ntheir calculations, they are concerned that the current dividends and \ncapital gains tax rates will expire in 2008. Because of the uncertainty \nof those critical factors, they are leery about the prospects.\n  They will make that decision about expanding and reinvesting in their \nbusinesses today. Not next year and not the year after that. Today. But \nwe have tied one hand behind their back. We are standing in the way of \ntheir growth and potential if we do not extend the dividends and \ncapital gains tax rates. They need that assurance today so that they \ncan expand, create jobs, and help our economy continue to grow.\n  The economic growth we have seen since lower tax rates were enacted \nin the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 is exactly \nwhy we must extend the rates. Dividend distributions are up. Corporate \ninvestment in new property, plant, and equipment has surged. The \neconomy has grown for 10 consecutive quarters.\n  These are impressive results, and they are not just about business \nsucceeding. The impact is being felt by families, seniors, and low-\nincome individuals. With more than 50 percent--50 percent--of American \nhouseholds owning stocks or mutual funds, the reach of dividends and \ncapital gains rates is significant. Today, many senior citizens rely on \ndividends and capital gains to supplement their Social Security. And \nlower and middle-income families are benefiting as well.\n  Without this extension, our economy will take a hit, and so will \nworking families across Nevada. Instead of closing doors on them, we \nneed to create certainty in our Tax Code and opportunity for our \neconomy. Although the tax rates don't expire until 2008, we don't have \nthe luxury of waiting 2 years to extend this. By then, too many \ninvestors and businesses will have made their decisions not to grow, \nnot to build, and not to hire. It will be too late.\n  We are part of a global economy that is constantly moving and \nchanging. If we don't allow investment to fuel our competitiveness and \ninnovation, we will pay the price, and so will future generations.\n  It is not just one business in California deciding whether to move to \nNevada, and it is not just the 200 employees who could have found work \nthere; it is about investors and companies across our Nation and it is \nabout working families throughout this country, and it is about the \nfuture of our economy.\n  There aren't many factors that Congress controls when it comes to \ncapital and business investment. This is one of them, and we must join \ntogether to ensure continued economic growth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/15/senate-section/article/S1322-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1322-S1323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor also to talk about \nwhere we are and, more importantly, where we need to go with respect to \nthe economy that impacts all of us in various ways. It seems \nappropriate to emphasize some of the key points about the health of our \neconomy, about what is doing very well, and about what we need to be \nworking on now to ensure that this continues, and also to have 20/20 \nvision about where we want to be and what we need to do to get there.\n  I am disappointed about the slowness in our moving this year and a \ncertain amount of obstructionism that seems to be going on in terms of \nmoving forward. Nevertheless, we ought to keep in mind that over the \nlast year, we have been able to accomplish a great deal and the \nchallenge is there to move forward.\n  We have been able to keep the taxes relatively low, which, obviously, \nis a key factor in our economy, and we need to make sure it continues \nthat way. We have certainly been able to do what is necessary to work \ntoward having a strong health care program in this country, and that is \na great challenge for us. We did do something last year with \npharmaceuticals, making them available, and even though the process was \na little difficult, now we are seeing great increases in the number of \npeople who are able to obtain pharmaceutical drugs at a more reasonable \nrate.\n  We have assured that there will be more opportunities for job \ntraining and training in technologies so that we will have more \nresearch and will be able to continue to lead the world in terms of our \neconomy.\n  I think one of the more important things we did last year was to pass \nan energy bill that gives us some direction in terms of one of the most \nimportant elements of our economy. There were other accomplishments as \nwell last year. We passed legislation to end frivolous lawsuits, which \nhas had a great impact on many aspects of our economy. We put some \njudges in place with a fair process.\n\n  We need to be reminded sometimes of how well our economy is doing in \nterms of real growth. The GDP growth experienced in 2005 was at a rate \nof 3.5 percent for the year as a whole, while inflation remained at 2 \npercent. So that is very good. Those are very good numbers, and it is \nbetter than what we have experienced over a number of years, and \ncertainly it is exactly what we want to do.\n  Real disposable income rose at 4 percent in December. We are up 1.4 \npercent for the year 2005. The aftertax income per person has risen \nalmost 8 percent. Real household net worth is at an all-time high. This \nis good, and we need to make sure we understand that.\n  Retail sales have risen, again, 7 percent in December and 6.4 percent \nfor the whole year. So that is very good.\n  Employment growth remains high. Employers created 2 million new jobs \nin 2005, resulting in a less than 5-percent unemployment rate at the \nend of the year.\n  Since 2003, when the tax cut went into effect, there have been almost \n5 million new jobs created. That is a good sign, and we ought to \nunderstand it is the impact of that tax cut. Job growth is often \naffected and impacted, as is the total economy, by what we do with \ntaxes. We have a great deal of controversy about it, of course. When we \nhave the unusual expenses of the war on terrorism and of Katrina, it \nmakes it difficult as we look at our budget. But the fact is the \ndiscretionary part of the budget has been held down. We need to get the \njob completed in Iraq, complete our work there and reduce that spending \nand bring our troops home. All of us want to do that.\n  The point I want to make is we have had a very favorable impact from \nwhat has been done over the last couple of years, and the thing we are \nseeking to do right now is continue those tax reductions that will \nstrengthen the economy and continue to help. As I said, employment \nremains high. That is good. Job creation is what we want to do. We have \nto deal with immigration, of course. Even though we do need immigrants \nand workers here, we need to be legal. But we have this job creation \nthing that we need to continue to work on.\n  One of the real challenges we have before us is to deal some more \nwith energy. As I said, last year we passed energy policies that I \nthink were excellent. Now, of course, we have to implement those \npolicies. We dealt last year with the question of alternative fuels in \nthe future, whether we will be able to use wind energy, be able to use \nbioenergy, be able to use ethanol, all of these kinds of things. Those \nare future activities, and we will be able to do that. That challenge \nis to have the technology and the funding for the research to be able \nto move into those fields. That is something we can do and indeed we \nmust do.\n  Coupled with that is another challenge. Those changes are going to be \nover a relatively long time, at least several years, where we are faced \nimmediately with shortages and dependence on world production and with \ncosts. We are working on a budget that will provide funding for doing \nresearch in the short term.\n  There are opportunities, for instance, in Wyoming and many of the \nenergy production States where we have new sources of fairly immediate \nenergy. We can do some things with coal, for example, our largest \nfossil fuel. We can make some conversions from coal into\n\n[[Page S1323]]\n\ngas; we can make conversion into hydrogen and do those things in a \nfairly short term. Of course, gas is more flexible than coal, so if we \ncan do something there, that would be good. We have an opportunity to \ngo into shale oil which is a different source than we have used in the \npast. It takes research to get there. We need to be doing that.\n  Coupled with that, of course, to keep our economy going and make sure \nwe deal with the energy issue is conservation and efficiency. There is \na great challenge there, to use less energy in our economy and be more \nconservative in our use--whether it is automobiles or buildings. \nClearly, we can do more in that area than we have done. That is a \nchallenge we have before us. That will have a great impact on the \neconomy.\n  Home sales are at a record level. More people than ever own their \nhomes, and that is a great thing. We need to ensure that continues to \nhappen and we have the tax incentives and other regulations in order to \ndo that.\n  When we put in place some of the tax reductions that helped the \neconomy, another impact of it has been an increase in revenues. Tax \ncuts not only leave more money in the pockets of Americans but have \nalso resulted in fairly dramatic increases in receipts to the Treasury. \nTax collections from nonsalaried income were up 32 percent as a result \nof tax reductions on capital gains and these sorts of things. They \ncause more investment and more activities, which are then taxed and \nbring money in. Capital gains collections brought in almost $80 \nbillion, up from almost $50 billion from 2002.\n  The broad point is we are able to do some things that strengthen the \neconomy, that allow people to create more jobs and invest more in the \neconomy by reducing taxes and, at the same time, because of the \neconomic growth, increase revenue.\n  All these results point to continuing to pursue that. Actually, in \nJanuary we ran up one of the highest surpluses in the last 4 years--$21 \nbillion. That is a great thing. Now we have to take a little longer \nlook at spending on the other side so we can balance these things out.\n  Health care is another concern. We need to take some long looks at \nthat. We need to provide the opportunity for health care for everyone. \nAccessibility becomes difficult because of the costs. I am from a rural \narea. Rural health care is one of the issues we have. We have done some \nthings there.\n  Overall, we have seen some real growth in the economy and some good \nthings happening. We have an opportunity to continue to do that. I hope \nwe will get moving with the things that are here and continue to do the \nthings that help this economy and do good for the American people.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COBURN).

Mr. President, millions of Americans are now going through \na paperwork nightmare, trying to complete their taxes. They are trying \nto find their 1099s and their W-2s and their schedule this and schedule \nthat. They shout across the room: Honey, can you find the copy of the \nreceipt for that copier we bought back in March?\n  What I am going to do between now and April 15 is highlight some of \nthe ways this Tax Code gratuitously complicates the lives of all our \ncitizens--middle-income folks, low-income folks, and the affluent. I am \ngoing to be pointing out specific provisions in the Tax Code and try to \ndescribe how it does not have to be this way. We do not have to have a \n``deadwood'' tax bureaucracy, where we now have had more than 14,000 \nchanges. That comes to something akin to three for every working day in \nthe last 20 years.\n  Our citizens are going to spend more this year complying with the Tax \nCode than this country spends on higher education. We are going to \nspend $140 billion complying with the needless kind of bureaucracy that \nI am going to describe this morning. It is my intent between now and \nApril 15 to discuss this. I am going to start today with the \nalternative minimum tax, which is true water torture for middle-class \nfolks who basically have to figure out two taxes, their taxes and the \nalternative minimum tax. There is a whole set of complicated procedures \nhere. After I complete this week's presentation on the alternative \nminimum tax, it is my intention to go next to the earned income tax, \nwhich is also mindlessly complicated.\n  Then I intend to focus on a number of the provisions for those who \nare very affluent that strike me, again, as defying common sense in how \nthey are written.\n  Today, I want to begin by focusing on the alternative minimum tax. It \nis, of course, a crushing tax for millions of middle-income people, \nfolks who definitely do not consider themselves fat cats. Across this \ncountry, 3.6 million taxpayers were impacted by the alternative minimum \ntax this year. The number is expected to rise to over 19 million by \n2006 unless the Congress acts this year.\n  The form that you use for the alternative minimum tax is form 6251. \nThe first line sums up what all of this has come to. The first line \nsays:\n\n       If filing Schedule A (form 1040), line 41 (minus any amount \n     on form 8914, line 2) and go to line 2. Otherwise enter the \n     amount from form 1040, line 38 (minus any amount on form \n     8914, line 2) and go to line 7. (If less than zero, enter as \n     a negative amount.)\n\n  I think it is pretty obvious that what I have read is, for all \npractical purposes, incomprehensible. You would have to have a Ph.D. in \neconomics. What it means is that in order to fill out form 6251 for \nyour minimum tax you have to fill out not just form 1040 but also form \n8914. How much time is that going to add to tax preparation? What about \ntrying to understand form 8914, for those who may have to fill it out?\n  Are people in this country going to have to become CPAs to fill out \nthis tax requirement that affects millions of middle-class people? I \nbring this up because it does not have to be this way.\n  I would like to now post the alternative that I have developed in my \nFair Flat Tax Act, S. 1927. On line 1, instead of all the mumbo jumbo I \nread--it is real simple--all you have to state is whether you are \nsingle, married, head of a household, qualifying widower.\n  I filled out my one-page 1040 form that my legislation mandates in \nabout a half hour. That alone is a bit of a revolution in the Senate \nFinance Committee, or the tax-writing committee in the other body, \nbecause it has been a long time since anybody who wrote tax laws could \nfill out their own returns. I bring this up only by way of saying let's \nmake sure people understand how much deadwood and legal mumbo jumbo and \nneedless complication there is in the Tax Code. That is why I have \nstarted today with the burdensome requirements of the alternative \nminimum tax. But I am going to go on, in the weeks ahead, to a number \nof other kinds of provisions.\n  As a result of what I read on the alternative minimum tax, lots of \nfolks simply turn to tax preparers. This year we will spend $140 \nbillion on tax preparation. That is more than the Government spends on \nhigher education. It is pretty obvious why. There were 14,000 changes \nin the Tax Code since the last major overhaul, three significant \nchanges for every working day in the last 20 years.\n  What I do in my fair flat tax legislation is simply say to the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer of the Senate, the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma: You take your income from all your sources, you \nsubtract your deductions, you add your credits, add it all up, send it \nto the IRS, and say: Have a nice day, I am done.\n  One page, 1040 form--somebody called me about it yesterday and we \ndiscussed how long it took me to do it. I mentioned I could do mine in \nhalf an hour. They said: Ron, it only took me 15 minutes.\n  That is what this is all about. I am not sure the Congress \nunderstands how this body has permitted this mindless bureaucracy, a \nbureaucracy that only can be described as deadwood, a bureaucracy that \nhas lost all kind of connection with what the middle class in this \ncountry is all about. And I want to change it.\n  I believe we ought to start tax reform by simplifying the Code. Then \nlet us\n\n[[Page S1324]]\n\nchange the tax system so that all Americans have the opportunity to \nclimb the ladder of success. One way you do that is to change a set of \nrates that now have the second richest person in America, Warren \nBuffett, paying a lower tax rate than his receptionist. The Tax Code \ndiscriminates against work.\n  I am not interested in soaking anybody. I believe in markets, and I \nbelieve in creating wealth, but as we saw today where we have very low \nrates in savings for the middle class, it is because they cannot keep \nup. Their wages aren't even keeping up with inflation. Their concerns \nare about those matters where the second word is ``bill''--the tax \nbill, the medical bill, the gas bill, the heating bill, and the \neducation bill.\n  We say with my legislation that we are going to end the \ndiscrimination against work. We will protect 90 percent of all interest \nincome earned by our citizens--their house, the capital gains they may \nbe able to enjoy if they sell it, their savings accounts, their life \ninsurance. I want us to build a new savings ethic. I do that in this \nlegislation as well. But for the life of me, I can't figure out why we \ncan't get both political parties to get moving on this issue.\n  The President has an advisory commission. They asked me what I \nthought about it. I said: Look, I have a one-page 1040 form which will \nsimplify this code for everybody. The President's commission report is \na bit longer, but for purposes of Government work, they are pretty \nclose together.\n  So why not start with simplification? Why not start with the rates I \nhave proposed which I would like to bring to the attention of the \nSenate? The first bracket of rates in my legislation is 15 percent, the \nsecond bracket is 25 percent, and the third bracket is 35 percent. That \nis what Ronald Reagan proposed. Those are the exact brackets Ronald \nReagan proposed in 1986.\n  Now, much has changed. I would be the first to acknowledge that. \nCertainly the AMT hits much harder than anything that was anticipated \nin the 1980s. But I am interested in being flexible with respect to the \nrates.\n  If the Senate, after bipartisan deliberation on a fair flat tax, \nwanted to have 13, 23, and 33, that would be fine with me. The \nprinciple is we ought to say marginal rates are important; they send a \nvery significant message with respect to growth. But let us treat all \nincome the same. Let us particularly get rid of some of this mindless \nkind of bureaucracy.\n  We are having a hearing today on the tax gap, the money that is not \ncollected that ought to be paid. We all realize that is a good \nopportunity to generate revenue to help the middle class. If we pick up \nsome of that money, we will drive the rates down for everybody in this \ncountry even more than I am proposing.\n  People ask me what I stand for. I stand for the proposition that \nevery American ought to have the opportunity to climb the ladder of \nsuccess. And let us start by changing the Tax Code, where the second \nwealthiest person in the United States, Warren Buffett, pays a lower \ntax rate than his receptionist. How is the receptionist going to be in \na position to be in the middle class if we don't treat them fairly?\n  I also think it is worth noting that when you graduate from a college \nin Oklahoma or in Illinois, when you go out into the marketplace and in \nthe first job with your new college degree, after all that hard work, \nyou are going to pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett, the second \nwealthiest person in this country.\n  We need incentives for investment.\n  I protect 90 percent of the interest income earned by people who are \nsaving and showing the kind of financial discipline which is necessary \nto get ahead.\n  But we can have a Tax Code that is simpler, flatter, and fairer.\n  I wrap up by saying to both Democrats and Republicans, I believe this \nis really what you are all about.\n  For Democrats, what could be more important than a message about \ngiving the middle class a fair shake, the opportunity to climb the \nladder of success and get out from under some of this bureaucracy?\n  Our friend from Illinois is here, Senator Durbin. His colleague from \nthe House, Congressman Emanuel, has tax clinics in Chicago for families \nwho can't fill out the earned income tax credit because it is too \ncomplicated. I have outlined how absurd the requirements are for the \nalternative minimum tax and why it is difficult for folks to comply. \nBut this is something which affects everybody--poor folks with the \nearned income tax credit and the middle-class folks with the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  As far as I can tell, many of the affluent in this country are saying \nto themselves: What really counts is finding a better accountant to get \nme more tax dodges because that is the way you get ahead in this \ncountry, not by innovating but by finding an accountant to get you more \ntax dodges.\n\n  It doesn't have to be this way. The Code doesn't have to be as \ncomplicated as it is. The Code doesn't have to discriminate against \npeople who work for a living. The late President Reagan accepted that \nprinciple in the 1986 tax reform.\n  We can do this. Certainly the administration, after talking about how \nthey were interested in tax reform and forming a commission, is going \nto ask me and, I believe, other Members of Congress: Where are the \ndeadlines?\n  This is an opportunity for the administration to have a big second-\nterm initiative. Ronald Reagan did this in the middle of his second \nterm because he reached out to Senators such as Bill Bradley and the \nchairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the other body, Congressman \nRostenkowski.\n  It is time to cleanse this Code. It has been 20 years since real \nreform, 14,000 changes, spending more on preparation than the \nGovernment spends on higher education. That is a disgrace. It is not \nright to working people. It is not right to all taxpayers, regardless \nof their income.\n  It is my intention to come back to this Chamber again and again--but \nparticularly between now and April 15--as I have done today with the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  I would like to pose once more the language for folks who are middle \nincome and trying to comply with the alternative minimum tax. If \nanybody who is not a CPA can figure out the first line of the AMT, I \nurge them to call me. My guess is they can't. They will have to call \ntheir accountant to sort it out.\n  I also wish to point out for people trying to get help this morning \nthat the IRS has an 800-number. We will post it on our Web site: 1-800-\n829-1040.\n  As I wrap up this presentation, let me contrast this, which is the \ndead wood in the tax bureaucracy today, with the legislation I have \nfiled, the Fair Flat Tax Act, which replaces the legal mumbo-jumbo I \nhave shown you with our section 1--just a handful of lines--describing \nwhether you are single, married, head of household, or a widower.\n  I know colleagues are waiting to speak.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Certainly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Oregon through the \nChair--first, I would like to tell him that about 10 or 15 years ago, \nin my hometown, my accountant in Springfield, IL, passed away, a man \nwho had done the tax returns for my wife and me. After years of being a \nlawyer, I thought to myself: I can do this. I will fill out my own \nincome tax return.\n  I went back home Sunday afternoon and sat down to fill out what is a \npretty simple income tax return for a Member of Congress. It took me 3 \nor 4 hours, and then I had to come back to it the next day, and I filed \nit. I then found out I had made several glaring errors. This was before \nTurboTax, H Block's Web site, and all the rest of these things. But I \nthought: Let me do it myself. I tell the Senator from Oregon that I \nhave an abiding respect for what he just said after that humbling \nexperience.\n  I would like to ask the Senator whether he thinks we would have more \nimpetus for simplifying tax returns if Members of Congress had to file \ntheir own tax returns, prepare their own tax returns, and then submit \nto the American people the fruits of their labor as to whether they \nmade mistakes?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, who as usual is being a bit too logical. The fact is, if \nMembers of the Congress had to go through this--because we\n\n[[Page S1325]]\n\nwill have a lot who are paying the AMT, many who have investments of a \nvariety of sorts--I believe that alone could trigger a bit of a \nrevolution around here. I think the challenge is for people to see just \nthe kind of tax hole we have dug ourselves into over the last 20 \nyears--14,000 changes, needless complications.\n\n  I really do not see how a middle-class person can get ahead with a \nTax Code that discriminates against work. The Senator from Illinois has \nbeen a champ for the middle-class kind of family.\n  Here is the way it works. If a cop in Chicago gets a $500 pay raise, \nthat cop pays 25 percent of his or her pay raise to the Federal \nGovernment in income taxes, and then they pay Social Security payroll \ntaxes on top of that. If somebody in downtown Chicago makes all their \nmoney from capital gains and investment, they pay 15 percent on their \ncapital gains and no Social Security payroll tax.\n  Again, I have tried to emphasize that I am not for soaking anybody. I \nbelieve in markets, and I believe in creating wealth, as I believe \nSenators of both political parties do. But as the Senator from Illinois \nhas pointed out, if Senators were really forced to deal with these \nkinds of situations themselves, starting with the Tax Code \ncomplications, when they fill it out on their own, that could start a \nrevolution around here.\n  I believe this is a bipartisan opportunity that comes along rarely.\n  I will wrap up with one last point.\n  I believe the Social Security reform showed a lot about what our \ncitizens think about a vital American program. A lot of Americans love \nSocial Security dearly, and there are a lot of rallies outside the \noffices of Members of Congress, with folks carrying signs saying, ``I \nlove Social Security.'' I tell colleagues that there will be no rally \noutside your office with people carrying signs saying, ``We Love the \nIRS Code.'' This is something which could be reformed, could be changed \non a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for one question \nwhich I think gets to the concern people have about tax reform, it \nseems like a zero-sum game in this respect: If you end up lowering the \ntaxes paid by someone in order to keep the same return to Government in \nrevenue, you have to raise the taxes for others.\n  So I ask the Senator to step back from his proposal for a minute. Who \nare the winners and losers?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator asks a good question. First, a quick word on \nmy proposal, which is available from the Congressional Research Service \nand Jane Gravell, the top economist who is there to discuss it with \nSenators. It would actually reduce the deficit by about $100 billion \nover 5 years, making downpayments in terms of deficit reduction.\n  But here is what the distribution profile looks like in terms of our \nlegislation. We believe that upwards of 70 percent of the people in \nthis country would get a solid tax cut. These are middle-class folks \nmaking $60,000, $70,000, $80,000, and $90,000. Essentially, what the \nCongressional Research Service has shown is that millions of middle-\nclass people would get relief. It is upwards of 70 percent. We have \ncalculated that about 15 percent of the people in this country would be \ntreated about the same.\n  For example--and it is matter of public record, and I can discuss \nit--I have a Senate wage of about $160,000, and I have a bit of \ninvestment income. I come out about the same under my proposal as under \nthe status quo. We have to make 6 or 7 percent of the people in this \ncountry who make virtually all their income from capital gains and \ndividends--not from wages--pay a bit more.\n  So that is what the distributional effect of one actual proposal \nlooked like. That was again very similar to what happened in 1986 when \nRonald Reagan, after having started his Presidency with a set of tax \nchanges--and my colleague will remember they were largely for \ninvestment--did an about-face and passed a reform proposal that gave \nreal relief to middle-class people.\n  I want to close by thanking the Senator from Illinois, who I know has \na great interest in this subject and has been a strong champion of the \nmiddle class.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 2271, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to consider S. 2271, a bill to clarify \n     that individuals who receive FISA orders can challenge \n     nondisclosure requirements, that individuals who receive \n     national security letters are not required to disclose the \n     name of their attorney, that libraries are not wire or \n     electronic communication service providers unless they \n     provide specific services, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nmotion to proceed and in support of the underlying legislation itself. \nThis bill was introduced to make changes, changes to the PATRIOT Act \nconference report that was delayed at the end of last year, just as we \nwere ready to adjourn for the holidays.\n  That conference report had some flaws and weaknesses. I began \nfocusing on and working on reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act well over \na year and a half ago, recognizing that we could do more to improve the \noriginal Act, we could make this bill more balanced by adding better \nprotections for civil liberties even as we reauthorized the law \nenforcement tools in the PATRIOT Act to give law enforcement power to \nconduct terrorism investigations.\n  I don't think there is anyone in this Chamber who believes we should \nnot provide law enforcement with tools necessary to deal with the \nthreat of terrorism, both domestically and overseas. But whenever we \ngive law enforcement new tools, new powers, we want to make sure they \nare balanced, balanced by the ability of individuals who think they \nhave been singled out unfairly to raise objections in court, balanced \nby the ability of individuals to seek legal advice, balanced by \nrestricting the use of these tools to ensure they are only used in \nappropriate circumstances. That is what protecting civil liberties is \nall about.\n  As the process of reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act began well over a \nyear and a half ago, a bipartisan group of Senators, including myself, \njoined to highlight a number of areas where we felt the legislation \ncould and should be improved and strengthened to provide the kinds of \nprotections I mentioned.\n  We spoke with Justice Department officials, not a month or 2 months \nbefore this process began, but, as I've said, over a year and a half \nago, raising our concerns in a clear, articulate fashion, trying to \nmake certain that DOJ knew full well that there was a bipartisan group \nthat would push to make changes to improve the PATRIOT Act and that we \nwould be willing to stand up for those changes and stand up on \nprinciple.\n  Unfortunately, the people who should have been engaged in this \ndiscussion process early on simply were not and much of the work was \nleft to the very end of the process, and continued after the law was \noriginally set to expire at the end of last year. As a result, changes \nthat should have been made early were not, and we found ourselves\n\n[[Page S1326]]\n\nwith reauthorization legislation that could not win enough bipartisan \nvotes to gain passage at the end of December.\n  What I wish to do today is to talk about the changes that were made \nto the PATRIOT Act earlier in the reauthorization process that better \nsafeguard civil liberties, and the changes that are in this underlying \nlegislation that I think will allow us to move forward with some \nconfidence that we have made additional improvements since the cloture \nvote in December.\n  In the conference report that was delayed, I certainly agree that \nthere were many significant improvements made to the original PATRIOT \nAct. For example, improvements were made to add clarity to a roving \nwiretap order to require more specificity as to the target or location \nof the surveillance to be conducted. Improvement was made to add \nclarity to delayed notification search warrants, which are search \nwarrants that are conducted without immediately telling the targets of \nthe search.\n  I think delayed notice search warrants are appropriate tools for law \nenforcement, but at a certain point law enforcement either needs to \ninform the target of the search or get agreement from a judge to \nfurther delay the notification. In the delayed conference report we \nadded clarity. We added a requirement that a target must be notified of \na search within 30 days unless a judge agrees to continue delaying the \nnotification.\n  We were successful when we took a stand at the end of last year in \nmoving the sunset period in the draft conference report from a 7-year \nsunset on the most controversial provisions of the PATRIOT Act to a 4-\nyear sunset period, so that 215 subpoena power, a very significant \nsubpoena power for law enforcement to access the most sensitive of \nrecords, the lone wolf provisions and the roving wiretap provisions I \nmentioned, would have to be reviewed four years from now.\n\n  All of these were improvements to the PATRIOT Act. But a number of us \nstill had many concerns, concerns in three particular areas.\n  First, our most significant concern was and is the breadth of the \nstandard for obtaining a 215 subpoena. We felt--and we still feel--it \nis unnecessarily broad. It could result in the gathering of information \nthat is not only extraneous, but pertains to innocent Americans. We \nthink that standard should be more narrow so that there be shown that \nan individual who is a target of this subpoena be connected to a \nsuspected terrorist or suspected spy. The current standard of mere \nrelevance to a terrorist investigations is unnecessarily broad.\n  Second, we feel there should be a clear judicial review, a review \nbefore a judge, of the gag order associated with the 215 subpoena. If \nyou are the recipient of one of these subpoenas, that subpoena comes \nwith a restriction on your ability to tell anyone about the subpoena. \nBut you ought to be able to challenge that gag order before a judge.\n  Third, we feel the provision in the conference report that required \nthe recipient of a national security letter to disclose the name of \ntheir attorney to the FBI was punitive and might have the result of \ndiscouraging an individual from seeking legal advice. Over the last 6 \nweeks, I have worked with a number of my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, on changes to the PATRIOT Act, negotiating with the \nJustice Department, making Members of the House aware of what we were \npursuing, working with Chairman Arlen Specter, who has been very \nhelpful throughout this whole process. Senator Leahy, Senator Durbin, \nSenator Feingold have all been part of these discussions and I have \nworked to share with them the concepts we were working on, the language \nwe were working on in the areas where there were still differences, \ndifferences between those who wanted to pass the conference report as \nit was and those of us who felt we could strike a better balance.\n  In the end, we have worked out an agreement on language that has \nreceived bipartisan support and makes changes to the conference report \nin three areas.\n  First, we add a clear, explicit judicial review process for the 215 \nsubpoena gag order. It is a judicial review process that is very \nsimilar to the judicial review process for the National Security Letter \ngag order set forth in the conference report. I think it is important \nthat we stand for the principle that a restriction on free speech such \nas a gag order can be objected to in a court of law before a judge. You \ncan at least have your case heard. That does not mean you will win, \nnecessarily, but you can at least have your case heard.\n  Second, we were able to get language striking the requirement that \nthe recipient of a National Security Letter disclose the name of their \nattorney to the FBI. Again this is a punitive provision, and it could \nhave the unintended effect of discouraging people from seeking legal \nadvice.\n  Third, we added clarification to National Security Letters as they \npertain to libraries. Our agreement adds a provision that makes very \nclear that libraries operating in their traditional role, including the \nlending of books, including making books available in digital form, \nincluding providing basic Internet access, are not subject to National \nSecurity Letters.\n  These are three areas that were highlighted as being of concern at \nthe end of last year. I did--and I think the others would agree--we all \ndid everything possible to stay focused on these areas of concern. We \nmade improvements in each of these three areas. I think we ought to be \nable to move forward now with the reauthorization, knowing full well \nthat in an effort such as this, no party ever gets everything they \nwant. But having shown that there is a bipartisan group of Members of \nthe Senate and I believe Members of the House as well who will look \ncarefully at these measures, who will push hard for improvements, I \nthink the oversight of the PATRIOT Act will be improved. I know that \nthe reporting to Congress as to how this act is used will be improved. \nRequirements to report on the use of 215 subpoenas and the minimization \nprocedures used to get rid of data and information on innocent \nAmericans collected through 215 subpoenas and National Security Letters \nare improvements.\n  So I feel confident we have legislation that is a vast improvement \nover current law in terms of protecting civil liberties. We have \noversight that is improved and, frankly, we have a strong coalition \nwithin Congress that is committed to doing an effective job in making \nsure these important law enforcement tools are used effectively but \nalso used fairly.\n  I know not all my colleagues will support this final package. I know \nin particular Senator Feingold, who has worked extremely hard on this \nissue, is not able to support this final package. He will speak more \neloquently than I can as to the concerns that remain, but among his \nconcerns is the breadth of the 215 standard and the feeling that we \nought to be able to agree on and work toward a standard that will \nprevent fishing expeditions, that will better protect civil liberties \nbut still enable law enforcement to do their job. I share that concern \nand that goal, but I at the same time recognize we have an obligation \nto take the many gains we received throughout the reauthorization \nprocess and reauthorize this legislation so we can move forward, focus \non our outstanding concerns, and focus on the agenda that still sits \nbefore Congress.\n  I thank the President for the time and the opportunity to lay out the \nimprovements that are in the package before us. I look forward to the \ndebate and the discussion, but I do hope we can, in a deliberate \nfashion, complete work on this legislation that now has gained \nbipartisan support, has gained additional votes from Republicans, \nincluding Senator Craig, Senator Hagel, Senator Murkowski, who have \nraised concerns, Senator Durbin, Senator Feinstein, and others on the \nDemocratic side who have stood with us too since the end of last year \nin the hopes of improving the balance of the conference report. I think \nwe do the country a service by enacting this legislation now with a \ncommitment to continue to try to improve it wherever we can.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it will come as no surprise that I would \nlike to talk about the PATRIOT Act today, and certainly I listened to \nthe remarks of the Senator from New Hampshire and have greatly enjoyed \nthe experience of working with him on this issue for the last couple of \nyears.\n  I, of course, come to a very different conclusion about the matters \nbefore us. I strongly oppose proceeding to the consideration of S. \n2271, which is legislation introduced by some of my friends and \ncolleagues to implement the deal on the PATRIOT Act that was struck by \nthe White House last week.\n  Some may argue that there is no harm in passing a bill that could \ncharitably be described as trivial. But protecting the rights of law-\nabiding Americans is not trivial, and passage of S. 2271 is the first \nstep toward passage of the flawed PATRIOT Act conference report.\n  I will oppose both measures, and I am prepared to discuss at length \nmy reasons for doing so. I do greatly respect the Senators who \nnegotiated this deal, but I am gravely disappointed in the outcome. The \nWhite House would agree to only a few very minor changes to the same \nPATRIOT Act conference report that could not get through the Senate \njust back in this past December. These changes do not address the major \nproblems with the PATRIOT Act that the bipartisan coalition has been \ntrying to fix for the past several years.\n  In fact, the Senator from New Hampshire described the issues that \nbrought us together, the points that brought us together. This \nagreement doesn't relate, in any significant way, to the provisions \nthat we were concerned about that brought us together in a bipartisan \nway.\n  What came out of this agreement is, quite frankly, a figleaf to allow \nthose who were fighting hard to improve the act to step down, claim \nvictory, and move on. What a hollow victory that would be and what a \ncomplete reversal of the strong, bipartisan consensus that we saw in \nthis body a couple months ago.\n  What we are seeing, I regret to say, is quite simply a capitulation \non the intransigent and misleading rhetoric of the White House that \nsees any effort to protect civil liberties as a sign of weakness. \nProtecting American values is not weakness. Standing on principle is \nnot weakness. Committing to fight terrorism aggressively without \ncompromising the rights and freedoms this country was founded upon is \nnot weakness either.\n  We have come too far and fought too hard to agree to reauthorize the \nPATRIOT Act without fixing any of the major problems with the act. A \nfew insignificant face-saving changes don't cut it. So I cannot support \nthis deal. I strongly oppose proceeding to legislation that would \nimplement it.\n  I understand the pressure my colleagues have been under on this \nissue, and I again want to say I appreciate all the hard work they have \ndone on the PATRIOT Act. It has been very gratifying to work on a \nbipartisan basis on this issue. It is unfortunate the White House is so \nobviously trying to make this into a partisan issue because it sees \nsome political advantage in doing so. But whether the White House likes \nit, this will continue to be an issue where both Democrats and \nRepublicans have concerns, and we will continue to work together for \nchanges in the law. I am sure of that. But I will also continue to \nstrongly oppose any reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act that doesn't \nprotect the rights and freedoms of law-abiding Americans who have \nabsolutely no connection whatsoever to terrorism.\n  This deal does not meet that standard. Frankly, Mr. President, it \ndoesn't even come close. I urge my colleagues to oppose it and I, \ntherefore, ask that they oppose even proceeding to this legislation.\n  I wanted to take some time to lay out the background and context for \nthis ongoing debate over the PATRIOT Act, a debate that will not end \nwith the reauthorization of the 16 provisions that are now set to \nexpire March 10. And I want to discuss my concerns about this \nreauthorization deal with some specificity.\n  Mr. President, because I was the only Senator to vote against the \nPATRIOT Act in 2001, I want to be very clear from the start. I am not \nopposed to reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. I supported the \nbipartisan compromise, the reauthorization bill the Senate passed last \nJuly without a single Senator objecting. I believe that bill should \nbecome law.\n  The Senate reauthorization bill is not a perfect bill, but it is \nactually a good bill. If that were the bill we considered back in \nDecember or the bill we were considering today, I would be speaking in \nsupport of it. In fact, we could have completed the process of \nreauthorizing the PATRIOT Act months ago if the House had taken up the \nbill that the Senate approved without any objection from any Senator on \neither side of the aisle.\n  I also want to respond to those who argue that any people who are \ncontinuing to call for a better reauthorization package want to let the \nPATRIOT Act expire. That is nonsense. Not a single Member of this body \nis calling for any provision--not only that the bill should not be \nreauthorized, but no Senator is calling for even one provision at all \nto actually expire. There are any number of ways we can reauthorize the \nact, while amending its most problematic provisions, and I am not \nprepared to support reauthorization without adequate reform.\n\n  Let me also be clear about how this process fell apart at the end of \nlast year and how we ended up having to extend the PATRIOT Act \ntemporarily past the end of 2005. In December, this body, in one of its \nprouder moments in recent years, refused to let through a badly flawed \nconference report. A bipartisan group of Senators stood together and \ndemanded further changes. We made very clear what we were asking for. \nWe laid out five issues that needed to be addressed to get our support.\n  Let me quickly read excerpts from a letter that we sent out \nexplaining our concerns:\n\n       The draft conference report would allow the Government to \n     obtain sensitive personal information on a mere showing of \n     relevance. This would allow Government fishing expeditions. \n     As business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have \n     argued, the Government should be required to convince a judge \n     that the records they are seeking have some connection to a \n     suspected terrorist or spy.\n       The draft conference report does not permit the recipient \n     of a section 215 order to challenge its automatic, permanent \n     gag order. Courts have held that similar restrictions violate \n     the First Amendment. The recipient of a section 215 order is \n     entitled to meaningful judicial review of the gag order.\n       The draft conference report doesn't provide meaningful \n     judicial review of a national security letter's gag order. It \n     requires the court to accept as conclusive the Government's \n     assertion that a gag order should not be lifted, unless the \n     court determines the\n\n[[Page S1328]]\n\n     Government is acting in bad faith. The recipients of NSLs are \n     entitled to meaningful judicial review of a gag order.\n       The draft conference report does not sunset the NSL \n     authority. In light of recent revelations about possible \n     abuses of NSLs, the NSL provision should sunset in no more \n     than four years so that Congress will have an opportunity to \n     review the use of this power.\n       The draft conference report requires the Government to \n     notify the target of a ``sneak and peek'' search no earlier \n     than 30 days after the search, rather than within seven days, \n     as the Senate bill provides and as pre-PATRIOT Act judicial \n     decisions required. The conference report should include a \n     presumption that notice will be provided within a \n     significantly shorter period in order to better protect \n     Fourth Amendment rights. The availability of additional 90-\n     day extensions means that a shorter initial timeframe should \n     not be a hardship on the Government.\n\n  Those are the key parts of the letter that we sent late last year. \nNow, you might ask, in this newly announced deal on the PATRIOT Act, \nhave any of these problems been solved? Have any of the five problems \nidentified by the SAFE Act authors been solved?\n  The answer is simple, Mr. President. The answer is: No, not a single \none. Only one of these issues has been even partially addressed by this \ndeal. The White House applied immense pressure and pulled out its usual \nscare tactics and succeeded in somehow convincing people to accept a \ndeal that makes only a tiny substantive improvement to a bill that was \nactually rejected in December. This is simply not acceptable.\n  I want to explain in detail my biggest concerns with the conference \nreport, as modified by S. 2271, the legislation that the majority \nleader is seeking to take up. First, I want to clear up one frequent \nmisconception. I have never advocated repeal of any portion of the \nPATRIOT Act. In fact, as I have said repeatedly over the past 4 years, \nI supported most of that bill. There were many good provisions in that \nbill. As my colleagues know, the PATRIOT Act did a lot more than expand \nour surveillance laws. Among other things, it set up a national network \nto prevent and detect electronic crimes, such as the sabotage of the \nNation's financial sector; it established a counterterrorism fund to \nallow the Justice Department offices, disabled in terrorist attacks, to \nkeep operating; and it changed the money laundering laws to make them \nmore useful in disrupting the financing of terrorist organizations. One \nsection even condemned discrimination against Arab and Muslim \nAmericans.\n  Even some of the act's surveillance sections were reasonable. One \nprovision authorized the FBI to expedite the hiring of translators. \nAnother added terrorism and computer crimes to the list of crimes for \nwhich criminal wiretap orders could be sought. And some provisions \nhelped to bring down what has been called frequently ``the wall''--the \nwall that had been built up between intelligence and law enforcement \nagencies.\n  Whenever we start debating the PATRIOT Act, we hear a lot of people \nsaying we must reauthorize the PATRIOT Act in order to ensure that the \nwall doesn't go back up. So let me make it clear. I supported the \ninformation-sharing provisions of the PATRIOT Act. One of the key \nlessons we learned in the wake of September 11 was that our \nintelligence and law enforcement agencies were not sharing information \nwith each other, even where the statutes permitted it.\n  Unfortunately, the wall was not so much a legal problem as it was a \nproblem of culture. That is not just my conclusion. The report of the \n9/11 Commission made that very clear. I am sorry to report we have not \nmade as much progress as we should have in bringing down those very \nsignificant cultural barriers to information sharing among our \nagencies. The 9/11 Commission report card that was issued toward the \nend of last year gave the Government a ``D'' for information sharing \nbecause our agencies' cultures have not changed enough. A statement \nissued by Chairman Kean and Vice Chairman Hamilton explained, ``You can \nchange the law, you can change the technology, but you still need to \nchange the culture. You still need to motivate institutions and \nindividuals to share information.'' And so far, apparently, our \nGovernment has not met that challenge.\n  Talking about the importance of information sharing, as \nadministration officials and other supporters of the conference report \nhave done repeatedly, is part of a pattern that started several years \nago on this issue of renewing or revising the PATRIOT Act. Rather than \nengage in a true debate on the controversial parts of the PATRIOT Act, \nas some in this body have done--to their credit--during this \nreauthorization process, many proponents of the PATRIOT Act point to \nthe noncontroversial provisions of the act and talk about how important \nthey are. They say this bill must be passed because it reauthorizes \nthose noncontroversial provisions. But, that doesn't advance the \ndebate; it muddies the waters because we all agree that those \nprovisions should be continued.\n  The point is we don't have to accept bad provisions to make sure the \ngood provisions become law, or continue to be law.\n  I hope I actually advance the debate. I want to spend some time \nexplaining my specific concerns with the conference report and the deal \nthat was struck to make a few minor changes to it. It is unfortunate \nthe whole Congress could not come together, as the Senate did around \nthe Senate's bipartisan compromise reauthorization bill. In July, the \nSenate Judiciary Committee voted unanimously in favor of a \nreauthorization bill that made meaningful changes to the most \ncontroversial provisions of the PATRIOT Act to protect the rights and \nfreedoms of innocent Americans.\n  Shortly thereafter, that bill passed the full Senate by unanimous \nconsent. It was not entirely easy for me to support the Senate bill, \nwhich fell short of the improvements contained in the bipartisan SAFE \nAct. But at the end of the day, the Senate bill actually contained \nmeaningful changes to some of the most problematic provisions in the \nPATRIOT Act--provisions I have been trying to fix since October 2001--\nso I decided to support it. I made it very clear at the time, however, \nthat I viewed the bill as the end point of negotiations, not the \nbeginning. In fact, I specifically warned my colleagues ``that the \nconference process must not be allowed to dilute the safeguards in this \nbill.'' Obviously, I meant it, but it appears that people either were \nnot listening or weren't taking me seriously. This conference report, \nas slightly modified by this deal, unfortunately does not contain many \nimportant reforms to the PATRIOT Act we passed in the Senate, so I \ncannot support it. And I will fight.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues of the serious problems with the \nPATRIOT Act which we have been discussing for several years now. Let me \nstart with section 215, the so-called library provision, which has \nreceived probably the most public attention of any one of the \ncontroversial provisions. I remember when the former Attorney General \nof the United States called the librarians who were expressing \ndisagreement with this provision ``hysterical.'' What a revelation it \nwas when the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the Senator from \nPennsylvania, opened his questioning of the current Attorney General \nduring his confirmation hearing by expressing concerns about this \nprovision of the PATRIOT Act, section 215. He got the Attorney General \nto concede that, yes, in fact, this provision probably went a bit too \nfar and could be improved and clarified. And that was really an \nextraordinary moment. It was a moment that was very slow in coming, and \nit was long overdue.\n  I give credit to the Senator from Pennsylvania because it allowed us \nto start having a real debate on the PATRIOT Act. Credit also has to go \nto the American people, who stood up, despite the dismissive and \nderisive comments of Government officials, and said, with loud voices: \nThe PATRIOT Act needs to be changed.\n  My colleagues know as well as I do that these voices came from the \nleft and the right, from big cities and small towns across America. So \nfar, more than 400 State and local governmental bodies have passed \nresolutions calling for revisions to the PATRIOT Act. I plan to read \nsome of those resolutions on the floor during this debate, and there \nare a lot of them. Nearly every one mentions section 215.\n  Section 215 is at the center of this debate over the PATRIOT Act. It \nis also one of the provisions that I tried unsuccessfully to amend here \non the floor in October of 2001. So it makes sense to start my \ndiscussion of the specific problems I have with the conference report \nwith the infamous ``library'' provision.\n\n[[Page S1329]]\n\n  Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act allows the Government to obtain secret \ncourt orders in domestic intelligence investigations to get all kinds \nof business records about people, including not just library records \nbut also medical records and various other types of business records. \nThe PATRIOT Act allowed the Government to obtain these records as long \nas they were ``sought for'' a terrorism investigation. That is all they \nhad to say. That is a very low standard. It didn't require that the \nrecords concern someone who was suspected of being a terrorist or spy \nor even suspected of being connected to a terrorist or a spy. It didn't \nrequire any demonstration of how the records would be useful in the \ninvestigation. Under section 215, if the Government simply said it \nwanted records for a terrorism investigation, the secret FISA Court was \nrequired to issue the order--no discretion required to issue the order, \nperiod. To make matters worse, recipients of these orders are also \nsubject to an automatic gag order. They cannot tell anyone that they \nhave been asked for records.\n  Some in the administration and even in this body took the position \nthat people shouldn't be able to criticize these provisions until they \ncould come up with a specific example of ``abuse.'' The Attorney \nGeneral has repeatedly made that same argument, and he did so again in \nDecember in an op-ed in the Washington Post when he dismissed concerns \nabout the PATRIOT Act by saying that ``there have been no verified \ncivil liberty abuses in the 4 years of the Act's existence.''\n  First of all, that has always struck me as a strange argument since \n215 orders are issued by a secret court and people who receive them are \nprohibited by law from discussing them. In other words, the law is \ndesigned--it is actually designed--so that it is almost impossible for \nyou to know if abuses have occurred. But even more importantly, the \nclaim about lack of abuse just isn't credible anymore, given what we \nnow know about how this administration views the surveillance laws that \nthis body, this Congress, writes. We now know that for the past 4-plus \nyears, the Government has been wiretapping the international \ncommunications of Americans inside the United States without obtaining \nthe wiretap orders required by statute.\n  If we want to talk about abuses, I can't imagine a more shocking \nexample of an abuse of power than to violate the law by eavesdropping \non American citizens without first getting a court order based on some \nevidence, some evidence that they are possibly criminals or terrorists \nor spies. So I don't want to hear again from the Attorney General or \nanyone on this floor that this Government has shown it can be trusted \nto use the power we give it with restraint and care.\n  The Government should not have those kinds of broad, intrusive powers \nin section 215--not this Government, not any government. The American \npeople shouldn't have to live with a poorly drafted provision which \nclearly allows for the records of innocent Americans to be searched and \njust hope that the Government uses it with restraint. A government of \nlaws doesn't require its citizens to rely on the good will and good \nfaith of those who have these powers, especially when adequate \nsafeguards could easily be written into the law--easily be written into \nthe law--without compromising their usefulness as a law enforcement or \nantiterrorist tool.\n  After lengthy and difficult negotiations, the Judiciary Committee \ncame up with language that achieved that goal. It would require the \nGovernment to convince a judge that a person has some connection to \nterrorism or espionage before obtaining their sensitive records. When I \nsay ``some connection,'' that is what I mean. The Senate bill's \nstandard is the following: No. 1, that the records pertain to a \nterrorist or spy; No. 2, that the records pertain to an individual in \ncontact with or known to a suspected terrorist or spy; or No. 3, that \nthe records are relevant to the activities of a suspected terrorist or \nspy. That is the three-prong test in the Senate bill, and I believe it \nis more than adequate to give law enforcement the power it needs to \nconduct investigations while also sufficiently protecting the rights of \ninnocent Americans. It would not limit the types of records the \nGovernment could obtain, and it does not go as far to protect law-\nabiding Americans as I would prefer, but it would make sure the \nGovernment cannot go on fishing expeditions into the records of \ncompletely innocent people.\n\n  The Senate bill would also give recipients of the 215 order an \nexplicit, meaningful right to challenge those orders and the \naccompanying gag orders in court. These provisions passed the Senate \nJudiciary Committee unanimously after tough negotiations late into the \nnight, and as anyone familiar with the Judiciary Committee knows, \nincluding the Chair, that is no mean feat, to get that done in the \nJudiciary Committee on any issue.\n  The conference report did away with this delicate provision. First \nand most importantly, it does not contain the critical modifications to \nthe standard for section 215 orders. The Senate permits the Government \nto obtain business records only if it can satisfy one or more of the \nprongs of the three-prong test I just described. This is a broad \nstandard, and it has a lot of flexibility. But it retains the core \nprotection--the core protection--that the Government cannot go after \nsomeone who has no connection whatsoever to a terrorist or spy or their \nactivities.\n  The conference replaces the three-prong test with a simple relevance \nstandard. It then provides a presumption of relevance that the \nGovernment meets one of the three prongs. It is silly to argue that \nthis is adequate protection against a fishing expedition. The only \nactual requirement in the conference report is that the Government show \nthat those records are just relevant to an authorized intelligence \ninvestigation--that is all--just relevant to an authorized intelligence \ninvestigation. Relevance is a very broad standard that could arguably \njustify the collection of all kinds of information about all kinds of \nlaw-abiding Americans. The three prongs are just examples of how the \nGovernment can satisfy the relevance standard. That is not simply a \nloophole or an exception that swallows the rule; the exception is the \nrule. The exception basically destroys the meaning of the carefully \nconsidered three-prong test we all supported in the Senate.\n  I will try to make this as straightforward as I can. The Senate bill \nrequires the Government to satisfy one of three tests. Each test \nrequires some connection between the records and a suspected terrorist \nor spy. But the conference report says that the Government only is \nrequired to satisfy a new fourth test, and that test is only relevance \nand which does not require a connection between the records and a \nsuspect. So the other three tests no longer provide any protections at \nall.\n  This issue was perhaps the most significant reason I and others \nobjected to the conference report. So, naturally, the question today \nis, How was this issue addressed by the White House deal to get the \nsupport of some Senators? The answer is, It wasn't. Not one change was \nmade on the standard for obtaining section 215 orders, and that is a \ngrave disappointment. The White House refused to make any changes at \nall. Not only would it not accept the Senate version of section 215, \nwhich no Member of this body objected to back in July, it wouldn't make \nany change in the conference report on this issue at all.\n  Another significant problem with the conference report that was \nrejected back in December is that it does not authorize judicial review \nof the gag order that comes with a section 215 order. While some have \nargued that the review by the FISA Court of a Government application \nfor a section 215 order is equivalent to judicial review of the \naccompanying gag order, that is simply inaccurate. The statute does not \ngive the FISA Court any latitude to make an individualized decision \nabout whether to impose a gag order when it issues a section 215 order. \nIt is required by statute to include a gag order in every section 215 \norder. That means the gag order is automatic and permanent in every \ncase.\n  This is a serious deficiency and one which very likely violates the \nFirst Amendment. In litigation challenging a similar, permanent, \nautomatic gag rule in a national security letter statute, two courts \nhave found first amendment violations because there is no \nindividualized evaluation of the need for secrecy. I have those \ndecisions here,\n\n[[Page S1330]]\n\nand perhaps I will have a chance to read them during this debate.\n  This question of judicial review of the section 215 gag order is one \nissue that is actually addressed in some way by the White House deal--\naddressed but not solved. Far from it. Under the deal, there is \njudicial review of section 215 gag orders, but it can only take place \nafter a year has passed, and it can only be successful if the recipient \nof the section 215 order proves that the Government has acted in bad \nfaith. As many of us have argued in the context of national security \nletters, that is a virtually impossible standard to meet. What we need \nis meaningful judicial review of these gag orders, not just the \nillusion of it.\n  I do acknowledge one change made by the White House deal that I do \nthink is an improvement over the conference report. The conference \nreport clarifies that the recipients of both section 215 orders and \nnational security letters, which I will discuss in detail in a moment, \ncan consult an attorney, but it also includes a provision that requires \nthe recipients of these letters to notify the FBI if they consult with \nthe attorney and to identify the attorney to the FBI. Obviously, this \ncould have a significant chilling effect on the right to counsel. The \ndeal struck with the White House makes clear that recipients of section \n215 orders in national security letters would not have to tell the FBI \nif they consult with an attorney. That is an improvement over the \nconference report but, unfortunately, it is only one relatively minor \nchange.\n  Let me now turn to a very closely related provision that has finally \nbeen getting the attention it deserves: national security letters, or \nNSLs--an authority that was expanded by section 358 and 505 of the \nPATRIOT Act. This NSL issue has flown under the radar for years, even \nthough many of us have been trying to bring more public attention to \nit. I am gratified that we are finally talking about NSLs, in large \npart due to a lengthy Washington Post story published last year on the \nuse of these authorities.\n  What are NSLs, and why are they such a concern? Let me spend a little \ntime on this because it is quite important. National security letters \nare issued by the FBI to businesses to obtain certain types of records. \nSo they are similar to section 215 orders, but with one very critical \ndifference: the Government does not need to get any court approval \nwhatsoever to issue them. It doesn't have to go to the FISA Court and \nmake even the most minimal showing. It simply issues the order signed \nby the special agent in charge of a field office or some other FBI \nheadquarters official.\n  NSLs can only be used to obtain certain categories of business \nrecords, in fairness, while section 215 orders can be used to obtain \n``any tangible thing.''\n  But even the categories reachable by an NSL are quite broad. NSLs can \nbe used to obtain three types of business records: subscriber and \ntransactional information related to Internet and phone usage; credit \nreports; and financial records, a category that has been expanded to \ninclude records from all kinds of everyday businesses like jewelers, \ncar dealers, travel agents and even casinos.\n  Just as with section 215, the PATRIOT Act expanded the NSL \nauthorities to allow the Government to use them to obtain records of \npeople who are not suspected of being, or even of being connected to, \nterrorists or spies. The Government need only certify that the \ndocuments are either sought for or relevant to an authorized \nintelligence investigation, a far-reaching standard that could be used \nto obtain all kinds of records about innocent Americans. And just as \nwith section 215, the recipient is subject to an automatic, permanent \ngag rule.\n  The conference report does little to fix the problems with the \nnational security letter authorities. In fact, it could be argued that \nit makes the law worse. Let me explain why.\n  First, the conference report does nothing to fix the standard for \nissuing an NSL. It leaves in place the breathtakingly broad relevance \nstandard. Now, some have analogized NSLs to grand jury subpoenas, which \nare issued by grand juries in criminal investigations to obtain records \nthat are relevant to the crime they are investigating. So, the argument \ngoes, what is the big deal if NSLs are also issued under a relevance \nstandard for intelligence investigations?\n  Two critical differences make that analogy break down very quickly. \nFirst of all, the key question is: Relevant to what? In criminal cases, \ngrand juries are investigating specific crimes, the scope of which is \nexplicitly defined in the criminal code. Although the grand jury is \nquite powerful, the scope of its investigation is limited by the \nparticular crime it is investigating. In sharp contrast, intelligence \ninvestigations are, by definition, extremely broad. When you are \ngathering information in an intelligence investigation, anything could \npotentially be relevant. Suppose the Government believes a suspected \nterrorist visited Los Angeles in the last year or so. It might then \nwant to obtain and keep the records of everyone who has stayed in every \nhotel in L.A., or booked a trip to L.A. through a travel agent, over \nthe past couple years, and it could argue strongly that that \ninformation is relevant to a terrorism investigation because it would \nbe useful to run all those names through the terrorist watch list.\n  I don't have any reason to believe that such broad use of NSLs is \nhappening. But the point is that when you are talking about \nintelligence investigations, ``relevance'' is a very different concept \nthan in criminal investigations. It is certainly conceivable that NSLs \ncould be used for that kind of broad dragnet in an intelligence \ninvestigation. Nothing in current law prevents it. The nature of \ncriminal investigations and intelligence investigations is different, \nand let's not forget that.\n  Second, the recipients of grand jury subpoenas are not subject to the \nautomatic secrecy that NSL recipients are. We should not underestimate \nthe power of allowing public disclosure when the Government \noverreaches. In 2004, Federal officials withdrew a grand jury subpoena \nissued to Drake University for a list of participants in an antiwar \nprotest because of public revelations about the demand. That could not \nhave happened if the request had been under section 215 or for records \navailable via the NSL authorities.\n  Unfortunately, there are many other reasons why the conference report \ndoes so little good on NSLs. Let's talk next about judicial review. The \nconference report creates the illusion of judicial review for NSLs, \nboth for the letters themselves and for the accompanying gag rule, but, \nif you look at the details, it is drafted in a way that makes that \nreview virtually meaningless. With regard to the NSLs themselves, the \nconference report permits recipients to consult their lawyer and seek \njudicial review, but it also allows the Government to keep all of its \nsubmissions secret and not share them with the challenger, regardless \nof whether there are national security interests at stake. So you can \nchallenge the order, but you have no way of knowing what the Government \nis telling the court in response to your challenge. The parties could \nbe arguing about something as garden variety as attorney-client \nprivilege, with no national security issues, and the Government would \nhave the ability to keep its submission secret. That is a serious \ndeparture from our usual adversarial process, and it is very \ndisturbing.\n  The other significant problem with the judicial review provisions is \nthe standard for getting the gag rule overturned. In order to prevail, \nthe recipient has to prove that any certification by the Government \nthat disclosure would harm national security or impair diplomatic \nrelations was made in bad faith. Again, this is a standard of review \nthat is virtually impossible to meet. So what we have is the illusion \nof judicial review. When you look behind the words in the statute, you \nrealize it's just a mirage.\n  Does the White House deal address these problems? It does not. In \nfact, as I have already discussed, it expands that same very troubling \nstandard of review to judicial review section 215 gag orders.\n\n  The modifications to the conference report agreed to by the White \nHouse do contain one other purported change to one of the NSL statutes. \nThis modification states that the FBI cannot issue an NSL for \ntransactional and subscriber information about telephone and Internet \nusage to a library unless\n\n[[Page S1331]]\n\nthe library is offering ``electronic communication services'' as \ndefined in the statute. But that just restates the existing \nrequirements of the NSL statute, which currently applies only to \nentities--libraries or otherwise--that provide ``electronic \ncommunication services.'' So that provision has no real legal effect \nwhatsoever. Perhaps that explains why the American Library Association \nissued a statement calling this provision a ``figleaf'' and expressing \ndisappointment that so many Senators have agreed to this deal.\n  I also want to take a moment to address, again, an argument that has \nbeen made about the NSL provisions of the conference report. It has \nbeen argued that many of the complaints I have about the NSL provisions \nof the conference report apply equally to the NSL provisions of the \nSenate bill and therefore, because I supported the Senate bill, by some \nconvoluted theory my complaints are therefore invalid and I should \nsupport the conference report.\n  That just makes no sense. The NSL section of the Senate bill was one \nof the worst sections of the bill. I didn't like it then, and I don't \nlike it now. But in the context of the larger package of reforms that \nwere in the Senate bill, including the important changes to section 215 \nthat I talked about earlier and the new time limit on ``sneak and \npeek'' search warrants that I will talk about in a moment, I was able \nto accept that NSL section even though I would have preferred \nadditional reforms.\n  The argument has been made that after supporting a compromise package \nfor its good parts, I guess the idea is I am supposed to accept a \nconference report that has only the bad parts of the package even \nthough the good parts have been stripped out. That is just nonsense, \nand every Member of this chamber who has ever agreed to a compromise--\nand I must assume that includes every single one of us--knows it.\n  The other point I want to emphasize here is that the Senate bill was \npassed before the Post reported about the use of NSLs and the \ndifficulties that the gag rule poses for businesses that feel they are \nbeing unfairly burdened by them. At the very least, I would think that \na sunset of the NSL authorities would be justified to ensure that \nCongress has the opportunity to take a close look at such a broad \npower. But the conferees and the White House refused to make that \nchange. Nor would they budge at all on the absurdly difficult standard \nof review, the so-called conclusive presumption; in fact, the White \nHouse insisted on repeating it in the context of judicial review of \nsection 215 gag orders.\n  This points out a real problem I have with the White House deal. In \nour letter in December, my colleagues and I, Democratic and Republican, \ncomplained about the unfair standard for judicial review of the gag \norder in connection to NSLs. So how can the supporters of this deal \nargue that applying that same standard to challenges to the gag rule \nfor section 215 orders is an improvement? A standard that was \nunacceptable in December has somehow miraculously been transformed into \na meaningful concession. That is just spin. It doesn't pass the laugh \ntest.\n  I suspect that the NSL power is something that the administration is \nzealously guarding because it is one area where there is almost no \njudicial involvement or oversight. It is the last refuge for those who \nwant virtually unlimited Governmental power in intelligence \ninvestigations. And that is why the Congress should be very concerned \nand very insistent on making the reasonable changes we have suggested.\n  I next want to address ``sneak and peek'' searches. This is another \narea where the conference report departs from the Senate's compromise \nlanguage, another area where the White House deal makes no changes \nwhatsoever, and another reason that I must oppose the conference \nreport.\n  When we debated the PATRIOT Act in December, the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania made what seems on the surface to be an appealing \nargument. He said that the Senate bill requires notice of a sneak and \npeek search within 7 days of the search, and the House said 180 days. \nThe conference compromised on 30 days. ``That's a good result,'' he \nsays. ``They came down 150 days, we went up only 23. What's wrong with \nthat?''\n  Let me take a little time to put this issue in context and explain \nwhy this isn't just a numbers game--an important constitutional right \nis at stake.\n  One of the most fundamental protections in the Bill of Rights is the \nfourth amendment's guarantee that all citizens have the right to ``be \nsecure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects'' against \n``unreasonable searches and seizures.'' The idea that the Government \ncannot enter our homes improperly is a bedrock principle for Americans, \nand rightly so. The fourth amendment has a rich history and includes in \nits ambit some very important requirements for searches. One is the \nrequirement that a search be conducted pursuant to a warrant. The \nConstitution specifically requires that a warrant for a search be \nissued only where there is probable cause and that the warrant \nspecifically describe the place to be searched and the persons or \nthings to be seized.\n  Why does the Constitution require that particular description? For \none thing, that description becomes a limit on what can be searched or \nwhat can be seized. If the magistrate approves a warrant to search \nsomeone's home and the police show up at the person's business, that \nsearch is not valid. If the warrant authorizes a search at a particular \naddress, and the police take it next door, they have no right to enter \nthat house. But of course, there is no opportunity to point out that \nthe warrant is inadequate unless that warrant is handed to someone at \nthe premises. If there is no one present to receive the warrant, and \nthe search must be carried out immediately, most warrants require that \nthey be left behind at the premises that were searched. Notice of the \nsearch is part of the standard Fourth Amendment protection. It's what \ngives meaning, or maybe we should say ``teeth,'' to the Constitution's \nrequirement of a warrant and a particular description of the place to \nbe searched and the persons or items to be seized.\n\n  Over the years, the courts have had to deal with Government claims \nthat the circumstances of a particular investigation require a search \nwithout notifying the target prior to carrying out the search. In some \ncases, giving notice would compromise the success of the search by \nleading to the flight of the suspect or the destruction of evidence. \nThe two leading cases on so-called surreptitious entry, or what have \ncome to be known as ``sneak and peek'' searches, came to very similar \nconclusions. Notice of criminal search warrants could be delayed but \nnot omitted entirely. Both the Second Circuit in U.S. v. Villegas and \nthe Ninth Circuit in U.S. v. Freitas held that a sneak and peek warrant \nmust provide that notice of the search will be given within 7 days, \nunless extended by the court. Listen to what the Freitas court said \nabout such searches:\n\n       We take this position because surreptitious searches and \n     seizures of intangibles strike at the very heart of the \n     interests protected by the Fourth Amendment. The mere thought \n     of strangers walking through and visually examining the \n     center of our privacy interest, our home, arouses our passion \n     for freedom as does nothing else. That passion, the true \n     source of the Fourth Amendment, demands that surreptitious \n     entries be closely circumscribed.\n\n  So when defenders of the PATRIOT Act say that sneak and peek searches \nwere commonly approved by courts prior to the PATRIOT Act, they are \npartially correct. Some courts permitted secret searches in very \nlimited circumstances, but they also recognized the need for prompt \nnotice after the search unless a reason to continue to delay notice was \ndemonstrated. And they specifically said that notice had to occur \nwithin 7 en days.\n  Section 213 of the PATRIOT Act didn't get this part of the balance \nright. It allowed notice to be delayed for any reasonable length of \ntime. Information provided by the administration about the use of this \nprovision indicates that delays of months at a time are now becoming \ncommonplace. Those are hardly the kind of delays that the courts had \nbeen allowing prior to the PATRIOT Act.\n  The sneak and peek power in the PATRIOT Act caused concern right from \nthe start. And not just because of the lack of a time-limited notice \nrequirement. The PATRIOT Act also broadened the justifications that the \nGovernment could give in order to obtain a sneak and peek warrant. It \nincluded\n\n[[Page S1332]]\n\nwhat came to be known as the ``catch- all'' provision, which allows the \nGovernment to avoid giving notice of a search if it would ``seriously \njeopardize an investigation.'' Some think that that justification in \nsome ways swallows the requirement of notice since most investigators \nwould prefer not to give notice of a search and can easily argue that \ngiving notice will hurt the investigation.\n  That is why it sounds to many like a catch-all provision.\n  Critics of the sneak and peek provision worked to fix both of the \nproblems when they introduced the SAFE Act. First, in that bill, we \ntightened the standard for justifying a sneak and peek search to a \nlimited set of circumstances--when advance notice would endanger life \nor property, or result in flight from prosecution, the intimidation of \nwitnesses, or the destruction of evidence. Second, we required notice \nwithin 7 days, with an unlimited number of 21-day extensions if \napproved by the court.\n  The Senate bill, as we all know, was a compromise. It kept the catch-\nall provision as a justification for obtaining a sneak and peek \nwarrant. Those of us who were concerned about that provision agreed to \naccept it in return for getting the 7-day notice requirement. And we \naccepted unlimited extensions of up to 90 days at a time. The key thing \nwas prompt notice after the fact, or a court order that continuing to \ndelay notice was justified.\n  That is the background to the numbers game that the Senator from \nPennsylvania and other supporters of the conference report point to. \nThey want credit for walking the House back from its outrageous \nposition of 180 days, but they refuse to recognize that the sneak and \npeek provision still has the catch-all justification and unlimited 90-\nday extensions.\n  Here is the crucial question that they refuse to answer. What \npossible rationale is there for not requiring the Government to go back \nto a court within 7 days and demonstrate a need for continued secrecy? \nWhy insist that the Government get 30 days free without getting an \nextension? Could it be that they think that the courts usually won't \nagree that continued secrecy is needed after the search is conducted, \nso they won't get the 90-day extension? If they have to go back to a \ncourt at some point, why not go back after 7 days rather than 30? From \nthe point of view of the Government, I don't see the big deal. But from \nthe point of view of someone whose house has been secretly searched, \nthere is a big difference between 1 week and a month with regard to the \ntime you are notified that some one came into your house and you had \nabsolutely no idea about it.\n  Suppose, for example, that the Government actually searched the wrong \nhouse. As I mentioned, that's one of the reasons that notice is a \nfourth amendment requirement. The innocent owner of the place that had \nbeen searched might suspect that someone had broken in, might be living \nin fear that someone has a key or some other way to enter. Should we \nmake that person wait a month to get an explanation rather than a week? \nPresumably, if the search revealed nothing, and especially if the \nGovernment realized the mistake and does not intend to apply for an \nextension, it will be no hardship, other than embarrassment, for notice \nto be given within 7 days.\n\n  That is why I'm not persuaded by the numbers game. The Senate bill \nwas already a compromise on this very controversial provision. And \nthere is no good reason not to adopt the Senate's provision. I have \npointed this out repeatedly, and no one has ever come forward and \nexplained why the Government can't come back to the court within 7 days \nof executing the search. Instead, they let the House get away with a \nnegotiating tactic--by starting with 180 days, they can argue that 30 \ndays is a big concession. But it certainly wasn't.\n  Let me put it to you this way: If the House had passed a provision \nthat allowed for notice to be delayed for 1,000 days, would anyone be \nboasting about a compromise that requires notice within 100 days, more \nthan 3 months? Would that be a persuasive argument? I don't think so. \nThe House provision of 180 days was arguably worse than current law, \nwhich required notice ``within a reasonable time,'' because it creates \na presumption that delaying notice for 180 days, 6 months, is \nreasonable. It was a bargaining ploy. The Senate version was what the \ncourts had required prior to the PATRIOT Act. And it was itself a \ncompromise because it leaves in place the catch-all provision for \njustifying the warrant in the first place. That is why I believe the \nconference report on the sneak and peek provision is inadequate and \nmust be opposed. And the fact that this so-called deal with the White \nHouse does not address this issue is yet another reason why I see no \nreason why I, or anyone, should change their position on this.\n  Let me make one final point about sneak and peek warrants. Don't be \nfooled for a minute into believing that this power is needed to \ninvestigate terrorism or espionage. It's not. Section 213 is a criminal \nprovision that applies in whatever kinds of criminal investigations the \nGovernment has undertaken. In fact, most sneak and peek warrants are \nissued for drug investigations. So why do I say that they aren't needed \nin terrorism investigations? Because FISA also can apply to those \ninvestigations. And FISA search warrants are always executed in secret, \nand never require notice. If you really don't want to give notice of a \nsearch in a terrorism investigation, you can get a FISA warrant. So any \nargument that limiting the sneak and peek power as we have proposed \nwill interfere with sensitive terrorism investigations is a red \nherring.\n  I have spoken at some length about the provisions of this conference \nreport that trouble me, and the ways in which the deal struck with the \nWhite House does not address those problems with the conference report. \nBut to be fair, I should mention one aspect of the conference report \nthat was better than a draft that circulated prior to the final signing \nof that report. The conference report includes 4-year sunsets on three \nof the most controversial provisions: roving wiretaps, the so-called \n``library'' provision, and the ``lone wolf' provision of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. Previously, the sunsets on these \nprovisions were at 7 years, and it is certainly an improvement to have \nreduced that number so that Congress can take another look at those \nprovisions sooner.\n  I also want to acknowledge that the conference report creates new \nreporting requirements for some PATRIOT Act powers, including new \nreporting on roving wiretaps, section 215, ``sneak and peek'' search \nwarrants, and national security letters. There are also new \nrequirements that the Inspector General of the Department of Justice \nconduct audits of the Government's use of national security letters and \nsection 215. In addition, the conference report includes some other \nuseful oversight provisions relating to FISA. It requires that Congress \nbe informed about the FISA Court's rules and procedures and about the \nuse of emergency authorities under FISA, and gives the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee access to certain FISA reporting that currently only goes to \nthe Intelligence Committee. I am also glad to see that it requires the \nDepartment of Justice to report to us on its data mining activities.\n  But adding sunsets and new reporting and oversight requirements only \ngets you so far. The conference report, as it would be modified by S. \n2271, remains deeply flawed. I appreciate sunsets and reporting, and I \nknow that the senior Senator from Pennsylvania worked hard to ensure \nthey were included, but these improvements are not enough. Sunsetting \nbad law in another 4 years is not good enough. Simply requiring \nreporting on the Government's use of these overly expansive tools does \nnot ensure that they will not be abused. We must make substantive \nchanges to the law, not just improve oversight. This is our chance, and \nwe cannot let it pass by.\n  Trust of Government cannot be cannot be demanded or asserted or \nassumed; it must be earned. And this administration has not earned our \ntrust. It has fought reasonable safeguards for constitutional freedoms \nevery step of the way. It has resisted congressional oversight and \noften misled the public about its use of the PATRIOT Act. We know now \nthat it has even authorized illegal wiretaps and is making misleading \nlegal arguments to try to justify them. We sunsetted 16 provisions of \nthe original PATRIOT Act precisely so we could revisit them and make \nnecessary changes--to make improvements based on the experience of 4\n\n[[Page S1333]]\n\nyears with the Act, and with the careful deliberation and debate that, \nquite frankly, was missing 4 years ago. This process of reauthorization \nhas certainly generated debate, but if we pass the conference report, \neven with the few White House modifications, in some ways we will have \nwasted a lot of time and missed our opportunity to finally get it \nright.\n  The American people will not be happy with us for missing that \nchance. They will not accept our explanation that we decided to wait \nanother 4 years before really addressing their concerns. It appears \nthat is now an inevitable outcome. But I am prepared to keep fighting \nfor as long as it takes to get this right. For now, I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the motion to proceed to this legislation to \nimplement the White House deal. We can do better than these minor \ncosmetic changes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Allen pertaining to the introduction of S.J. Res. \n31 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ALLEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand the current business. I ask \nunanimous consent that my presentation appear in the Record as in \nMorning Business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are again enduring another filibuster \nof the PATRIOT Act. It is frustrating to me in the sense that I \nbelieve, properly understood, the PATRIOT Act provides tremendous \nprotections to the people of the United States which don't now exist, \nand that those protections are crafted in a way which is sensitive to \nand consistent with the great civil liberties which we all cherish.\n  Two months ago, in December, we had a long debate, and since then, we \nhave had to extend the PATRIOT Act for some time without reauthorizing \nit. Leaders have met and worked and dealt with some concerns. I know \nfour Republican Senators who had concerns, and their concerns have been \nmet. I think others also have likewise felt their concerns have been \nmet. They are not large changes, but it made the Senators happy and \nthey feel comfortable with voting for the bill today. That is good \nnews. It is time to pass it.\n  I believe the American people expect that we will be able to have an \nup-or-down vote on this legislation. That has been blocked. There has \nbeen a majority in favor of the legislation for some time.\n  To get to cloture, we have to use 30 hours of debate, which will \nprobably last throughout the day and into tomorrow. We will get there \nthis time, I am confident. When we do, we will have a fairly strong \nvote, I believe, in favor of the legislation. We certainly should.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with us as best they can to move this \nforward in an expeditious way that allows for the up-or-down vote that \nis necessary.\n  I have talked about it a number of times, but I thought today I would \nfocus on the question of why the PATRIOT Act matters, or are these just \nacademic issues? Are they issues of an FBI agent wanting to violate our \ncivil rights and spy on us? Some group in Government out here with \nblack helicopters trying to find out what people are doing and then \ntake away our liberties?\n  That is a great exaggeration. This is not what is at stake here. This \nbill is consistent with our great American liberties. It has not been \nheld unconstitutional. Overwhelmingly, the powers given in this act are \npowers that law enforcement officers have had for years. They have been \nable to utilize them to catch burglars, murderers, drug dealers, and \nthe like.\n  The local district attorney can subpoena my library records, medical \nrecords, and bank records. The Drug Enforcement Administration Act by \nadministrative subpoena--not even a grand jury subpoena--can subpoena \nmy telephone toll records. That has always been the law. That is the \nlaw today. We have provisions that allow our investigators to do that \nfor terrorists. One would think somehow we are ripping the Constitution \ninto shreds, that this is somehow a threat to our fundamental \nliberties. It is not so.\n  Let me point out I had the privilege, for over 15 years, to be a \nFederal prosecutor and work on a daily basis with FBI agents, DEA \nagents, and customs agents. These are men and women who love their \ncountry. They believe in our law. They follow the law. In my remarks, I \nwill demonstrate these agents, unlike what is seen on television, \nfollow what we tell them to do. If they do not follow what we tell them \nto do, they can be prosecuted, removed from the FBI, the DEA or the \nFederal agency for which they work. In fact, they know that and they \nremain disciplined and men and women of integrity who follow the law. \nTherefore, do not think, when we pass restrictions on how they do their \nwork, that it is not going to be followed; that if it is a really big \ncase, such as on ``Kojak,'' that they will go in and kick in the door \nwithout a warrant. That does not happen.\n  In 2001, we know at least 19 foreign terrorists were able to enter \nthis country and plan and execute the most devastating terrorist attack \nthis Nation has ever seen. The reasons the United States and terror \ninvestigators, the people we had out there at the time--FBI, CIA, and \nothers--failed to uncover and stop the September 11 conspiracy have now \nbeen explored carefully by a joint inquiry of the House and Senate \nIntelligence Committees and other congressional committees and \ncommissions, as well as the 9/11 Commission. These very commissions and \ninquiries have reviewed, in painstaking detail, the various pre-\nSeptember 11 investigations that were out there--investigations, \ninquiries, preliminary inquiries--gathering information that raised \npeople's suspicions about terrorism.\n  These investigations could have but unfortunately did not stop the \nSeptember 11 plot. We have seen how close the investigators came to \ndiscovering or disrupting the conspiracy, only to repeatedly reach dead \nends or obstructions to their investigations.\n  Those are the facts they found. Some of the most important pre-\nSeptember 11 investigations, we know exactly what stood in the way of a \nsuccessful investigation. It was the laws Congress wrote, seemingly \nminor, but, nevertheless, with substantive gaps in our antiterror laws, \npreventing the FBI from fully exporting the best leads it had on the \nal-Qaida conspiracy. One pre-September 11 investigation, in particular, \ncame tantalizingly close to substantially disrupting or even stopping \nthe terrorist plot. But this investigation was blocked by a flaw in our \nantiterror laws that has since been corrected by this PATRIOT Act being \nfilibustered today.\n  This investigation involved Khalid Al Midhar. Midhar was one of the \neventual suicide attackers on the American Airlines flight 77 which was \nflown into the Pentagon across the river from here, killing 58 \npassengers on the plane, the crew, and 125 people at the Pentagon. \nPatriots all.\n  An account of a pre-September 11 investigation of Midhar is provided \nin the 9/11 Commission Staff Statement No. 10. The 9/11 Commission \nlooked at what information we did have prior to these events, and this \nis what the staff statement notes:\n\n\n[[Page S1334]]\n\n\n       During the summer of 2001, a CIA agent asked an FBI \n     official [a CIA agent responsible for foreign intelligence \n     talked with an FBI official responsible for the security and \n     law enforcement international] to review all of the materials \n     from a Al Qaeda meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia one more \n     time. The FBI official began her work on July 24th prior to \n     September 11, 2001. That day she found the cable reporting \n     that Khalid Al Mihdhar had a visa to the United States. A \n     week later she found the cable reporting that Mihdhar's visa \n     application--what was later discovered to be his first \n     application--listed New York as his destination . . . The FBI \n     official grasped the significance of this information.\n       The FBI official and an FBI analyst working on the case \n     promptly met with INS representatives at the FBI \n     Headquarters. On August 22nd, INS told them that Mihdhar had \n     entered the United States on January 15t, 2000, and again on \n     July 4, 2001 . . . The FBI agents decided that if Mihdhar was \n     in the United States, he should be found.\n\n  At this point, the investigation of Khalid Al Midhar came up against \nthe infamous legal ``wall'' that separated criminal and intelligence \ninvestigations at the time.\n  The Joint Inquiry Report of the House and Senate Intelligence \nCommittees describes what happens next:\n\n       Even in late August 2001 when CIA told FBI, State, INS, and \n     Customs that Khalid al-Mihdhar, Nawaf al-Yazmi, and two other \n     ``Bin Laden-related individuals'' were in the United States, \n     FBI Headquarters refused to accede to the New York field \n     office recommendation that a criminal investigation be \n     opened, which might allow greater resources to be \n     dedicated to the search for the future hijackers . . .\n\n  The FBI has attorneys. They read our statutes, they read the laws we \npass, they tell the agents what they can and cannot do because they are \ncommitted to complying with the laws we place upon them.\n\n       The FBI attorneys took the position that criminal \n     investigators CANNOT be involved and that criminal \n     information discovered in the intelligence case would be \n     ``passed over the wall'' according to procedures. An agent in \n     the FBI's New York field office responded by an e-mail, \n     saying--\n\n  And I will quote the agent in a second but the scene is this: The FBI \nfield office in New York concluded, after obtaining information from \nCIA that this individual, one of the hijackers, was a dangerous person \nand should be found. And the FBI field office--it is a big deal to be a \nspecial agent in charge of the New York field office, the biggest one \nin the country--recommended to FBI headquarters that we act on it. The \nFBI lawyers read the laws we passed and said ``you cannot.'' This is \nwhat the agent in New York responded when he heard this, sent it by e-\nmail. See if this doesn't chill your spine a bit.\n  He said:\n\n       Whatever has happened to this, someday someone will die \n     and, wall or not, the public will not understand why we were \n     not more effective in throwing every resource we had at \n     certain problems.\n\n  That was his reaction. It was a natural reaction.\n  How did we get this wall? It occurred in a spate of reform \nlegislation after abuses of Watergate and the Frank Church committee \nhearings. They decided that in foreign intelligence--that is one thing, \ndomestic is another--foreign intelligence does not always follow every \nrule. We ought to have a clear line between the FBI, which is over here \nin America, and we ought not give them information that the CIA had \nbecause they thought somehow this was going to deny us our civil \nliberties, which was not very clear thinking, in my view.\n  But these were good people. They were driven maybe by the politics of \nthe time or what they thought was good at the time. They created this \nwall we have demolished with the PATRIOT Act--and good riddance it is. \nThere is no sense in this.\n  The 9/11 Commission has reached the following conclusion about the \neffect the legal wall between criminal and intelligence investigations \nhad on the pre-September 11 investigation of Khalid Al Midhar. This is \nwhat the 9/11 Commission concludes:\n\n       Many witnesses have suggested that even if Mihdhar had been \n     found, there was nothing the agents could have done except \n     follow him onto the airplane. We believe this is incorrect. \n     Both Hazmi and Mihdhar could have been held for immigration \n     violations or as material witnesses in the Cole bombing case.\n\n  This was our warship, the USS Cole, that was bombed by al-Qaida, \nkilling a number of American sailors in Yemen; an attack on a warship \nof the United States by al-Qaida. What does it take to get our \nattention?\n  This report continues:\n\n       Investigation or interrogation of any of these individuals, \n     and their travel and financial activities, also may have \n     yielded evidence of connections to other participants in the \n     9/11 plot. In any case, the opportunity did not arise.\n\n  There was a realistic chance, had these rules not existed, rules that \nthis PATRIOT Act eliminates, we would have been able to move forward \nwith an investigation that had some prospect of actually preventing \nSeptember 11 from occurring.\n  Some say, Jeff, you cannot say that for certain; and I am not saying \nit for certain, but I have been involved in investigations. You never \nknow. You get a bit of information, you follow up on a lead or two, you \nget a search warrant, you surveil an activity, and all of a sudden you \nfind that bit of evidence that takes you even further into an \norganization committed to a criminal activity or a terrorist plot you \nnever knew existed. This is reality of law enforcement work today. We \nask them every day to do this. And those investigating terrorist cases \nare giving their very heart and soul to it. They are trying every way \npossible, consistent with the law, not outside the law, to gather all \nthe information they can to be successful.\n\n  So we know the PATRIOT Act was enacted too late to have aided in the \npre-September 11 investigations, unfortunately. But it did raise our \nconsciousness of the lack of wisdom on the reform legislation that was \npassed the year before--all with good intentions.\n  Let me mention another matter of a similar nature.\n  Another key pre-September 11 investigation was also blocked by a \nseemingly minor gap in the law. The case involves Minneapolis FBI \nagents' summer 2001 investigation of al-Qaida member Zacarias \nMoussaoui.\n  Hearings before the 9/11 Commission raised agonizing questions about \nthe FBI's pursuit of Moussaoui. Commissioner Richard Ben-Veniste noted \nthe possibility that the Moussaoui investigation could have allowed the \nUnited States to ``possibly disrupt the [9/11] plot.'' Commissioner Bob \nKerrey, a former Member of this Senate, even suggested that with better \nuse of the information gleaned from Moussaoui, the ``conspiracy would \nhave been rolled up.''\n  Moussaoui was arrested by Minneapolis FBI agents several weeks before \nthe 9/11 attacks. Do you remember that? He was arrested early that \nsummer. Instructors at a Minnesota flight school became suspicious when \nMoussaoui, with little apparent knowledge of flying, asked to be taught \nhow to pilot a 747. The instructors were concerned about it. They were \non alert. They did what good citizens would do. Remember, this is \nbefore 9/11. But they were concerned about this oddity. They called the \nFBI in Minneapolis, which immediately suspected that Moussaoui might be \na terrorist.\n  FBI agents opened an investigation of Moussaoui and sought a FISA \nthat is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court--national security \nwarrant to search his belongings. But for 3 long weeks, the FBI agents \nwere denied that FISA warrant. During that 3 weeks--you know the \ntruth--the September 11 attack occurred.\n  After the attacks--and largely because of them the agents were then \nable to obtain an ``ordinary'' criminal warrant. So after the attacks, \nthe agents were issued an ``ordinary'' criminal warrant to conduct the \nsearch. And when they conducted the search, his belongings then linked \nMoussaoui to two of the actual 9/11 hijackers and to a high-level \norganizer of the attacks who was later arrested in Pakistan.\n  The 9/11 Commissioners were right to ask whether more could have been \ndone to pursue the case. This case was one of our best chances of \nstopping or disrupting the 9/11 attacks. Could more have been done? The \nbest answer is probably no--based on the law that existed at that time.\n  The FBI agents were blocked from searching Moussaoui because of an \noutdated requirement of the 1978 FISA statute. Unfortunately, one of \nthat statute's requirements was that the target of an investigation--if \nit were to be subject to a search under a FISA warrant, a foreign \nintelligence warrant--the agent had to have proof that he was not a \nlone-wolf terrorist, but he\n\n[[Page S1335]]\n\nmust have been an agent of a foreign power or a known terrorist group. \nThe law did not allow searches of apparent lone wolves, like Zacarias \nMoussaoui was thought to be at the time. They did not have the evidence \nto show otherwise.\n  So according to the FBI Director, the man in charge of the FBI, \nRobert Mueller--a former prosecutor of many years and a skilled \nlawyer--the gap in FISA probably would have prevented the FBI from \nusing FISA against any of the September 11 hijackers. As the Director \nnoted in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       Prior to September 11, [of] the 19 or 20 hijackers . . . we \n     had very little information as to any one of the individuals \n     being associated with . . . a particular terrorist group.\n\n  So in other words, their lawyers in the FBI were saying: Well, you \ncan't use the FISA. I know you want to. I know you have suspicions. And \nI know he looks like a terrorist. And we would like to search his \nbelongings and see if he has any connection with any terrorist \norganization and maybe find out if they have any bombs or plans there. \nBut you can't do it because we lack one little bit of proof. We can't \nprove he's connected to a terrorist group or a foreign nation. Sorry. \nCan't do it.\n  So the ``lone-wolf'' gap was fixed by the Intell reauthorization, and \nadopted as part of the PATRIOT Act. We need to reauthorize it and \ncontinue it into law.\n  What the various reports and commissions investigating the 9/11 \nattacks have shown us thus far is that where our antiterror laws are \nconcerned, even seemingly little things, minor things--it might seem \nlike they were OK at the time--can make a big difference, a life and \ndeath difference.\n  Before September 11, few would have thought that the lack of \nauthority in FISA for the FBI to monitor and search lone-wolf \nterrorists might be decisive as to our ability to stop a major \nterrorist attack on U.S. soil. Indeed, that is true. We did not think \nabout it. We did not think clearly about it.\n  And before September 11, though there was some attention to the \nproblems posed by the legal wall between the intelligence-gathering \nagencies and the criminal investigative agencies, there was little \nsense of urgency to fix those matters. We accepted it. The FBI accepted \nit. It was the way you had to do business. You could not violate the \nlaw. I am sorry, you cannot investigate. You cannot participate with \nthe CIA. Even though you may think he is a terrorist instigator, you \ncannot participate because there is a wall that the Congress created.\n  So at the time, these all seemed like legal technicalities--not real \nproblems, the kind of problems that could lead to the deaths of \nalmost 3,000 American citizens.\n\n  Today, we face the same challenge--recognizing why it is so important \nto fix small gaps in the law that can lead to large consequences and \nreal-life disasters. Congress must not take the position that enough \ntime has been passed since 9/11. Congress must not allow the \ninformation wall to be reconstructed by blocking the passage of the \nPATRIOT Act, or allow the tools we have given to our terrorism \ninvestigators by the PATRIOT Act to be taken away.\n  We must pass the PATRIOT Act reauthorization conference report. It is \nthat simple. It permanently plugs most of the holes that we know \nexisted in our terrorism laws. The report retains a few sunsets. I do \nnot think they are necessary. I think they were good, sound changes in \nthe law. But people are nervous that they might be abused, so they will \nautomatically sunset if we do not extend them. OK, we will do that. If \nthat will get some people more comfortable so they will pass this bill, \nwe will do that.\n  And the report has a long list of additional civil liberties \nprotections.\n  It is a compromise product that came out of our Judiciary Committee, \nI believe with a unanimous vote, and with a unanimous vote on the floor \nof the Senate, and went to conference. A few changes were made in \nconference. But where there were conflicts, overwhelmingly, the \nconflicts were decided in favor of the Senate product. And it was that \nproduct that finally hit the floor of the Senate in December. And we \nhave had this filibuster going ever since. Hopefully, now we are in a \nposition to end it.\n  I urge my colleagues to examine the nature of the PATRIOT Act as it \nis now configured. Read it carefully. Ask any questions you have. Make \nsure you understand what powers police have today in your hometowns all \nover America. And do not get confused that some of the things provided \nfor might sound if--you listen to critics--as if they are new and far-\nreaching and utterly dangerous. They are part of everyday law \nenforcement--overwhelmingly, they are--and I believe are consistent \nwith the highest commitment of American citizens to civil liberties.\n  I would also mention this. There are almost 3,000 people who are no \nlonger with us today. They have zero civil liberties as a result of the \nmost vicious and hateful attack on 9/11. That is not an academic \nmatter. That is a fact. As that FBI agent said: Someday the American \npeople are not going to understand how we were not able to intercept \nand investigate these groups.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Alabama \njoining the debate about the PATRIOT Act. I am going to respond very \nbriefly to his remarks because I know there are other Senators on the \nfloor who wish to speak about other issues, and I will defer to them in \na moment.\n  But the Senator complained that the Senate is enduring another \nfilibuster on this issue. I suppose that is one way to characterize it. \nWhat I would characterize it as is those of us who have concerns about \nthis bill are enduring again speech after speech that has absolutely \nnothing to do with the issues at hand. That is irrelevant to the \nconcerns we have raised about the PATRIOT Act.\n  Throughout his speech, the Senator from Alabama talked about issues \nthat are not about the concerns we have raised. In fact, again, we are \nsubjected to this idea that somehow those of us who raise these \nconcerns are not concerned about what happened to this Nation on 9/11, \nthat we do not feel exactly as much as the Senator from Alabama the \npain and the tragedy of the loss of those 3,000 lives.\n  Not a single concern I have raised about this bill would have \nanything to do with this Government's ability to crack down on people \nwho are trying to attack this country. In fact, that is the whole \npoint. All of the changes we seek are to try to make sure we \ndistinguish those who are completely innocent and unrelated to the \nterrorists from those who, in fact, are involved in espionage or \nterrorism.\n  The Senator talks about academic issues. But these are not academic \nissues. The fact is, when he brings up anything specific, he is \nchanging the subject. He is bringing up noncontroversial issues. He \ntalks about this wall. I talked about this in my speech before: the \nwall between the CIA and FBI. No Member of this body disputes that wall \nneeded to be taken down. The wall has been taken down. I do not want it \nto be put back up. That is not in controversy.\n  And virtually the entire speech by the Senator from Alabama was about \nspecific issues--the Midhar case and the Moussaoui case. All of that \npart of his speech was about something that is not in controversy. If \nhe wants to offer that as a bill right now to simply continue that \nprovision, he can put me down as a cosponsor. So it is completely \nirrelevant to what we are discussing and what my concerns are at this \npoint.\n  The Senator says that somehow people are running around saying that \nthe FBI is kicking down people's doors without a warrant. Nobody ever \nsaid that. I understand how the sneak-and-peek provisions work. We have \nbeen on this issue for a while. We know that in sneak and peek there \nhas to be a warrant.\n  The question there is not whether there are warrantless searches of \npeople's homes. The question is, when somebody is allowed, through a \njudicial order and a warrant, to come into somebody's house when they \ndo not get notice of it, how long somebody should have to endure the \npossibility that their home has been searched and they\n\n[[Page S1336]]\n\ndo not get notice after the fact that somebody came into their house \nwhen they were not there. So again, the argument is entirely unrelated \nto the concern.\n  The concerns we have raised are important, but they are limited. I am \ngoing to insist in this debate that we debate the concerns that we have \nput forward.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am amused by the Senator talking about how \nwe passed a bill in the Judiciary Committee by a unanimous vote. You \nbet we did. The Senator from Alabama voted for it and I voted for it. \nThe whole Senate did not oppose the bill. Now every single thing I have \nadvocated to change in the PATRIOT Act, in terms of the product of this \nbody, is what I am advocating today. The Senator is acting as if those \nare dangerous provisions. Well, he voted for them. He voted for the \nstronger standard on 215. He voted for 7 days on the sneak-and-peek \nprovisions. So how can they be dangerous if the Senator from Alabama \nactually voted for those provisions with me in the Judiciary Committee?\n  These are not dangerous changes. These are not irresponsible changes. \nThese are not changes that have anything to do with legitimate efforts \nto try to stop the terrorists.\n  I so thank the Senator. I always enjoy debating him. He is the one \nSenator who has come down here and engaged on this today. I appreciate \nthat. But I wish the debate could be about the questions that have \narisen having to do with notice issues in sneak and peek, whether there \nis going to be a stronger provision on national security letters, \nwhether there is going to be a provision on library business records to \nmake sure it is tied to terrorists. The only reason I am doing this has \nto do with those kinds of provisions, not the issues the Senator from \nAlabama raised on which I happen to, in large part, agree.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield, I have talked about the \ndetails of this bill and individual complaints the Senator has about \nthis or that provision in some detail. I will do so again. At this \npoint, what we are facing is a filibuster of the motion to proceed that \nimpacts the entire legislation.\n  I would ask the Senator if the Senator remembers that when the bill \ncame out of the Senate, it said there would be a 7-day notice if there \nwere a sneak-and-peek search warrant. The House bill had 180 days \nbefore notice would be given. The conferees moved far to the side of \nthe Senate and made it a 30-day notice. Is that the basis of the \nSenator's desire to filibuster this entire bill, the difference between \n7 and 30 days, recognizing in this body we seldom get anything exactly \nas we want it?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if the Senator is asking me a question, \nI am happy to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin controls the time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I spoke at some length this morning about this issue \nwhich I call the numbers game on the sneak and peek. Of course, the \nsneak-and-peek provision is not my only concern. There are four or five \nareas. But I am very concerned about the length of time that somebody \ndoes not get notice that the FBI has come into their home without their \nbeing aware of it and the idea that somehow, after very careful court \ndecisions said there will be exceptions to the requirements of the \nfourth amendment for perhaps 7 days--that was the standard in the court \ndecisions upon which these unusual sneak-and-peek provisions were \nbased--then to somehow have it become reasonable to have a whole month, \na 30-day period, strikes me as extreme.\n  The 7-day standard was not picked out of the air. The 7-day standard \nwas based on those court decisions which made the unusual law, in terms \nof our history as a country in the prohibition against unreasonable \nsearches and seizures--the 7 days was based on those court decisions. \nSo, yes, 30 days, four times more, is unreasonable.\n  After the Government has come into somebody's home and they have had \n7 days, why is it that they should not have to come back and get \npermission to do that for a longer period of time? What is the need for \nthe Government to have 30 days to not tell somebody to do that, when \nyou remember that the Senate version you and I both voted for had the \n7-day period?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, we all don't get exactly what we want, I say to \nthe Senator, No. 1.\n  No. 2, under current law, the so-called sneak-and-peek search by \nwhich you can, if you are investigating a major criminal enterprise or \na terrorist group, actually conduct a search without actually telling \nthe person the day you conducted it, the courts allow you as much time \nas they choose to allow you, for the most part. Some courts may have \nsaid 7 days. I am not aware at all that is the law in this country. It \nis what the judge says. This sets the standard. It says 30 days, and \nthen they have to be repeated after that.\n  We have a bill on the floor that is a matter of life and death. I \nwould ask my colleague to be somewhat more amenable to the fact that he \nwon a pretty good victory in conference but just didn't get everything \nhe wanted in conference by going from the House version of 180 down to \n30.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I could say: Gee, it went from 180 to \n30. I could tell my constituents in Spooner, WI: Look, the Government \nis going to come into your home under a special circumstance when you \nare not around, and it might not have even been the right house, and we \nare making this exception for 7 days because of emergencies in \nimportant situations. You and I both agree in certain circumstances \nthat might occur. But the idea that for a whole month, that for 30 days \nthe Government of the United States of America can come into your home \nwithout telling you they have been there, even if they have made a \nmistake, and they have no responsibility to tell a completely innocent \nperson they made a mistake, to me is serious business.\n  If the Senator could make a credible argument as to why it is \nimportant for the Government to have a whole month after this 7-day \nperiod or 3 more weeks after the 7-day period, it would be one thing. \nBut nobody has even made the argument that it is important for the \nGovernment to have 30 days to conduct this search. It is essentially an \nunreasonable period of time. I think it is important. The erring here \nshould be on the side of people's liberty. It should be on the side of \npeople protecting their homes from unreasonable searches and seizures. \nIt should not be: What is the problem here? The Senator should be happy \nhe got something better than the House version. I don't accept that, as \nsomebody who believes the fourth amendment still has meaning.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator yield and let me make a few remarks?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield his time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I don't want to interfere with the Senator. \nI see quite a few pages of remarks there. I don't want to interfere \nwith that, but I understood the Senator from Virginia and the Senator \nfrom Arkansas were going to introduce legislation, to be followed by \nremarks of mine on the bill before us in my capacity as the ranking \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over \nthis piece of legislation. My remarks will only be 5 or 6 minutes, but \nI wish to make them now or as soon as the Senators from Virginia and \nArkansas have finished.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there had been an informal agreement among \ncolleagues, subject to the Senator who is principally on the floor at \nthis point in time--and I will let him speak for himself--that we were \ngoing to introduce a bill. It would take 4 or 5 minutes for my remarks \nand 4 or 5 for the Senator from Arkansas. We were intending to do that \nat the conclusion of the colloquy between Senators Feingold and \nSessions.\n  Am I correct on that, the Senator had indicated that we could \nproceed?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Certainly, I had no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no recognized time agreement by the \nChair at this time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then I make a unanimous consent request that the Senator \nfrom Arkansas and I have 15 minutes equally divided, to be followed by \nSenator Leahy for such time as he may\n\n[[Page S1337]]\n\nneed and then the distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I do not \nintend to object--I need to complete my remarks by 4:35. I have about \n20 minutes here.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then I revise the request. The Senator from Arkansas and \nI can drop to, say, 10 minutes, and 5 minutes for the Senator from \nVermont. Well, let's drop it down to 8 minutes----\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would need about 6 minutes. And that is cutting down a \nhalf-hour speech to accommodate the Senator from West Virginia, but I \nhave been here for a couple hours ready to give this speech.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have waited many hours here many times. I \nnever make a fuss about it. I will just leave the floor and----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves, what amount of \ntime would the senior Senator from West Virginia like?\n  Mr. BYRD. I have 61 pages, large type. But that will take about 20 \nminutes--15, I think.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have 5 or 6 pages of large type.\n  Mr. BYRD. My problem is, I need to get through by 4:30 or 4:35.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would suggest to my distinguished \ncolleague from Arkansas, recognizing that Senator Byrd has an \nextenuating circumstance he has to take care of, I would be perfectly \nwilling to step aside and regain into the queue following the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is more than generous and more than kind.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The understanding is that I will be done by 4:15 to \naccommodate the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask to \nbe recognized at the completion of the Senator's speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, the Judiciary Committee held an \nimportant hearing. That hearing should be the beginning of the process \nof congressional oversight into what has been called ``the President's \nprogram.'' This is a domestic spying program into emails and telephone \ncalls of Americans without a judge's approval, apparently conducted by \nthe National Security Agency. Having participated in the hearing and \nreviewed the transcript of the Attorney General's testimony, I \nunderstand the fear that this administration is engaged in an elaborate \ncover-up of illegality. I urge them to come clean with us and the \nAmerican people.\n  Perhaps their recent change of course and briefings with the full \nIntelligence Committees of the Senate and House will be a start. We \nneed the whole truth not self-serving rationalizations. Since our \nhearing the Bush administration has had to adjust its course. That is \ngood. They have had to acknowledge that they cannot simply ignore \nCongress and keep us in the dark about this illegal spying program. The \nclassified briefings of the Intelligence Committees are a first step \nbut cannot be used to cover up the facts through secrecy and arbitrary \nlimitations. That is unacceptable. This domestic spying program has \nraised serious concern, not only among Democrats and Republicans here \nin Congress, but also among the Federal judges providing oversight over \nterrorist surveillance and even high-ranking Justice Department \nofficials.\n  I commend Chairman Specter for beginning this investigation. He and I \nhave a long history of conducting vigorous bipartisan oversight \ninvestigations. If the Senate is to serve its constitutional role as a \nreal check on the Executive, thoroughgoing oversight is essential. \nToday, Chairman Specter has announced a second Judiciary Committee \nhearing will be held on February 28. We expect by then to have received \nanswers to the written questions that have already been sent to the \nAttorney General.\n  The question facing us is not whether the Government should have all \nthe tools it needs to protect the American people. Of course it should. \nThe terrorist threat to America's security remains very real, and it is \nvital that we be armed with the tools needed to protect Americans' \nsecurity. That is why I coauthored the PATRIOT Act 5 years ago. That is \nwhy we have amended the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act five \ntimes since 9/11 to provide more flexibility.\n  And that is why within days of the despicable attacks we passed the \nAuthorization for the Use of Military Force on September 14, 2001, to \nsend the United States Armed Forces into Afghanistan to get those who \nplanned and carried out the vicious attacks on September 11.\n  We all agree that we should be wiretapping al-Qaida terrorists. \nCongress has given the President authority to wiretap legally, with \nchecks to guard against abuses when Americans' conversations and email \nare being monitored. But instead, the President has chosen to proceed \noutside the law, without those safeguards. He has done so in a way that \nis illegal and illogical. It remains confusing that the Attorney \nGeneral testified last week that the Bush administration has limited \n``the President's program'' of illegal wire taps to calls with an \ninternational component.\n  The administration's rationale is not limited to calls and emails \nwith an international component or to know al-Qaida operatives.\n  It sounded at our hearing as if what the Bush Attorney General and \nformer White House counsel was saying is that this particular \n``program'' is limited because they were afraid of public outrage. The \nAttorney General said as much to Senator Kohl and confirmed to Senator \nBiden that the Bush administration does not suggest that the \nPresident's powers are limited by the Constitution to foreign calls. \nTheir descriptions of the President's program seem to have more to do \nwith public relations than anything else. It was even branded with a \nnew name in the last few days after it has been known for years as \nsimply ``the President's program.''\n  Senator Feinstein was right to observe after the Attorney General \ndodged and weaved and would not directly answer her questions: ``I can \nonly believe--and this is my honest view--that this program is much \nbigger and much broader than you want anyone to know.'' The Attorney \nGeneral's strenuous efforts to limit the hearing to ``those facts the \nPresident has publicly confirmed'' and ``the program that I am here \ntestifying about today'' suggest that all of us must be skeptical about \nthe secret games the Attorney General was playing through controlling \nthe definition of ``the program'' to include only what he understood to \nexist at the beginning of last week. Senator Feinstein was not fooled. \nNone of us should be. Such limiting definitions are what the Bush \nAdministration used to redefine ``torture'' in order to say that we do \nnot engage in ``torture'' as they redefined it. These are the word \ngames of coverup and deception. It is not al-Qaida surprised that our \nGovernment eavesdrops on its telephone calls and emails. Al-Qaida knows \nthat we eavesdrop and wiretap. It is the American people who are \nsurprised and deceived by the President's program of secret \nsurveillance on them without a judge's approval for the last 5 years--\nespecially, after the Attorney General, the Justice Department, the \nhead of the NSA and the President have all reassured the American \npeople over and over that their rights are being respected--when they \nare not.\n  I wish the President had effectively utilized the authority Congress \ndid grant in the Authorization for the Use of Military Force in \nSeptember 2001 to get Osama bin Laden and those responsible for the \nterrible attacks on September 11. That resolution was what it said it \nwas, authorization to send troops to Afghanistan to get those \nresponsible for 9/11. President Bush should have gotten Osama bin Laden \nwhen Congress authorized him to use our military might against al-Qaida \nin 2001 in Afghanistan. Instead of pursuing him to the end, he pulled \nour best forces out of the fight and diverted them to preparing for his \ninvasion of Iraq.\n  Last week the Attorney General left key questions unanswered and left \nimpressions that are chilling. Under his approach, there is no limit to \nthe power the President could claim for so long as we face a threat of \nterrorism.\n\n[[Page S1338]]\n\nThat is a real threat, which we have long faced and will continue to \nface for years if not decades toe. The Attorney General's testimony \nonly hinted at the full dimensions of the Bush administration's \nillegality. He would not reassure us that Americans' domestic calls, \nemails, or first class mail have not been illegally spied upon.\n  He sought to choose his words carefully to say that he was only \nwilling to speak about the President's ``program'' as it existed that \nday. That means we do not yet know the full dimensions of the program \nas it has evolved over time from 2001 to today. That means we do not \nknow what other illegal activities the Bush administration is still \nendeavoring to hide from us.\n  Along with other Senators I asked about the lack of any limit to the \nlegal rationale the Bush administration has embraced. Their \nrationalization for their actions is rationalization for any action. \nUnder their view of the President's power, he can order houses and \nbusinesses searched without a warrant. Americans can be detained \nindefinitely. Detainees can be tortured. Property could be seized. \nTheir rational is a prescription for lawlessness and the opposite of \nthe rule of law.\n  Regrettably, the Attorney General's testimony last week left much to \nbe desired. He did not provide convincing answers to basic questions, \nrelevant information or the relevant underlying documents. Facts are a \ndangerous thing in a coverup. They are seeking to rewrite history and \nthe law and control the facts that Congress can know.\n  The Bush administration refusal to provide the contemporaneous \nevidence of what the Congress and the Bush administration were \nindicating to each other regarding what the Authorization for the Use \nof Military Force was intended to mean, speaks volumes. Does anyone \nthink that if they had any evidence in support of their after-the-fact \nrationalization they would hesitate to provide it, to trumpet it from \nthe highest media mountain? Of course not.\n  Their failure to provide the information we asked for is not based on \nany claim of privilege, nor could it be. It is just a deafening, \ndamning silence. So what is so secret about precisely when they came to \nthis legal view, this rationalization of their conduct? Could it have \ncome after the illegal conduct had been initiated? Could it have come \nafter the President sought to immunize and sanitize the illegal \nconduct? Could it have come months or years later than the impression \nAttorney General Gonzales is attempting to create? Is that why the Bush \nadministration is also refusing to provide to us the formal legal \nopinions of our Government, the binding opinions of the Office of Legal \nCounsel from 2001 and 2004 that we have also requested? Would review of \nthose opinions show that the after-the-fact legal rationalizations \nchanged over time and in 2001 were not those that the Attorney General \nhas repackaged for public consumption in their current public relations \ncampaign? Now that we know of the existence of the years-old secret \ndomestic spying program that included the warrantless wiretapping of \nthousands of Americans, the Bush administration says that we should \njust trust them. That is a blind trust this administration has not \nearned. We have seen this administration's infamous and short-lived \n``Total Information Awareness'' program and know how disastrous the \nFBI's Carnivore and Trilogy computer programs have been.\n\n  I have read recent reports of a secret Pentagon database containing \ninformation on a wide cross-section of ordinary Americans, including \nQuakers meeting in Florida and Vermont, and have gotten no satisfactory \nexplanation of the Defense Department's Counterintelligence Field \nActivities that spy on law-abiding Americans. I read about a secret \nHomeland Security database and datamining activities, as well. Today we \nread about another database with the names of more than 325,000 \nterrorists but we do not know how many are Americans, how many are \nlisted incorrectly or how the mistakes will be corrected.\n  There are new and disturbing reports that the Defense Department and \nthe FBI have been monitoring U.S. advocacy groups working on behalf of \ncivil rights or against the continuing occupation of Iraq.\n  This is all too reminiscent of the dark days when a Republican \nPresident compiled enemies lists and eavesdropped on political \nopponents and broke into doctors offices and used the vast power of the \nexecutive branch to violate the constitutional rights of Americans. \nThat President resigned in disgrace after articles of impeachment were \nreported in the House of Representatives.\n  I was first elected to the Senate in the aftermath of Watergate and \nthe White House ``plumbers'' and the illegality that led to the \nimpeachment inquiry of President Nixon. The Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act was passed in 1978 as part of the reform and reaction \nto those abuses. It was enacted after decades of abuses by the \nExecutive, including the wiretapping of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \nand other political opponents of earlier Government officials.\n  It was enacted after the White House ``horrors'' of the Nixon years, \nduring which another President asserted that whatever he did was legal \nbecause he was the President. The law has been extensively updated in \naccordance with the Bush administration's requests in the aftermath of \n9/11 and has been modified further in the last 4 years. It is the \ngoverning law. The rule of law and freedoms we enjoy as Americans are \nprinciples upon which this Nation was founded and what we are defending \nand fighting for abroad. This type of covert spying on American \ncitizens and targeted groups on American soil betrays those principles \nand it is unacceptable.\n  What happens to the rule of law if those in power abuse it and only \nadhere to it selectively? What happens to our liberties when the \ngovernment decides it would rather not follow the rules designed to \nprotect our rights? What happens is that the terrorists are allowed to \nachieve a victory they could never achieve on the battlefield. We must \nnot be intimidated into abandoning our fundamental values and treasured \nfreedoms. We cannot let them scare us into giving up what defines us as \nAmericans.\n  There can be no accountability unless the Republican Congress begins \nto do its job and joins with us to demand real oversight and real \nanswers. Senators take an oath of office, too. We swear to support and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States, to bear true faith and \nallegiance to it, and to faithfully discharge our duties so help us \nGod. Let each Senator fulfill that pledge and the Senate can resume its \nintended place in our democracy.\n  Let us protect our national security and the national heritage of \nliberty for which so many have given so much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVermont for his characteristic kindness and courtesy. I thank the \ndistinguished Senator who has been alone in opposing this act in the \nbeginning, at a time when I wish I had voted as he did.\n  In June 2004, 10 peace activists outside of Halliburton, Inc., in \nHouston gathered to protest the company's war profiteering. They wore \npaper hats and were handing out peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, \ncalling attention to Halliburton's overcharging on a food contract for \nAmerican troops in Iraq.\n  Unbeknownst to them, they were being watched. U.S. Army personnel at \nthe top secret Counterintelligence Field Activity, or CIFA, saw the \nprotest as a potential threat to national security.\n  CIFA was created 3 years ago by the Defense Department. Its official \nrole is forced protection; that is, tracking threat and terrorist plots \nagainst military installations and personnel inside the United States. \nIn 2003, then Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz authorized a \nfact-gathering operation code named TALON, which stands for Threat and \nLocal Observation Notice, which would collect raw information about \nsuspicious incidents and feed it to CIFA.\n  In the case of the ``peanut butter'' demonstration, the Army wrote a \nreport on the activity and stored it where? In its files. Newsweek \nmagazine has reported that some TALON reports may have contained \ninformation on U.S. citizens that has been retained in Pentagon files. \nA senior Pentagon official has admitted that the names of these U.S. \ncitizens could number in the thousands. Is this where we are heading? \nIs this where we are heading in\n\n[[Page S1339]]\n\nthis land of the free? Are secret Government programs that spy on \nAmerican citizens proliferating? The question is not, is Big Brother \nwatching? The question is, how many big brothers have we?\n  Ever since the New York Times revealed that President George W. Bush \nhas personally authorized surveillance of American citizens without \nobtaining a warrant, I have become increasingly concerned about dangers \nto the people's liberty. I believe that both current law and the \nConstitution may have been violated, not just once, not twice, but many \ntimes, and in ways that the Congress and the American people may never \nknow because of this White House and its penchant for control and \nsecrecy.\n  We cannot continue to claim we are a nation of laws and not of men if \nour laws, and indeed even the Constitution of the United States itself, \nmay be summarily breached because of some determination of expediency \nor because the President says, ``Trust me.''\n  The Fourth Amendment reads clearly:\n\n       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n     houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches \n     and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall \n     issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or \n     affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be \n     searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\n  The Congress has already granted the executive branch rather \nextraordinary authority with changes in the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act that allow the Government 72 hours after surveillance \nhas begun to apply for a warrant. If this surveillance program is what \nthe President says it is, a program to eavesdrop upon known terrorists \nin other countries who are conversing with Americans, then there should \nbe no difficulty in obtaining a warrant within 72 hours. One might be \ntempted to suspect that the real reason the President authorized \nwarrantless surveillance is because there is no need to have to bother \nwith the inconveniences of probable cause. Without probable cause as a \ncondition of spying on American citizens, the National Security Agency \ncould, and can, under this President's direction, spy on anyone, and \nfor any reason.\n  How do you like that? How about that? We have only the President's \nword, his ``trust me,'' to protect the privacy of the law-abiding \ncitizens of this country. One must be especially wary of an \nadministration that seems to feel that what it judges to be a good end \nalways justifies any means. It is, in fact, not only illegal under our \nsystem, but it is morally reprehensible to spy on citizens without \nprobable cause of wrongdoing.\n  When such practices are sanctioned by our own President, what is the \nmessage we are sending to other countries that the United States is \ntrying to convince to adopt our system? It must be painfully obvious \nthat a President who can spy on any citizen is very unlike the model of \ndemocracy the administration is trying to sell abroad.\n  In the name of ``fighting terror,'' are we to sacrifice every freedom \nto a President's demand? How far are we to go? Can a President order \nwarrantless, house-to-house searches of a neighborhood where he \nsuspects a terrorist may be hiding? Can he impose new restrictions on \nwhat can be printed, what can be broadcast, what can be uttered \nprivately because of some perceived threat--perceived by him--to \nnational security? Laughable thoughts? I think not.\n\n  This administration has so traumatized the people of this Nation, and \nmany in the Congress, that some will swallow whole whatever rubbish \nthat is spewed from this White House, as long as it is in some tenuous \nway connected to the so-called war on terror. And the phrase ``war on \nterror,'' while catchy, certainly is a misnomer. Terror is a tactic \nused by all manner of violent organizations to achieve their goal. This \nhas been around since time began and will likely be with us until the \nlast day of planet Earth.\n  We were attacked by bin Laden and by his organization, al-Qaida. If \nanything, what we are engaged in should more properly be called a war \non the al-Qaida network. But that is too limiting for an administration \nthat loves power as much as this one. A war on the al-Qaida network \nmight conceivably be over someday. A war on the al-Qaida network might \nhave achievable, measurable objectives, and it would be less able to be \nused as a rationale for almost any Government action. It would be \nharder to periodically traumatize the U.S. public, thereby justifying a \nreason for stamping ``secret'' on far too many Government programs and \nactivities.\n  Why hasn't Congress been thoroughly briefed on the President's secret \neavesdropping program, or on other secret domestic monitoring programs \nrun by the Pentagon or other Government entities? Is it because keeping \nofficial secrets prevents annoying congressional oversight? Revealing \nthis program in its entirety to too many Members of Congress could \ncertainly have unmasked its probable illegality at a much earlier date, \nand may have allowed Members of Congress to pry information out of the \nWhite House that the Senate Judiciary Committee could not pry out of \nAttorney General Gonzales, who seemed generally confused about for whom \nhe works--the public or his old boss, the President.\n  Attorney General Gonzales refused to divulge whether purely domestic \ncommunications have also been caught up in this warrantless \nsurveillance, and he refused to assure the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand the American public that the administration has not deliberately \ntapped Americans' telephone calls and computers or searched their homes \nwithout warrants. Nor would he reveal whether even a single arrest has \nresulted from the program.\n  What about the first amendment? What about the chilling effect that \nwarrantless eavesdropping is already having on those law-abiding \nAmerican citizens who may not support the war in Iraq, or who may \nsimply communicate with friends or relatives overseas? Eventually, the \nfeeling that no conversation is private will cause perfectly innocent \npeople to think carefully before they candidly express opinions or even \nsay something in jest.\n  Already we have heard suggestions that freedom of the press should be \nsubject to new restrictions. Who among us can feel comfortable knowing \nthat the National Security Agency has been operating with an expansive \nview of its role since 2001, forwarding wholesale information from \nforeign intelligence communication intercepts involving American \ncitizens, including the names of individuals to the FBI, in a departure \nfrom past practices, and tapping some of the country's main \ntelecommunication arteries in order to trace and analyze information?\n  The administration could have come to Congress to address any aspects \nof the FISA law in the revised PATRIOT Act which the administration \nproposed, but they did not, probably because they wished the completely \nunfettered power to do whatever they pleased, the laws and the \nConstitution be damned.\n  I plead with the American public to tune in to what is happening in \nthis country. Please forget the political party with which you may \nusually be associated and, instead, think about the right of due \nprocess, the presumption of innocence, and the right to a private life. \nForget the now tired political spin that if one does not support \nwarrantless spying, then one may be less than patriotic.\n  Focus on what is happening to truth in this country and then read \nPresident Bush's statement to a Buffalo, NY, audience on April 24, \n2004:\n\n       Any time you hear the United States Government talking \n     about wiretap, it requires--a wiretap requires a court order. \n     Nothing has changed, by the way. When we are talking about \n     chasing down terrorists, we are talking about getting a court \n     order before we do so.\n\n  That statement is false, and the President knew it was false when he \nmade it because he had authorized the Government to wiretap without a \ncourt order shortly after the 2001 attacks.\n  This President, in my judgment, may have broken the law and most \ncertainly has violated the spirit of the Constitution and the public \ntrust.\n  Yet I hear strange comments coming from some Members of Congress to \nthe effect that, well, if the President has broken the law, let's just \nchange the law. That is tantamount to saying that whatever the \nPresident does is legal, and the last time we heard that claim was from \nthe White House of Richard M. Nixon. Congress must rise to the occasion \nand demand answers to the serious questions surrounding warrantless\n\n[[Page S1340]]\n\nspying. And Congress must stop being spooked by false charges that \nunless it goes along in blind obedience with every outrageous violation \nof the separation of powers, it is soft on terrorism. Perhaps we can \ntake courage from the American Bar Association which, on Monday, \nFebruary 13, denounced President Bush's warrantless surveillance and \nexpressed the view that he had exceeded his constitutional powers.\n  There is a need for a thorough investigation of all of our domestic \nspying programs. We have to know what is being done by whom and to \nwhom. We need to know if the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act has \nbeen breached and if the Constitutional rights of thousands of \nAmericans have been violated without cause. The question is: Can the \nCongress, under control of the President's political party, conduct the \ntype of thorough, far-ranging investigation which is necessary. It is \nabsolutely essential that Congress try because it is vital to at least \nattempt the proper restoration of the checks and balances. \nUnfortunately, in a Congressional election year, the effort will most \nlikely be seriously hampered by politics. In fact, today's Washington \nPost reports that an all-out White House lobbying campaign has \ndramatically slowed the congressional probe of NSA spying and may kill \nit.\n  I want to know how many Americans have been spied upon. Yes, I want \nto know how it is determined which individuals are monitored and who \nmakes such determinations. Yes, I want to know if the \ntelecommunications industry is involved in a massive screening of the \ndomestic telephone calls of ordinary Americans like you and me. I want \nto know if the U.S. Post Office is involved. I want to know, and the \nAmerican people deserve to know, if the law has been broken and the \nConstitution has been breached.\n  Historian Lord Acton once observed that:\n\n       Everything secret degenerates, even the administration of \n     justice; nothing is safe that does not show how it can bear \n     discussion and publicity.\n\n  The culture of secrecy, which has deepened since the attacks on \nSeptember 11, has presented this Nation with an awful dilemma. In order \nto protect this open society, are we to believe that measures must be \ntaken that in insidious and unconstitutional ways close it down? I \nbelieve that the answer must be an emphatic ``no.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nat the conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Virginia and the \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner and Mr. Pryor pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2290 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n\n                           Prescription Drugs\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I came to the Senate back in 2001 \nfocused in part on lowering the cost of prescription drugs and the \nimportance of making sure every American senior, every person with \ndisabilities on Medicare, had the opportunity to receive their medicine \nthrough the Medicare system, which has been so very successful. We had \na lot of work, a lot of effort go back and forth on the Medicare bill \nas time went on, related to Medicare Part B, and it changed from being \nabout our seniors to being about what was best for those in the \nindustry, particularly the pharmaceutical industry. We began to see a \nbill that was written, in fact, for the industry rather than for our \nseniors.\n  I stand here this evening calling on my colleagues to join with us on \nthis side of the aisle to fix this, to get it right for people. We have \na Medicare prescription drug plan that has been adopted that costs \ntwice as much for the American taxpayer as it should, much more for \nmost seniors than it should, and provides less in options and less in \nmedicines than it should. It makes no sense to continue with something \nwhich is so confusing, with the cost gaps, which does not allow our \npoorest seniors to get the medicines they need or, if they do, they are \npaying more than they did last year. It makes no sense.\n  We stand here getting ready to go on a recess next week without \nhaving fixed the basics of what is wrong with this program. We know \nthat at the beginning of January, our poorest seniors on Medicaid were \nswitched over to the Medicare Program. But too much of the time the \ncomputers didn't work, the pharmacists did not have records in the \nsystem, and seniors didn't know what plans they were in. They were \narbitrarily put into a plan that may not cover their medicines today or \ncosts much more than it should. We saw the administration indicate that \nwhile this was being fixed, the pharmacists should go ahead and give \npeople their medicines for the first 30 days. In many cases, States \nhave stepped in to try to continue to help our seniors to get the life-\nsaving medicine they desperately need while all of this gets figured \nout.\n  At the end of 30 days, it wasn't figured out. That was the end of \nJanuary. Here we are now on February 15, and we are into a 2-month \nextension, a 60-day extension to try to figure out this mess for our \nseniors.\n  Pharmacists are told to continue giving people their medicine. Of \ncourse, it is the right thing to do. People should not be losing their \nmedicine. But now I am getting calls from pharmacists who are deeply \nconcerned because they are trying to decide whether their small family-\nowned pharmacy, for example, will be able to continue to pay its own \nbills without reimbursement or they are going to have to choose whether \nto help the people in the community they care about, whom they were set \nup to serve, and want to serve and are serving.\n  The question is, What is going to happen? Are the pharmacies going to \nget paid? Are the States going to get reimbursed? What happens to the \nseniors at the end of March? Are we going to see another 30 days or \nanother 60 days because of a failed system that is confusing? We need \nto fix this, and it can be fixed.\n  On this side of the aisle, Senator Jay Rockefeller has legislation \nmany of us cosponsored to make sure that States are reimbursed. We need \nto make sure those who are providing the medicines now will get this \nworked out and will be reimbursed.\n  We also have another series of issues that need to be addressed with \nthis system. People have until May 15, 3 months from today, to decide \nwhether they are going to sign up to be a part of the Medicare system \nin terms of their prescription drugs and wade through all of this. In \nMichigan, there are about 65 plans. God bless them if they can get \nthrough it, or their children or friends can help them get through all \nof this and figure out the plan they are going to be on. But once they \nfigure it out, they are locked into the plan after May 15 for a year. \nShockingly, the people they sign up with aren't locked into the same \nagreement for a year. The drug companies can change what is covered. \nThey don't have to cover the plan.\n  If my mother has worked through a plan that covers four medicines, \nfor example, after May 15 if they decide they will only cover two, or \nmaybe they decide not to cover any of them, that is OK under the \ncurrent system. It is not OK for the American people. It is not OK for \npeople who are counting on us to have a plan that works.\n  What if they want to raise the price? You lock into a system, looks \nlike a good deal, figure out the premium that works for you, figure out \nthe copay, what is covered, after May 15 you are\n\n[[Page S1341]]\n\nlocked in for a year. But the plan could change the price, and it could \nchange it every day, if they wanted to. That is outrageous, absolutely \noutrageous.\n  A colleague of mine, Senator Bill Nelson, introduced a bill I am \ncosponsoring with others to extend that May 15 date to the end of the \nyear to at least give people a year to figure out what is going on.\n  But in addition to that, we need to say once somebody is locked into \na plan, everybody is locked in. You can't say I am obligated or my \nmother is obligated to pay a monthly premium and a copay on a plan they \nsign up for but the other side can change the contract, change the \nprice, and no longer cover the medicine. That is outrageous. It makes \nabsolutely no sense whatsoever.\n  I have an example of a gentleman with MS who called my office a \ncouple of weeks ago. He worked through all of the plans and made a \ndetermination on a plan that would cost him $50 a month for his \nmedicine. He got ready to go to the pharmacy and thought he would call \nto make sure the price he had was right. He called and found out that, \nno, that has been changed now. It is over $500. He is fortunate because \nhe could and did drop that plan because it is not May 15. If that were \nafter May 15, this gentleman with MS would be locked into a plan \ncosting him over $500 for something he thought he was getting for $50. \nWho in their right mind would say that is OK? We can do better than \nthat. We have to do better for our seniors and for the people with \ndisabilities.\n  To add insult to injury, we have a situation where negotiating for \ngroup prices is actually prohibited in this new Medicare bill. How does \nthat make any sense at all? You are talking about over 31 million \npeople on Medicare. That would be a pretty good group discount if they \nwere negotiating together for a group discount. But that is prohibited. \nSo we are locking in the highest possible prices. The taxpayers are \npaying more, the seniors are paying more, and people with disabilities \nare paying more because they are not allowed to do group pricing.\n  The VA, on behalf of veterans, doesn't pay top dollar. They get about \na 40-percent discount. That makes sense. There is no reason why that \nshould not be happening here with a plan that in fact is written for \nseniors and the disabled.\n  What happened? What happened when people didn't get the choices they \nwanted, which is the one I am advocating for, which is a real benefit \nto Medicare--sign up, go to your pharmacy, know what your prices are, \nlike Medicare. What happened? Why didn't that plan get enacted instead \nof this privatized approach forcing people to go through private \ninsurance companies or HMOs to get the help they need? How did that \nhappen? How did it happen that Medicare is stopped from negotiating the \nbest deal? How did that happen? How did it happen that seniors have to \nsign up for a plan and be locked in for a year, but the people on the \nother side providing the benefit, getting the premium and the copay, \ndon't have to have prices that are locked in for a year or the range of \nmedicines they will cover locked in for a year?\n\n  When you look at what happened, unfortunately, this is the \nlegislative process at its worst. Unfortunately, for somebody who came \nhere wanting desperately to make sure that we are providing low-cost \nmedicine for everybody through various means but certainly for our \nseniors, this was an extremely disturbing process that occurred that \nresulted in this new law.\n  The reality is while we were negotiating on the Senate floor, the \nhead of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid was at the same time \nnegotiating himself a job with a pharmaceutical industry. We now know \nthat at least 10 people from the administration working in Medicare and \nMedicaid have now gone out to work with the industry. We also know that \nin the House, one of the committee chairs, at the same time he was \nnegotiating this bill, was negotiating a salary for himself of $2.5 \nmillion to go to work for PhRMA, which is a lobbying arm for the \nbrandname pharmaceutical industry. That is outrageous. When we talk \nabout reform, when we talk about what needs to be done here, we need to \nstart with that. That is the kind of thing that, in fact, we address in \nour honest government bill that has been passed and submitted by the \nDemocrats in the Senate. We need to deal with that.\n  But the reality is we have a bill that was written for the interests \nof people in the industry, not for seniors and the disabled in this \ncountry, and not for the taxpayers either.\n  When you lock in the biggest prices possible, you are not looking out \nfor taxpayers' interests any more than looking out for the interests of \nseniors or the disabled. This needs to be fixed. There needs to be a \nsense of urgency about this.\n  I know at home there is an outrage about this. This needs to be \nfixed. There are those potentially who can be helped by this bill. I \nhope everybody who can receive assistance under this new benefit will \nbe able to wade through the bureaucracy and figure out or have somebody \nhelp them get some help for themselves. Every day, there is a sense of \nurgency for people, but we have to fix this overall.\n  In my book, we need to start over and get this right and decide we \nare going to worry about the person right now, at almost 7 o'clock \ntonight, on a Wednesday night, who has probably had dinner already and \nis sitting down maybe deciding what medicine they take tonight--or do I \nhave my pills for tomorrow? Do I cut them in half so they will last \nlonger? Maybe I can take them every other day. Maybe I am a wife whose \nhusband takes the same blood pressure medicine and can share, even \nthough it is dangerous for your health to do that.\n  This is the United States of America. We can do better than that. We \ncan do better than a Medicare bill that costs too much and provides too \nlittle and does not put Americans first. We can do better than that.\n  My colleagues on this side of the aisle stand ready and are going to \nspeak out every single day to create a sense of urgency about getting \nthis done. We need to work together. Things only happen when we work \ntogether on a bipartisan basis. We need to do that. But we cannot let \nanother month or two go by without having fixed the things that are \nright in front of us. We can't let time go by and not have dealt with \nthe issues that lock people into a system that can raise their prices \nand take away their medicine while they have to continue to pay. That \nis outrageous.\n  There is a better way to do this through Medicare. That is the way it \nshould have been done from the very beginning. There is absolutely no \nreason we can't go back and get this right.\n  I hope everyone who cares about this issue will be speaking out, will \ndo everything they can to raise this issue and call on us to act and \nget this right. This is not the finest hour of this Congress or this \nadministration. We can do much better than what has been done.\n  I am going to continue to do everything in my power to both fix this \nin the short run for people and then make sure we have a real \nprescription drug benefit for people as we go forward. Medicine isn't a \nfrill. This is about life and death for too many people. We need to go \nback and get this right. I am hopeful that, working together, we will.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to speak a few minutes after \nhearing the Senator from Michigan. I thought, first of all, her \naccusations have to be answered. First of all, she made a fairly \nserious charge on a friend of mine, the Congressman from Pennsylvania, \nBucks County, Jim Greenwood, and implied that not only was his vote and \nhis work in trying to secure prescription drugs for seniors part of a \ndeal with the pharmaceutical industry, which I think there is no \nfoundation for whatever, and I believe it also probably is in very poor \ntaste for this Senate to start hanging out people who have left and \ndemeaning their name on the basis of whom they go to work for. If we \ncounted on both sides, we would find plenty of ammunition to do that. I \nthink that is probably not the decorum of the Senate. I hope we will \nnot hear that again.\n  I have lots of differences with former Congressman Greenwood in terms \nof\n\n[[Page S1342]]\n\nsocial issues, but I have always found him to be an honorable man, \nabove board and straightforward in both his intellect and the way he \ncarried himself. To disadvantage his reputation the way that was done I \nfind unconscionable.\n  No. 2, the Senator from Michigan did run a campaign on lowering \nprescription drugs. Her campaign was increased competition and \nreimportation, as well as Government control of every aspect of the \npharmaceutical industry to lower the prices.\n  The program this country has I would not have supported. I do not \nbelieve it is the Government's role for us to supply to seniors in this \ncountry, but this program will supply drugs at half the cost of what \nmost seniors who have been paying for their prescription drugs pay. To \nscare seniors into thinking they have a prescription drug program and \nthey will not have one in 2 months or 2 weeks or 6 months is the type \nof tactic that undermines the integrity of this Senate and is one of \nthe reasons people in this country are losing confidence in elected \nrepresentatives. Quite frankly, the difference is going to be a lot of \nseniors today are having medicines they would not otherwise have.\n  I don't like it, but it is understandable, and we must recognize any \nprogram of this magnitude, when it starts, is going to have trouble. \nThey are having far less problems now. The vast majority of people and \nthe vast majority of pharmacists are not having a problem with the \nprogram. It will still have some bugs for the next couple of months. It \nwill get better every month.\n  The goal of the program was to make sure those people who were \nchoosing between food and medicine did not have to make that choice. \nEven though I'm not a fan of this program, it is accomplishing its \ngoals. To scare seniors with this tactic, to try to scare seniors into \nthinking something they have now will go away, is unconscionable and is \nbeyond the decorum of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as one of the authors of the original USA \nPATRIOT Act, as someone who voted to reauthorize an improved version of \nthe act back in July 2005, and as an American concerned with our \nsecurity, I am glad that we are making progress, but I have some \nmisgivings about the bill being considered today. I will vote to \nproceed and hope there is an opportunity to improve the bill and the \nPATRIOT Act reauthorization even further.\n  I believe that the PATRIOT Act provides important and valuable tools \nfor the protection of Americans from terrorism. These matters should be \ngoverned by law and not by whim. Legislative action should be the clear \nand unambiguous legal footing for Government powers.\n  I am glad that the sunsets that Congressman Armey and I insisted be \nincluded in the 2001 act brought about reconsideration and some \nrefinement of the powers authorized in that measure. Those sunsets \ncontributed to congressional oversight. Without them I expect the Bush \nadministration would have stonewalled our requests for information and \nfor review of the way they were implementing the statute. The sunsets \nwere the reason we have been going through a review and renewal process \nover the last few months. Now the challenge to Congress is to provide \nthe effective oversight that will be needed in the days ahead and to \nensure that there is effective court review of actions that affect the \nrights of Americans.\n  Several specific provisions of this bill reflect modest improvement \nover both the original PATRIOT Act and the reauthorization proposal \ninitially produced by the House-Senate conference. It is with these \nimprovements in mind that I will support Senator Sununu's bill.\n  These improvements, like those contained in the conference report, \nwere hard won. The Bush administration pursued its usual strategy of \ndemanding sweeping Executive powers and resisting checks and balances. \nAs usual, it was short on bipartisan dialogue and long on partisan \nrhetoric. And as usual, the Republican majorities in the House and \nSenate did their utmost to follow the White House's directives and \nprevent any breakout of bipartisanship. But a ray of bipartisanship did \nbreak out, and this reauthorization package is the better for it.\n  Senator Sununu's bill modifies a provision I objected to that would \nhave required American citizens to tell the FBI before they exercise \ntheir right as Americans to seek the advice of counsel. Chairman \nSpecter and I worked together to correct this provision and Senator \nSununu has improved it further. I commend his efforts in this regard.\n  Another important change provided by the Sununu bill builds upon \nanother objection I had and an idea I shared with him to ensure that \nlibraries engaged in their customary and traditional activities not be \nsubject to national security letters as Internet service providers. \nThis is a matter I first raised and feel very strongly about. I commend \nSenator Sununu for the progress he has been able to make in this \nregard. The bill is intended to clarify that libraries as they \ntraditionally and currently function are not electronic service \nproviders, and may not be served with NSLs for business records simply \nbecause they provide Internet access to their patrons. Under this \nclarification, a library may be served with an NSL only if it functions \nas a true Internet service provider, as by providing services to \npersons located outside the premises of the library, but this is an \nunlikely scenario. In most if not all cases, if the Government wants to \nreview library records for foreign intelligence purposes, it will need \na court order to do so. The language I proposed to Senator Sununu in \nthis regard was less ambiguous than that to which the Bush \nadministration would agree. Still, my intent, Senator Sununu's intent, \nand the intent of Congress in this regard should be clear. It is to \nstrengthen the meaning and ensure proper implementation of this \nprovision that I will support this bill. As a supporter, I trust my \nintent will inform those charged with implementing the bill and \nreviewing its proper implementation.\n  It is regrettable that the Bush administration would not engage all \nof us in a bipartisan conversation on ways we could improve the bill. \nThe White House Counsel only spoke to the Republican Senators. In that \nsetting, they negotiated to achieve what they viewed as improvements. \nIt is less than we would have liked. I know that the Republican \nSenators who worked on this bill were well intentioned and I commend \ntheir efforts. Regrettably, I note that one set of changes included in \nthis bill I strongly oppose.\n  The Bush administration has used the last round of discussions with \nRepublican Senators to make the gag order provisions worse, in my view, \nby forbidding any challenge for one year. The Bush administration has \nsimply refused to listen to reason on this and insists on this thumb on \nthe scale of justice. In addition, the bill continues and cements into \nlaw procedures that, in my view, unfairly determine challenges to gag \norders. The bill allows the Government to ensure itself of victory by \ndeclaring that, in its view, disclosure ``may'' endanger national \nsecurity or ``may'' interfere with diplomatic relations. This is the \ntype of provision to which I have never agreed in connection with \nnational security letters or section 215 orders. It will serve to \nprevent meaningful judicial review of gag orders and, in my view, is \nwrong.\n  I will continue to work to improve the PATRIOT Act. I will work to \nprovide better oversight of the use of national security letters and to \nremove the un-American restraints on meaningful judicial review. I will \nseek to monitor how sensitive personal information from medical files, \ngun stores, and libraries are obtained, used, and retained. While we \nhave made some progress, much is left to be done.\n  In 2001, I fought for time to provide some balance to Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft's demands that the Bush administration's antiterrorism \nbill be enacted in a week. We worked hard for 6 weeks to make that bill \nbetter and were able to include the sunset provisions that contributed \nto reconsideration of several provisions over the last several months. \nLast year I worked with Chairman Specter and all the members of the \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate to pass a reauthorization bill in \nJuly. As we proceeded into the House-Senate conference on the measure, \nthe Bush administration and congressional Republicans locked Democratic \nconferees out of their deliberations and wrote the final bill.\n\n[[Page S1343]]\n\nThat was wrong. In December, working with a bipartisan group of \nSenators, we were able to urge reconsideration of that final bill. \nSenators Sununu and Craig were able to use that opportunity to make \nsome improvements. I commend them for what they were able to achieve \nand hope that my support for their efforts has been helpful. I wish \nthat along the way the Bush administration had shown a similar interest \nin working together to get to the best law we could for the American \npeople. When the public's security and liberty interests are at stake, \nit seems especially prudent and compelling to me that every effort \nshould be made to proceed on a bipartisan basis toward constructive \nsolutions. Instead, the White House has chosen once again to try to \npoliticize the situation.\n  Since the conference was hijacked, I have tried to get this measure \nback on the right track. We have been able to achieve some \nimprovements, and that is no small feat given the resistance by this \nWhite House to bipartisan suggestions. I regret that this bill is not \nbetter and that the intransigence of the Bush administration has \nprevented a better balance and better protections for the American \npeople. I will continue to work to provide the tools that we need to \nprotect the American people. I will continue to work to provide the \noversight and checks needed on the use of Government power and will \nseek to improve this reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I understand an agreement has been reached to have the \ncloture vote on the motion to proceed tomorrow morning and then a \ncloture vote on the bill on that Tuesday after we return from the \nrecess.\n  I point out the agreement essentially implements the schedule that \nwould have been followed had I required the Senate to go through all \nthe procedural hoops necessary to reach a vote on the White House deal. \nIt, of course, maintains the 60-vote threshold for passing this \nlegislation.\n  I thank the two leaders for working with me. I have no desire to \ninconvenience my colleagues or force votes in the middle of the night, \nas I understand the majority leader was threatening.\n  I have been trying all day to get an agreement to allow debate and \nvotes on a small number of amendments to this bill. I do not understand \nwhat the majority leader is afraid of or concerned about in rejecting \nthis reasonable request. So while I do not object to the agreement that \nwill be propounded in a few minutes, I hope once we are on the bill \ntomorrow, I will be able to offer amendments and have them voted on.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are at a continuation of a sequence of \nevents which has resulted in a lot of delay, a lot of postponement, \nreally reflecting these insufferable attempts to put off the Nation's \nbusiness with obstruction and stalling. It is disturbing to me because \nwe have so many issues to address in securing America's future, \nsecuring America's future in terms of security, securing America's \nfuture when it comes to looking at health care issues, education \nissues, securing America's prosperity as we look at competition and \ninnovation and things we can do to invest in math and science \neducation, and making us more competitive and creating jobs with \nrespect to China and India.\n  There are so many issues, many of which were outlined by the \nPresident of the United States in the State of the Union Address. Yet \nwe are going through this stall ball, which is reflected now on the \nPATRIOT Act, where we have the PATRIOT Act reauthorization being \nfilibustered by the Democrats, which started in December when we had a \nfilibuster on the reauthorization, and the filibuster now on the motion \nto proceed. Now, with that continued postponement and filibuster, there \nis no way to complete this reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act before we \ngo on recess. There is no way to do it using the tools of the Senate, \nusing the tools of the filibuster.\n  And a filibuster I can understand if you are shaping the bill or if \nthe outcome is not absolutely predetermined. But the outcome here is \nabsolutely predetermined. There will be overwhelming support in this \nbody for this bill. It is important to the safety and security of the \nAmerican people. It breaks down barriers between the intelligence \ncommunity and our law enforcement community, and it does so protecting \nthe civil liberties of Americans.\n  There is overwhelming support. The outcome is determined. Yet we have \nbeen in a quorum call for most of the day, and using the rules of the \nSenate. Again, people say: Well, if it is a filibuster, why aren't \npeople talking all the time? With the rules of the Senate, you do not \nhave to be talking, but you control the Senate in terms of time. With \nthat, we are able to file cloture motions, and then you wait another 30 \nhours, and it is a series of cloture motions, which stretches the time \nout, again, really wasting precious time on the floor of the Senate \nwhen we should be governing, answering, responding to the problems of \neveryday Americans, the challenges of everyday Americans.\n  Looking at what we have gone through recently, for example, the \npensions bill, we passed the pensions bill on November 16, 2005, with a \nvote of 97 to 2, overwhelming support. I asked the Democrats to appoint \nconferees on December 15 of last year. I asked them to appoint \nconferees again, renewing that request on February 1. I have been in \ncontinued conversation and discussions with the Democratic leadership. \nAgain: Not yet, postponement. We know the issues pertaining to the \npensions bill. We can't respond until we can get to conference. The \nHouse is ready with conferees, but we can't go to conference until we \nappoint conferees. Yet once again, those names are not given.\n  I have been in discussion with the Democratic leader. I understand we \nwill be able to appoint conferees in the next 24 hours or so. But it is \nthe pattern of postponement, delay, obstruction, and stopping the \nNation's business that disturbs me.\n  The asbestos bill, I said long ago that we would spend this period on \nasbestos. We were forced by the other side of the aisle to file cloture \non the motion to proceed just to get on that bill, a bill that does \naddress victims who are suffering from asbestos-related disease and who \nare not being compensated fairly. We voted in favor of cloture 98 to 1. \nThen we had delayed consideration of the bill by 3 days by forcing \ncloture, and then we had insistence on a day of debate only--again, \npostponement.\n  The Alito nomination ended up being successful; the advice and \nconsent was carried out. But once again, there was a week delay beyond \nwhich we had worked out a time line before we could bring the Alito \nnomination to the floor.\n  Earlier this week and over the last couple of weeks, we have had to \ndeal with the tax reconciliation bill to go to conference. The \nDemocrats forced the Senate to consider the bill three separate times \njust to get to conference. We had 20 hours of debate the first time, \nwith 17 rollcall votes, and then we had another 20-hour limitation, \nwith 7 more rollcall votes. Then we had a series of votes yesterday \nmorning on motions to instruct before we get to conference. All of that \ndidn't change the bill at all. These are nonbinding motions to \ninstruct--but again, another manifestation of stalling, postponing, \ndelaying.\n  It is frustrating because whether it is the tax relief bill or the \nAlito nomination or the asbestos bill or the pensions bill or, now, the \nPATRIOT Act, it is a pattern that, if we are going to be working \ntogether in the Nation's interest, we cannot continue over the course \nof the year; otherwise, we will not get anything done when we do have \nchallenging problems with health care costs too high, things that we \ncan do on education in terms of math and science, making our country \nand our students more competitive in the future, addressing issues \nsurrounding funding our military.\n  So with that, I plead to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nwork together to make progress. Let's be doing what we are supposed to \nbe\n\n[[Page S1344]]\n\ndoing and that is governing in the Nation's interest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote on the \npending motion to proceed occur at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow with the \nmandatory quorum waived; provided further that if cloture is invoked, \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed immediately to the bill; \nI further ask consent that if a cloture motion is filed on the bill \nduring Thursday's session, then that cloture vote occur at 2:30 p.m. on \nTuesday, February 28; provided further that if cloture is invoked on \nthe bill, then at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, March 1, the bill be read a \nthird time and the Senate proceed to a vote on the bill with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will spend a few minutes talking about \nenergy.\n  There was a letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal, I \nbelieve, this morning or yesterday morning, responding to an editorial \nwhere I had given a response to an editorial. The writer to the Wall \nStreet Journal was taking me to task for saying there is not a ``free \nmarket'' in energy or in oil. My point was there is no free market in \noil. He said he doesn't know what I have been drinking or where I got \nthese thoughts. He said there is a free market in oil.\n  Let me describe all of this in the context of President Bush's State \nof the Union Address in which he suggested that we are ``addicted'' to \noil and we need to move toward greater independence with respect to \noil, especially coming from off our shores.\n  First, on the subject of a free market, there is no free market in \noil. A substantial portion of oil comes from halfway around the world, \nunder the sand in the Middle East, in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, and \nIran. A substantial part of the world supply of oil comes from that \nregion. And those OPEC ministers, having formed a cartel, sit around a \nroom and decide how much they are going to pump and at what price. That \nis a cartel. Cartels are the antithesis of the free market system. Yet \nthe OPEC countries have this cartel, produce a great amount of oil, and \nthey decide how they are going to manipulate price and supply. That is \nNo. 1.\n  No. 2, you have the large oil companies, bigger and much stronger \nbecause of the blockbuster mergers in recent decades, especially in the \nlast one. These oil companies used to be one company, and now they are \na company with several names, such as ExxonMobil. That used to be \nExxon, and that used to be Mobil. They decided to fall in love and get \nmarried, and now it is ExxonMobil. Last year, ExxonMobil made $36.1 \nbillion--the highest profit ever recorded in corporate America. \nExxonMobil.\n  Then there is Chevron-Texaco. It used to be Chevron, and there was \nTexaco. They discovered they liked each other and they got hitched, \nmaking it Chevron-Texaco.\n  And then we have ConocoPhillips, which used to be separate companies. \nOnce they decide to marry up and merge, they save all these names.\n  So there is ExxonMobil, Chevron-Texaco, and ConocoPhillips. Maybe \nsome day they will all merge, and when you put them all together, they \nwill be ExxonMobil ChevronTexaco ConocoPhillips--just one company. The \nblockbuster mergers mean these companies are bigger, stronger, and have \ngreater capacity to influence the marketplace.\n  So you have the OPEC ministers in a closed room talking about supply \nand price and how they affect supply and price and the manner in which \nthey want to affect it. You have the oil companies, larger and \nstronger, having more muscle to influence the marketplace. And third, \nyou have the futures market. The futures market, rather than simply \nproviding liquidity for training, has become an orgy of speculation. So \nthose three things are what determine the price of oil and the price of \ngasoline. It has very little to do with the so-called free market. Yet \nwe hear all these people talk about the free market.\n\n  Do you think it is the free market that gives us a company such as \nExxonMobil, with profits of $36.1 billion last year? That is not a free \nmarket. That is the price of oil which is somewhere between $60 and $70 \na barrel. That is up from $40 a barrel average price of the year \nbefore, at which point this company had the highest profits in their \nhistory. So it went from an original price of $40 a barrel to over $60 \na barrel, and the company had no additional expenses at all. That price \nwent to that level and it stayed relatively at that level, and it has \ndramatically boosted the profits of all of these oil companies--Shell, \n$25.3 billion; B.P., $22.3 billion; $36.1 billion for ExxonMobil.\n  Listen, all the gain is here with the big oil companies and the OPEC \ncountries. All the gain is here, and all the pain is on the side of the \nconsumers, people trying to heat their home in the winter, people \ndriving to the gas pump trying to figure out how much it is going to \ntake to fill up their tank. They are paying the higher prices, and all \nthat goes into these coffers, higher profits. And that is sent also to \nthe OPEC countries.\n  The President talks about an addiction to oil. I would use that term. \nWe are hopelessly addicted to oil. I don't suggest that we have an oil \nanonymous organization where we show up on Wednesday nights and confess \nthat we drove our Humvee 10 blocks to pick up a bagel. What do we \nconfess to? Well, we have a 6,000-pound vehicle and we decided we \nneeded to run an errand to buy a piece of ribbon. That is not what I \nsuggest, nor is it what I expect the President suggest.\n  Addiction to oil. Let's think about that. We suck 84 million barrels \nof oil out of this Earth every day. Every single day, 84 million \nbarrels are sucked out of the Earth. One-fourth of it, 21 million \nbarrels of oil, goes to this country, the United States of America. We \nuse fully one-fourth of all the oil that is extracted from this planet \nevery single day. Sixty percent of all that oil we use in this country \ncomes from off our shore, and much of it from troubled parts of the \nworld. If, God forbid, something should happen to the supply of oil \nfrom Saudi Arabia tomorrow, we would have a huge problem.\n  Our economy is, in fact, attached to the ability to get oil from \nother parts of the world that are very troubled parts of our planet. If \nterrorists, for some reason, interdicted the supply of oil, shut off \nthe supply of oil tomorrow morning, our economy would be in deep \ntrouble. Obviously, there are national security interests here. Does it \nmake sense from a national security standpoint to have the American \neconomy running on 60-percent foreign oil, much of it coming from \ntroubled parts of the world? The answer to that is no. Of course not. \nSo in addition to national security issues, you have the issue of the \nunfairness, of huge profits for the major oil companies, huge profits \nfor the OPEC countries, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and others, and then \nsubstantial pain for people, many of whom can't afford it, pain in the \nform of higher prices.\n  Energy independence: That is the watchword. Energy independence, they \nsay. What does all this mean? Let me go back for a moment to January \n13, 2002. January 13, 2002 is the day the Ambassador for Saudi Arabia \nshowed up at the White House in the Oval Office. Prince Bandar, the \nSaudi Ambassador, was then told at a meeting in the White House on \nJanuary 13 that this country was going to attack Iraq, invade the \ncountry of Iraq. It is interesting that not until the next day did the \nPresident notify the U.S. Secretary of State.\n  On January 13, at a meeting in the Oval Office--and again, this comes \nfrom Bob Woodruff's book ``Bush at War''--the President called in and \nnotified the Saudi Ambassador to the United States that we were going \nto war with Iraq. The following day, the President notified his own \nSecretary of State that he had made a decision to\n\n[[Page S1345]]\n\ngo to war with Iraq. Interesting. It describes something about the \nrelationship this country has with Saudi Arabia and the importance it \nplaces on that relationship.\n  This occurred, by the way, as my colleagues know, following 9/11/\n2001. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi citizens. Of the 19 \nhijackers who flew the planes that hit this country, 15 of them were \nSaudi citizens. We had Saudi citizens rounded up on private airplanes \nleaving this country. Then in January of 2002, the President calls the \nSaudi Ambassador to the Oval Office and tells him we are going to war \nwith Iraq. The following day, he tells our own U.S. Secretary of State \nColin Powell that he has decided to go to war with Iraq. I recite that \nbecause it describes a very special relationship this country has had \nwith Saudi Arabia, and perhaps a very unhealthy relationship. Under the \nSaudis' noses and eyes, I believe, there has existed a network of \nmadrassas, schools and other activities in which terrorist \norganizations developed and flourished, and we bore the brunt of that \non 9/11/2001. As long as they left Saudi Arabia alone, it was going to \nbe all right; They could develop their terrorist cells.\n\n  The fact is when we go to the gas pumps in this country and fill our \ntank and pay the kind of money we are paying for that petroleum, there \nis a fair amount of evidence, and it is written evidence coming from \nnumerous studies, that we are actually helping to finance terrorism. \nThere are many steps we have to take to deal with that.\n  The first and most important step, however, is for us to understand \nthis addiction to oil from the Middle East. The addiction to oil from \nSaudi Arabia and Kuwait and Iraq and elsewhere is a very unhealthy \ncircumstance for our country. It is relatively easy to talk about \naddiction and fairly simple to talk about the need for energy \nindependence. It is quite another thing to get there. I mentioned a \nmoment ago driving a 6,000-pound car to go get a bagel. By that I meant \na Humvee. Understand, I have never driven a Humvee, but I understand \nthey weigh about 6,000 pounds, and I don't mean to demean anybody who \nwould drive a 6,000-pound Humvee. But I do have, as I have indicated \nbefore, only broken knowledge of Latin, and when I drive up to a \nstoplight beside a Humvee and look over and see a Humvee on the street \nnext to me, I think of a Latin phrase I learned in high school, not in \nformal class, but the phrase was ``totus porcus.'' I look at Humvees, \n6,000-pound vehicles, and I understand that no one has been serious in \nthis country about suggesting that we change the way we do things.\n  Are we suggesting that we get better gas mileage in our automobiles \nin any significant way? I looked at a vehicle the other day that is an \nidentical vehicle to the same model that was produced 10 years ago. \nGuess what. It has exactly the same rated gas mileage. In 10 years, we \ncan't add 1 mile per gallon. Whether it is conservation, efficiency, \nbetter gas mileage, or any dozens of other issues on the side of using \npetroleum products, or if it is on the side of producing petroleum \nproducts, we don't have a national plan. We don't have a plan that \nrepresents this country's crucial interests in actually getting to some \nkind of independence or some percentage of independence of foreign oil. \nWe need one, and if the President's call in his State of the Union is \nan honest attempt to get there, I am with him. But it is not so much \nwhat we say, it is what we do that will determine our energy future.\n  I was proud in the last week or two to join my colleagues Senator \nDomenici, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Talent in offering legislation \nto open the Gulf of Mexico for additional production. We believe there \nis somewhere around 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas available for \nproduction in lease 181. It was ready for production in 2001 and the \nPresident took it off the books because his brother was Governor of \nFlorida and didn't want it produced, so it has not been produced. But \nthe fact is on a bipartisan basis here in the Senate we have a fair \nnumber of people on the bill that has been introduced. So let's \nproduce, let's get that natural gas and get it into the pipeline.\n  The issue of additional production, especially coming from renewable \nfuels, makes a great deal of sense to me. I talked about lease 181, \nthat is drilling, and that is production from drilling, oil and natural \ngas. We have a pipeline that needs to get done that we have already \nsupported, from Alaska to the United States, transporting substantial \nportions of natural gas to the United States, but those who are \nsupposed to be doing that have been dragging their feet on that. We do \nneed fossil fuels to be producing more. But we also in the area of \nrenewable fuels need to understand, we can decide to substitute for \ntraditional fuels a substantial amount of renewable energy if we \ndecided our country could do that.\n  Wind energy. Wind energy has great potential. Taking energy from the \nwind and producing electricity from it, perhaps even using electricity \nin the process of electrolysis to separate hydrogen from water and \ncreating hydrogen fuel to run a hydrogen fuel-celled vehicle. All of \nthat makes great sense. But you only do that as a country if you set \ngoals and decide that is the direction you want to head.\n  Biofuels, ethanol. I was part of a group that set a new renewable \nfuel standard, saying we are going to get to 7.5 billion gallons of \nethanol by the year 2012, doubling the use of ethanol in our country. \nThat means you go in the farm fields on a renewable basis every year, \nproduce corn, as an example, and produce ethanol fuel from corn that \nextends America's energy supply and also produces a new market for \nfamily farmers. All of these things are doable. Other countries have \ndone them. Brazil is an example of a country that has done remarkable \nthings with the extension of renewable fuels. Our country has not \nbecause we have not had a plan. Now we are getting there.\n\n  Last year's energy bill was a start. The bill we have introduced on \nlease 181 is another piece. There is much more to do, but we will not \ndo anything close to move toward something you could call energy \nindependence unless we as a country have a rational plan, a thoughtful \nplan.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about who created this energy plan \nof ours. It goes all the way back to the year 2001 when there were \nsecret meetings and we had people coming to town to participate in \nthese meetings, and virtually all of these countries, I understand, \nplayed a role in meetings such as that, although we can't find the \nnames because they claim that the meetings were not public. The Vice \nPresident and others convened meetings, developed an energy policy, but \nit has not been a policy that has done anything other than lead us \ntoward greater dependence on foreign sources of oil.\n  Slightly over 60 percent of our oil is coming from off our shores. \nThat is scheduled in a very short order to go to nearly 70 percent. It \nhas been an inevitable climb, from 60 to now 70. We are going to have \nto decide as a country, are we going to change that or aren't we? There \nis not much more we can do for this country's economic security and \nnational security that is more important than to take this kind of \nenergy plan and to decide to embark on something that will strengthen \nthis country and make us less dependent on unstable parts of the world \nfor the production of our energy and for the transport of our oil.\n  It is interesting to me that we never see that which goes in our gas \ntanks. My father ran a gasoline station, among other things. So when I \nwas a kid, on nights and Saturdays and weekends, I was pumping gas. \nSome people say my occupation hasn't changed very much. But I pumped \ngas, and people would drive up and I filled their car with gas. I did \nthat when I was a kid for years and years. When you think about this, \nwe never see that product. So it comes from under the sands of Saudi \nArabia. The Lord has seen fit to give us this wonderful bounty called \nthe United States of America. There is no other country quite like it. \nYet we have this prodigious appetite for energy. We use one-fourth of \nall the oil that is sucked out of this earth every day, and a \nsubstantial part of the oil, for some reason, exists halfway around the \nworld under the sands of a very troubled part of our globe.\n  So in Saudi Arabia, where there are dramatic deposits of oil--we are \nnot quite sure how large those deposits are because the Saudis won't \nlet anyone verify all that--it is pulled out of that sand. It is \ncheaper to pull it out of that sand than anywhere else on the face of\n\n[[Page S1346]]\n\nthe Earth, and then it is put in a pipe, it goes to a refinery, put in \nanother pipe, goes to a dock, put on a ship, comes to this country on a \ntanker, is offloaded into a refinery, goes on a pipeline, perhaps goes \nto a truck, gets sent to a gasoline station, pumped through an \nunderground tank and pumped through a hose into your car, and no one \nhas ever seen it. Nobody has ever seen that gallon of gasoline. That is \nthe way it works. But literally in this country our economy and our \nfuture are held prisoner by this unbelievable dependence on foreign \noil.\n  It affects everything we do. It affects our foreign policy. We have \ngone to war over oil. It affects everything. So the question for this \nPresident and this Congress, not tomorrow but today, is how do you \nreach some sort of independence? How do we make our country less \ndependent on something we desperately need for our future economic \nopportunity and growth, less dependent on oil from overseas? I know \nthere are as many suggestions on how to write a new energy policy as \nthere are Members of the Senate. But I do not believe, with all due \nrespect, that there is a Republican or Democratic way to write an \nenergy policy or a conservative or liberal way to write an energy \npolicy. I think there is a right way and a wrong way and a smart way \nand a pretty stupid way. But it seems to me that we need to begin to \nfind the best of what each of our political parties has to offer in \nterms of an energy policy and find a way to construct, from the best of \nwhat both have to offer, something to assure us that our economy will \nhave the energy that it needs for the future.\n\n  This is not some academic discussion, as is often the case on the \nfloor of the Senate. There are people who, this winter, do not have \nenough money to heat their homes because prices are too high. That does \nnot, by the way, have anything to do with supply and demand. You see \nthese profits, the highest profits in history for the oil companies. \nYou don't see gasoline lines. Has anybody seen any gas lines around \nhere, people lining up for hours to get gas? No. There is no shortage. \nIn fact, something came across my desk yesterday--an oil company is \nshutting down a portion of its refinery because it wants to restrict \nsupply. Why? It wants to keep prices where they are. They like these \nhigh prices.\n  There are a lot of ramifications. There are enormous riches for the \nbig oil companies and enormous pain for the American consumer, and that \nis the short term. The question in the short term is always: Who is \ngoing to stand up for the American consumer? I introduced a bill, along \nwith my colleague, Senator Dodd, from Connecticut, a couple of months \nago, that would have imposed a windfall profit tax on these oil company \nprofits, only on the profits above $40 a barrel. Incidentally, last \nyear, 2004, represented the highest profits in history at $40 a barrel. \nWe proposed a windfall profits tax at 50 percent on profits over $40 a \nbarrel, with all the proceeds to be sent back to the American consumers \nas a rebate.\n  Interestingly enough, I guess it was 65 Senators voted against that \nbecause they do not want to take money from the oil industry and \nprovide it as a rebate to consumers. I think you ought to even the \nscore a bit. There is no justification for these profits. These \ncompanies have not exhibited additional expenses. These are \nextraordinary profits, the highest in the history of corporate America, \nand all the American consumers are feeling the pain. That is the short \nterm. We have tried, in the short term, to address it with the windfall \nprofits tax rebate bill and we have not been successful. But that is \nnot over.\n  Then in the intermediate to longer term, we have to do more. We need \na real plan for energy independence, a real plan, one that addresses \nalternative fuels and renewable fuels, enhances the recovery of fossil \nfuels in a way that is protective of our environment. We need to be \ndoing all of that together, reaching a set of goals that our country \nestablishes. You can't do this without leadership.\n  So my hope is that, both from the White House and also from here, we \nwill begin to see some leadership toward energy independence--I mean \nsome real leadership. Talking about it is one thing. It doesn't mean \nanything. People have been talking about this forever. It is a waste of \nbreath unless it results in real planning.\n  I have mentioned before the book McCullough wrote about John Adams. \nIt was a fascinating book and had lingering questions from John Adams \nas he was traveling around the world representing this new country they \nwere trying to form. He spent time in France and England. He would \nwrite back to his wife Abigail. At least as I read the book, it would \nseem that he would write to Abigail and lament to her in his letters: \nWhere will the leadership come from to form this new country of ours? \nWhere will the leadership emerge to put this new country we want to \nform together? Then in the next letter he would write: Well, then, \nthere is really only us--there's me, there's George Washington, there's \nBen Franklin, there's Thomas Jefferson, there's Madison, there's \nMason--and of course in the rearview mirror of history we know the \n``only us'' now represents some of the greatest human talent ever \nassembled. But every generation of Americans asks the identical \nquestion: Where will the leadership come from? Where will the \nleadership emerge, real leadership, to steer this country in the right \ndirection?\n  With respect to energy policy which relates to both our economic \nsecurity and our national security, time is wasting, and there is not a \nmore important subject for us to address, beginning now. The question \nremains: Where will the leadership come from? That question is \naddressed to both the White House and the Congress, asking for, \nfinally, what the best of both political parties ought to have to offer \nthis country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/15/senate-section/article/S1346-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1346-S1347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        AMERICAN ASSOCIATION ON MENTAL RETARDATION AWARD WINNERS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join the Illinois \nchapter of the American Association on Mental Retardation, AAMR, in \nrecognizing the recipients of the 2006 Direct Service Professional \nAward. These individuals are being honored for their outstanding \nefforts to enrich the lives of people with developmental disabilities \nin Illinois.\n  These recipients have displayed a strong sense of humanity and \nprofessionalism in their work with persons with disabilities. Their \nefforts have inspired the lives of those for whom they care, and they \nare an inspiration to me as well. They have set a fine example of \ncommunity service for all Americans to follow.\n  These honorees spend more than 50 percent of their time at work in \ndirect, personal involvement with their clients. They are not primarily \nmanagers or supervisors. They are direct service workers at the \nforefront of America's effort to care for people with special needs. \nThey do their work every day with little public recognition, providing \nmuch needed care and assistance that is unknown except to those with \nwhom they work.\n  It is my honor and privilege to recognize the Illinois recipients of \nAAMR's 2006 Direct Service Professional Award: Cheryl Case, Lisa \nCutter, Jane Flores, Cindy Block, Patricia Bzdyl, Don Collins, Judy \nHicks, Holly Spence, Della Reese, Sarah McRae, and Kathy Slimmer.\n  I know my fellow Senators will join me in congratulating the winners \nof the 2006 Direct Service Professional Award. I applaud their \ndedication and thank them for their service.\n\n\n                    army specialist patrick herried\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, in February 6, 2006, one of South \nDakota's sons made the ultimate sacrifice while serving in Iraq. Army \nSP Patrick Herried died when an improvised explosive device detonated \nunder the armored military vehicle he was driving. He was a member of \nthe 4th Squadron, 14th Calvary Regiment, 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat \nTeam based in Fort Wainwright, AK.\n  Specialist Herried was a 1994 graduate of Roosevelt High School in \nSioux Falls and was fondly remembered by his classmates and teachers. \nLike many South Dakotans, he was passionate about sports and the \noutdoors. He was a member of the Roosevelt High School football team \nand enjoyed skateboarding and mountain biking.\n  Specialist Herried joined the Army in the hopes that it would lead to \na better career and even college. His mother, Rita, agreed that the \nArmy had a positive impact on her son. ``He was just a good kid,'' she \nsaid. ``Really quiet, but very directed since he's been in the service. \nHe was a good son.''\n  Patrick's family and friends are in my thoughts and prayers during \nthis trying time. Coming to terms with the\n\n[[Page S1347]]\n\nloss of any soldier who gives their life in defense of freedom is \ndifficult. While we are awed by Patrick's selfless sacrifice, we are \nreminded that his life ended much too soon. It is my sincere hope that \nPatrick's family may take some small measure of comfort knowing our \nNation is eternally grateful for his dedicated service to our country.\n\n\n                         Corporal Jesse Zamora\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life \nof CPL Jesse Zamora. I regret to inform my colleagues that Corporal \nZamora was killed in Beiji, Iraq on February 3, 2006.\n  Those close to Corporal Zamora recognized an indomitable love of \ncountry and a passionate desire to serve his Nation in the military at \nan early age. Friends and family recall that as a young man, Corporal \nZamora would often drive into the desert near Las Cruces in his pickup \nto practice his marksmanship. This simple custom is indicative of his \ndiscipline and certainly contributed to his great skill as a soldier. \nIn 2002, shortly after graduating from high school, Corporal Zamora \nenlisted in the Army, fully knowing that his country would soon be \ngoing to war abroad. This brave decision illustrates the selflessness \nthat endeared Corporal Zamora in the hearts of his family members, his \nfriends, and his brothers in arms. It also demonstrates his passionate, \ndisciplined approach to service and the selfless demeanor that is at \nthe core of what the American Army prides its servicemembers on honor, \nduty, humility, and loyalty.\n  His mother Paola, stepfather Sergio, sister Christy, are all in our \nthoughts. His brother Tyrel is another brave member of the U.S. Army, \nand I hope that we can soon guarantee him a swift and safe journey \nhome.\n  Corporal Zamora was assigned as an infantryman to the 101st Airborne \nDivision. We can never fully express our gratitude for our veterans' \nservice; I ask that we stop now to thank Corporal Zamora and \nacknowledge the sacrifice of his family for their Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/15/senate-section/article/S1347-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1347-S1348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    POPULARITY OF ``GROUNDHOG DAY''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday and a few weeks ago, I invoked \nthe movie ``Groundhog Day'' starring Bill Murray to provide a \nperspective on consideration of our tax reconciliation package. For the \nedification of my esteemed colleagues and other interested parties, I \nask unanimous consent that an article originally published in the \nFebruary 14, 2005, issue of ``National Review'' titled, ``A Movie for \nAll Time,'' be printed in the Record. This article provides some \ninformation on the film and its enduring popularity.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the National Review, Feb. 14, 2005]\n\n                          A Movie For All Time\n\n                          (By Jonah Goldberg)\n\n       Here's a line, you'll either recognize, or you won't: \n     ``This is one time where television really fails to capture \n     the true excitement of a large squirrel predicting the \n     weather.'' If you don't recognize this little gem, you've \n     either never seen Groundhog Day or you're not a fan of what \n     is, in my opinion, one of the best films of the last 40 \n     years. As the day of the groundhog again approaches, it seems \n     only fitting to celebrate what will almost undoubtedly join \n     It's a Wonderful Life in the pantheon of America's most \n     uplifting, morally serious, enjoyable, and timeless movies.\n       When I set out to write this article, I thought it'd be fun \n     to do a quirky homage to an offbeat flick, one I think is \n     brilliant as both comedy and moral philosophy. But while \n     doing what I intended to be cursory research--how much \n     reporting do you need for a review of a twelve-year-old movie \n     that plays constantly on cable?--I discovered that I wasn't \n     alone in my interest. In the years since its release the film \n     has been taken up by Jews, Catholics, Evangelicals, Hindus, \n     Buddhists, Wiccans, and followers of the oppressed Chinese \n     Falun Gong movement. Meanwhile, the Internet brims with \n     weighty philosophical treatises on the deep Platonist, \n     Aristotelian, and existentialist themes providing the skin \n     and bones beneath the film's clown makeup. On National Review \n     Online's group blog, The Corner, I asked readers to send in \n     their views on the film. Over 200 e-mails later I had learned \n     that countless professors use it to teach ethics and a host \n     of philosophical approaches. Several pastors sent me excerpts \n     from sermons in which Groundhog Day was the central metaphor. \n     And dozens of committed Christians of all denominations \n     related that it was one of their most cherished movies.\n       When the Museum of Modern Art in New York debuted a film \n     series on ``The Hidden God: Film and Faith'' two years ago, \n     it opened with Groundhog Day. The rest of the films were \n     drawn from the ranks of turgid and bleak intellectual cinema, \n     including standards from Ingmar Bergman and Roberto \n     Rossellini. According to the New York Times, curators of the \n     series were stunned to discover that so many of the 35 \n     leading literary and religious scholars who had been polled \n     to pick the series entries had chosen Groundhog Day that a \n     spat had broken out among the scholars over who would get to \n     write about the film for the catalogue. In a wonderful essay \n     for the Christian magazine Touchstone, theology professor \n     Michael P. Foley wrote that Groundhog Day is ``a stunning \n     allegory of moral, intellectual, and even religious \n     excellence in the face of postmodern decay, a sort of \n     Christian-Aristotelian Pilgrim's Progress for those lost in \n     the contemporary cosmos.'' Charles Murray, author of Human \n     Accomplishment, has cited Groundhog Day more than once as one \n     of the few cultural achievements of recent times that will be \n     remembered centuries from now. He was quoted in The New \n     Yorker declaring, ``It is a brilliant moral fable offering an \n     Aristotelian view of the world.''\n       I know what you're thinking: We're talking about the movie \n     in which Bill Murray tells a big rat sitting on his lap, \n     ``Don't drive angry,'' right? Yep, that's the one. You might \n     like to know that the rodent in question is actually Jesus--\n     at least that's what film historian Michael Bronski told the \n     Times. ``The groundhog is clearly the resurrected Christ, the \n     ever-hopeful renewal of life at springtime, at a time of \n     pagan-Christian holidays. And when I say that the groundhog \n     is Jesus, I say that with great respect.''\n       That may be going overboard, but something important is \n     going on here. What is it about this ostensibly farcical film \n     about a wisecracking weatherman that speaks to so many on \n     such a deep spiritual level?\n\n\n                       THOROUGHLY POSTMODERN PHIL\n\n       A recap is in order. Bill Murray, the movie's indispensible \n     and perfect lead, plays Phil Connors, a Pittsburgh weatherman \n     with delusions of grandeur (he unselfconsciously refers to \n     himself as ``the talent''). Accompanied by his producer and \n     love interest, Rita (played by Andie MacDowell), and a \n     cameraman (Chris Elliott), Connors goes on assignment to \n     cover the Groundhog Day festival in Punxsutawney, Pa., at \n     which ``Punxsutawney Phil''--a real groundhog--comes out of \n     his hole to reveal how much longer winter will last. Connors \n     believes he's too good for the assignment--and for \n     Punxsutawney, Pittsburgh, and everything in between. He is a \n     thoroughly postmodern man: arrogant, world-weary, and \n     contemptuous without cause.\n       Rita tells Phil that people love the groundhog story, to \n     which he responds, ``People like blood sausage, too, people \n     are morons.'' Later, at the Groundhog Festival, she tells \n     him: ``You're missing all the fun. These people are great! \n     Some of them have been partying all night long. They sing \n     songs 'til they get too cold and then they go sit by the fire \n     and get warm and then they come back and sing some more.'' \n     Phil replies, ``Yeah, they're hicks, Rita.''\n       Phil does his reporting schtick when the groundhog emerges \n     and plans to head home as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, \n     a blizzard stops him at the outskirts of town. A state \n     trooper explains that the highway's closed: ``Don't you watch \n     the weather reports?'' the cop asks. Connors replies \n     (blasphemously, according to some), ``I make the weather!'' \n     Moving on, the cop explain's he can either turn around to \n     Punxsutawney or freeze to death. ``Which is it?'' he asks. \n     Connors answers, ``I'm thinking, I'm thinking.'' Reluctantly \n     returning to Punxsutawney, Connors spends another night in a \n     sweet little bed and breakfast run by the sort of un-ironic, \n     un-hip, decent folks he considers hicks.\n       The next morning, the clock radio in his room goes off and \n     he hears the same radio show he'd heard the day before, \n     complete with a broadcast of ``I Got You Babe'' and the \n     declaration, ``It's Groundhog Day!'' At first, Connors \n     believes it's an amateurish gaffe by a second-rate radio \n     station. But slowly he discovers it's the same day all over \n     again. ``What if there is no tomorrow?'' he asks. ``There \n     wasn't one today!''\n       And this is the plot device for the whole film, which has \n     seeped into the larger culture. Indeed, ``Groundhog Day'' has \n     become shorthand for (translating nicely) ``same stuff, \n     different day.'' Troops in Iraq regularly use it as a rough \n     synonym for ``snafu,'' which (also translated nicely) means \n     ``situation normal: all fouled-up.'' Connors spends an \n     unknown number of days repeating the exact same day over and \n     over again. Everyone else experiences that day for the \n     ``first'' time, while Connors experiences it with Sisyphean \n     repetition. Estimates vary on how many actual Groundhog Days \n     Connors endures. We see him relive 34 of them. But many more \n     are implied. According to Harold Ramis, the co-writer and \n     director, the original script called for him to endure 10,000 \n     years in Punxsutawney, but it was probably closer to ten.\n       But this is a small mystery. A far more important one is \n     why the day repeats itself and why it stops repeating at the \n     end. Because the viewer is left to draw his own conclusions, \n     we have what many believe is the best\n\n[[Page S1348]]\n\n     cinematic moral allegory popular culture has produced in \n     decades--perhaps ever.\n       Interpretations of this central mystery vary. But central \n     to all is a morally complicated and powerful story arc to the \n     main character. When Phil Connors arrives in Punxsutawney, \n     he's a perfect representative of the Seinfeld generation: \n     been-there-done-that. When he first realizes he's not crazy \n     and that he can, in effect, live forever without \n     consequences--if there's no tomorrow, how can you be \n     punished?--he indulges his adolescent self. He shoves \n     cigarettes and pastries into his face with no fear of \n     lovehandles or lung cancer. ``I am not going to play by their \n     rules any longer,'' he declares as he goes for a drunk-\n     driving spree. He uses his ability to glean intelligence \n     about the locals to bed women with lies. When that no longer \n     gratifies, he steals money and gets kinky, dressing up and \n     play-acting. When Andie MacDowell sees him like this she \n     quotes a poem by Sir Walter Scott: ``The wretch, concentrated \n     all in self/Living, shall forfeit fair renown/And, doubly \n     dying, shall go down/To the vile dust, from whence he sprung/\n     Unwept, unhonored, and unsung.''\n       Connors cackles at her earnestness. ``You don't like \n     poetry?'' She asks. ``I love poetry,'' he replies, ``I just \n     thought that was Willard Scott.''\n       Still, Connors schemes to bed Rita with the same techniques \n     he used on other women, and fails, time and again. When he \n     realizes that his failures stem not from a lack of \n     information about Rita's desires but rather from his own \n     basic hollowness, he grows suicidal. Or, some argue, he grows \n     suicidal after learning that all of the material and sexual \n     gratification in the world is not spiritually sustaining. \n     Either way, he blames the groundhog and kills it in a murder-\n     suicide pact--if you can call killing the varmint murder. \n     Discovering, after countless more suicide attempts, that he \n     cannot even die without waking up the next day he begins to \n     believe he is ``a god.'' When Rita scoffs at this--noting \n     that she had twelve years of Catholic school (the only \n     mention of religion in the film)--he replies that he didn't \n     say he was ``the God'' but merely ``a god.'' Then again, he \n     remarks, maybe God really isn't all-powerful, maybe he's just \n     been around so long he knows everything that's going to \n     happen. This, according to some, is a reference to the \n     doctrine of God's ``middle knowledge,'' first put forward by \n     the 16th-century Jesuit theologian Luis de Molina, who argued \n     that human free will is possible because God's omniscience \n     includes His knowledge of every possible outcome of every \n     possible decision.\n\n\n                           THE METAMORPHOSIS\n\n       The point is that Connors slowly realizes that what makes \n     life worth living is not what you get from it, but what you \n     put into it. He takes up the piano. He reads poetry--no \n     longer to impress Rita, but for its own sake. He helps the \n     locals in matters great and small, including catching a boy \n     who falls from a tree every day. ``You never thank me!'' he \n     yells at the fleeing brat. He also discovers that there are \n     some things he cannot change, that he cannot be God. The \n     homeless man whom Connors scorns at the beginning of the film \n     becomes an obsession of his at the end because he dies every \n     Groundhog Day. Calling him ``pop'' and ``dad,'' Connors tries \n     to save him but never can.\n       By the end of the film, Connors is no longer obsessed with \n     bedding Rita. He's in love with her, without reservation and \n     without hope of his affection being requited. Only in the \n     end, when he completely gives up hope, does he in fact \n     ``get'' the woman he loves. And with that, with her love, he \n     finally wakes on February 3, the great wheel of life no \n     longer stuck on Groundhog Day. As NR's own Rick Brookhiser \n     explains it, ``The curse is lifted when Bill Murray blesses \n     the day he has just lived. And his reward is that the day is \n     taken from him. Loving life includes loving the fact that it \n     goes.''\n       Personally, I always saw Nietzsche's doctrine of the \n     eternal return of the same in this story. That was \n     Nietzsche's idea--metaphorical or literal--to imagine life as \n     an endless repetition of the same events over and over. How \n     would this shape your actions? What would you choose to live \n     out for all eternity? Others see Camus, who writes about how \n     we should live once we realize the absurdity of life. But \n     existentialism doesn't explain the film's broader appeal. It \n     is the religious resonance--if not necessarily explicit \n     religious themes--that draws many to it. There's much to the \n     view of Punxsutawney as purgatory: Connors goes to his own \n     version of hell, but since he's not evil it turns out to be \n     purgatory, from which he is released by shedding his \n     selfishness and committing to acts of love. Meanwhile, Hindus \n     and Buddhists see versions of reincarnation here, and Jews \n     find great significance in the fact that Connors is saved \n     only after he performs mitzvahs (good deeds) and is returned \n     to earth, not heaven, to perform more.\n       The burning question: Was all this intentional? Yes and no. \n     Ultimately, the story is one of redemption, so it should \n     surprise no one that it speaks to those in search of the \n     same. But there is also a secular, even conservative, point \n     to be made here. Connors's metamorphosis contradicts almost \n     everything postmodernity teaches. He doesn't find paradise or \n     liberation by becoming more ``authentic,'' by acting on his \n     whims and urges and listening to his inner voices. That \n     behavior is soul-killing. He does exactly the opposite: He \n     learns to appreciate the crowd, the community, even the \n     bourgeois hicks and their values. He determines to make \n     himself better by reading poetry and the classics and by \n     learning to sculpt ice and make music, and most of all by \n     shedding his ironic detachment from the world.\n       Harold Ramis and Danny Rubin, the writer of the original \n     story, are not philosophers. Ramis was born Jewish and is now \n     a lackadaisical Buddhist. He wears meditation beads on his \n     wrist, he told the New York Times, ``because I'm on a \n     Buddhist diet. They're supposed to remind me not to eat, but \n     actually just get in the way when I'm cutting my steak.'' \n     Rubin's original script was apparently much more complex and \n     philosophical--it opened in the middle of Connors's sentence \n     to purgatory and ended with the revelation that Rita was \n     caught in a cycle of her own. Murray wanted the film to be \n     more philosophical (indeed, the film is surely the best sign \n     of his reincarnation as a great actor), but Ramis constantly \n     insisted that the film be funny first and philosophical \n     second.\n       And this is the film's true triumph. It is a very, very \n     funny movie, in which all of the themes are invisible to \n     people who just want to have a good time. There's no \n     violence, no strong language, and the sexual content is about \n     as tame as it gets. (Some e-mailers complained that Connors \n     is only liberated when he has sex with Rita. Not true: They \n     merely fall asleep together.) If this were a French film \n     dealing with the same themes, it would be in black and white, \n     the sex would be constant and depraved, and it would end in \n     cold death. My only criticism is that Andie MacDowell isn't \n     nearly charming enough to warrant all the fuss (she says a \n     prayer for world peace every time she orders a drink!). And \n     yet for all the opportunities the film presents for self-\n     importance and sentimentality, it almost never falls for \n     either. The best example: When the two lovebirds emerge from \n     the B to embrace a happy new life together in what Connors \n     considers a paradisiacal Punxsutawney, Connors declares, \n     ``Let's live here!'' They kiss, the music builds, and then in \n     the film's last line he adds: ``We'll rent to start.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/15/senate-section/article/S1348-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1348-S1349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MASTER SERGEANT WOODROW WILSON KEEBLE\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, few Americans will recognize MSG Woodrow \nWilson Keeble's name, but he was an American hero who served in two \nwars and who deserves our Nation's most prestigious recognition.\n  I first became aware of Master Sergeant Keeble's bravery in 2002 \nafter being contacted by members of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe \nwho were requesting that his Distinguished Service Cross be upgraded to \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor is our Nation's \nhighest military honor, and while it is awarded on behalf of Congress, \nthe Department of Defense determines the qualifications and eligibility \nfor the decoration.\n  Master Sergeant Keeble, a member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux \nTribe, was an Army veteran of both World War II and the Korean War. For \nhis service, he was awarded the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, the \nSilver Star, and the Distinguished Service Cross.\n  The last decoration was awarded for his actions near Kumsong, North \nKorea in October 1951. After many days of fighting in the bitter cold, \nand though he was wounded, Master Sergeant Keeble single handedly took \nout three enemy machinegun emplacements.\n  The first hand accounts of his actions that day read like something \nout of an old Hollywood movie. What he did was real, and his bravery in \nthe face of enemy fire was so remarkable that the men in his company \ntwice submitted recommendations that he receive the Congressional Medal \nof Honor. In both cases, the recommendation was lost.\n  Like so many veterans, Master Sergeant Keeble returned home after the \nwar a humble man, not interested in pursuing medals or personal honors. \nHe died in 1982, and without the dedicated effort of his family and \nfellow veterans, most of us would have never had the opportunity to \nlearn about Master Sergeant Keeble. Today, there is an ongoing effort \nto document his actions through the eyewitness testimony of those \nveterans who served with him. This is a valuable effort and will help \npreserve an important part of our Nation's history.\n  After first hearing in 2002 of his heroic actions, I contacted the \nSecretary of the Army to request a review of Master Sergeant Keeble's \ncase. Based on an affidavit from a member of the company that the \noriginal recommendations for the Medal of Honor had been lost, I asked \nthe Secretary to waive the normal 3-year statute of limitations \nrequirement for consideration of the Medal of Honor.\n  Since that time, I have been in close contact with the Army. The \nrecommendation to posthumously award\n\n[[Page S1349]]\n\nthe Medal of Honor to Master Sergeant Keeble has been reviewed by an \nArmy Decorations Board, a Senior Army Decorations Board, and now awaits \nfinal action by the Secretary of the Army. At this point, I do not know \nif the Secretary's decision will be positive or negative, but I remain \nin contact with his office almost every month as I have for the past 4 \nyears.\n  While all of us who care about this case are frustrated by the amount \nof time this has taken, the thorough review process is an indication of \nthe importance of the Medal of Honor and the seriousness of this \ndecision.\n  As more people learn about Master Sergeant Keeble's story, more \npeople are joining in the effort to pay tribute to his service. While I \ndo not know what the Army's ultimate decision will be in this case, I \ncan think of no one more deserving of this honor than Master Sergeant \nKeeble.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/15/senate-section/article/S1349-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DAVID EVANS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I today pay tribute to David Lee Evans, who \nhad been a member of the staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations. \nHe was a much loved Senate employee who was universally respected for \nhis professionalism, patience, and generosity. Dave passed away last \nweek at age 65.\n  Dave was born on October 23, 1940, in Baltimore, MD. He graduated \nfrom Kenwood High School, and attended Howard Community College. Dave \nserved the Government as a journeyman printer and as a member of the \nForeign Relations Committee staff for nearly 23 years. In addition to \nhis service as a printer with the Government Printing Office, he had \nbeen Chief Clerk and Assistant Chief Clerk to the committee during the \n1970's. Dave ably served under Foreign Relations Committee Chairmen \nFulbright, Sparkman, Church, Helms, Biden and myself.\n  Committee members and staff relied heavily on Dave to shepherd our \nmany publications through all aspects of the printing process. As a \nreturning chairman in 2003, I brought in a new majority staff, many of \nwhom were working for a Senate committee for the first time. Dave was \nindispensable in teaching these staff members committee printing \nprocedures and patiently answering their many questions. Dave's skills, \ntechnical ability and good humor made it possible to meet our many \ndeadlines.\n  During the last 6 years that Dave served the committee, we printed \nmore than 400 documents, including executive and legislative reports, \nhearings, and other materials. Without Dave's tireless efforts and hard \nwork, the committee would not have been able to produce such a huge \nvolume of material. Dave took great pride in his work and ensured that \nthe material he produced met his and the committee's high standards. \nEvery publication Dave printed reflected favorably on the committee, \nthe Senate, and the U.S. Government as a whole.\n  In addition to his extensive public service, Dave will be remembered \nas a loyal friend and loving husband and father. He is survived by his \nwife Angela, who is currently the Executive Clerk of the Committee on \nForeign Relations; four children, David T. Evans, Christopher Evans, \nKathleen Canby, and Susan Hennegan; a stepson, Jeffrey Morris; six \ngrandchildren; and a brother.\n  All who knew Dave will miss his kindness and grace. The thoughts of \nthe entire Foreign Relations Committee are with his family as they \nremember and celebrate the life of an exemplary man.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks that \nour chairman, Senator Lugar, has just made regarding our fine printer \nDavid L. Evans, who died last week at the age of 65 after a courageous \nbattle with cancer.\n  Dave did two tours as a GPO printer assigned to the Committee on \nForeign Relations, first in the 1970s, and then again from 1999 until \nabout a year ago. For a time in the late 1970s, he also served directly \non the staff of the committee as its deputy clerk and then its chief \nclerk. The committee, and the country, are indebted to him for his \nservice for performing some of the numerous jobs that are essential to \nthe operation of this institution, but which are largely unrecognized \nby the public.\n  Dave was a big and wonderfully gentle man. He reveled in the \nopportunity to serve his country, even though it meant working long \ndays, and sometimes well into the night, to ensure that the committee's \nhearings and reports were printed promptly and properly. Why he put up \nwith us I don't know, but it was an honor to have him on our staff, and \nto know that the published output of our committee had been subject to \nhis careful and professional scrutiny. He was unfailingly courteous and \npleasant to his co-workers, and never complained about his heavy \nworkload.\n  Like so many others in this country afflicted with cancer, Dave was \ntaken from us too soon. We will miss him greatly. Our thoughts and \nprayers are with all his family and especially his wife Angie Evans, \nwho shared Dave's work ethic and continues to bless us with her service \nto the committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/15/senate-section/article/S1349-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I today speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On May 17, 2003, Sakia Gunn was fatally stabbed during a \nconfrontation about her being a lesbian. Gunn and four other girls were \nwaiting for a bus in downtown Newark, NJ, when Richard McCullough and \nanother man drove up and asked them to go to a party. When the girls \nresponded that they were lesbians, the two men began spewing homophobic \ninsults and McCullough proceeded to stab her.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. By \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/15/senate-section/article/S1349-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ATLANTA GAS LIGHT\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS.

Atlanta Gas Light was \nincorporated on February 16, l856, and first brought lighting to the \nstreets of Atlanta on Christmas Day, 1855, enabling accelerated growth \nand the safe transportation of individuals and supplies necessary for \nthe expansion of Atlanta and its surrounding communities.\n  At the end of the Civil War, Atlanta Gas Light quickly rebuilt its \ngasworks to facilitate the rebuilding of Atlanta and contributed to the \nrise of that great city to a major commercial center in the Southeast. \nIn the 1920s, it invested in the State of Georgia's future by creating \nthe infrastructure necessary to allow natural gas to flow under the \ncity streets and into homes, ending the need to manufacture gas and \nexpanding the use of gas throughout the Southeast region. In the early \n20th century, it began expanding its services to cities and towns \nthroughout the State of Georgia.\n  Atlanta Gas Light has faithfully served the State of Georgia and its \ncitizens for each of its 150 years, delivering natural gas to customers \nthroughout the State safely and reliably. This great company and its \ntop-notch employees deserve special recognition. They have contributed \nmillions of dollars and hours to improve the communities in which they \nwork and live.\n  Atlanta Gas Light and its Georgia parent, AGL Resources, continue to \nprovide exemplary service to their customers and remain a vital part of \nthe economic development of the State of Georgia. I am pleased to take \nthis opportunity to commemorate the contributions and services rendered \nby Atlanta Gas Light in its 150 years of operation and look forward to \nits continued service for the next 150 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/15/senate-section/article/S1349-4", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1349-S1350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATING MS.

Mr. President, today I rise to congratulate Ms. \nSara J.\n\n[[Page S1350]]\n\nKieffner for being selected as one of the Cincinnati Enquirer \nnewspaper's Women of the Year.\n  The Enquirer has done well to bestow this honor on Ms. Kieffner. \nAmong her many causes, she has done much for the St. Elizabeth Medical \nCenter Foundation. She has also devoted herself to promoting breast \nhealth awareness and to raising funds for the Fischer Homes Breast \nCenter. If that weren't enough, she is also active with the Redwood \nRehabilitation Center, the American Cancer Society's Northern Kentucky \nchapter, United Ministries, and her church, Gloria Dei Lutheran.\n  Since The Enquirer's Women of the Year program was started in 1968, \nover 350 women in Greater Cincinnati and northern Kentucky have been \nsingled out for their efforts to improve the community for everyone.\n  Ms. Kieffner has certainly deserved this citation.

COOPER\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to extend my \ncongratulations to Mr. William A. Cooper for long standing service as \nCEO at TCF Financial Corporation, a financial holding company based in \nMinnesota.\n  Bill Cooper came to TCF Financial in 1985 with an impressive \nfinancial leadership record which included serving as a senior auditor \nfor Touche, Ross and company, a Detroit firm, and as President of \nHuntington Bank of Ohio.\n  But based on my personal relationship with Bill, I would say his high \nschool graduating class might have voted him ``least likely to become a \nbanker.'' The banker's stereotype is reserved, cautious, and \ncircumspect. Bill Cooper is bold, innovative, and refreshingly \noutspoken. Like his hero Ronald Reagan, there is never a bit of doubt \nas to where Bill Cooper stands.\n  During his tenure as CEO, Bill Cooper directed an impressive \nexpansion of TCF Financial in Minnesota and elsewhere through his \ninnovative leadership. From 1985 until his retirement in January, he \nhelped to transform TCF Financial from a small banking enterprise into \na thriving operation offering industry leading consumer services.\n  Bill Cooper is a complete citizen. He not only led a thriving \nbusiness that provided thousands of jobs and financial services to a \nbig proportion of our Minnesota population, Bill used his voice, his \nphilanthropy, and his influence to improve as many sectors of our State \nas he could get his hands on.\n  His work on education not only shaped Minnesota public policy, his \npersonal involvement changed the lives of hundreds of disadvantaged \nstudents forever. He has always had strong opinions and had the \nintegrity to walk his talk.\n  Although Mr. Cooper has retired as CEO of TCF, he has not completely \ngiven himself up to the ski slopes or the golf courses as he continues \nto remain active in the financial world and in his community.\n  Minnesota has been fortunate to have a business leader like Mr. \nCooper who not only has enriched the economy of Minnesota and elsewhere \nbut has also used his good name, time, and money for the good of the \ncommunity. Minnesota celebrates its lakes and farms and excellent \ncommunity assets. One of the secrets of our success is community \nleaders like Bill Cooper who shoulder the burdens of leadership.\n  I congratulate Bill Cooper, the staff of TCF, and his family on his \ngreat career and leadership in the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/15/senate-section/article/S1350-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CELEBRATING THE 2006 BILL TALLMAN MEMORIAL WOMEN IN SCIENCE CONFERENCE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise \nto recognize the Bill Tallman Memorial Women in Science Conference, \nwhich is taking place in five communities across South Dakota from \nMarch 6th through April 28th. Since 2002, the Women in Science \nConference has helped to increase interest in science and technological \ncareers among young women in my State. This year's conference is named \nin honor of the event's distinguished founder, Bill Tallman, who \nunexpectedly passed away last October while helping with recovery \nefforts for victims of the devastating hurricanes that hit the gulf \ncoast region.\n  The cover of a recent Time magazine features a rather amusing photo \nof a child wearing a lab coat and oversized safety goggles, accompanied \nby the question, ``Is America Flunking Science?'' Though the image is \nmeant to provoke a laugh, its associated question is anything but \nhumorous. By a number of measures, our country is losing the \ncompetitive edge in scientific and technological fields that has for \ndecades been a key driver of our economy. At a national level, one of \nthe factors that undoubtedly contributes to this unfortunate trend is a \nfailure to adequately engage young women in scientific pursuits. It is \ndiscouraging to think of how many important discoveries were never made \nbecause of our failure to cultivate young female researchers.\n  In my view, the Women in Science Conference in South Dakota is a \nshining example of what we as a nation need more of to retain and \nenhance our superiority in science and technology. The conference \nprovides young women in South Dakota with first-hand exposure to women \nwho are leading important scientific work. These distinguished \nindividuals share the rewards and challenges of their work in vivid, \nconcrete terms, and serve as role models for young women who may not \nhave previously considered a career in science.\n  The Women in Science Conference is a product of a partnership between \nseveral forward-thinking entities, including the National Weather \nService, and several nonprofit and private-sector sponsors. Without \ntheir contributions, this valuable event would not be possible.\n  It is a fitting tribute to Bill Tallman that this year's event should \nbe named in his honor. Bill not only recognized the need for an \nimportant event like this, he actually made it happen. I know it was \none of his proudest achievements, and I congratulate everyone who \nparticipates in the Women in Science Conference for helping to carry on \nhis vision. Bill began his career by engaging young minds as a high \nschool math teacher, and then served his country during a 20-year \ncareer as a meteorologist with the U.S. Air Force. Next he joined the \nNational Weather Service, and was eventually asked to lead its \nAberdeen, SD, office. At a time of national tragedy, few were surprised \nat Bill's willingness to serve again by leaving home to help those who \nhad suffered through the devastating hurricanes that hit the gulf coast \nin 2005.\n  Bill Tallman's presence will be sorely missed by all the people whose \nlives he touched. It is my distinct pleasure to honor his life and \nlegacy by recognizing the Bill Tallman Memorial Women in Science \nConference today in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/15/senate-section/article/S1350-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1350-S1351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MRS. PRANKE'S SIXTH GRADE\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise \ntoday to recognize a special group of students. It is not often enough \nthat we have the opportunity to acknowledge heartwarming acts of \nkindness, but the actions of Mrs. Pranke's sixth grade class in \nSheyenne, ND, have touched my hearts and the heart of their neighbors \nand friends.\n  Throughout their years together, this special group of students has \nworked on more than one occasion to serve their community. As third \ngraders, they collected box tops to purchase new games for schoolmates. \nWhen they were in the fifth grade, they initiated a fundraiser and \ndonated the proceeds to benefit the Ronald McDonald House in Fargo, ND.\n  As one final project, Mrs. Pranke's sixth graders decided to treat \nthemselves to a class trip to celebrate their years together before \nmoving on to junior high school.\n  The students began holding fundraisers for their trip. Shortly after \nall the funds had been raised, they learned that the father of one of \ntheir classmates had fallen critically ill. The students quickly \nrealized that they were faced with unique circumstances. After learning \nof their classmate's situation and the medical costs the family would \nbear, the children chose to donate the funds to their classmate's \nfamily and forgo their class trip.\n  By choosing to help with their hard-earned money rather than keep it \nfor themselves, these extraordinary students proved that their hearts \nare deep and their love for one another is real.\n  Again, I commend Mrs. Pranke's exceptional group of sixth graders. \nTheir\n\n[[Page S1351]]\n\nselfless act has reaffirmed that values and kindness have not been lost \nin a world that so often focuses on the negative. I wish them all the \nbest as they finish their final year together and continued success as \nthey begin a new chapter of their education next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/15/senate-section/article/S1351-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:40 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1989.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to increasing efforts to protect our borders; to the \n     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                        HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 149\n\n       Whereas, The current war on terrorism began on September \n     11, 2001, when terrorists unleashed an air assault on \n     America's military and financial power centers, hijacking \n     commercial jets and crashing them into the World Trade Center \n     in New York, and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. Thousands \n     of innocent people were murdered, and the nation suffered \n     billions of dollars in damages from this terrorist attack; \n     and\n       Whereas, In response to these attacks, in order to better \n     coordinate security and emergency response efforts, the \n     federal government created a federal Homeland Security \n     Department and increased funding for antiterrorism efforts \n     throughout the nation. Border security is an essential \n     component of creating a safe and secure homeland and the \n     federal Homeland Security Department is responsible for \n     protecting our borders. As a border state that includes some \n     of the busiest points of entry in the country, Michigan is \n     acutely aware of the importance of this issue; and\n       Whereas, In order to increase our safety and security, \n     Congress should pass legislation that provides increased \n     manpower and more sophisticated technology at the national \n     borders. United States border security should be able to \n     apprehend illegal immigrants and potential terrorists before \n     they enter the country and cause mayhem; now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the\n\n[[Page S1352]]\n\n     United States to increase efforts to protect our borders; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, \n     the President of the United States Senate, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/15/senate-section/article/S1352-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1352-S1353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following executive reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. INHOFE for the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n       *Terrence L.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease and permanently extend the expensing of certain depreciable \nbusiness assets for small businesses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nallows small businesses to expense more of their equipment and business \nassets, which will create incentives to invest in new technology, \nexpand their operations, and most important, create jobs. Small \nbusinesses are the engine that drives our Nation's economy and I \nbelieve this bill strengthens their ability to lead the way. I am \npleased to join my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Trent Lott, as \nwe work to move this important initiative for small businesses from \nlegislation to law.\n  As the Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I drafted this bill in response to the repeated \nrequests from small businesses in my State of Maine and from across the \nNation to allow them to expense more of their investments like the \npurchase of essential new equipment. The bill modifies the Internal \nRevenue Code and would double the amount a small business can expense \nfrom $100,000 to $200,000, and make the provision permanent as \nPresident Bush also proposed this change in his fiscal year 2007 tax \nproposals. With small businesses representing 99 percent of all \nemployers, creating 75 percent of net new jobs and contributing 51 \npercent of private-sector output, their size is the only `small' aspect \nabout them.\n  By doubling and making permanent the current expensing limit and \nindexing these amounts for inflation, this bill will achieve two \nimportant objectives. First, qualifying businesses will be able to \nwrite off more of the equipment purchases today, instead of waiting \nfive, seven or more years to recover their costs through depreciation. \nThat represents substantial savings both in dollars and in the time \nsmall businesses would otherwise have to spend complying with complex \nand confusing depreciation rules. Moreover, new equipment will \ncontribute to continued productivity growth in the business community, \nwhich economic experts have repeatedly stressed is essential to the \nlong-term vitality of our economy.\n  Second, as a result of this bill, more businesses will qualify for \nthis benefit because the phase-out limit will be increased to $800,000 \nin new assets purchases. At the same time, small business capital \ninvestment will be pumping more money into the economy. Accordingly, \nthis is a win-win for small business and the economy as a whole.\n  This legislation is a tremendous opportunity to help small \nenterprises succeed by providing an incentive for reinvestment and \nleaving them more of their earnings to do just that. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this vital legislation as we work \nwith the President to enact this investment incentive into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2287\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. INCREASE AND PERMANENT EXTENSION FOR EXPENSING FOR \n                   SMALL BUSINESS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 179(b) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to dollar limitation) \n     is amended by striking ``$25,000 ($100,000 in the case of \n     taxable years beginning after 2002 and before 2008)'' and \n     inserting ``$200,000''.\n       (b) Increase in Qualifying Investment at Which Phaseout \n     Begins.--Paragraph (2) of section 179(b) of such Code \n     (relating to reduction in limitation) is amended by striking \n     ``$200,000 ($400,000 in the case of taxable years beginning \n     after 2002 and before 2008)'' and inserting ``$800,000''.\n       (c) Inflation Adjustments.--Section 179(b)(5)(A) of such \n     Code (relating to inflation adjustments) is amended--\n       (1) in the matter preceding clause (i)--\n       (A) by striking ``after 2003 and before 2008'' and \n     inserting ``after 2007'', and\n       (B) by striking ``the $100,000 and $400,000 amounts'' and \n     inserting ``the $200,000 and $800,000 amounts'', and\n       (2) in clause (ii), by striking ``calendar year 2002'' and \n     inserting ``calendar year 2006''.\n       (d) Revocation of Election.--Section 179(c)(2) of such Code \n     (relating to election irrevocable) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(2) Revocability of election.--Any election made under \n     this section, and any specification contained in any such \n     election, may be revoked by the taxpayer with respect to any \n     property, and such revocation, once made, shall be \n     irrevocable.''.\n       (e) Off-the-Shelf Computer Software.--Section \n     179(d)(1)(A)(ii) of such Code (relating to section 179 \n     property) is amended by striking ``and before 2008''.\n       (f) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2006.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 2288. A bill to modernize water resources planning, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce the Water Resources \nPlanning and Modernization Act of 2006, a bill that will bring our \nwater resources policy into the 21st century. I am pleased to be joined \nin this legislation by the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain. We \nhave worked together for some time to modernize the Army\n\n[[Page S1355]]\n\nCorps of Engineers and I thank Senator McCain for his continued \ncommitment to this issue.\n  While the bill I introduce today builds on previous bills we have \nintroduced, it also reflects a recognition that we must respond to the \ntragic events of the recent past and make thoughtful and needed \nadjustments to all aspects of water resources planning. The entire \nprocess, starting with the principles upon which the plans are \ndeveloped all the way to discussions of where we invest limited Federal \nresources, requires attention and revision. Congress cannot afford to \nauthorize additional Army Corps projects until it has considered and \npassed the Water Resources Planning and Modernization Act. From \nensuring large projects are sound to using natural resources to protect \nour communities, modernizing water resources policy is a national \npriority.\n  As we all know, our nation is staring down deficits that just a few \nyears ago were unimaginable. Our current financial situation demands \npragmatic approaches and creative collaborations to save taxpayer \ndollars. The bill I introduce today provides a unique opportunity to \nendorse such approaches and such collaborations.\n  The Water Resources Planning and Modernization Act of 2006 represents \na sensible effort to increase our environmental stewardship and \nsignificantly reduce the government waste inherent in poorly designed \nor low priority Army Corps of Engineers projects. It represents a way \nto both protect the environment and save taxpayer dollars. With support \nfrom Taxpayers for Common Sense Action, National Taxpayers Union, \nCitizens Against Government Waste, American Rivers, National Wildlife \nFederation, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense, Republicans for \nEnvironmental Protection, Sierra Club, and the World Wildlife Fund, the \nbill has the backing of a strong, creative coalition.\n  Several years have passed since I tried to offer an amendment to the \nWater Resources Development Act of 2000 to require independent review \nof Army Corps of Engineers' projects. Much has changed since the 2000 \ndebate, and yet too much remains the same. We now have more studies \nfrom the National Academy of Sciences, the Government Accountability \nOffice, and others--even the presidentially appointed U.S. Commission \non Ocean Policy--to point to in support of our efforts. We have also \nhad a disaster of historic proportion. Hurricane Katrina highlighted \nproblems that we would be irresponsible to ignore.\n  The Water Resources Planning and Modernization Act of 2006 can be \nbroadly divided into five parts: focusing our resources, identifying \nvulnerabilities, updating the Army Corps of Engineer's planning \nguidelines, guaranteeing sound projects and responsible spending, and \nvaluing our natural resources.\n  Our current prioritization process is not serving the public good. To \naddress this problem, the bill reinvigorates the Water Resources \nCouncil, originally established in 1965, and charges it with providing \nCongress a prioritized list of authorized water resource projects \nwithin one year of enactment and then every two years following. The \nprioritized list would also be printed in the Federal register for the \npublic to see. The Water Resources Council described in the bill, \ncomprised of cabinet-level officials, would bring together varied \nperspectives to shape a list of national needs. In short, the \nprioritization process would be improved to make sure Congress has the \ntools to more wisely invest limited resources while also increasing \npublic transparency in decision making both needed and reasonable \nimprovements to the status quo.\n  Taking stock of our vulnerabilities to natural disasters must also be \na priority. For this reason, the bill also directs the Water Resources \nCouncil to identify and report to Congress on the Nation's \nvulnerability to flood and related storm damage, including the risk to \nhuman life and property, and relative risks to different regions of the \ncountry. The Water Resources Council would also recommend improvements \nto the Nation's various flood damage reduction programs to better \naddress those risks. Many of these improvements were discussed in a \ngovernment report following the 1993 floods so the building blocks are \navailable; we just need to update the assessment. Then, of course, we \nmust actually take action based on the assessment. To help speed such \naction, the legislation specifies that the administration will submit a \nresponse to Congress, including legislative proposals to implement the \nrecommendations, on the Water Resources Council report no later than 90 \ndays after the report has been made public. We cannot afford to have \nthis report, which will outline improvements to our flood damage \nreduction programs, languish like others before it.\n  The process by which the Army Corps of Engineers analyzes water \nprojects should undergo periodic revision. Unfortunately, the corps' \nprinciples and guidelines, which bind the planning process, have not \nbeen updated since 1983. This is why the bill requires that the Water \nResources Council work in coordination with the National Academy of \nSciences to propose periodic revisions to the corps' planning \nprinciples and guidelines, regulations, and circulars.\n  Updating the project planning process should involve consideration of \na variety of issues, including the use of modern economic analysis and \nthe same discount rates as used by all other Federal agencies. Simple \nsteps such as these will lead to more precise estimates of project \ncosts and benefits, a first step to considering whether a project \nshould move forward.\n  To ensure that corps' water resources projects are sound, the bill \nrequires independent review of those projects estimated to cost over \n$25 million, those requested by a Governor of an affected State, those \nwhich the head of a Federal agency has determined may lead to a \nsignificant adverse impact, or those that the Secretary of the Army has \nfound to be controversial. As crafted in the bill, independent review \nshould not increase the length of time required for project planning \nbut would protect the public both those in the vicinity of massive \nprojects and those whose tax dollars are funding projects.\n  We must do a better job of valuing our natural resources, such as \nwetlands, that provide important services. These resources can help to \nbuffer communities from storms and filter contaminants out of our \nwater. Recognizing the role of these natural systems, the Water \nResources Planning and Modernization Act of 2006 requires that corps' \nwater resources projects meet the same mitigation standard as required \nby everyone else under the Clean Water Act. Where States have adopted \nstronger mitigation standards, the corps must meet those standards. I \nfeel very strongly that the Federal government should be able to live \nup to this requirement. Unfortunately, all too often, the corps has not \ncompleted required mitigation. This legislation will make sure that \nmitigation is completed, that the true costs of mitigation are \naccounted for in corps' projects, and that the public is able to track \nthe progress of mitigation projects.\n  Modernizing all aspects of our water resources policy will help \nrestore credibility to a Federal agency historically rocked by scandal \nand currently plagued by public skepticism. Congress has long used the \nArmy Corps of Engineers to facilitate favored pork-barrel projects, \nwhile periodically expressing a desire to change its ways. Back in \n1836, a House Ways and Means Committee report referred to Congress \nensuring that the corps sought ``actual reform, in the further \nprosecution of public works.'' Over 150 years later, the need for \nactual reform is stronger than ever.\n  My office has strong working relationships with the Detroit, Rock \nIsland, and St. Paul District Offices that service Wisconsin, and I do \nnot want this bill to be misconstrued as reflecting on the work of \nthose district offices. What I do want is the fiscal and management \ncloud over the entire Army Corps to dissipate so that the corps can \ncontinue to contribute to our environment and our economy without \nwasting taxpayer dollars.\n  I wish the changes we are proposing today were not needed, but \nunfortunately that is not the case. In fact, if there were ever a need \nfor the bill, it is now. We must make sure that future corps' projects \nproduce predicted benefits, are in furtherance of national priorities, \nand do not have negative environmental impacts. This bill gives the \ncorps the tools it needs to a better job and focuses the attention of \nCongress\n\n[[Page S1356]]\n\non national needs, which is what the American taxpayers and the \nenvironment deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2288\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Council.--The term ``Council'' means the Water \n     Resources Council established under section 101 of the Water \n     Resources Planning Act (42 U.S.C. 1962a).\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Army.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MODERNIZATION \n                   POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States that all water \n     resources projects carried out by the Corps of Engineers \n     shall--\n       (1) reflect national priorities for flood damage reduction, \n     navigation, and ecosystem restoration; and\n       (2) seek to avoid the unwise use of floodplains, minimize \n     vulnerabilities in any case in which a floodplain must be \n     used, protect and restore the extent and functions of natural \n     systems, and mitigate any unavoidable damage to natural \n     systems.\n\n     SEC. 4. MEETING THE NATION'S WATER RESOURCE PRIORITIES.\n\n       (a) Report on the Nation's Flood Risks.--Not later than 18 \n     months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Council \n     shall submit to the President and Congress a report \n     describing the vulnerability of the United States to damage \n     from flooding and related storm damage, including the risk to \n     human life, the risk to property, and the comparative risks \n     faced by different regions of the country. The report shall \n     assess the extent to which the Nation's programs relating to \n     flooding are addressing flood risk reduction priorities and \n     the extent to which those programs may unintentionally be \n     encouraging development and economic activity in floodprone \n     areas, and shall provide recommendations for improving those \n     programs in reducing and responding to flood risks.

The Council shall submit to Congress a \n     prioritized list of water resources projects of the Corps of \n     Engineers every 2 years following submission of the initial \n     report. In preparing the prioritization of projects, the \n     Council shall endeavor to balance stability in the rankings \n     from year to year with recognizing newly authorized projects. \n     Each report prepared under this paragraph shall provide \n     documentation and description of any criteria used in \n     addition to those set forth in paragraph (2) for comparing \n     water resources projects and the assumptions upon which those \n     criteria are based.\n       (2) Project prioritization criteria.--In preparing a report \n     under paragraph (1), the Council shall prioritize each water \n     resource project of the Corps of Engineers based on the \n     extent to which the project meets at least the following \n     criteria:\n       (A) For flood damage reduction projects, the extent to \n     which such a project--\n       (i) addresses the most critical flood damage reduction \n     needs of the United States as identified by the Council;\n       (ii) does not encourage new development or intensified \n     economic activity in flood prone areas and avoids adverse \n     environmental impacts; and\n       (iii) provides significantly increased benefits to the \n     United States through the protection of human life, property, \n     economic activity, or ecosystem services.\n       (B) For navigation projects, the extent to which such a \n     project--\n       (i) produces a net economic benefit to the United States \n     based on a high level of certainty that any projected trends \n     upon which the project is based will be realized;\n       (ii) addresses priority navigation needs of the United \n     States identified through comprehensive, regional port \n     planning; and\n       (iii) minimizes adverse environmental impacts.\n       (C) For environmental restoration projects, the extent to \n     which such a project--\n       (i) restores the natural hydrologic processes and spatial \n     extent of an aquatic habitat;\n       (ii) is self-sustaining; and\n       (iii) is cost-effective or produces economic benefits.\n       (3) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that to \n     promote effective prioritization of water resources projects, \n     no project should be authorized for construction unless a \n     final Chief's report recommending construction has been \n     submitted to Congress, and annual appropriations for the \n     Corps of Engineers' Continuing Authorities Programs should be \n     distributed by the Corps of Engineers to those projects with \n     the highest degree of design merit and the greatest degree of \n     need, consistent with the applicable criteria established \n     under paragraph (2).\n       (c) Modernizing Water Resources Planning Guidelines.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and every 5 years thereafter, the \n     Council, in coordination with the National Academy of \n     Sciences, shall propose revisions to the planning principles \n     and guidelines, regulations, and circulars of the Corps of \n     Engineers to improve the process by which the Corps of \n     Engineers analyzes and evaluates water projects.\n       (2) Public participation.--The Council shall solicit public \n     and expert comment and testimony regarding proposed revisions \n     and shall subject proposed revisions to public notice and \n     comment.\n       (3) Revisions.--Revisions proposed by the Council shall \n     improve water resources project planning through, among other \n     things--\n       (A) focusing Federal dollars on the highest water resources \n     priorities of the United States;\n       (B) requiring the use of modern economic principles and \n     analytical techniques, credible schedules for project \n     construction, and current discount rates as used by all other \n     Federal agencies;\n       (C) discouraging any project that induces new development \n     or intensified economic activity in flood prone areas, and \n     eliminating biases and disincentives to providing projects to \n     low-income communities, including fully accounting for the \n     prevention of loss of life as required by section 904 of the \n     Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (33 U.S.C. 2281);\n       (D) eliminating biases and disincentives that discourage \n     the use of nonstructural approaches to water resources \n     development and management, and fully accounting for the \n     flood protection and other values of healthy natural systems;\n       (E) utilizing a comprehensive, regional approach to port \n     planning;\n       (F) promoting environmental restoration projects that \n     reestablish natural processes;\n       (G) analyzing and incorporating lessons learned from recent \n     studies of Corps of Engineers programs and recent disasters \n     such as Hurricane Katrina and the Great Midwest Flood of \n     1993; and\n       (H) ensuring the effective implementation of the National \n     Water Resources Planning and Modernization Policy established \n     by this Act.\n       (d) Revision of Planning Guidelines.--Not later than 180 \n     days after submission of the proposed revisions required by \n     subsection (b), the Secretary shall implement the \n     recommendations of the Council by incorporating the proposed \n     revisions into the planning principles and guidelines, \n     regulations, and circulars of the Corps of Engineers. These \n     revisions shall be subject to public notice and comment \n     pursuant to subchapter II of chapter 5, and chapter 7, of \n     title 5, United States Code (commonly known as the \n     ``Administrative Procedure Act''). Effective beginning on the \n     date on which the Secretary carries out the first revision \n     under this paragraph, the Corps of Engineers shall not be \n     subject to--\n       (1) subsections (a) and (b) of section 80 of the Water \n     Resources Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 1962d-17); and\n       (2) any provision of the guidelines entitled ``Economic and \n     Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related \n     Land Resources Implementation Studies'' and dated 1983, to \n     the extent that such a provision conflicts with a guideline \n     revised by the Secretary.\n       (e) Availability.--Each report prepared under this section \n     shall be published in the Federal Register and submitted to \n     the Committees on Environment and Public Works and \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the Committees on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure and Appropriations of the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (f) Water Resources Council.--Section 101 of the Water \n     Resources Planning Act (42 U.S.C. 1962a) is amended in the \n     first sentence by inserting ``the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, the Chairperson of the Council on Environmental \n     Quality,'' after ``Secretary of Transportation,''.\n       (g) Funding.--In carrying out this section, the Council \n     shall use funds made available for the general operating \n     expenses of the Corps of Engineers.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Feingold \nin introducing the Water Resources Planning and Modernization Act of \n2006. This legislation is designed to take a post-Katrina approach to \nArmy Corps of Engineers projects. It would provide for a more effective \nsystem for selecting and funding Army Corps projects that help to \nprotect our citizens against damage caused by floods, hurricanes and \nother natural disasters.\n  Last August this Nation witnessed a horrible national disaster. When \nHurricane Katrina hit, it brought with it destruction and tragedy \nbeyond compare; more so than our Nation has seen in decades. Some six \nmonths later, the Gulf Coast region is still largely in the early \nstages of attempting to rebuild and recover and there is a long road \nahead. As our Nation continues to dedicate significant resources to the \nreconstruction effort, we must be vigilant in our oversight obligations \nand take appropriate actions based on the many lessons learned from \nthis tragedy.\n  One area that most would agree deserves needed attention concerns the \nArmy Corps system. Funding is distributed in a manner that is not \nalways awarded the most urgent projects. Because of this, citizens can \nend up paying for unnecessary and irresponsible Army Corps projects \nwith their tax dollars and their safety. It is time for us to take a \nnew approach to how the Army Corps does business. With lessons learned \nfrom Katrina, we can and must shepherd in a new era within the Army \nCorps that prioritizes critical projects and allows the American \ntaxpayers to know that their money is being spent in an effective and \nefficient manner.\n  The Water Resources Planning and Modernization Act is the only Corps \nrelated measure that has been introduced in the Senate since Katrina \ntragically struck that truly takes a lessons-learned approach. Any \nmeasure acted upon by this Congress regarding the Corps simply must \naccount for the most up to date information available. We owe it to the \nAmerican public.\n  Historically, Congress has considered water projects costing many \nbillions of taxpayer dollars as essential expenditures--regardless of \nthe environmental costs or public benefits. That is why the \nmodernization procedures in this bill are designed to achieve more \ncritical and cost-effective expenditures for Corps water projects that \nwill yield more environmental, economic, and social benefits. The need \nfor these changes has been acknowledged by many for some time, but \nnever has the need to spend scarce taxpayer dollars wisely been as \ncrucial as it is now.\n  The Corps procedures for planning and approving projects, as well as \nthe Congressional system for funding projects, are broken, but they can \nbe fixed. The reforms in our bill are based on thorough program \nanalysis and common sense. I commend Senator Feingold for his efforts \nto build on and improve upon the legislation we have previously \nintroduced. Corps modernization has been a priority that Senator \nFeingold and I have shared for years but never before has there been \nsuch an appropriate atmosphere and urgent need to move forward on these \noverdue reforms.\n  Provisions of the legislation we are introducing today provide for a \nprocess to modify and modernize the Corps planning and approval \nprocedures to consider economic, public, and environmental objectives. \nIndependent review of Corps projects and a clear national \nprioritization of Corps projects would ensure that the most beneficial \nprojects are constructed. Effective measures for mitigation of \nenvironmental and other damage caused by projects would be required and \nmonitored.\n  With support from Taxpayers for Common Sense Action, National \nTaxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government Waste, American Rivers, \nNational Wildlife Federation, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense,\n\n[[Page S1359]]\n\nRepublicans for Environmental Protection, Sierra Club, and the World \nWildlife Fund, the bill has broad interest and impact.\n  Water projects that provide economic and environmental benefits to \nour Nation's citizens--the hardworking American taxpayers--serve the \ncommon good and reflect our common interest in fiscal responsibility.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING:\n  S. 2289. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nincrease the per resident payment floor for direct graduate medical \neducation payments under the Medicare program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I am introducing important \nlegislation that will have an impact on many of the hospitals in my \nState, along with hundreds of hospitals in other States. This \nlegislation deals specifically with the Medicare payments for Direct \nGraduate Medical Education--also known as DGME.\n  I am pleased that Congressman Ron Lewis from Kentucky's Second \nDistrict is the lead sponsor of a companion bill already introduced in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Medicare pays teaching hospitals for its share of the cost of \ntraining new physicians. These payments are known as DGME payments. \nTeaching hospitals initially reported their direct costs to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services in the mid-1980s. These \nreported amounts are now the basis for which each teaching hospital is \nreimbursed.\n  Unfortunately, there was a disparity in the types of costs each \nhospital reported, which has lead to large disparities in payments \nbetween hospitals. Hospitals are also being reimbursed on data that is \n20 years old, at this point.\n  To help rectify this problem, in 1999 Congress established a floor \nfor calculating Medicare payments for DGME at 70 percent of the \nnational average. In 2001, Congress raised the floor to 85 percent of \nthe national average.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would bring all of Medicare's \nDGME hospitals up 100 percent of the national average. This is an \nimportant change that would help many teaching hospitals in Kentucky \nand across the Nation be fairly reimbursed for training our young \ndoctors.\n  For example, there are 19 hospitals in Kentucky that currently \nreceive reimbursements below the national average. This means that \nKentucky hospitals lose more than two million a year because of the \nlower reimbursement rate. Across the country, there are about 600 \nhospitals being reimbursed below the national average.\n  This legislation takes an important step to ensure that Medicare's \npayment policy for teaching hospitals are fair and that these \ninstitutions can continue to do the important work they do. I hope my \ncolleagues will take a close look at the bill and can support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRYOR (for himself, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Talent):\n  S. 2290. A bill to provide for affordable natural gas by rebalancing \ndomestic supply and demand and to promote the production of natural gas \nfrom domestic resources; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am privileged to rise with the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas to introduce a bill today entitled \nthe Reliable and Affordable Natural Gas Energy Reform Act of 2006\n  In September of 2005, at the time the Senate was examining a number \nof energy proposals under the distinguished chairmanship of Senator \nDomenici, I introduced a bill at that time quite similar to this one, \nalthough it included oil. This measure sticks to gas, and gas only, to \nenable the several States across our Nation to take such steps under \nState law, in combination with the Governors and the respective \nlegislatures of the several States that desire to explore and the \ndesire to drill for energy off their shores. That bill as yet is still \non the docket.\n  Since that time I have had the great pleasure of joining my colleague \nfrom Arkansas to put this bill in. I am delighted that he indicated he \nwould like to step forward and take the lead. I readily accede to that \nrequest.\n  So much of the concern about drilling offshore is understandably in--\nand I am not here to criticize--the environmental community. I think my \ncolleague from Arkansas can help me eventually convince the \nenvironmental community that the time has come for offshore drilling.\n  Two things have occurred in the interim between the 1988 moratorium, \nnamely advancement in technology so we can safely, by engineering, put \nthe wells in; and the second is the ever-tightening noose around the \ncitizens of the United States of America with regard to their energy \nsources. The third thing that is occurring is the growing competition \nfor energy worldwide--India coming on with enormous consumption \nrequirements, and China with even larger consumption requirements.\n  I think the time has come that the Congress begin to reexamine its \nold policies with regard to those lands offshore of our several States.\n  At this time, I yield the floor to my colleague from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, as the distinguished Senator from Virginia \nacknowledged, we have a problem when it comes to the high cost of \nnatural gas. We feel strongly that this bill which we are cosponsoring \ncan be part of the solution.\n  About one-quarter of all natural gas is used to produce electricity, \nbut the rest is used to manufacture plastics that go into things such \nas cars, computers, and medical equipment. Fertilizer and \npharmaceutical production is highly dependent on natural gas. In fact, \nfor nitrogen fertilizer, a total of 93 percent of the production cost \nof that fertilizer is the component of natural gas.\n  The price of natural gas--which, by the way, is one-quarter of the \nenergy of this country--has more than doubled in the past year and it \nis anticipated that over the next 20 years you will see a 40-percent \nincrease for the usage and need of natural gas in the United States.\n  Another thing about natural gas that makes it very different than oil \nis natural gas is not easy to ship across oceans. Certainly there is \nsome liquid natural gas technology out there, but a vast majority--all \nbut a tiny fraction of the natural gas we use in this country--comes \nfrom United States wells, or comes out of Canada. We have a great \nreserve of natural gas, not only in the Continental United States, not \nonly in Alaska, but also off our shores. Most notably, the one that \nmost people are aware of is in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Our legislation will allow the Secretary of the Interior to offer \nnatural gas leases as part of the Outer Continental Shelf leasing \nprogram.\n  Let me say this: As Senator Warner of Virginia said a few moments \nago, we are referring only to natural gas. We have been very careful to \nmake sure this bill does not include petroleum or oil.\n  I hope no one will be confused by an earlier draft because we \nincluded some references to oil, but we have very carefully taken all \nof those out of the bill. I think the bill is very clear on that point \nnow, that this refers only to natural gas supply and exploration.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a moment on \nthat point?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we earlier distributed material which \nreferred to oil which was in an earlier draft. I have been in contact \nwith the environmental community, and so forth. It is clear to me at \nthis point in time that we have in this bill just gas. My fervent hope \nand belief is that the environmental community will see the \nadvancements in technology and the tremendous requirements of this \ncountry for natural gas, that we can restrict it to gas.\n  At a later time, if we are successful in proving that the natural gas \ncan be drawn and is safe, which I am confident we can do, maybe due to \nworld circumstances and domestic circumstances we could go back at that \ntime and revisit the issue of oil.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, another very important point, which is the essence of \nthis legislation, goes to the moratorium on exploration of the Outer \nContinental Shelf. This bill allows that moratorium\n\n[[Page S1360]]\n\nto stay in place until the year 2012. It allows coastal States to, \neither out of that moratorium, if they so choose, or if after that \nmoratorium expires, to opt into continuing that moratorium. It gives \nStates, legislatures, Governors, State officials, elected officials, et \ncetera, the ability to control some of the things that are going on on \ntheir coastlines.\n  I think that is a very important point here because this could be a \ngood revenue source for these States. It could be a good economic boom \nto some of these States. Certainly we have included revenue sharing, \nwhich I think is important to make this work.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Warner and I have been able to work \ntogether and come up with what we think is a very commonsense solution, \nor at least part of a solution, to a very serious problem our country \nis facing.\n  Arkansas farmers--and I am sure it is true with most other States' \nfarmers as well--had a difficult and disastrous year last year when it \ncame to agriculture. One of the main reasons it has been so hard is \ntheir costs have gone up--the high cost of fertilizer and fuel. They \nuse a lot of natural gas when it comes to drying grain, et cetera. The \nhigh cost of energy is killing our farmers, and it is certainly hurting \nour manufacturing sector as well.\n  The high price of natural gas is bad for the economy, but it is also \nbad for our energy security. That is one thing which I don't think we \ncan overemphasize here today. I think it is critical that we have a \nhigh level of energy security for this country. I am proud to join my \nvery distinguished colleague from Virginia to do our very best to offer \na solution to help American families and help American businesses.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, our committee, under the leadership of \nSenator Domenici, is putting forward a proposal. I spoke with him \ntoday. This bill does not, in my judgment--and I hope he concurs \neventually--conflict in any way with the objectives he is trying to \nachieve. He is a man who thinks forwardly and is so knowledgeable on \nthe question of energy, the domestic situation here and the worldwide \nimplication, and I think eventually he will be looking at something, \nand this may be a vehicle on which the Energy Committee will focus as \nthey take the next step and begin to recognize the need to have some \noffshore drilling.\n  I thank my colleague on the Energy Committee.\n  I conclude my remarks by saying I am proud of the State of Virginia \nand its legislature. In the last session of the Virginia State \nlegislature in the year 2005, both houses passed legislation \nauthorizing precisely what we have here. In other words, let us go out \nand take a look at the shelf, find out what may or may not be off the \ncoast of Virginia, and determine the accessibility and the feasibility \nand interest among industry to come and participate in the drilling.\n  But, unfortunately our former Governor--and I get along very well \nwith Governor Warner--for reasons which he expressed, felt at this time \nthe legislation shouldn't go forward in this session of the Virginia \nGeneral Assembly. Again, the Senate stepped forward and passed \nlegislation along the lines of what the General Assembly of Virginia \ndid last year. It is my hope the House will do likewise, and that our \nnew Governor, Governor Kaine, will take it under consideration, should \nboth houses act--and hopefully they will act upon it favorably. \nVirginia is in a key location, and its citizens could benefit \nenormously if in fact earlier analysis of the shelf off of our State is \nconfirmed as possessing resources of energy, namely natural gas.\n  I thank my colleague from Arkansas. He is a marvelous working \npartner. I look forward to working with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 2291. A bill to provide for the establishment of a biodefense \ninjury compensation program and to provide indemnification for \nproducers of countermeasures; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Kennedy in \nintroducing a bill, the Responsible Public Readiness and Emergency \nPreparedness Act, that will correct a grievous mistake made by some of \nmy Republican colleagues. Our legislation will take responsible steps \nto protect the American people from one of the greatest threats facing \nour nation--a pandemic flu, bioterror attack or infectious disease \noutbreak.\n  Congress should have no higher priority than protecting the safety, \nsecurity, and health of the American people. Public health experts have \nwarned that a severe avian flu epidemic could lead to worldwide panic, \ncost millions of lives, and result in untold economic damage.\n  In order to prevent these dire projections from becoming a reality, \nwe have no choice but to be prepared for such an event. One of the \nindispensable components of a biodefense plan is the availability of \nsafe and effective vaccines and medicines. To achieve this goal, a \nbiodefense plan must have two critical components. First, it must \nencourage drug companies to develop and manufacture effective medicines \nto counteract a disease or flu. Second, it must encourage first \nresponders, health care workers, and ordinary citizens to take those \nmedicines before, during, or after an attack or outbreak.\n  In December of last year, some of my Republican colleagues inserted \nlanguage that contained neither of these critical components into the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations conference report. This was done \nat the last minute, in the middle of the night, without the opportunity \nfor discussion and debate, and without the knowledge or consent of many \nof the conferees.\n  Unfortunately, this Republican plan will do nothing to protect the \nAmerican people. Rather than encouraging companies to make safe and \neffective medicines, it will provide a perverse incentive by protecting \nthose companies that make ineffective or harmful products. And rather \nthan encouraging Americans to be vaccinated or take a needed \nmedication, it will discourage them from doing so by failing to provide \nguaranteed care for the few who will inevitably be injured by these \nproducts. Make no mistake about it; this plan will fail to protect our \nNation.\n  I say this with confidence because we have been down this path \nbefore. Three years ago, the Bush administration launched a program to \ninoculate millions of first responders against smallpox. Ignoring \npublic health experts, the administration failed to establish a \ncompensation program to provide help to those injured by the vaccine. \nDoctors, nurses, firefighters and other first responders who would be \non the front lines in the event of a smallpox attack by terrorists were \nnot willing to roll the dice and risk the future of their families \nwithout compensation for their losses if they were injured, disabled, \nor even killed by its side effects. Most refused to participate, and \nthe program was a failure.\n  On November 9 of last year, while testifying before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, Dr. Julie Gerberding, the Director of the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was asked about the \nexpected success of a biodefense plan that does not include fair \ncompensation to people injured by the very medicines they thought would \nhelp them. She responded: ``Well, I certainly feel that from the \nstandpoint of the smallpox vaccination program, that the absence of a \ncompensation program that was acceptable to the people we were hoping \nto vaccinate was a major barrier--and I think we've learned some \nlessons from that.''\n  On November 20 of last year, while appearing on NBC's Meet the Press, \nSecretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt said that along \nwith limits on liability, ``adequate compensation . . . needs to be \nmade for those who are hurt.''\n  Many groups representing the public health community and first \nresponders, including the American Public Health Association, the \nAmerican Nurses Association, and the American Federation of State, \nCounty, and Municipal Employees, have been outspoken about the need for \na compensation program.\n  Yet despite our past experience, despite the position taken by those \nat high levels in the administration, and despite the warnings of those \nwho would be on the front lines in the event of an outbreak, the \nRepublican leadership in Congress included language in\n\n[[Page S1361]]\n\nthe Defense Appropriations conference report that repeats the mistakes \nof the past, and endangers American lives. If and when we have a \nvaccine to protect against a pandemic flu, we must provide first \nresponders with a reasonable assurance that it will be as safe as can \nreasonably be expected, and that they and their families will be taken \ncare of should they be injured. This plan does not provide that \nassurance, and once again, first responders will refuse to participate.\n\n  Those who inserted this provision into the Conference Report during \nlate night backroom negotiations claim that it includes compensation. \nBut make no mistake--there is no guaranteed compensation in this bill. \nThere is a provision to set up a compensation fund, but there is \nabsolutely no guarantee that this fund will ever see a penny. The \nauthors of this provision are claiming to take care of the injured, \nwithout providing any guarantee that it will ever happen. They are \nmaking an empty promise.\n  Not only will this plan fail to compensate those first responders and \nordinary citizens injured or even killed by a vaccine, but it will also \nprotect manufacturers even when they act with disregard for the safety \nof their products. This is an incredibly dangerous and inappropriate \nincentive. We should be encouraging manufacturers to make safe \nproducts, not protecting them when they make products that harm the \nAmerican people.\n  Let me make it perfectly clear that I am not against the idea of \nproviding limited liability protection for manufacturers in order to \nencourage the development of vaccines and medicines to protect the \nAmerican people in the event of an outbreak or bioterror attack. But \nsuch liability protection must adhere to certain principles. First, it \nmust not protect manufacturers that act with careless disregard for the \nsafety and effectiveness of their product. And second, because even the \nsafest vaccine will harm a small percentage of the people who take it, \nliability protection must be coupled with an adequate compensation \nprogram so that injured patients are properly cared for and not left \ndestitute.\n  The legislation that Senator Kennedy and I are introducing today \nadheres to these principles. It repeals the Republican provision passed \nin December, and replaces it with tried-and-true solutions that will \nencourage the production of vaccines and drugs without leaving patients \nto fend for themselves if they are injured. Our legislation will ensure \nthat the reputable and responsible manufacturers of needed medicines--\nand the doctors, nurses, and hospitals who administer them in good \nfaith--will be protected from frivolous lawsuits that might deter them \nfrom making and administering such medicines. But those injured by \nthese medicines will be justly compensated for their injuries.\n  Congress has adopted this type of solution in the past. The \ncompensation program established by our bill is modeled on one of those \npast successes--the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP). The \nVICP has successfully incentivized the manufacturers of recommended \nchildhood vaccines, encouraged families to have their children \nvaccinated, and compensated those who are injured.\n  Senator Kennedy and I spent several months last year negotiating with \nSenator Enzi, Senator Burr, Senator Gregg, Senator Frist, and others on \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to try to reach a \nbipartisan compromise on this issue. We made several proposals, modeled \non past Congressional action, to protect manufacturers from frivolous \nlawsuits while providing fair and adequate compensation to those who \nare injured.\n  Unfortunately, the decision was made to forego this bipartisan \nprocess. Instead, a non-germane provision was inserted into a massive \nappropriations bill in the final hours of last session of Congress. \nFurthermore, it is my understanding that this language was inserted \nafter members had signed the Conference Report, some doing so with the \nunderstanding that this language was not included. I am disturbed and \ndisappointed by this blatant abuse of power and disregard for Senate \nprocedures. I can only assume that the supporters of this provision \nused this tactic because they knew that their plan would not stand up \nto public scrutiny and Senate debate.\n  I am confident that if the Senate were to consider this issue \ncarefully, we would choose to reject the failed policies of the past, \nand enact a policy that really protects the American people--a \nbiodefense program that encourages manufacturers to make safe and \neffective vaccines and medicines, and provides compensation to those \nindividuals who are injured by those vaccines and medicines.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2291\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide relief for the Federal judiciary from \nexcessive rent charges; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to speak in support of \nlegislation, cosponsored by Senators Leahy, Cornyn, Chambliss, and \nFeinstein, which I am introducing today to address a major problem \naffecting the Federal judiciary, specifically excessive rental charges \nby the General Services Administration for courthouses and other space \noccupied by the courts across the country. This legislation would \nprohibit the GSA from charging the Federal judiciary rent in excess of \nthe actual costs incurred by GSA to maintain and operate Federal court \nbuildings and related costs.\n  Unlike many other elements of the Federal Government, the judiciary \nis required to pay a large and ever-increasing portion of its budget as \nrent to another branch of government, the GSA. In fiscal terms, since \n1986, the Federal courts' rental payments to GSA have increased from \n$133 million to $926 million in fiscal year 2005. This rental payment \nrepresents an increasing slice of the judiciary's relatively small \noverall budget. The percentage of the judiciary's operating budget \ndevoted to rent payments has escalated from 15.7 percent in fiscal year \n1986 to 22 percent in fiscal year 2005. By contrast, only three percent \nof the Department of Justice budget goes toward GSA rent, and the \nExecutive Branch as a whole spends less than two-tenths of one percent \nof its budget on GSA rent.\n  In his 2005 Year-End report on the Federal Judiciary, Chief Justice \nJohn Roberts cited escalating GSA rents as one of the two serious \nthreats to the independence of the Federal judiciary, the other being \njudges' pay. The increased rents, coupled with across-the-board cuts \nimposed during fiscal years 2004 and 2005, resulted in a reduction of \napproximately 1,500 judicial branch employees as of mid-December when \ncompared to October 2003, and a 24-month moratorium on courthouse \nconstruction has been imposed.\n  On May 13, 2005, a bipartisan group of 11 Senators on the Judiciary \nCommittee wrote to Stephen A. Perry, Administrator of GSA, to exercise \nhis statutory authority to exempt the judiciary from rental payments in \nexcess of those required to operating and maintaining Federal court \nbuildings and related costs. On May 31, 2005, Mr. Perry wrote back and \ndenied this sensible request. Mr. Perry referred to the judiciary as \n``one of our largest and most valued tenants,'' but a more apt \ndescription would have been one of its most valued profit centers.\n  The judiciary paid $926 million to GSA in fiscal year 2005, but GSA's \nactual cost of providing space to the judiciary was only $426 million, \na difference of $500 million. The judiciary in essence is being used as \na profit center by GSA, which accomplishes this by charging for such \nfictitious costs as real estate tax which GSA does not in fact pay and \nforcing the judiciary to pay for buildings that have been fully \namortized, not only once but several times.\n  This legislation provides a relatively modest and simple fix to this \nnear crisis in the Federal judiciary, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLEN:\n  S.J. Res. 31. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to require a balancing of \nthe budget; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I rise to speak on a resolution regarding \na constitutional amendment I am introducing today. It is the third part \nof my three-point plan to restore fiscal accountability and common \nsense to Washington. It is a resolution, in particular, to amend the \nConstitution to require a balanced Federal budget.\n  The continued growth in Government, coupled with our enormous \ndeficit, make a balanced budget amendment a vital tool for bringing \nthis fiscal house back in order and restraining the growing appetite of \nthe Federal Government to take more money from the people in taxes, and \nthis is money that is coming from families, working people, from men \nand women who run their own small businesses; and also when the Federal \nGovernment is taking more money, it means they can be meddling in more \nthings that are best left to the people or the States--if Government \nneeds to be involved at all.\n  The Federal Government ought to be paying attention and be focused on \nits key reasons for being created in the first place by the people in \nthe States, and that is national defense--making sure the military is \nstrong and that they have the most advanced equipment and armament for \nour men and women in uniform as they secure our freedom. We need a \nnational missile defense system. Those are the sorts of things that are \nthe primary responsibility of the Federal Government, as well as key \nresearch areas, whether it is in nanotechnology, aeronautics, or in \nother areas working with not just Federal agencies but the private \nsector and our colleges and universities.\n  As this Senate gets to work on the fiscal year 2007 budget, our \ncountry's fiscal discipline and accountability must be improved. We \nhave a budget deficit not because the Federal Government has a revenue \nproblem; it is because the Federal Government has a spending problem. \nThe Government doesn't tax too little, it spends too much. We must \nfocus our efforts on spending the people's money much smarter, not \ntaking more of their money because it is convenient or expedient.\n  Now, to control spending, I have revived a pair of ideas that Ronald \nReagan advocated when he was President. In Ronald Reagan's farewell \naddress to the American people, he said there were two things he wished \nhe had accomplished as President, and what he wanted future Presidents, \nboth Republican and Democrat, to have. They were the line-item veto and \na constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  As always, and so often, Ronald Reagan was right. That is why I have \nmade the line-item veto and the balanced budget amendment the first two \npoints of my three-point plan to bring fiscal accountability and \nresponsibility to Washington.\n  Let's start first with the line-item veto. When I was honored by the \npeople of Virginia as Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I had \nthe power of the line-item veto. I used it 17 times. I saw how useful a \ntool that was as Governor to knock out undesirable, nonessential \nspending, or untoward or undesirable policies. It is a power--the line-\nitem veto--or an authority that actually 46 Governors in the U.S. \nenjoy. It is a very powerful tool to cut wasteful spending and \nundesirable programs. In fact, after you use it a few times, you don't \nhave to use it as much, because the legislative branch understands \nthat, gosh, he actually is going to use that power, and when it comes \nto the final budget or appropriations bills, the undesirable or \nwasteful programs or spending are not in it.\n  The President of the United States, in my view, should have the same \npower I had as Governor of Virginia, and that is the line-item veto. \nTogether with Senator Jim Talent of Missouri, last September we \nintroduced a constitutional amendment to provide the President with \nline-item veto authority. It is high time for that. The reason we need \na constitutional amendment is that there were times when we were trying \ndo it statutorily. I would be in favor of statutory methods, rather \nthan an amendment, but the Supreme Court struck down the last effort. I \nthink the President, as well as the Congress, ought to be accountable \nfor some of these spending items that create such controversy and are \nabsurd or wasteful. By the way, we need to vote on this. If this goes \nto the States, I have no question that the States will\n\n[[Page S1364]]\n\nquickly ratify such a constitutional amendment because, after all, they \ngive their Governors such power.\n  Secondly, we need a balanced budget amendment. This is something many \nStates have, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and virtually the rest of \nthe States. One of the best ways, in my view, to eliminate the Federal \ndeficit and limit the size and scope of the Government is to wrestle it \ndown with the chains of the Constitution.\n  I would also add that balancing the budget is not just a matter of \nmaking sure that expenditures are equal to revenue; it is about making \nsure the Federal Government fulfills its proper, focused, \nconstitutional role--and not expanding into everything that is not \nnecessarily a Federal prerogative, but best left to the people or the \nStates. We all know that a big, bloated Federal Government stifles \ninnovation, saps initiative, and reduces personal responsibility.\n  The third part of my plan is a proposal I offered last week, which I \nknow won't be all that popular in this Chamber, but I think it will be \nmuch appreciated and understood by real people in the real world.\n  I have proposed legislation that provides a powerful incentive for \nSenators and Congressmen to perform their jobs on time, as people do in \nthe private sector. We have a full-time legislature here and we go into \nsession on January 3. One of our prime responsibilities is to pass \nappropriations bills before the next fiscal year, which is October 1. \nBut it is, to me, deplorable that full-time legislators cannot get \ntheir job done on time by October 1. Then, of course, we end up with \ncontinuing resolutions, and several months later, some time after \nThanksgiving but before Christmas, all kinds of unknown, unscrutinized \nspending occurs. It gets passed in the dead of night, thinking nobody \nwill notice what is in all these appropriations bills--and actually a \nlot of people don't know what is in those appropriations bills.\n\n  That is why I want to impose on Congress what I call the ``paycheck \npenalty.'' The paycheck penalty says to Members of Congress, if you \nfail to pass all your appropriations measures by the start of the \nfiscal year, October 1, which is your job, what you are paid to do, \nyour paychecks will be withheld until you complete your job.\n  Now, taken together, these three measures will eliminate the need to \nraise taxes to eliminate the deficit. The tax reductions enacted in the \nlast 5 years have helped our country get out of recession. It has \nincented more investment, created many new jobs--in fact, 4.5 million \nnew jobs--in the private sector; thereby, from all this economic growth \nand prosperity and more people working in businesses, large, medium, \nand small doing better, tax receipts to the Government have increased. \nTo illustrate the point, from 2004 to 2005, tax receipts to the Federal \nGovernment grew at a rate of 14.5 percent, or $274 billion. This growth \nis more than twice the rate of economic growth. So the economic growth \nis strong, but the tax revenues are twice as much to the Federal \nGovernment. To further this point, the President's budget forecasts \nthat tax revenues will grow an additional 6.1 percent, or $132 billion, \nfrom 2005 to 2006.\n  From the tax cuts of the Reagan administration to the tax cuts we \npassed in this new century, the fact is that lower taxes stimulate \neconomic growth, stimulate job creation, and stimulate expansion, which \nin turn increases revenues to the Federal Government. More important, \nlow taxes make this country more competitive for investment and jobs \nhere, rather than people going to invest in places such as China or \nelsewhere in the world. When people are able to keep more of what they \nearn, they spend it, save it, invest it, they may expand their \nbusiness, and they may get more innovative capital equipment, and the \nfact is lower taxes make this country more competitive and people more \nprosperous.\n  The opportunity created by Americans spending the fruits of their own \nlabor, as opposed to the Government, is the path to bringing fiscal \nsanity to the Federal budget. So to avoid future pressure for \ncounterproductive, harmful tax increases, and to achieve a balanced \nbudget, we must make these dramatic changes in how the Federal \nGovernment spends the taxpayers' money: the line-item veto, balanced \nbudget amendment, and the paycheck penalty for Members of Congress who \nhave not done their jobs on time.\n  As we closed 2005, Madam President, the Federal Government was \nresponsible for a gross Federal debt of $8.2 trillion. One must ask, \nhow did we get here? Consider these statistics from the last 5 years: \nFederal spending has increased 33 percent. In 2005, the per-household \nspending by our Government has grown to $21,878 per year. That figure \nis compared to the per-household tax, on average, of $19,062 per year, \nleaving an annual per-household deficit of about $2,800. The macro \nresult is an annual budget deficit in the hundreds of billions of \ndollars.\n  We are in a time of war, this war on terror, and enormous national \ndisasters have also befallen our country in Louisiana, Alabama, Texas, \nand in Florida, in the past year. That is why I am introducing this \nresolution. Even when those occur, this amendment does require the \nFederal Government to achieve a balanced budget within 5 years of \nratification by the States. Each year, the budget deficit would be \nreduced by 20 percent, until the Federal budget is balanced. This is a \nphased-in approach, which is realistic and provides needed time for \nCongress to amend the budget and appropriations processes to provide \nfor a balanced budget. I fully understand that national and global \nevents can significantly affect our country's budgetary needs. Thus, I \nhave included a provision that allows for a waiver in the event of war. \nHowever, to ensure deficits resulting from a war do not continue in \nperpetuity, the provision provides for a 5-year window following the \nend of the conflict to reduce any deficits that may have accumulated.\n  Domestic catastrophes can also wreak havoc on the Federal \nGovernment's budget, as well as those of the States in Louisiana, \nMississippi and, to some extent Florida, which we have recently seen \ndevastated by hurricanes. To address such circumstances, the resolution \nalso includes a provision that would allow expenditures in excess of \nrevenues, provided three-fifths of each House of Congress approves, \nwhich I think Congress would have done in these situations if this were \nin effect last year and presently.\n  Now the risks of budget deficits and national debt are well known: \nthe collapse of the dollar, a significant reduction in national \nsavings, and the inability to fund programs vital to the Nation's \nsecurity and well-being. It also means if you are putting in more and \nmore tax revenues to finance the debt, there is less money there for \nkey areas such as national defense, homeland security, education, \nresearch in science, and also engineering. So to prevent these events, \nwe need an institutional mechanism to get this overspending under \ncontrol.\n  Based on past performance, it will take, of course, a change in the \nConstitution. To paraphrase Thomas Jefferson, we need to bind the \nCongress with a change in the Constitution to prevent present \nCongresses from burdening future generations with perpetual debt.\n  I believe all of us, if we look at it seriously and responsibly, \nrecognize and grasp the seriousness of this problem. I am hopeful that \nthis Senate will be able to make the difficult choices to make sure \nthat the next generation of Americans is not burdened with overwhelming \ndebt or higher taxes from a burdensome, large Federal Government. A \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution, I sincerely believe from \nmy experiences as Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, will be a \nvery valuable, useful, and effective tool in making that goal a \nreality. The same applies to the line-item veto authority for the \nPresident. I also believe very strongly that this Senate and the other \nbody, the House, can get the appropriations bills done on time by \nOctober 1. If not, I think paychecks ought to be withheld until it is \ndone.\n  So I hope that my colleagues recognize the seriousness, the \nimportance, and the urgency of these responsible measures, these ideas. \nThese measures include getting our fiscal house in order, protecting \nthe taxpayers from tax increases in the future, and making sure this \ncountry is the world capital of innovation. These measures include \ninvestment by the private sector, more competitiveness compared to \nother\n\n[[Page S1365]]\n\ncountries because of lower taxes, Federal regulatory policies, sound \nenergy policy with more development and exploration here at home, as \nwell as using clean coal and advanced nuclear and biofuels and new \ntechnologies. We also must make sure our fiscal house is in order for \nAmericans to compete and succeed in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this resolution and join me in this \neffort for America's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/15/senate-section/article/S1365-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2889.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 32 \nand that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill state the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 32) to amend title 18 United States Code, to \n     provide criminal penalties for trafficking in counterfeit \n     marks.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to speak about \nH.R. 32, the Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act of 2005, \nsponsored by Representative Knollenberg and 59 House cosponsors. The \ncounterfeiting of goods bearing American held trademarks is an \nimportant problem that I am committed to fighting, as reflected by my \nsponsoring S. 1699, the Senate companion bill to H.R. 32, earlier this \nyear with Senator Leahy and Senators Alexander, Bayh, Brownback, \nCoburn, Cornyn, DeWine, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, Hatch, Kyl, Levin, \nReed, Stabenow, and Voinovich.\n  H.R. 32, the Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act of 2005 \naddresses a problem that has reached epidemic proportions as a result \nof a loophole in our criminal code: the trafficking in counterfeit \nlabels. Criminal law currently prohibits the trafficking in counterfeit \ntrademarks ``on or in connection with goods or services.'' However, it \ndoes not prohibit the trafficking in the counterfeit marks themselves. \nAs such, there is nothing in current law to prohibit an individual from \nselling counterfeit labels bearing otherwise protected trademarks \nwithin the United States.\n  This loophole was exposed by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in \nUnited States v. Giles, 213 F.3d 1247 (10th Cir. 2000). In this case, \nthe United States prosecuted the defendant for manufacturing and \nselling counterfeit Dooney & Bourke labels that third parties could \nlater affix to generic purses. Examining title 18, section 2320, of the \nUnited States Code, the Tenth Circuit held that persons who sell \ncounterfeit trademarks that are not actually attached to any ``goods or \nservices'' do not violate the Federal criminal trademark infringement \nstatute. Since the defendant did not attach counterfeit marks to \n``goods or services,'' the court found that the defendant did not run \nafoul of the criminal statute as a matter of law. Thus, someone caught \nredhanded with counterfeit trademarks walked free.\n  H.R. 32 closes this loophole by amending title 18, section 2320 of \nthe United States Code to criminally prohibit the trafficking, or \nattempt to traffic, in ``labels, patches, stickers'' and generally any \nitem to which a counterfeit mark has been applied. In so doing, H.R. 32 \nprovides U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors with the means not only \nto prosecute individuals trafficking in counterfeit goods or services, \nbut also individuals trafficking in labels, patches, and the like that \nare later applied to goods.\n  Congress must act expeditiously to protect U.S. held trademarks to \nthe fullest extent of the law. The recent 10-count indictment of four \nMassachusetts residents of conspiracy to traffic in approximately $1.4 \nmillion of counterfeit luxury goods in the case of U.S. v. Luong et \nal., 2005 D. Mass. underscores the need for this legislation. According \nto the indictment, law enforcement officers raided self-storage units \nearlier this year and found the units to hold approximately 12,231 \ncounterfeit handbags; 7,651 counterfeit wallets; more than 17,000 \ngeneric handbags and wallets; and enough counterfeit labels and \nmedallions to turn more than\n\n[[Page S1368]]\n\n50,000 generic handbags and wallets into counterfeits. Although the \nU.S. Attorneys Office was able to pursue charges of trafficking and \nattempting to traffic in counterfeit handbags and wallets, they were \nnot able to bring charges for trafficking and attempting to traffic in \nthe more than 50,000 counterfeit labels and medallions. As such, these \ndefendants will escape prosecution that would have otherwise been \nillegal if they had only been attached to an otherwise generic bag. \nThis simply does not make sense. Had the Stop Counterfeiting in \nManufactured Goods Act of 2005 been in effect at the time of \nindictment, U.S. prosecutors would have been able to bring charges \nagainst the defendants for trafficking and attempting to traffic in not \nonly counterfeit goods, but also counterfeit labels.\n  As Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher said:\n\n       Those who manufacture and sell counterfeit goods steal \n     business from honest merchants, confuse or defraud honest \n     consumers, and illegally profit on the backs of honest \n     American workers and entrepreneurs.\n\n  This point is underscored by the Bureau of Customs and Border \nProtection estimate that trafficking in counterfeit goods costs the \nUnited States approximately $200 to $250 million annually. With each \npassing year, the United States loses millions of dollars in tax \nrevenues to the sale of counterfeit goods. Further, each counterfeit \nitem that is manufactured overseas and distributed in the United States \ncosts American workers tens of thousands of jobs. With counterfeit \ngoods making up a growing 5 to 7 percent of world trade, this is a \nproblem that we can no longer ignore.\n  To be sure, counterfeiting is not limited to the popular designer \ngoods that we have all seen sold on corners of just about every major \nmetropolitan city in the United States. Counterfeiting has a \ndevastating impact on a broad range of industries. In fact, for almost \nevery legitimate product manufactured and sold within the United \nStates, there is a parallel counterfeit product being sold for no more \nthan half the price. These counterfeit products range from children's \ntoys to clothing to Christmas tree lights. More frightening are the \nthousands of counterfeit automobile parts, batteries, and electrical \nequipment that are being manufactured and placed into the stream of \ncommerce with each passing day. I am told that the level of \nsophistication in counterfeiting has reached the point that you can no \nlonger distinguish between the real and the counterfeit good or label \nwith the naked eye. However, just because these products look the same \ndoes not mean that they have the same quality characteristics. The \ncounterfeit products are not subject to the same quality controls of \nlegitimate products, resulting in items that are lower in quality and \nlikely to fall apart. In fact, counterfeit products could potentially \nkill unsuspecting American consumers.\n\n  In addition to closing the ``counterfeit label loophole,'' the Stop \nCounterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act strengthens the criminal code \nand provides heightened penalties for those trafficking in counterfeit \nmarks. Current law does not provide for the seizure and forfeiture of \ncounterfeit trademarks, whether they are attached to goods or not. \nTherefore, many times such counterfeit goods are seized one day, only \nto be returned and sold to an unsuspecting public. To ensure that \nindividuals engaging in the practice of trafficking in counterfeit \nmarks cannot reopen their doors, H.R. 32 establishes procedures for the \nmandatory seizure, forfeiture, and destruction of counterfeit marks \nprior to a conviction. Further, it provides for procedures for the \nmandatory forfeiture and destruction of property derived from or used \nto engage in the trafficking of counterfeit marks.\n  When this legislation was sent over to the Senate from the House, \nconcerns were raised to Senator Leahy and myself about the language in \nSection 2(bbb)(1)(B) of this bill pertaining to the forfeiture \nauthority of the U.S. Department of Justice. In focusing our attention \nto this section, we discussed the scope of the facilitation language, \nwhich parallels the drug and money laundering forfeiture language in 21 \nU.S.C. 853 and 18 U.S.C. 982, respectively, and how it might relate to \nInternet marketplace companies, search engines, and ISPs. Specifically, \nwe were aware of concerns regarding the potential misapplication of the \nfacilitation language in Section 2(b)(1)(B) to pursue forfeiture and \nseizure proceedings against responsible Internet marketplace companies \nthat serve as third-party intermediaries to online transactions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Section 2(b)(1)(B) authorizes U.S. \nAttorneys to pursue civil in rem forfeiture proceedings against ``any \nproperty used, in any manner or part, to commit or to facilitate the \ncommission of a violation of subsection (a).'' The intent of this \nlanguage is to provide attorneys and prosecutors with the authority to \nbring a civil forfeiture action against the property of bad actors who \nare facilitating trafficking or attempts to traffic in counterfeit \nmarks. The forfeiture authority in Section 2(b)(1)(B) cannot be used to \npursue forfeiture and seizure proceedings against the computer \nequipment, website or network of responsible Internet marketplace \ncompanies, who serve solely as a third party to transactions and do not \ntailor their services or their facilities to the furtherance of \ntrafficking or attempts to traffic in counterfeit marks. However, these \nInternet marketplace companies must make demonstrable good-faith \nefforts to combat the use of their systems and services to traffic in \ncounterfeit marks. Companies must establish and implement procedures to \ntake down postings that contain or offer to sell goods, services, \nlabels, and the like in violation of this act upon being made aware of \nthe illegal nature of these items or services.\n  It is the irresponsible culprits that must be held accountable. Those \nwho profit from another's innovation have proved their creativity only \nat escaping responsibility for their actions. As legislators it is \nimportant that we provide law enforcement with the tools needed to \ncapture these thieves.\n  I say to Senator Specter, it is also my understanding that the U.S. \nSentencing Commission recently promulgated new Federal sentencing \nguidelines to account for the changes in how intellectual property \ncrimes are committed. Could the Senator clarify for the record why we \nhave authorized the U.S. Sentencing Commission to further amend the \nFederal sentencing guidelines and policy statements for crimes \ncommitted in violation of title 18, section 2318 or 2320, of the United \nStates Code?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I say to Senator Leahy, as the Senator is aware, \nperiodically Congress directs the Sentencing Commission to update the \nFederal sentencing guidelines upon the periodic directive of Congress \nto reflect and account for changes in the manner in which intellectual \nproperty offenses are committed. The recent amendments to which you \nrefer were promulgated by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to the \nauthorization in the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005, \nalso known as FECA. These amendments to the Federal sentencing \nguidelines, which took effect on October 24, 2005, address changes in \npenalties and definitions for intellectual property rights crimes, \nparticularly those involving copyrighted pre-release works and issues \nsurrounding ``uploading.'' For example, these guidelines provide for a \n25 percent increase in sentences for offenses involving pre-release \nworks. In addition, the Commission revised its definition of \n``uploading'' to ensure that the guidelines are keeping up with \ntechnological advances in this area.\n\n  I would like to make it clear for the record that the directive to \nthe Sentencing Commission in section 3 of H.R. 32 is not meant as \ndisapproval of the Commission's recent actions in response to FECA. \nRather, section 3 covers other intellectual property rights crimes that \nCongress believes it is time for the Commission to revisit. \nSpecifically, section 3 directs the Commission to review the \nguidelines, and particularly the definition of ``infringement amount,'' \nto ensure that offenses involving low-cost items like labels, patches, \nmedallions, or packaging that are used to make counterfeit goods that \nare much more expensive, are properly punished. It also directs the \nCommission to ensure that the penalty provisions for offenses involving \nall counterfeit goods or services, or devices used to facilitate \ncounterfeiting, are properly addressed by the guidelines. As it did in \nresponse to the No\n\n[[Page S1369]]\n\nElectronic Theft Act of 1997 and FECA, I am confident that the \nCommission will ensure that the Federal sentencing guidelines provide \nadequate punishment and deterrence for these very serious offenses and \nI look forward to the Commission's response to this directive.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I say to Senator Specter, thank you for that \nclarification. As you are aware, there has been overwhelming support \nfor this legislation. It has been very heartening to see such \noverwhelming support for this important bill. Counterfeiting is a \nthreat to America. It wreaks real harm on our economy, our workers, and \nour consumers. This bill is a tough bill that will give law enforcement \nimproved tools to fight this form of theft. The bill is short and \nstraightforward, but its impact should be profound and far reaching.\n  Mr. SPECTER. At this point, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, chairman of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, and Representative Joe Knollenberg for their leadership in \nthe House with regard to H.R. 32. In January of 2005, Representative \nKnollenberg introduced H.R. 32 in the House. When the bill was in \ncommittee, he fostered negotiations between the Department of Justice, \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the International Trademark \nAssociation to ensure that it passed the House. I would also like to \nthank my colleague Senator Leahy, ranking member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and Senators Alexander, Bayh, Brownback, Coburn, \nCornyn, DeWine, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, Hatch, Kyl, Levin, Reed, \nStabenow, and Voinovich for their cosponsorship of S. 1699, the \ncompanion legislation to H.R. 32. It is through the hard work of all of \nthese Members that we were able to achieve truly bipartisan support for \nlanguage that will ensure the protection of American-held trademarks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Some of our most important legislation is produced not \nonly when we reach across the aisle in the name of bipartisanship, but \nwhen we work across Chambers and reach true consensus. I would also \nlike to thank Senators Alexander, Bayh, Brownback, Coburn, Cornyn, \nDeWine, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, Hatch, Kyl, Levin, Reed, Stabenow, \nand Voinovich for their cosponsorship of the Senate companion \nlegislation. Counterfeiting is a serious problem that does not lend \nitself to a quick and easy solution. This legislation is an important \nstep towards fighting counterfeiting. I hope we can build on the \nsuccess of this law.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Cornyn in \nanother of our bipartisan efforts to improve the lives of Americans \nthrough effective and efficient Government. The Protecting American \nGoods and Services Act of 2005, which was passed unanimously out of the \nSenate last November as S. 1095, is now part of a package that includes \nthe Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act, which I co-sponsored \nwith Senator Specter as S. 1699. The Protecting American Goods and \nServices Act strengthens our ability to combat the escalating problem \nof counterfeiting worldwide. In order to effectively fight intellectual \nproperty theft, we need stiff penalties for counterfeiters and those \nwho are caught with counterfeit goods with the intent to traffic their \nfalse wares. Ours is a short bill--indeed, it is only two pages long--\nbut it will have global implications in the fight against piracy.\n  Counterfeiting is a growing problem that costs our economy hundreds \nof billions of dollars every year and has been linked to organized \ncrime, including terrorist organizations. According to the \nInternational Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition, counterfeit parts have \nbeen discovered in helicopters sold to NATO, in jet engines, bridge \njoints, brake pads, and fasteners in equipment designed to prevent \nnuclear reactor meltdowns. The World Health Organization estimates that \nthe market for counterfeit drugs is about $32 billion each year.\n  Several years ago, Senator Hatch joined me in sponsoring the Anti-\nCounterfeiting Consumer Protection Act of 1996, which addressed \ncounterfeiting by amending several sections of our criminal and tariff \ncodes. That law made important changes, particularly by expanding RICO, \nthe Federal antiracketeering law, to cover crimes involving \ncounterfeiting and copyright and trademark infringement: Then, as now, \ntrafficking in counterfeit goods hurts purchasers, State and Federal \nGovernments, and economies at every level.\n  Perhaps most disturbingly, the U.S. Customs Service reports that \nterrorists have used transnational counterfeiting operations to fund \ntheir activities: The sale of counterfeit and pirated music, movies, \nsoftware, T-shirts, clothing, and fake drugs ``accounts for much of the \nmoney the international terrorist network depends on to feed its \noperations.''\n  Last year, as in years past, I worked with Senator Allen on an \namendment to the Foreign Operations bill that provides the State \nDepartment with vital resources to combat piracy of U.S. goods abroad. \nThe bill we ultimately passed included $3 million for this important \npurpose. Yet more work both at home and abroad remains. When you \nconsider that the economic impact of tangible piracy in counterfeit \ngoods is estimated to be roughly $350 billion a year and to constitute \nbetween 5 percent and 7 percent of worldwide trade, a few million \ndollars is a worthwhile investment.\n  We have certainly seen how this form of theft touches the lives of \nhard-working Vermonters. Burton Snowboards is a small company, whose \ninnovation has made it an industry leader in snowboarding equipment and \napparel. Unfortunately, knock-off products carrying Burton's name have \nbeen found across the globe. Vanessa Price, a representative of Burton, \ntestified about counterfeiting at the Judiciary Committee's March 23, \n2004, hearing on this topic. In addition to learning about the economic \ncosts of counterfeiting, I asked her after the hearing about the risks \nposed to consumers by these goods. Her answer was chilling:\n\n       In the weeks since my Senate testimony, I discovered a \n     shipment of counterfeit Burton boots for sale through a \n     discount sports outfit . . . After examining the poor quality \n     of the counterfeit boots, we determined that anyone using the \n     boots for snowboarding risks injury due to a lack of \n     reinforcement and support in the product's construction.\n\n  Customers and businesses lose out to counterfeiters in other ways, \ntoo. SB Electronics in Barre, VT, has seen its capacitors reverse \nengineered and its customers lost to inferior copycat models. Vermont \nTubbs, a furniture manufacturer in Rutland, has seen its designs \ncopied, produced offshore with inferior craftsmanship and materials, \nand then reimported, so that the company is competing against cheaper \nversions of its own products. And Hubbardton Forge in Castleton, VT, \nhas seen its beautiful and original lamps counterfeited and then sold \nwithin the United States at prices--and quality--far below their own. \nThis is wrong. It is unfair to consumers who deserve the high quality \ngoods they think they are paying for, and it is unfair to innovators \nwho play by the rules and deserve to profit from their labor.\n  This bill helps to combat this growing scourge.\n  S. 1095 criminalizes the possession of counterfeit goods with the \nintent to sell or traffic in those goods, and it expands the definition \nof ``traffic'' to include any distribution of counterfeits with the \nexpectation of gaining something of value--criminals should not be able \nto skirt the law simply because they barter illegal goods and services \nin exchange for their illicit wares. Finally, the bill will criminalize \nthe importation and exportation of counterfeit goods, as well as of \nbootleg copies of copyrighted works into and out of the United States.\n  By tying off these loopholes and improving U.S. laws on \ncounterfeiting, we are sending a powerful message to the criminals who \nbelong in jail, and to our innovators.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Specter \nsubstitute at the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, \nand that any statements thereon be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2889) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1370]]\n\n (Purpose: To amend title 18, United States Code, to provide criminal \npenalties for trafficking in counterfeit marks, clarify the prohibition \n    on the trafficking in goods or services, and for other purposes)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of calendar No. 229, S. 1777.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n\n       A bill (S. 1777) to provide relief for the victims of \n     Hurricane Katrina.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEIBERMAN. Mr. President, I have been pleased to work with \nSenator Collins to draft and reach agreement on this legislation to \nprovide relief for the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  The package that the Senate is passing today does not contain \neverything that I would like, but I think the provisions of this bill \nwill make a real difference for the families and their communities.\n  The challenges facing our country in the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina are like nothing we have faced in modern times--if ever.\n  This legislation has four parts.\n  First, this measure will provides an additional 13 weeks of Federal \nDisaster Unemployment Assistance for those who lost their jobs because \nof Hurricane Katrina, thereby extending the duration of benefits from \nthe current 26 weeks to 39 weeks. More than 46,000 gulf coast workers \nwere left jobless as a result of Hurricane Katrina, and this \nlegislation is urgently needed, as these workers will run out of their \n26 weeks of Federal assistance starting March 4.\n  Those who qualify for Disaster Unemployment Assistance, or DUA, \ngenerally do not qualify for regular unemployment benefits. They mostly \ninclude the self-employed, like fisherman and small business owners, \nwho make up a vital sector of the economy in the gulf coast. Their \nweekly DUA assistance, which corresponds to the amounts provided in \nregular unemployment benefits in the States, is modest, at best. In \nLouisiana, for example, the weekly DUA benefit averages just $100 a \nweek.\n  The version of this legislation that I proposed on the Senate floor \non September 15, 2005, would have also increased the minimum DUA \nbenefit to $135 a week, or half the national average unemployment \nbenefit, and that was retained in our bill reported out of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs committee; the compromise amendment \nnow before the Senate leaves the benefit levels under current statute \nunchanged.\n  The fact that so many families remain unemployed almost 6 months \nafter the storm is a grave reminder that we as a Nation still have far \nto go to realize our promise of hope to the proud people of New Orleans \nand rest of the gulf coast who suffered the worst natural disaster this \nNation has ever known. Extending these limited benefits by 13 weeks, \njust as we did for the families left jobless after the events of \nSeptember 11, is the least we can do to allow these displaced families \nsome measure of security as they look for work while facing mounting \nexpenses and countless other challenges in rebuilding their lives and \ntheir communities.\n  In the current amendment, we added language in section 2(a)(2) \nclarifying what we understand to be the current law regulating the DUA \nprogram--that an individual is not eligible to collect DUA at any given \ntime if the individual is, at the same time, eligible to receive any \nother unemployment benefits available under Federal or State law. \nIndividuals whose regular unemployment benefits expire may then be \neligible to receive DUA if no other Federal or State jobless benefits \nare available. However, under no circumstances can they collect more \nthan the 39 weeks in total benefits. This provision is consistent with \ncurrent DUA law as applied by the U.S. Department of Labor. We are \nsimply extending the benefit period from 26 weeks under current law to \n39 weeks.\n  Two, the second provision in the bill would allow communities to be \nreimbursed for buying certain supplies in bulk--such as linens, cots, \nor toiletries--and giving them out to individual victims of either \nHurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita.\n  Third, the bill expresses the sense of Congress that international \nstudents should not be deported solely due to their inability to \nfulfill the terms of their visas as a result of a national disaster \nsuch as Katrina.\n  Fourth and finally, the legislation requires that the Secretary of \nHomeland Security must establish new inspection guidelines saying that \ninspectors who determine eligibility for FEMA assistance may not enter \ninto contracts with those for whom they perform inspections.\n  This bill does not make all of the changes to disaster assistance \nprograms that I would have liked. But that is the nature of compromise. \nIn my opinion, the Disaster Unemployment Assistance program, in \nparticular, needs further strengthening. I hope there may be an \nopportunity in the future to consider further improvements. But I am \nvery pleased that we have been able to make very meaningful \nimprovements that will help families weather this terrible storm.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nat the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time \nand passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2890) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Katrina Emergency Assistance \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

REIMBURSEMENT FOR PURCHASES.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Disaster period.--The term ``disaster period'' means, \n     with respect to any State that includes an area for which a \n     major disaster has been declared in accordance with section \n     401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170) as a result of Hurricane \n     Katrina or Hurricane Rita, the period beginning on the \n     earliest date on which any area of the State was so declared \n     and ending on the latest date for which any such declaration \n     of an area of the State terminates.\n       (2) Katrina or rita survivor.--The term ``Katrina or Rita \n     Survivor'' means an individual who--\n       (A) resides in an area for which a major disaster has been \n     declared in accordance with 401 of the Robert T. Stafford \n     Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170) \n     as a result of Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita; or\n       (B) resided in an area described in subparagraph (A) during \n     the 7 days immediately preceding the date of declaration of a \n     major disaster described in subparagraph (A).\n       (3) Major disaster.--The term ``major disaster'' has the \n     meaning given the term in section 102 of the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5122).\n       (b) Reimbursement.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the President may reimburse a community for each \n     purchase of supplies (such as food, personal hygiene \n     products, linens, and clothing) distributed to Katrina or \n     Rita Survivors.\n       (2) Eligible purchases.--Reimbursement under paragraph (1) \n     shall be available only with respect to supplies that--\n       (A) are purchased with taxpayer dollars; and\n       (B) would otherwise be eligible for reimbursement if \n     purchased by a Katrina or Rita Survivor.\n       (c) Period of Applicability.--This section and the \n     authority provided by this section apply only to a community \n     assisting Katrina or Rita Survivors from a State during the \n     disaster period of the State.\n\n     SEC. 4. INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS DISPLACED BY KATRINA.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Bureau of Immigration \n     and Customs Enforcement within the Department of Homeland \n     Security should suspend or refrain from initiating removal \n     proceedings for international students and scholars who are \n     deportable solely due to their inability to fulfill the\n\n[[Page S1372]]\n\n     terms of their visas as a result of a national disaster, such \n     as Hurricane Katrina.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Of course.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/15/senate-section/article/S1372-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1372-S1373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, tomorrow--to explain what we did--following \nmorning business, the Senate will resume debate on the motion to \nproceed to the PATRIOT Act amendments act. The cloture vote on that \nmotion to proceed will occur at 10:30 in the morning. Under the \nagreement, once cloture has been invoked on the motion to proceed, we \nwill proceed immediately to the bill, and a cloture vote on the bill \nitself will occur at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, February 28, with a vote on \nfinal passage at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, March 1.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. President, I will respond to some comments he made a few minutes \nago. First, about the asbestos bill, I think the record speaks for \nitself. A 393-page bill came to the floor of the Senate. It was a \nfairly complicated bill, which would have affected hundreds of \nthousands, maybe millions, of Americans over the next 50 years, and \ncreated a $140 billion trust fund. It involved payments of billions of \ndollars into that trust fund by American businesses from a list that \nwas never publicly disclosed. Then as the bill arrived on the floor, as \nwe expected, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee filed a \nsubstitute to the bill, wiping away the 393-page bill, replacing it \nwith a 392-page bill, and then we proceeded to debate.\n  One amendment was called by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn. \nObjection was made on the floor to Senator Cornyn's amendment, and a \nmotion to table and stop debate on his amendment was passed. At that \npoint, we went into a question about whether that bill would satisfy \nthe requirements of the Budget Act. Then, without another amendment \nbeing offered, the majority leader announced the Republican side was \ngoing to file a cloture motion to close down debate and amendments on \nthis bill.\n  To suggest that somehow we are inundating this body with amendments \nand debate is to overlook the obvious: One amendment was offered by a \nRepublican Senator from Texas, and as we were waiting for the budget \npoint of order, the majority leader suggested that we would close down \ndebate on the bill, and that was the end of the story.\n  So this argument that somehow we are dragging our feet here and \nsomehow miring down the process with amendments--the record speaks for \nitself. That was not the case on the asbestos bill. Last night, when \nthe budget point of order was called, it was sustained. That means, in \ncommon terms, that the bill was returned to committee because it was \nnot written properly.\n  It was not written in a way to comply with our Budget Act. So that is \nthe state of affairs on the asbestos bill.\n  Now comes the PATRIOT Act. If there is any suggestion in the majority \nleader's remarks that anything that has happened on the floor of the \nSenate yesterday or today in any way endangers America, I think the \nrecord speaks for itself. That is not a fact. The current PATRIOT Act, \nas written, continues to protect America until March 10. We could \ncontinue debating right here on the floor of the Senate up until March \n9 and even on March 10, and we would never have a gap in coverage of \nthe PATRIOT Act as a law. So there is no endangerment of America, no \nlessening of our defense against terrorism by the possibility that the \nSenate might stop, reflect, consider, and even debate the PATRIOT Act.\n  I am sorry that my colleague, Senator Feingold of Wisconsin, is not \nhere to speak for himself, but he has been an extraordinary leader on \nthis issue. He has taken a position which I think is nothing short of \npolitically bold, if not courageous, in standing up and saying, even in \nthe midst of terrorism, we need to take the time and debate the core \nvalues and issues involved in the PATRIOT Act.\n  What has Senator Feingold asked for? He has asked for an opportunity \nto offer perhaps four amendments, four amendments, and he has gone on \nto say that he doesn't want days or long periods of time to debate \nthem. He will agree to limited debate on each amendment. Nothing could \nbe more reasonable. What he said is the Senate needs to face reality. \nThis is an important bill. It involves our constitutional rights. And \nwhether I would agree or disagree with any of Senator Feingold's \namendments, I would fight, as long as I had the breath in my body and \nthe strength to stand, that he have the right to express his point of \nview and bring this matter to a vote in the Senate. That is not \nunreasonable, nor is Senator Feingold unreasonable in his position. And \nfor the suggestion to be made on the floor that somehow we have dragged \nthis out for a lengthy period of time overlooks the obvious.\n  The offer was made for two votes tomorrow on Senator Feingold's \namendment and then a cloture vote tomorrow on the bill and, if cloture \nwere invoked, pass the bill tomorrow. That offer was rejected by the \nRepublican majority. Why? Not because of fear of terrorism but fear of \ndebate. Not because of fear of threats to America but fear of threats \nthat some amendment may be adopted, somehow upsetting an apple cart. \nWell, that is unfortunate. But this Democratic process is an open \nprocess--at least I hope it is--and we should protect the rights of \nMembers on both sides of the aisle to offer amendments with reasonable \nperiods of debate. We should have actual debate on the floor and then \nmake a decision.\n  One of my favorite friends and colleagues from the House was a fellow \nnamed Congressman Mike Synar of Oklahoma. He passed away about 10 years \nago. I liked Mike so much. He was a close personal friend. He used to \nlament that so many of his colleagues in the House of Representatives \nwere loathe to even engage in a debate on a controversial issue. He \nwould listen to Members of the House of Representatives whining and \ncrying about having to face a vote on a controversial issue, and Mike \nSynar used to say: If you don't want to fight a fire, don't be a \nfireman. If you don't want to vote on tough issues, don't be a Member \nof the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  Well, the Mike Synar rule applies here. If you don't want to face the \nreality of the debate on critical constitutional and legal issues, I \ndon't know why one would run for the Senate.\n  What Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin has asked us to do is to \nconsider amendments to the PATRIOT Act. What is wrong with that? That \nis as basic as it gets. That is why we are here. And whether I would \nvote for or against those amendments, I would defend his right to offer \nthem, and I hope that the record will reflect what I have just said. He \nwas ready to stand, offer\n\n[[Page S1373]]\n\nthe amendments with limited debate, and then move this bill to a \ncloture vote tomorrow, which, if it were invoked, would see the passage \nof the bill as soon as tomorrow. That offer by Senator Feingold was \nrejected.\n  So to say that we are foot-dragging on this side of the aisle or that \nany Democratic Senator such as Senator Feingold is not trying to \ncooperate does not accurately state what we have been through to this \nmoment on the PATRIOT Act.\n  I will close by saying that despite partisan differences, there is \npartisan cooperation in this Chamber, and I wish to say as I close \nthese remarks that I want to salute Senator John Sununu on the \nRepublican side of the aisle; he has worked night and day over the last \nseveral months to come up with what I consider to be a reasonable way \nto end the current debate on the PATRIOT Act.\n  We stood together, we worked together, we brought the issue to the \nfloor. I don't think it is unreasonable to give Senator Feingold his \nmoment to offer amendments with limited debate, bring them to a vote, \nput the Senate on the record, and move forward. To suggest otherwise \ndoes not reflect an accurate presentation of the facts as they \noccurred.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I find my colleague's comments in response \nto my statement that the problem is that we are seeing this whole \npattern of obstruction and postponement--it is not just one bill, it is \nthis whole series of bills--I find his comments responsive to several \nof the things I said but not really responsive to this pattern. I \nreally just want to make that a comment and not get into a long debate \nabout it. But I do want to point out that pattern of the things that I \nmentioned, like the PATRIOT Act as my colleague pointed out, it is time \nto bring this to a close.\n  This thing is going to pass overwhelmingly, and that is exactly \nright. I rejected options to continue to amend this forever. The \nproblem, in part, that got us to this point is every time we come to an \nagreement which is a bill that, as written, will have overwhelming \nsupport in this body, somebody will come forward and say: One more \namendment, one more amendment, one more amendment.\n  It is exactly right. It is time to bring this to a close. This will \npass with overwhelming support--not today, as it should have, or \ntomorrow or Monday or Tuesday, but on Wednesday morning. It is going to \npass with overwhelming support.\n  My point is this whole delay, this postponement, is stopping the \nNation's business as we have to address other important issues--whether \nit is our budgetary issues, whether issues on health care or education \nor LIHEAP, flood insurance or lobbying reform. All these issues get put \noff another 4 or 5 days--yes, using the rights we have on this floor. I \nrespect that. But to no avail. It is hurting the American people, not \nhelping the American people.\n  Asbestos--this is a complicated bill. It is a bill many of us have \nbeen working on for 3 years. We started the bill, not Tuesday or Monday \nof this week and not Friday of last week or Thursday or Tuesday, but I \nthink it was Monday morning that we said: Let's talk about this bill, \nlet's debate this bill and have unlimited debate. As I pointed out, \nthey said: No, we are not going to go to the bill. We are not going to \ngo to a bill which is an important bill which has to be addressed.\n  We have 700,000 individuals who have filed claims for their \nillnesses, and 300,000 of those claims are still pending in the courts. \nTragically, as I mentioned earlier, some of the most ill among those \nare among the worst served because of the delay in having the cases \nconsidered, and then, once considered, even if they get compensation \nfor every dollar that is spent, 60 cents goes to the system and the \ntrial lawyers and only 40 cents goes to the patient.\n  Yet, because of this mentality of Democrats, obstructing--they say \nyou are not going to go to the bill. You are going to have to file a \nmotion to proceed and cloture on that motion to proceed to the bill, \nwhich is a waste of 2 days. Then the vote was either 98 to 2 or 98 to \n1. So once we got to the vote, they said: We will be with you, let's go \nahead and consider it. And then to hear my colleagues say: We didn't \nhave an opportunity to debate, when it was a request from your side of \nthe aisle that we take a whole day, that we not have amendments but \njust to talk about it again--I am not sure why--but then to complain \nthat we did not have time to offer amendments when it came to that \nfirst day--I think it was Wednesday; no amendments today--it is a \nlittle bit disingenuous, especially as it fits this larger pattern I \nlaid out of the tax relief bill just to get to conference requiring \nthree separate considerations on this floor, 17 rollcall votes for the \nfirst 20-hour limitation, the second 20-hour limitation requiring seven \nmore rollcall votes, motions to instruct here all yesterday morning, \nnonbinding motions.\n  The pensions bill, I still do not fully understand why there is delay \nin getting the pensions bill to conference, when the first request was \nmade in December and the second one earlier this year, and then now, on \nan important bill, when people are out there saying we have to address \nthe pension bill--it passed the Senate, passed the House of \nRepresentatives--we have to get it to conference so we can come up with \na final product for the President to sign.\n  Instead of arguing each of these individual bills, I just wanted to \nmake the point that it is a pattern that we cannot continue. We have to \nwork together in the Nation's interest, in the interests of the \nAmerican people. Unless things are changed, we are not going to be \ndelivering what we are responsible to do.\n  Anyway, that is a little bit out of my frustration with the other \nside of the aisle in terms of the way they have conducted business, and \nI believe we can work together in a civil way to address these \nimportant issues in the coming days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/15/senate-section/article/S1373-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
